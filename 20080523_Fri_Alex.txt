[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:07.360 --> 00:15.400]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.400 --> 00:29.280]  Well, my friends, we have quite a radio show lined up for you today. Quite a broadcast
[00:29.280 --> 00:38.360]  on this Friday edition, 23rd day of May, 2008. Bob Chapman, the international forecaster
[00:38.360 --> 00:45.680]  on all of the accelerating loss and the value of the dollar, exploding oil prices well above,
[00:45.680 --> 00:53.640]  well above $130 a barrel. And we got Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan,
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.280]  gave him his daily briefings also. George Bush Sr., he'll be joining us to talk about
[00:58.280 --> 01:06.480]  the police state, the venomous propaganda against Iran, the war drums, Israel saying
[01:06.480 --> 01:12.420]  the U.S. will be attacking by the end of this year before Bush leaves office. That means
[01:12.420 --> 01:19.960]  just in the next seven months or so. So it's all coming up today. And then Jack McClam,
[01:19.960 --> 01:24.120]  I know he's been on him twice the last couple of months, but he's on today because people
[01:24.120 --> 01:30.500]  always wondered who it was who snuck in two years ago and got new footage of Bohemian
[01:30.500 --> 01:37.200]  Grove. And it was Jack McClam's volunteer webmaster, who for many years had been the
[01:37.200 --> 01:44.560]  webmaster for his aide-in-a-bet, police and military against the New World War website.
[01:44.560 --> 01:51.000]  And his name is Chris Jones. We always called him Kyle, protected his name. He worked in
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.880]  the Grove one year, and then he tried to get hired back again. They started harassing
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.200]  him and threatening him. The police came to his house in Southern California, arrested
[02:01.200 --> 02:07.280]  him, set him up, and I have the court transcripts. I have all, I have what they charged him with.
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.720]  It's unbelievable. He went to jail. He was convicted. He thought, oh, this is a free
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.760]  country. I'll go to jail. He showed some neighbor teenagers. He gave him a copy of Dark
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.240]  Secrets inside Bohemian Grove and said, that's a mock human sacrifice. And the state of California
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.760]  said, yeah, he, they said he showed him a video and claimed it was a snuff film. He
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.200]  didn't. He said, this is a film of a mock sacrifice. He gave him a copy of my film.
[02:33.200 --> 02:42.720]  They arrested him for that and said that it was a form of a pedophilia and he was going,
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.000]  he's gone to prison. We didn't want to embarrass the guy or talk about it or cover it until
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.400]  this, I mean, it's dangerous to expose these people. I mean, people sit there and make
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.280]  up lies and say, they let him into the Grove. They let him go in there and cover it. And
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.640]  I've said on air, you know, I snuck in. They questioned me. I mean, I guess in some weird
[03:00.640 --> 03:05.920]  twist of fate, they might have, you know, without me knowing, let me film it and get
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.880]  it out. But they were hopping mad. I got death threats when I got out with it. I got all
[03:09.880 --> 03:16.720]  sorts of threats that were very upset. Others said the video wasn't real. Didn't matter
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.840]  of the Grove told, uh, world of wonder that made the production that aired in the British
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.460]  TV, Japanese German, and then the U S aired more than 40, 50 times last time I checked.
[03:27.460 --> 03:31.160]  They said, you know, the film, no, he snuck in. He did videotape this. It is real, but
[03:31.160 --> 03:34.800]  his interpretation is different than ours. You know, I went to a lot of risks to do that
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.120]  and people just say, no, it's not either. It's not real. Like Carl Wigglesworth and San
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.640]  Antonio on KTSA always says, and others nationally have said it. New York Times said I made it
[03:45.640 --> 03:50.480]  up and claimed it. That was in 2001 though. They said, Bilderberg didn't exist either.
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.480]  Of course they attended sometimes. Uh, but, uh, Chris, I said, Chris, don't go in there.
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.320]  Jack McClam called me and he said, I've got a guy that does my website and, and, and you
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.560]  know, I don't have time to manage this, but do you want to have him sneak in? He says
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.040]  he's going to go get a job there and do it. And I said, um, let me talk to him. And I
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.280]  said, sir, this is very dangerous. I said, you certainly don't want to tell anybody who
[04:14.280 --> 04:18.320]  you are, or you want to be very public. You need to either be a talk show host and high
[04:18.320 --> 04:24.120]  profile or be secretive. And I said, stop telling people. I said, stop, you know, telling
[04:24.120 --> 04:29.320]  people at parties, stopped, you know, I said, these are dangerous people. And he gave neighbor
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.960]  teenagers, I think it was 14 year old, a copy of the, of the film and the police came in
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.280]  and arrested him. And it was, he's gone to prison for a copy. It's just like Kelly rushing
[04:39.280 --> 04:44.800]  was arrested for a Ron Paul video. Uh, in a 40 minute speech he gave before the house
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.240]  representatives and the police. I mean, it was in the newspaper. They said Ron Paul's
[04:49.240 --> 04:57.040]  illegal. I mean, this country is far gone. Folks, we'll be right back. It is a big idea.
[04:57.040 --> 05:05.480]  A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful government is known
[05:05.480 --> 05:10.840]  as the builder bird. Put their objective the world domination or thousands of years, their
[05:10.840 --> 05:16.720]  dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream
[05:16.720 --> 05:25.120]  of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.080]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[05:30.080 --> 05:35.000]  entire new world order agenda. Builders is making great progress for the world. Most
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.120]  people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're

[08:02.200 --> 08:12.760]  This is Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.760 --> 08:18.440]  Bob Chapman in one hour, Ray McGovern in the third hour, fourth hour, Jack McClam for this
[08:18.440 --> 08:25.480]  webmaster being imprisoned, convicted. I've read the court record. I read the charges.
[08:25.480 --> 08:32.360]  This is like a year ago when it first happened. I was just talking about it. To Chris Jones,
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.280]  who snuck into Behemoth, he worked there for a summer is what happened. He infiltrated
[08:37.280 --> 08:41.920]  by getting a job there. That's why other people are getting jobs there and laughing and, oh,
[08:41.920 --> 08:47.520]  it's fun. It's so easy. They have arrested people. They have charged them with trespassing.
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.360]  People have gotten fired from their jobs. People have mysteriously died that have snuck
[08:51.360 --> 08:58.520]  in there. This is not a joke. This is not a game. That's why it's so irritating to
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.600]  me when people say, oh, you didn't really sneak into Bohemian Grove. Oh, really, there's
[09:03.600 --> 09:09.640]  just footage of us sneaking in. Regardless, we got video of it and that's what they do.
[09:09.640 --> 09:15.000]  That's the mock human sacrifice ritual they do. It takes from several different Babylon
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.800]  mystery religion, Canaanite type ceremonies. The occult's always an amalgamation and regardless
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.800]  set of obsessing on me and why don't you obsess on the footage and what your so-called Christian
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.480]  conservative leaders are doing. Now they have a lot of homosexual sex in there. They ship
[09:33.480 --> 09:39.480]  in male prostitutes. That's been admitted all over the mainstream news. Chris Jones,
[09:39.480 --> 09:45.520]  of course, no criminal record, upstanding, nice fella, webmaster for Jack McClam for
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.840]  years, wanted to sneak in and Jack called me about three years ago before he snuck
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.240]  in in 2005 and said, what do you think about this? Think, you've been in there. Can you
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.240]  advise Chris? So I called Chris up. I said, hey man, this isn't a joke. He's like, oh,
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.400]  but it'll be fun. I want to go and get better footage than you got. I said, he did get some
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.480]  great footage. It's in order of death, the 45 minute film I made. And then when you get
[10:11.480 --> 10:16.800]  the DVD, you get the whole re-updated, you know, added to dark secrets inside Bohemian
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.120]  Grove an hour and 40 minutes long with the 45 minute or 46 minute long order of death
[10:22.120 --> 10:32.440]  46 minutes to be precise. And you know, it covers the new information. And within months
[10:32.440 --> 10:43.160]  of him sneaking in there and then within months of the film coming out, I guess what in 2006,
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.880]  he was handing out to all his neighbors as we recommend copies of, I'm trying to get
[10:49.880 --> 10:52.960]  all this straight in my head because I just talked to Jack about this yesterday and I'm
[10:52.960 --> 11:01.200]  trying to remember all the things that happened. So much happened. And he, he handed out to
[11:01.200 --> 11:06.440]  all his neighbors copies of the original VHS tape. And then I guess it was in 2006 when
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.880]  order of death came out, he made copies of that and he handed that out. And so that somehow
[11:11.880 --> 11:19.000]  tied him into it. And then when he gave it all to the neighbors, adult neighbors, teenage
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.160]  neighbors, the teenage neighbors came over and said, we want more. They said, you really
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.680]  snuck in there. And they said, yeah. And so the neighbors all kind of turned into like
[11:26.680 --> 11:35.880]  a witch hunt where it's my gosh, he was in there. He's part of it. He killed a baby.
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.080]  So the police come and Chris was real nice and talked to him and let him in and said,
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.640]  no, no, it's Alex Jones. And here he is online. I, I worked there for a summer. I got him
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.600]  some footage. It's in this film. You know, here's this film. It's aired on national television.
[11:49.600 --> 11:53.040]  And the cops said, all right, when they came in and talked to him, then in months and months
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.880]  later, they came and arrested him. And then it took about a year for it to go to trial
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.120]  and it went to trial. And then he was trying to appeal and he couldn't believe it. And
[12:00.120 --> 12:09.880]  now he's gone to prison. And they said that basically, well, he was convicted of showing
[12:09.880 --> 12:16.840]  children a snuff film, showing minors a snuff film in an attempt to have sex with them.
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.480]  But then they admit in the trial, well, he never did anything with them and never said
[12:20.480 --> 12:29.480]  anything with them. But the film talks about ritualistic murder of children and homosexual
[12:29.480 --> 12:37.240]  prostitutes being brought in. So that's improper to give youth. And so he's gone to prison
[12:37.240 --> 12:46.120]  for that. I mean, this is amazing. Don't forget it was in the newspaper in the lion county
[12:46.120 --> 12:53.880]  news. I remember Kelly rushing in 2004 called me and said, I've been arrested. I pulled
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.120]  out of my house and the state trooper pulled me over. I'd given him a week before a copy
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.480]  of it was a Ron Paul 40 something minutes speech, the famous neocon speech that he just
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.080]  given in 2003. And then after it rode to tyranny and I gave it to him and said, please watch
[13:08.080 --> 13:12.240]  this. And he pulled me over a week later and said, Oh, and he put him in handcuffs and
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.920]  called his wife on the cell phone and said, the state trooper did said, I've got the VHS
[13:16.920 --> 13:25.520]  bandit. And he said, man, I just, you know, he's like, why'd you give me that? That's
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.160]  anti law enforcement. That's insulting. That's threatening to me. And he said, sir, I just
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.640]  care about you. I mean, don't you care about your family? This country's in deep trouble.
[13:34.640 --> 13:37.760]  And they said, that's another charge. That's a threat to my family. And they did charge
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.240]  him with that. So we had three charges of terroristic threats for the two videos, you
[13:42.240 --> 13:45.280]  know, the two films on the one tape, each one was a threat and then the third one, but
[13:45.280 --> 13:50.200]  they dropped the one as it went to trial for saying, don't you care about your children,
[13:50.200 --> 13:57.000]  your family? I'm doing this for your family. And they took him to jail. And I mean, the
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.680]  guys sounded credible. But even in 2004, I hadn't fully woken up yet. I mean, I get
[14:02.680 --> 14:07.320]  more quote radical and hardcore every day because I find out and then shocked and amazed
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.960]  by the things I see on YouTube videos from police, their own squad cars, the things I
[14:11.960 --> 14:19.560]  personally experience. It just, it's hard to believe for me and I've seen it. So I looked
[14:19.560 --> 14:25.360]  up rushing online and I made calls and I got like four or five numbers randomly on Kelly
[14:25.360 --> 14:32.360]  rushing for rushings in, in, in Lyon County, Kentucky. They're well known, uh, actually
[14:32.360 --> 14:37.520]  middle class, some of them wealthy, you know, founding family there in that county. And
[14:37.520 --> 14:39.960]  I'd call up and I'd call rushings and they go, yeah, it's our cousin, great guy in the
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.000]  church, a deacon, blah, blah, blah, family guy, you know, owns a business in town. Yeah,
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.040]  we heard about him being arrested. It's really weird. So I randomly called other numbers.
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.400]  I mean, I'm called like six, seven of them because I was being, I was amazed and they
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.400]  say, yeah, we know the Russians. Yeah, we heard about Kelly small town. That's really
[14:55.400 --> 15:01.200]  weird. He's a gentle giant. Uh, that's very strange. Yeah, we heard about it. So I had
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.440]  the newspaper article, somebody mail it to me like a week later. I don't remember. I
[15:06.440 --> 15:09.560]  get the newspaper article. I read it on air five, six times. Those audio clips are on
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.560]  the web. So I make a YouTube video with them and I, and so I'm driving one day. I've written
[15:14.560 --> 15:17.720]  down, I've called and got the judge's number, but I'm kind of scared to call a judge because
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.560]  they'll set you up a lot of them and show you threatened to kill them. Uh, if, uh, you
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.640]  know, if they don't like how you talk to them, I don't want to be SWAT team here, but I just
[15:26.640 --> 15:32.800]  couldn't help it. I was in a home depot parking lot and, uh, I, I called the cell phone, the
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.800]  judge Andrew, they go, is this judge blah, blah, that's even the paper. And he said,
[15:36.800 --> 15:44.000]  yeah, and I said, you're trying Kelly rushing for, uh, giving someone a videotape. And he
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.200]  said, yes, we are, but I'm not going to comment on the case. He's been indicted. And I said,
[15:48.200 --> 15:51.200]  yeah, I've got the news article. And he said, well, that ought to tell you everything. Cause
[15:51.200 --> 15:55.680]  the judge was quoted in there and it went to court and they came in and then said this
[15:55.680 --> 16:03.440]  video of this, uh, congressman, they, he was a charge, a charge in America. Now for Chris
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.200]  Jones, he kept laughing about it, thinking he'd go to trial and to be laughed out, not
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.160]  in, uh, San Diego. I think it's San Diego. We got Jack McClam, come on. I haven't talked
[16:13.160 --> 16:16.520]  to Chris in months. He's been in jail for months and at the time he didn't want to go
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.360]  on air with it. He keeps thinking that justice will come and they'll let him go. They don't
[16:20.360 --> 16:27.360]  do that folks. And, uh, so I guess if we've got permission, I'll get Jack McClam. I know
[16:27.360 --> 16:30.640]  he's got a lot of the documents and court records. I've got them around here somewhere
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.640]  from a year ago. Uh, we'll get them up on the web and do an article about it and just
[16:35.640 --> 16:42.960]  post them for you to read. And it just says he gave them a video and see the public is
[16:42.960 --> 16:48.520]  so dumb folks. They don't know who the vice president is, how many continents there are.
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.640]  I mean, you know the drill. They don't know the anything you can give them the scientific
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.200]  name for water and they'll say ban it. And so most of them are cops, you know, brothers
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.440]  or sisters or judges, brothers or sisters or government people and they just tell them
[17:01.440 --> 17:09.480]  convict and it was, uh, they just said he gave minors, uh, this film. Truth is he gave
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.560]  it to the neighbors and then the teenagers came over and wanted more and he talked to
[17:13.560 --> 17:17.400]  them and said, yeah, it's real. Kind of like I'm a celebrity. I, you know, he was, I snuck
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.960]  in. Yeah, it's me. And they were like, it was a witch hunt. I'm surprised. They didn't
[17:21.960 --> 17:25.440]  take him out in the street and put a thousand pound weight on his chest and crush him or
[17:25.440 --> 17:33.240]  bar him at the stake. And this still goes on. They still have this stuff going on.
[17:33.240 --> 17:39.360]  But, uh, Jones even said later that, you know, the police were basically told him. They
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.320]  said, well, you know, we basically had orders to come down on you boy because Chris told
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.600]  me that the police had heard about it in the neighborhood. And then like I said, came out
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.480]  and investigated and a long time later came after him, but I've already digressed. We'll
[17:53.480 --> 18:02.520]  talk about that with a Jack McClam in the fourth hour today. Just so amazing. Okay.
[18:02.520 --> 18:05.800]  I just spent 15 minutes on that. I shouldn't have because I've got all this news and it's
[18:05.800 --> 18:13.560]  all amazing. Look at this veterans group band from Memorial Day parade. It's in the top
[18:13.560 --> 18:19.440]  10 largest veterans group in the country. Veterans for peace. This is from AP veterans
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.480]  group that opposes the March. I mean, the war in Iraq has been blocked from marching
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.040]  Memorial Day parade in Washington for being told its plans, which once included a cast
[18:28.040 --> 18:33.560]  representing war dead would be too political for the event. Yeah, the war is a political.
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.320]  So they've been a band from that. So, see, first they say you got to have a permit on
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.080]  a gun. Then they just deny the permit. Then you got to have a permit to have a march and
[18:41.080 --> 18:47.360]  then they deny the permit. That's how tyranny works. Um, Bilderberg luminary to select Obama's
[18:47.360 --> 18:55.240]  running made Fannie Mae CEO James A. Johnson was behind 2004 Edwards pick for Bilderberg
[18:55.240 --> 19:02.040]  signaled approval. We got to start organizing masses of people. I would just say media because
[19:02.040 --> 19:05.840]  they'll the Virginia police will try to claim you don't have any right to demonstrate here
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.280]  in this third world police state. Uh, you got very strong protections there. Uh, but
[19:11.280 --> 19:15.640]  you haven't even stronger as the press to cover the elite meeting. And you watch in
[19:15.640 --> 19:21.120]  the U S I bet money. They're going to say they're going to try to just get out of here.
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.920]  Uh, I have authority. Just get out. Just don't stand on the sidewalk in America. Covering
[19:25.920 --> 19:32.360]  125 world leaders. That's bizarre. I want to know what they're doing. That's weird. I
[19:32.360 --> 19:37.120]  saw some video of a Marine. These cops want to randomly search his house basically. And
[19:37.120 --> 19:41.800]  he's saying no. And, uh, he goes, you know, you get the feds of training to violate our
[19:41.800 --> 19:47.080]  rights. And the cop goes, Oh, yeah, the KGB too. It starts laughing like the feds haven't
[19:47.080 --> 19:52.040]  federalized police like all the warrantless checkpoints sucking blood from you all over
[19:52.040 --> 19:57.040]  the country under federal grants. That's not federal. Do you know the truth about cancer
[19:57.040 --> 20:03.000]  treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking
[20:03.000 --> 20:08.640]  the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment? Do you realize that
[20:08.640 --> 20:15.600]  mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[20:15.600 --> 20:22.400]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace med inks, patented methodology without cutting,

[21:54.400 --> 21:58.000]  Hello Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.520]  and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes
[22:02.520 --> 22:06.880]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.160]  can remove from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[22:11.160 --> 22:15.400]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.760]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed
[22:19.760 --> 22:24.340]  by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central
[22:24.340 --> 22:28.800]  banks to increase liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.240]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and
[22:33.240 --> 22:38.400]  stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[22:38.400 --> 22:43.480]  into gold and silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on
[22:43.480 --> 22:50.380]  its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[22:50.380 --> 22:57.120]  That's 1-800-686-2237. Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste
[22:57.120 --> 23:01.480]  in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic
[23:01.480 --> 23:05.760]  waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high
[23:05.760 --> 23:10.560]  stress lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually
[23:10.560 --> 23:15.840]  disease. The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[23:15.840 --> 23:20.680]  water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter

[23:37.040 --> 23:42.080]  body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water. Let SnyderHealth.com provide

[25:06.320 --> 25:10.840]  help set up Homeland Security as well as Marcus Wolf, former head of the East German Stasi.
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.280]  You can't make this stuff up. But there they were saying there's nothing federal. Our police
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.440]  are completely federalized. A lot of them even have now been given federal, you know,
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.200]  hazard pay. When they're out running checkpoints, searching your car, when they're out CPSing
[25:24.200 --> 25:30.320]  your kids, it's all federal folks. Denton County, this is up by Dallas. No refusal weekend
[25:30.320 --> 25:33.800]  targeting drunk drivers. He told you about this a few weeks ago. All over the country
[25:33.800 --> 25:43.240]  started in Arizona a decade ago or so. And they just pull you over in the dark and they
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.880]  admitted that it was in Maricopa County. They stopped. I was reading some numbers yesterday.
[25:48.880 --> 25:56.360]  44,000 people and less than 1% that were actually drinking. Didn't matter though. A lot of people
[25:56.360 --> 25:59.560]  said, no, I have rights. I'm not doing a breathalyzer. Why are you stopping me? You'll
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.240]  have one time they shut I-35 down. The one time I caught him in Austin heard of them
[26:04.240 --> 26:09.920]  other times. The whole highway was backed up for like 20 miles. Just insane. I mean,
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.160]  this was incredible. It was backed up through the city all the way to Georgetown from South
[26:15.160 --> 26:20.200]  Austin and Kyle all the way to Georgetown. But I digress. It's just nuts. And that was
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.240]  a federal grant, but there we walked up and said, this federal grant's wrong. And the
[26:24.240 --> 26:30.080]  cops went, oh yeah, and I'm working with Serb troops. That's in police state 2000. It's
[26:30.080 --> 26:35.360]  always a joke. They could be burning children at the stake and they'd say, what do we do
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.760]  with burning children at the stake? I mean, it's always a denial.
[26:40.760 --> 26:47.080]  And all over the country, federal training, federal funding to do these. And now the cops
[26:47.080 --> 26:53.760]  in Illinois and Indiana and in Ohio and in areas of Texas, they are going to jam a needle
[26:53.760 --> 26:58.360]  in your arm. I mean, I've had nurses mess up, you know, and I got to give blood over
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.480]  the years. Probably only happened 10 times in my life given blood and half the time they're
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.920]  sitting there because I started to find my veins for some reason. I got thick skinned.
[27:06.920 --> 27:12.000]  But the point is, is they'll tase you. They'll beat you. They'll do it. Now, now in Denton,
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.520]  it says they're going to have judges waiting at the jail and that they're going to sign
[27:15.520 --> 27:21.920]  out a warrant. And so that actually is quasi constitutional, but them taking you to jail
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.560]  was not on probable cause because these checkpoints, there was no reasonable suspicion. There was
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.760]  no way to kick in. It's totally unconstitutional. I mean, we didn't do it before. It's something
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.000]  out of a nightmare science fiction movie. And this is all part of you, the public being
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.040]  trained to be violated, the police being trained to violate you. And I'm sorry, I am down to
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.120]  probably drinking a beer once a month now. And I'm even going to quit that. And yeah,
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.360]  I'll be out with friends. Okay, I'll have a beer or no, because I refuse. And let me
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.720]  tell you, you pull me over and you want to stick a needle in me. It just didn't going
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.840]  to happen, buddy boy. I mean, I've just been pushed and I just can't be pushed anymore.
[27:59.840 --> 28:07.960]  I mean, what's next? Well, forcible inoculations. They've been trained for that. They admit
[28:07.960 --> 28:15.320]  that, but they can't get the cops. They ordered 14 million first responders in 2002 under
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.080]  no law. It was just our insurances. We have to have it. The feds say we have to have it.
[28:20.080 --> 28:30.560]  Police, firemen, emergency workers, nurses, doctors, hospital staff and less than 1% agreed
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.000]  to take it. So they're going to force on us what they're smart enough to not do. Just
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.440]  Oh, it's sick. If you got caught drinking and driving this Memorial Day weekend, police
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.480]  will make you an offer that you can't refuse. See Don Carleone language. That's what it
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.840]  is. Mafia law enforcement agencies across Denton County will participate in the first
[28:50.840 --> 28:57.840]  DWI. No refusal weekend. Intoxicated drivers and boaters. See, see, see how the psychology
[28:57.840 --> 29:02.720]  here is. It's guilty until proven innocent. Intoxicated drivers and boaters who refused
[29:02.720 --> 29:09.040]  the breathalyzer test. Well, how do you know they're intoxicated? We'll be taken to jail
[29:09.040 --> 29:14.320]  to give court ordered blood samples. I know so many people that have had strokes or or
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.160]  who have speech impediments to the cops take to jail and they do take blood and there's
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.200]  nothing sponsored by the Denton County District Attorney's Office's program is designed to
[29:23.200 --> 29:27.440]  ensure the evidence in the form of a sample of the suspect's breath or blood is obtained
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.000]  in order to determine the alcohol concentration in the in the suspect system. Wait a minute.
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.840]  I thought it said up here that it's intoxicated drivers, but down here it says suspects guilty
[29:39.840 --> 29:48.800]  until proven slave and you are a slave. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex
[29:48.800 --> 30:00.920]  Jones and the GCN radio network. It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future.

[30:13.760 --> 30:20.000]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[33:10.560 --> 33:22.160]  Denton counties no refusal weekend targets drunk drivers.
[33:27.520 --> 33:32.800]  Now all over the country the police take the blood. It says in Denton they at least think
[33:32.800 --> 33:38.160]  there's some semblance somewhere of a Fourth Amendment. These are random checkpoints
[33:38.160 --> 33:45.600]  and they have these saturation patrols which I got pulled over by about a month ago and I saw him
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.320]  I noticed there were police cars just pulling cars over there police everywhere coming out of
[33:50.320 --> 33:53.680]  downtown over congress street bridge I was at a meeting it was about nine o'clock at night
[33:54.400 --> 33:58.800]  and I'm going 30 over the bridge I remember looking at my speedometer there were cops everywhere I
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.040]  just pulled out of a restaurant and he pulls me over he looks in the car with this thing I give
[34:03.040 --> 34:09.200]  him all my slave papers and I was just like man you guys are everywhere I go this is part of a
[34:09.200 --> 34:15.200]  saturation patrol and it was so shocking to him and a slave you know basically knew what was going
[34:15.200 --> 34:20.560]  on and he was like well you were going you know too fast but I'm just giving you a ticket for
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.880]  your insurance being out of date instead of speeding and I'm like yeah I'm speeding buddy boy I bet I

[34:52.160 --> 34:56.960]  weekend to remember our veterans and how are we going to do it goons out checking our papers but
[34:56.960 --> 35:02.080]  if you're an illegal alien and drunk they've been told let them go because the judge just lets them go
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.480]  I mean I told the story a hundred times but one night I'm coming to work at about 10 o'clock
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.360]  and they they told him they thought he was suspicious because he pulled off when they were behind him
[35:13.120 --> 35:16.800]  they've already got a lot of some of the cop cars in Austin they've got them all over the country
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.400]  have the license plate reading cameras but these cars didn't have them where they're illegally
[35:22.400 --> 35:29.120]  running everybody's plates without any fourth amendment without any uh
[35:29.120 --> 35:35.440]  reasonable suspicions some some reason you're weaving tail light out burnout license plate
[35:35.440 --> 35:43.360]  light I mean all those sorry excuses of a cop on quota or a cop who's mad at his wife who you
[35:43.360 --> 35:47.280]  know just hung up the phone he's going to show somebody you know it's very rudimentary level
[35:47.280 --> 35:52.960]  psychology and I'm tired of being fed on I mean I'm sick of it the government it's evil you
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.360]  individually may not be evil and corrupt but the system you work for is it's bankrupt I have no
[35:57.360 --> 36:09.040]  respect for it you know and I'm also so clean ladies and gentlemen I'm such a square goody
[36:09.040 --> 36:17.120]  two shoes that it just disgusts me I want to be left alone by you but but one of my uh it's a
[36:17.120 --> 36:24.160]  contractor who works here is pulled in my IT guy and then he's got an expired license and they're
[36:24.160 --> 36:30.240]  putting him in handcuffs and I told the story and they I started talking to him and they go yeah
[36:30.240 --> 36:33.680]  yeah we're not really supposed to rush illegals because the judge just lets them go
[36:33.680 --> 36:39.440]  it's discouraged and yeah we we would let him go if he was an illegal alien yep and I go yeah
[36:39.440 --> 36:42.960]  I've seen in the news where sheriffs complain they arrest illegals and ICE won't come get them
[36:42.960 --> 36:49.680]  yeah that's true sure is hey I like your show but you're still arresting him I mean why it's
[36:49.680 --> 36:56.000]  well that's what we're told to do I mean that that was even worse that the guy was telling me
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.320]  about I remember your show 10 years ago remember the show about that remember one time in a chevron
[37:00.320 --> 37:07.680]  you saw me there's two other cops there one I'm going yeah I like the show too the woman cop
[37:07.680 --> 37:10.720]  was looking at me with total hatred though she drove off with him she's the one that bagged him
[37:11.520 --> 37:12.160]  one that did it
[37:15.840 --> 37:23.120]  I bet money her mom's an illegal alien but the point is is that uh it was a victory a victory over
[37:23.120 --> 37:32.880]  freedom a victory over liberty a victim a victory over justice I mean the injustice of well we arrest
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.240]  you now for no turn signal we're told to arrest you now for an expired driver's license we're told
[37:38.240 --> 37:45.200]  to arrest you for no sheet belt see how that see how that's working and if you smart off we're
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.480]  going to beat you up and then you're going to get an assaulting an officer charge and we got monkey
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.600]  juries that'll watch a squad car video of us tasering you and they'll send you to jail for
[37:55.600 --> 38:02.720]  resisting how's that sound because we got a monkey public that likes being slaves and likes being
[38:02.720 --> 38:07.360]  tattletales and likes being petted by us we got grandmothers and mothers and fathers that turn
[38:07.360 --> 38:14.080]  their children in people that turn their parents in for petty crimes for money it's easy for us to
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.720]  rule you and dominate you because you're so weak and evil I mean cops don't think I dislike you
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.160]  you at least your predators at least you know what you're doing some of you at least you enjoy
[38:24.160 --> 38:30.960]  the power and at least you are what you are it's the lukewarm weak public who who who are so dumb
[38:30.960 --> 38:42.320]  down and so stupid we hope through this coordinated effort of all agencies and some of our judges
[38:42.320 --> 38:47.920]  this will be a save them early weekend said jamie beck first assistant criminal district attorney
[38:49.760 --> 38:53.920]  this should send a message that everyone should think twice before drinking and driving or drinking
[38:53.920 --> 39:00.080]  and boating yeah it's now come out with all the witnesses signing out the davids cops pull up see
[39:00.080 --> 39:08.400]  a rich football player at anchor lala to drink and they drug him over and beat him up and then poured
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.880]  water in his face and choked him and another victory they showed everybody that they're the boss
[39:14.240 --> 39:15.040]  cedric benson
[39:17.840 --> 39:24.000]  no refusal policies policies totally not a law you scum have become increasingly common in
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.680]  north texas oh yeah absolute villainy up there most of the sheriffs i mean everyone i knew about
[39:29.680 --> 39:35.440]  it was a narcotics trafficker no refusal policies have become increasingly common in north texas
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.320]  cities and i mean it's boss hog everywhere up there no refusal policies have become increasingly
[39:42.320 --> 39:46.800]  common in north texas cities and in some counties across the state the programs have not only been
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.240]  successful in proving the rates of convictions for dw i drivers and boaters but have also served as
[39:52.240 --> 40:00.240]  an effective deterrent according to law enforcement officials and i say uh you know don't go out at
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.600]  night and that's kind of what they want is the culture where we don't go out we just watch our
[40:03.600 --> 40:09.040]  tv's but just pray to god meditate think about your family think about you know how you're
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.600]  going to go to city council and speak out against this the next week uh think about
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.520]  how you're going to wake other people up burn copies of my films other films this weekend
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.080]  clean your firearms take them to the shooting range prepare yourself
[40:24.080 --> 40:32.880]  and then they keep calling themselves officials in this disgusting article
[40:32.880 --> 40:39.120]  officials oh oh they're the the officials oh my gosh
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.160]  man you go to these medium-sized towns and even big cities and they just worship the judges and
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.920]  cops and bailiffs and they all just nitty around all soft and weak and it's all just
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.880]  there's lots of little weird ticks and things they do it's indescribable you've got to see them
[40:56.880 --> 41:05.200]  it's a certain type it's called filth it's called parasite scum those that want to run other people's
[41:05.200 --> 41:08.880]  lives i mean i can hardly run my own life and i'd be embarrassed around other people's lives
[41:08.880 --> 41:13.200]  i'd be embarrassed to try to dominate people i had authority over not them
[41:16.240 --> 41:18.640]  so now they're coming with needles to jam them in your arms
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.040]  forcibly if you don't like it they'll tager you till you die of course taser it doesn't kill you
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.040]  though you just die gotta learn the double thing i'm gonna just run through some news here bill
[41:29.040 --> 41:36.640]  de burg luminary to select obama's running mate fanny may ceo james a johnson was also about
[41:36.640 --> 41:44.640]  2004 edwards pick for bill de burg u.s home prices fall another one percent in the last month
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.680]  to all-time record low opec oil market is going crazy
[41:51.680 --> 41:58.560]  oil well above 135 dollars a barrel and rising right towards 200 like we told you two years ago
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.440]  it would because bill de burg runs things and we go and cover them we we go and risk our lives
[42:04.640 --> 42:11.360]  to cover them for you think oil prices hurt now just wait
[42:11.360 --> 42:16.560]  wait again reuters is saying with gas at four dollars a gallon on average a barrel
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.280]  you need to get rid uh you need to get ready for five six seven dollars a barrel
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.680]  because we pay more for gas than anybody else we pay more prescription drugs than anybody else
[42:27.680 --> 42:35.120]  we pay those are all taxes total we pay more taxes than any other nation but a handful of
[42:35.120 --> 42:40.320]  european countries but it's all hidden it's all added on so that the cattle don't notice
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.800]  french fishermen burn e u flag to protest fuel costs that's the headline they also attack stores
[42:48.800 --> 42:55.120]  looted yeah they're getting angry do you wouldn't see that used to americans acted like that now it's
[42:55.120 --> 42:59.360]  the europeans because they're not as yelled at as us or they're deeper into the slavery and they're
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.760]  really well they're all going bankrupt they're losing everything the farmers the it's all over
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.720]  it's it you know new world order lawmakers near agreement on domestic surveillance that's right
[43:08.720 --> 43:14.960]  totally illegal uh just they now admit surveilling the entire american population non-terror related
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.000]  they tried to lie and claim it's just listening to bin laden's phone calls and they had to admit no
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.760]  it's listening to everybody tracking everything you do illegally and uh you know they're getting
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.480]  ready to completely overturn the fourth amendment which they can't do constitution says congress
[43:28.480 --> 43:34.960]  can't do that court says us cash discriminates against the blind a decade ago i saw globalist
[43:34.960 --> 43:40.080]  policy reports where they would have billboards tv ads saying cash was dirty then discriminated
[43:40.080 --> 43:43.760]  against the blind that's how they were going to get rid of cash and they're now doing it
[43:45.360 --> 43:49.600]  and folks when that happens the ramifications are unspeakable
[43:53.200 --> 43:56.880]  now they're i told you the whole time we're told you 25 years ago because they read trilateral
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.760]  commission documents you called it a conspiracy they would phase in colored money first to get you
[44:01.760 --> 44:08.240]  used to then having smaller bills that have rfid chips in them and then we gave you the federal
[44:08.240 --> 44:13.920]  documents where they were testing it in some money in canada the euro in the us people then said we
[44:13.920 --> 44:18.800]  made that up you can now google rfid to be putting money hundreds of articles oh right again as usual
[44:19.760 --> 44:26.480]  and um they are going to now have it with rfid in it uh so we don't quote discriminate against
[44:26.480 --> 44:33.520]  the blind yeah that's really what it's about now things become cashless then and they scan it and
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.080]  track it and what you do and how you got it out of an atm and what you did and where you spent it
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.200]  with a new national slash global carbon tax it's going to be a sales tax one of the many taxes
[44:43.200 --> 44:47.040]  they're going to track everything you do with that they've now announced that face scanners to quote
[44:47.040 --> 44:52.400]  make sure no one underage checked against national and international databases through the local
[44:52.400 --> 44:57.920]  driver's license or id you should have to have a job unless you're an illegal they're given waivers um
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.480]  it's selectively enforced you will all be face scanned by and sell they're going in now lawmakers
[45:04.480 --> 45:09.920]  near agreement on domestic surveillance court says us cash discriminates against the blind
[45:09.920 --> 45:16.960]  ruling enforced treasury department to redesign its money folks they ignore rulings there's
[45:16.960 --> 45:22.080]  hundreds of rulings in texas about these warrantless checkpoints there's uh two supreme
[45:22.080 --> 45:28.320]  court rulings in texas one i mean national federal supreme court one out of austin from the 80s where
[45:28.320 --> 45:32.000]  you don't have to have an id walking down the street but the dumb cops have been told you do
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.720]  and they still arrest people every day for it i was almost arrested for not having an id once
[45:36.720 --> 45:42.720]  walking from a convenience store 60 yards from my apartment and that was back in like 1995 94
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.440]  had a gatorade and some ice cream and the guys just they just heard screaming i mean i said am i
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.320]  a suspect decide look like somebody said no punk you gotta have an id i can arrest you now tell me
[45:54.320 --> 46:00.640]  where your apartment is that's just right there this here's the number another brick in the wall
[46:00.640 --> 46:09.840]  another reason i don't buy into all your bull i mean at that time i was a complete health food
[46:09.840 --> 46:14.480]  nut doing nothing bad for my body not even cheeseburgers i just run like five miles in there with
[46:14.480 --> 46:22.960]  these guys yelling at me i still did like some junk food though um the point is is that uh you
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.640]  know they say oh the courts are making them oh they've gotta do it folks they do whatever they
[46:28.640 --> 46:34.480]  want okay that's all staged i told you they do this a decade ago because i read their documents
[46:34.480 --> 46:44.960]  they're gonna claim first apes great apes african great ape chimpanzees and orangutans uh them
[46:46.400 --> 46:50.720]  getting into the other primates different monkeys baboons things like that
[46:52.400 --> 46:56.080]  they're all going to have rights but they really can't talk and can't defend themselves
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.840]  because they're not really humans uh they're not even close that's bold that their chromosomes
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.920]  are only two percent different ladies and gentlemen uh when you look that they only count the last you
[47:07.920 --> 47:11.360]  know four percent because they used to claim that was the only chromosomes that mattered
[47:11.360 --> 47:16.000]  the other 96 percent are completely different that they were just ignoring all that but yes
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.800]  of the four percent that they would look at they are half like us see that's that's a little
[47:22.800 --> 47:29.440]  semantical trick they play incidentally dogs are very similar but uh if you look at it according
[47:29.440 --> 47:36.640]  to the only the four percent of the chromosomes four percent of the genetics european court agrees
[47:36.640 --> 47:44.160]  to hear chimps plea for human rights it's a human but government oh you've got to give us million
[47:44.160 --> 47:48.800]  you know millions of square miles that the un's going to control course and then strip mine later
[47:48.800 --> 47:53.920]  five years later when you forget because it's for the chimpanzee see they can't speak for themselves
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.320]  so they're going to be represented see it's always you notice how they always give everything hyper
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.840]  rights oh we've got to get rid of the money and have a cashless for the blind
[48:04.320 --> 48:06.960]  but under eugenics the government wants to euthanize the blind
[48:08.880 --> 48:18.560]  this the visually impaired see oh we we care about the chimpanzees that's why we do medical
[48:18.560 --> 48:24.880]  testing on them all over the world which i'm actually against i think the higher level prime
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.760]  age whales things like that i mean but we don't need a global control on we need to boycott
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.560]  and culturally people in norway need to stop eating whale and at least until they get into
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.920]  gigantic numbers again i mean they're wonderful but see it sounds reasonable then it turns into
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.520]  exterminate the humans teachers given right oh they're given a right see it's it's see how they
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.000]  phrase it to scream pupils computers and mobile phones and crack down school gangs and then really
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.320]  what it is is down to elementary kids they spy on them ask about their parents ask us in the medicine
[48:54.320 --> 48:59.760]  cabinet it already happens here in the u.s nbc army stop-loss policy a backdoor draft
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.160]  actually a pretty good report but they minimize the number it's way more than the amount of
[49:06.160 --> 49:12.080]  58 000 they list i mean almost everybody i know in the marines of the army has been in iraq for at
[49:12.080 --> 49:16.720]  least three tears let me think most people i they've been in like afghanistan twice iraq twice
[49:16.720 --> 49:21.520]  i guess more than that everybody i knows but in afghanistan three times iraq twice or iraq three
[49:21.520 --> 49:27.360]  times in afghanistan once or vice versa and a lot of them signed up for three years and they tell
[49:27.360 --> 49:33.120]  them no i mean they'll be in there two three years after you know we're now five months five years
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.760]  and what three or four months into uh the war in iraq we're now six and a half years in afghanistan
[49:39.760 --> 49:47.520]  but so this story sounds bad that we'll play that after the break if i have time but it's it's not
[49:47.520 --> 49:54.080]  half as bad as it really is democrats seek iraq embezzlement probe ha man if they for political
[49:54.080 --> 50:00.640]  points they're all involved by the way i mean there was a trillion nine missing and broken the
[50:00.640 --> 50:06.160]  news two days before nine eleven which is why they probably went ahead went with that a little bit
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.720]  earlier than they've been planning according to our sources you know with the stage of attacks
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.800]  but now it's over four trillion last time i checked you're like four trillion the whole
[50:14.800 --> 50:22.720]  military budget's only 800 billion now well that's because they took all the pension funds all the
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.400]  investments they had comprehensive annual financial reports the pentagon and subdirectorates
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.600]  all had investments they just dumped all those and they won't even say where they went of course
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.320]  they're going for marshal law of course they're building camps the military lockheed runs the
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.840]  red light cameras in most cities they're training the police they're taking over it always happens
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.560]  in third world countries and in rome and i mean it's real simple we'll be right back
[50:54.320 --> 50:59.680]  terror storm a history of government sponsored terror loose change final cut in game blueprint
[50:59.680 --> 51:05.120]  for global enslavement the true story of the bilderberg group the late great usa america freedom

[54:02.400 --> 54:07.520]  let me just boil it down very simply i know you know this listener is your body is smarter than i am
[54:07.520 --> 54:16.640]  but for the general public who doesn't know history in rome in greece in europe going back
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.800]  thousands of years in japan in latin america you can go back six thousand years seven thousand
[54:22.800 --> 54:29.440]  years right through to today generally new dynasties even under imperial systems or monarchies
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.600]  the new dynasties would be the generals they would band together have a coup overthrow the king
[54:35.600 --> 54:41.840]  and make themselves a new dynasty well now things are scientific and world war two happened we came
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.480]  out of the depression that had been staged that's been declassified uh the public now trusted the
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.520]  government for the first time in 200 years of american history of u.s history that time been
[54:51.520 --> 54:59.920]  about 170 years of history and you had the military industrial complex that eisenhower and his
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.680]  farewell speech warned us about in six in 1961 they went in and took over 90 percent of research
[55:05.680 --> 55:15.520]  funding all research funding science mathematics speech you name it uh at the universities and
[55:15.520 --> 55:21.120]  then more than all the university funding in the country they had black ops and huge secret
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.520]  technology development systems and they charted how the highways were built and how the signs
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.960]  looked and what color they were and how uh what electrical voltage went down the power lines and
[55:30.960 --> 55:35.360]  grids and control and power plants and built the country up and a lot of it was good
[55:37.200 --> 55:43.120]  but from the beginning it was meant for control and to make the u.s a armed military camp
[55:44.480 --> 55:48.800]  and it's a long strategic plan the families that own the private defense contractors and the private
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.240]  banks got more power more control they consolidated the economy they bought up local economies with
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.720]  all this federal money they had everybody would follow up with themselves for it they leveraged
[55:58.720 --> 56:06.320]  that they then put rules in the local communities uh for money they took from us originally and now
[56:06.320 --> 56:11.040]  the red light cameras the face scanning cameras the license plate scanning cameras every major
[56:11.040 --> 56:17.280]  city has thousands of microphones awesom has thousands of microphones since 1998 that's in
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.920]  my film police state 2000 released in 99 with awesom american statesman cover story and then
[56:21.920 --> 56:28.080]  the bills the documents uh you're all being listened to uh and they're now going to shift the economy
[56:28.080 --> 56:35.520]  over to one in ten college grads so well that'll be about one and twenty roughly in the country
[56:35.520 --> 56:45.680]  will be a spy a tattle tail a uh corrections officer a cop a analyst a data miner a hacker
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.800]  that works for the government and it's simple they control the money machines they control the
[56:50.800 --> 56:56.480]  currency and credit they see they're outside the paradigm we're in they fully built the system we
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.040]  live in now they're totally phasing out the last vestiges of what was left of liberty and freedom
[57:01.040 --> 57:09.200]  and family and they control the the symbol of energy the symbol of food the symbol of gas the
[57:09.200 --> 57:18.160]  symbol of cars the symbol of housing the symbol of everything and they are now uh restricting
[57:18.160 --> 57:23.920]  that okay by devaluing that actually restricts uh how much of it you have it's an illusion they
[57:23.920 --> 57:30.400]  print more of it you have more of it but it's worthless and so things are getting worse and
[57:30.400 --> 57:34.800]  worse and more and more predatory that puts pressure on you they then still poses the
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.440]  saviors you ask them what do we do to get it better they go more government more control
[57:39.440 --> 57:45.040]  here's hillary here's mccain here's here's obama all of them want open borders all of them really
[57:45.040 --> 57:50.560]  want socialized health care and gun control and wars and everything else and so they're just bringing
[57:50.560 --> 57:57.440]  you into the next phase as they incrementally turn the heat up in the eugenics program and then
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.520]  meanwhile the private corporations the private defense companies that are owned by the private
[58:01.520 --> 58:08.960]  federal reserve predominantly they now own the entire infrastructure the land and then oh chimpanzees
[58:08.960 --> 58:13.360]  are human but it can't talk so we represent it we're the government we're going to take your

[59:36.480 --> 59:43.040]  now at prison planet dot tv in game blueprint for global enslavement you have been warned
[59:43.040 --> 59:52.320]  not waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[59:57.920 --> 1:00:06.960]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:15.040]  and now live from austin texas alex jones it's really very simple private interest can come in
[1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:19.280]  i've seen this broken down different studies it changes year to year
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:29.440]  for every million dollars a big multinational corporation puts in to lobbying they get around
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:35.360]  four billion dollars back and then i've seen numbers at the state level for every thousand
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:40.720]  dollars a lobbyist puts in on average they get about two hundred thousand dollars back
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:49.360]  and so they come in and they've basically bought up almost everything that they're
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:53.760]  still pockets of land pockets of assets they want and so they're just going to jack up oil
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:01:00.800]  prizes jack up carbon taxes and they're going to destroy all the millionaires and middle class people
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:05.840]  that the that the working class thinks are rich some guy making twenty thousand dollars a year
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:10.320]  thinks somebody making two hundred grand a year is his filthy rich
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:15.760]  they have no idea that person's really lower middle class with true standard of living
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.760]  so most of our wealth has been illusion and it was done to get us under their control and to get
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:31.200]  real assets let's play this nbc stop loss piece because you'd think it was being honest but
[1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:36.560]  it's actually very dishonest here it is nbc news in depth tonight back to the front the number
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:42.000]  of us soldiers who've had their iraq military service involuntarily extended under the so-called
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.520]  stop loss policy is at its highest since the start of the war that's despite a pentagon
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:52.720]  pledge last year to cut back on its use nbc's jimik leshevsky takes a look at the effect of
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:59.200]  this controversial policy as sergeant david white was preparing to wrap up his military career last
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:05.440]  year he was stunned when the army refused to let him go i was just in disbelief i did not think
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.840]  that something like that could happen to me instead white was sent to iraq for his second
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:16.320]  combat tour leaving wife crystal and newborn eva behind what the army did is slap white with a
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.680]  stop loss which allows the army to extend the soldiers enlistment like it or not i was going
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:29.040]  to be stuck in the army for an extra year and i was so close to getting out 58 000 soldiers have
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:34.800]  been stopped lost in the past six years their service involuntarily extended from a few months
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:40.480]  to more than a year i felt you felt helpless you felt like there's really nothing you could do
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:45.840]  there's nothing you do about it steward mckenzie stop loss not only cost him his time it nearly
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:51.440]  cost him his life the bomb was about five five seven feet away severed my left hand almost
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:57.280]  completely off it was just dangling by some skin army surgeons reattach mckenzie's hand which now
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:03.760]  gives him limited use to this day mckenzie blames the stop loss you know i got hurt right at the
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:11.120]  end of uh seven months you know i was only supposed to be there six the army says it uses
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:16.080]  stop loss to keep soldiers who reach the end of enlistment from leaving the battlefield in the
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:22.960]  middle of a combat tour they don't like it any better than i do but it it has proven necessary
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:30.160]  in order to maintain the force but many lawmakers and critics claim the army has used stop loss as
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.400]  a backdoor draft to make up for the shortage of soldiers for the wars in iraq and afghanistan
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:44.480]  it is going to destroy the morale of our troops we've got to stop it senior army officials predict
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.440]  however they'll still need stop loss at least through the end of next year that won't matter
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:56.320]  to david white who will finally leave the army in july fulfilling his duty and then some jimik
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:04.160]  leshevsky n dc news the pentagon now did you hear them um say the army pledged not to do it anymore
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:11.040]  but the government pledges something you better be assured they pledged they didn't do 9 11 they
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:17.200]  pledged there were wmds they pledged florida is good for you in the water they pledged there
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:22.320]  wasn't mercury in the vaccines and then said oh we lied it's in there but it's good for you
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:27.520]  and now they the documents have come out they say tens of millions have been brain damaged
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:36.000]  their own internal cdcs public and doesn't matter they still cause conspiracy theories in the media
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.680]  just amazing course they won't need stop loss soon because the military is going to be felons
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:46.320]  and illegal aliens already is and then they can have their way with us we'll be right back with

[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:53.760]  july maybe i should reapprise my prediction and go up even faster so i think it'll probably go up
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:59.120]  to 145 by the end of july maybe 150 then it'll drop back down to 120 and you'll think you're lucky

[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:04.400]  you know i i i came from very humble surroundings i worked my way through college
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:11.200]  i spent uh several years in counterintelligence with the government and fact i just got off another
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:18.000]  program where somebody from the state department emailed in and uh commented upon something i had
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:26.560]  to say uh he said that uh throughout the state department people are drawing mustaches on the
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:32.480]  photos of uh our president and vice president which was very illuminating and i went back to him and i
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:38.080]  said uh that's interesting and you know there was a fellow who roomed with me when i was in
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:43.840]  counterintelligence named pete galbraith who worked for the state department which he worked for
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:50.880]  and i said do you know him and he said he used to be my boss but anyway going forward um i was in
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:56.400]  the brokerage business for 28 years i own my own firm part of the time and i've been writing the
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:03.520]  international forecaster i guess is the second or third vocation uh for the last almost 20 years
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:12.720]  and uh i've lived around the world i've i speak several languages um as a alex pointed out i lived
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:20.880]  in uh south africa and zimbabwe i lived all over europe central south america mexico uh the caribbean
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:28.480]  islands uh canada and so um i got a lot of experience i'm fortunate that 73 to be healthy
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:34.560]  and so i can keep on imparting what i hope is uh correct correct prognostications about what is
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.760]  going on and incidentally i gotta fit this in considering what you just said before we went
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:44.880]  to the break and then as i got a letter in this morning from a subscriber who said he works in
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:52.960]  a federal prison in the dietary part and he said uh uh next week uh the government is sending
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:12:00.000]  their recruiters to try to recruit people to go into the military and i went back to them and they
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.680]  said well what are they gonna line up the murderers on one side and tell them you get the best chance
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:12.240]  of going in so anyway i had to throw that in alex what level security did he say this facility is
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.280]  didn't say i don't know well i mean i was telling people this eight nine years ago
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.440]  it's incredible how time flies actually in 99 that i learned that they were recruiting uh i mean
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:29.200]  aggravated felons out of texas prisons i even got documents but people wouldn't believe me
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.880]  and now the biggest army recruiting center in the world is not in the us or in a uh protectorate
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:41.520]  a possession it is in mexico city the second largest is in manila philippines uh and so
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:48.480]  they're recruiting foreigners a and then felons aggravated that means violent felons and i mean
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:54.320]  at this point bob Chapman this government i have no respect for it it's bankrupt and and i have
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:58.240]  confirmed with sources that people inside government are seeing the preparations for martial law
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:02.640]  and they know obama and hillary are just as bad we don't know who's going to pull the trigger
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:06.480]  whether it'll be bush or somebody down the line it's key to understand that listeners
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.880]  but that yes people in government are the ones calling us and saying you are absolutely right
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:16.800]  i mean the things we're seeing bush and the john warner defense authorization act it says he's
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:21.280]  dictator and it says they're going to use the army against rebelling americans what are they
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:28.000]  planning bob that they're going to need to fight quote rebelling americans i think what they're
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.640]  they're not planning on what they've created that they can't stop is a depression and the people
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:40.000]  saying uh you know you gotta support me you gotta feed me and the people are losing their homes
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.400]  and their vehicles and their jobs and living under bridges and people are running around
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:49.360]  with assault weapons saying you know who did to did this to me and i think it's going to get to
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:57.200]  that and if the military steps in uh they're not going to win if they shoot at american people
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:03.920]  they are going to lose by the way the scenario in viva vendetta where they shoot the little girl
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:09.600]  who's wearing the mask and then the people finally riot and start killing the cops that has happened
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.240]  hundreds of times in the last century mainly in eastern europe and latin america other places
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:19.840]  and that happened here in 1776 that's how fast it can happen bob and i don't want that to happen
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:25.840]  and that's why we're on the air alex to try to cut these guys off at the past
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:30.560]  but bob from living in these third world countries and living in war zones and doing
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:34.480]  what you did in the military i know you can't talk about how do you see if it does go bad
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:41.280]  and unfortunately the cards lean towards that right now really bad um what will it unravel
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:48.400]  like what will civil war look like you don't even want to see shooting nevermind dead bodies all
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:54.240]  over the place i mean you know people can't handle it emotionally uh people will be committing
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:01.280]  suicide you know rather than face somebody else shooting them or starving i mean look what they've
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:06.720]  done with food prices people are starving all over the world because they got to have ethanol
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:14.480]  there's not going to be good and you can't you don't know what it's going to be like until you
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:19.600]  get there all i can tell you is it's not going to be nice and that is the understatement of the year
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:27.360]  ask any veteran out there some of you veterans call in and tell us what it was like in vietnam
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:28.720]  or in the second world war
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:36.320]  now maybe these people will get the the message you know this is not some sort of a video game
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:43.680]  i think you just hit the crux of the problem americans have become spectators in the bleachers
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:47.520]  watching their neighbor get dragged off by the swat team watching cps take their
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:54.880]  their co-workers children for no reason uh watching friends and in oj2 and all of it
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:16:00.880]  and they think it's a video game no no no this is this is a real world this is a real government
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:09.600]  building fema camps this is the 1930s in europe all over again
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:14.960]  and you still say time they're going to pick on everybody
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:19.440]  and you think that you still think two to three years till total implosion
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:25.520]  that's a good shot at it because i think they can keep the financial system
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:32.160]  humming to some degree and to keep the banks from and other financial houses from going under
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:35.440]  for that period of time but the key to the whole thing is
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:42.080]  is the non usage of money and credit when that happens deflation is going to take over
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:48.880]  the caveat within that time frame is are they going to invade another country are they going
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:53.040]  to have a draft are they going to ship our kids and grandkids out of the country
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:02.000]  and make people more fearful of having a war and losing their lives than they are at home not eating
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:10.960]  eating i mean this is a tried and true historical fact that dictator after dictator oppressive
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:18.080]  a government after one after another have done this it is it sticks out like a sore thumb in history
[1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:30.400]  bob i'm looking for an article i had my stack it's up on info wars dot com
[1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:36.560]  um a government study they have another university study saying that seven million people
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:48.320]  starved to death during the great depression from 1929 until the 1938 or so and it's just
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:57.040]  just amazing that seven million stars then when we were 85 90 agrarian and self-sufficient
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:02.640]  we're now 90 percent living in cities 10 percent in the country with only five percent half of that
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:07.680]  10 percent being self-sufficient my god if we had another depression it would just be total
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:15.280]  societal breakdown and it'll happen in many other countries as well uh some countries will be spared
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:23.760]  because they have uh the ability to be able to uh grow crops but you know you take a place like
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:29.440]  europe it's going to be upside down canada i mean they don't have favorable weather and uh
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.560]  and uh they have populations that that can get out of control just like anybody else
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:39.680]  i mean nobody has an um a monopoly on it on sanity
[1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:50.000]  bob shatman uh talk about oil uh dollar devaluation that what's going on currently and what
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:56.320]  are these going to happen in the short term uh short term um we may form a double top here at
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:05.680]  136 and a retrench back to say uh 100 to 125 and then these are technical thought patterns
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.960]  i'm i'm talking about now because markets go up they go back they settle and then they see if
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:18.160]  they can go higher again um i think like you said earlier 145 50 is very doable here so it may
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:24.320]  clock up another 15 or 20 dollars go to 150 and what they call in the brokerage business
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:30.960]  back and fill and it may do that but okay explain that when we get back and by the way 150 dollar
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:36.800]  barrel and oil means five to six dollars depending on where you are in the country per gallon of gas
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:43.040]  um it's just absolutely amazing we'll be right back with bob shatman right here on the gcm radio

[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:09.440]  ring of fire but down down coming up at about 45 after we're going to go to paul watson from england
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.160]  a mentally ill person they claim control balkaida it's always a mentally ill person
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:22.000]  always in government facilities beforehand had a tiny bomb and it blew up like a smoke bomb and
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:27.920]  cut his eyebrow then the whole country's locked down with fear and crying and gnashing of teeth
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:33.760]  because a cherry bomb with us some nails on it a firecracker with some nails on it cut someone's
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:39.760]  eyebrow that set it off in front of their face and we just got to give all our rides up it happened
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.320]  one day after they were in trouble for some staging some anti-terror stuff and they just send
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:47.760]  their mentally ill person out to do it and all their hyping of terror i'm surprised there's not
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:53.840]  more real wounds outbombing with this guy's got got all the government uh earmarks bob Chapman uh
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:25:02.080]  Chapman um what do you see gold going i mean if all the other commodities are skyrocketing i'm
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:09.840]  surprised that it's not a 2000 by now how are they holding it down well uh there's a number of ways
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:16.400]  uh i i think they still probably have a gold bullion to sell they also buy puts which means
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:24.000]  you're going to bet that gold's going to go down um they also can sell uh futures contracts which would
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:32.640]  put pressure downward on gold prices and it's my suspicion that this gold etf which is listed on
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.800]  the new york stock exchange is lending gold to the united states government because the company
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:48.080]  that manages the etf uh is jp morgan chase and they are used by the government to interfere in in the
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:54.240]  market and i think that is where some of the gold is coming from that is being sold into the market
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:01.120]  and then bought back again and uh they know that they can't keep the price down indefinitely
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:08.080]  but what they can do is interrupt the forward movement of the price from time to time and
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:13.840]  that's why as we go on further you're going to see even greater volatility in gold and silver it's
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:23.760]  not going to stop and uh if you base gold prices on uh 1980 official inflation figures
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:28.080]  gold should be selling at twenty two dollars twenty two hundred and sixty eight dollars
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:32.400]  announced but we all know that nineteen nine twenty five get selling on twenty five instead
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:38.720]  half the price why bob or less than half now that's that's that's official inflation what's
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:44.880]  what's i'm sure i know you've broken down what's real inflation to in 2008 versus uh 1980 numbers
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:53.280]  well the the best figures i've seen i come from jim turk uh who is a former banker and
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:58.560]  writes about this sort of thing like i do and he's talking something like six hundred and forty
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:03.280]  five dollars and uh six thousand four hundred and fifty dollars an ounce and they think he's
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:09.760]  probably right i've said gold's going over three thousand um i didn't attempt to pick out a number
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:15.520]  because it's early and and i don't have to do that all i know is it's going higher so you keep on
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:21.600]  buying it and uh if you don't you you you're going to be stuck because the value of all the other
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:27.440]  things that you have a good it's going to go down so you have to offset those losses by making gains
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:37.680]  someplace and you can do that in gold and silver but if oil is i mean all the mainstream media 95
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:42.320]  percent of the time you do see it on a few shows here and there but but most of mainstream media
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:48.000]  stays away from admitting that most of the oil price increase is that it's dollar denominated
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.720]  and the dollar is tanking and now i see the foreign press they're admitting that's the main culprit
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:57.920]  but a can you elaborate on that and then be what are some of the other reasons oil's exploding
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:02.000]  well first of all it used to be a great secret but now they're admitting it so
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.440]  they're right yes finally they were forced to because of people like me writing about it
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:14.080]  um the second thing is that in the price of oil about one third of that price is
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.600]  through speculation no question and why is that speculation happening is because our president
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:26.880]  keeps on trying to find a way to turn a ran into a parking lot and so as long as you have that
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:34.640]  sort of damocles hanging over the the oil market you're going to have speculation and rightly so
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:38.640]  and i know everybody doesn't like paying more for gasoline
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:43.680]  whether you're in thailand or in new york city but that's just the way it is
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:49.680]  and by congress well the house of representatives yesterday come out and said uh we're going to
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:56.080]  bring antitrust laws against uh these opaque people for uh fixing the price of oil and uh
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:01.120]  and we're going to start finding them and this sort of thing i know that siren he thinks so stupid
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:05.440]  in my life that's a red heron opaque will say is we'll just stop shipping you oil how's that
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:11.920]  yeah it's a cartel outside their control and they're also blaming the oil companies
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:17.200]  oil companies when bob isn't their profits set at eight nine percent and they don't have anything to
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:21.920]  do with this well i don't know about the setting of profits but they're making more than that
[1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:28.160]  and uh they've always been manipulating the oil price the big companies uh both in london and new
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:33.520]  york so you're saying some of the blame does go on the oil companies it does but not as much as it
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:37.440]  does on the other two factors yeah that's that's the point i mean i'm not saying they're not
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:44.000]  scoundrels but the point is that they're not the main culprit we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:10.720]  ring of fire i went down down down by the way i talked to one of my friends at sunday's showing
[1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:15.600]  of truth rising that won't be out till july 4th for prison planet dot tv members and of course on
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:22.000]  dvd for everybody else who wants it and she'd been visiting family in germany in fact i gave her
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:28.080]  a number to my producer i need to get her on monday or tuesday uh and she was coming back and
[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:34.000]  they thumb scan us citizens and all foreigners and she noticed when you go to all foreign countries
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.120]  now that are western they take your thumb prints and biometric face scan that's all part of a
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:43.680]  international agreement from 2000 fingerprint registry and housing bill now they have one
[1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:50.000]  for all americans to be fingerprinted she were all criminals bob Chapman all over the country
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:55.280]  they're announcing now federally funded the police are going to take blood at checkpoints now now
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  they're going to get in our space get uh you know past that extreme boundary imagine an old
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:06.480]  nazi germany a movie about that black and white if the germans would have been sucking people's
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:12.960]  bloods on train i mean i mean imagine that image of the germans at checkpoints taking blood how crazy
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:20.560]  does this have to get bob well i think uh uh you know the world works on its stomach and uh the
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:26.240]  kicker is going to be when we head into depression and finally people are going to say i can't take
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:32.720]  it anymore uh i don't have a job etc and that's that's going to be the trigger and they know that
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:37.760]  bob why is exactly they know that i was about to say why are they doing saturation patrols why are
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.320]  they running more checkpoints why are they pulling families out why are they telling cops to be to
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:46.800]  be more aggressive do they think they're trying to intimidate us before the depression or they
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:52.960]  trying to make us fight back no i think they're trying to intimidate i don't think they're you
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:58.880]  know lining people up to fight back because most people don't do that unless they absolutely have
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:03.600]  but i was about to say it's not intimidating people everybody i know is just going lunatic crazy
[1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:08.400]  well they're having the opposite effect and then perhaps they'll stop it
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:13.200]  but you know the experiment with different things and you know they don't know how
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:18.240]  certain things they guess but they don't know how certain things are going to work
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:21.920]  within this public sphere so they experiment
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:28.480]  you think the average cop because i know the average cop isn't a bad person the system is bad
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:31.520]  do you think an average cop realizes how they're being manipulated to bob
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:36.560]  i think a lot of them do i don't know what the numbers are and i think they're very disturbed
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:42.960]  about it and i think that probably 80% will not follow orders and i'm hoping that that's so
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.200]  maybe it's what you'll think and i think the same thing is true with the military
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:53.920]  i do not think 20 you know 80 80% will not participate unless they're shot at or something
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:36:01.760]  and then they've got to shoot back you know to defend their lives but i think that what you're
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:06.880]  going to see is more and more of what we're getting it's a police state well bob there's
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:11.360]  just no two ways about it bob i thought you were right about that and that's what was my view
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:16.960]  until katrina as long as they've got some cover or excuse like why aren't we shipping food in
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:20.560]  or why is it there we're not giving it to them or why aren't we getting old people out of nursing
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:25.920]  homes why are we out confiscating guns with most of our manpower and the troops from the news going
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:32.880]  i don't like confiscating guns in america but i do it mm-hmm so i i don't know well confiscating
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:41.360]  guns and uh and uh perhaps moving people around is one thing but uh being told that mob over there
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:45.600]  has to be put down and there's no other way we can do it except shoot them all uh that's another
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:52.480]  story i agree and i read pentagon uh documents uh from 30 years ago the last few years we read
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:58.400]  them on air about how they admit that less lethal tasers rubber bullets it's habitualizing cops to
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:03.680]  pull the trigger on what looks like feels like a firearm the news shows the image of a huge
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:09.440]  muzzle flash people being hit blood that those are training aids to try to just like video games
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:16.240]  for training aids to get them to go ahead and instinctively kill us well uh there'll be somewhat
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:21.360]  successful but you got to look at the whole picture and i'm sure that the plan is it ran
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:25.600]  corporation and places like that throughout the world are looking at this and that is that
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:30.160]  you start shooting people then people start shooting back that's what i was about to say
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:36.640]  150 million guns in the united states and there's probably 125 million people who know how to use
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:43.520]  them effectively um do you really think that the police and any army stands a chance against the
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:47.360]  public i don't think so well that's what you're right that and that's why the image of them
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:53.520]  shooting us with rubber bullets in in in one of the plans was ran corporation from the 70s was
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:59.200]  that the image of rubber bullets and the image of flashes gets the public ready to see people being
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:05.920]  shot but there's one problem when mama and daddy don't come home uh and or or or when your son or
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.560]  daughter doesn't come home there's a big percentage of people and you're right out of 100 million
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:14.800]  gun owners one percent fights back that's a million you start killing people's kids you're
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:19.520]  going to have like 20 30 percent they're going to come out looking to kill people guaranteed
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:24.160]  and they're going to come and they're going to kill and and and i hope the government realizes
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:28.480]  that once they cross that rubicon once they make us fight them they're going to get their butt kicked
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:35.360]  bob yeah and the people who got it with you know we we know who's doing what to whom and we're just
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:40.080]  going to go in and clean them out and i'm not talking about the military and the government
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:46.880]  i'm talking about the people behind the scenes and they know that there's people like us out there
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:51.360]  who know who the culprits are and they're going to be brought brought to justice
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:57.360]  and they're terrified of that and that's born out by the program i saw in cmbc this morning
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:05.120]  of p peterson and uh david walker talking about uh what my lord my lord what are we supposed to
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:10.480]  do the system is falling apart and they're terrified and they're terrified because they know
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:15.120]  that if the system falls apart everybody's going to say well gee how did that happen
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:21.440]  and then all of this looting and corruption and thievery that's gone on for so many years
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.840]  and who did it and how they got their fortunes they're all going to get them taken away from them
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.440]  and they're going to sit in jail and they're just terrified they don't know what to do about it
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:36.080]  and they're trying to blame the public for being greedy and spending too much money and
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:41.520]  and in part they're right but the public was led to do so and the public are not economists and
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.640]  financiers they just common people with a high school education yeah i've been studying this
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:51.600]  constantly for 15 years bob and i can barely grasp the basics i mean you've been doing this your
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:55.760]  whole life and aren't there there are whole areas of finance i would imagine you've got to check in
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:02.240]  with other experts well the derivative is a very good one and uh... it it's a very complex thing
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:09.200]  because derivatives are all different the major order it's like going in getting a suit made
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:14.240]  you know if you're a 48 long i mean you're a big fat guy
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:22.000]  bob Chapman the international forecaster dot com you can go there and get a free
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.360]  eversion of it it goes out a couple times a week or twice a month in a hardback you know paper format
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:31.040]  uh... very high quality the international forecaster dot com great intel
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:33.760]  on a host of issues i want to get into south africa what's happening there
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:37.600]  but first i want to get into housing the housing numbers that came out and some of the other
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:43.680]  financial and the uh... economic numbers we're getting what do they mean well we get an inventory
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:51.280]  of unsold holds that just jumped 10.5 percent to an 11.2 months supply the highest since record
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:59.920]  records began a single-hand family home inventories of 10.7 months the highest since 1985 and for
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:07.840]  condos 14.2 months now we're seeing a little bounce coming in san diego and fort mires
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:15.680]  uh... that'll be a dead cat bounce and that means that it'll be a false uh... bump upward so
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:22.560]  that's bargain hunters snapping up things there yeah and and they're wrong uh... but uh... and most
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:28.320]  of them are are not professionals and uh... and in the reason that they're wrong is that prices are
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:34.640]  going to go lower uh... in some areas not much lower san diego and fort mires is an example
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:40.160]  might go five or ten percent lower that should do it for them but this whole areas of california
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:45.440]  and the barter in maryland they even in new england in new york city haven't hasn't been really wrapped
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:54.800]  at the high end yet and uh... so this is going to be another full year the worst full year of sub
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:01.200]  prime all-to-lone failures are coming up and so these these figures that just gave you are going
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:08.240]  to be ten times worse by this time next year and on top of it what nobody talks about is the pick
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:17.360]  and pay loans which are arm option loans usually made to people who have good f y c's ratings
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.840]  and they took loans out that they shouldn't have and they started about six months ago
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.400]  having problems with them and that's going to continue for five years
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:36.640]  let me ask you a question bob if there are fifteen million homes that people already
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:41.360]  walked away from that's the number i saw last week a is that accurate from what you know
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:49.360]  and uh... b is what's i know it's plunging but but but it's some parachute or kind of a streamer
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:55.520]  slowing down your fall a bit uh... that a lot of people i know are still demanding all this money
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:00.160]  for a house or a condo or an office building and they admit that it's been a year two years three
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:05.440]  years nobody's coming and leasing it they're just stubbornly keeping it and paying the taxes
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:09.200]  but a lot of them now i'm starting to see even in austin supposedly the best real estate market in
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:14.880]  the country it's finally softening by ten fifteen points just in the last month or so and and so
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:19.360]  i'm worried that they've had this false sense of confidence and then so when it goes it's really
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:27.600]  going to go it it'll be expedited and uh... and the framework is there for four and a half years
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:34.720]  so we're in the middle of all eight uh... you're looking at twelve twenty twelve and uh... then
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:40.720]  we'll probably hit bottom and then we'll probably go sideways on the bottom for five to fifteen
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:46.880]  years there's no telling how long just like japan just like japan but but but much worse than japan
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:55.440]  um... no not as bad as japan oh not even as bad i think i think what you're going to see
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:02.080]  uh... japan we saw land prices down eighty to ninety percent house prices down seventy to eighty
[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:06.720]  uh... i think what we'll see what we saw in the in the depression in america
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:11.520]  uh... the loss of values of anywhere between forty and sixty percent
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:18.320]  but that's hard in itself uh... probably seventy five percent of builders will go bankrupt
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:25.360]  that's why i have all those short positions on uh... builders and uh... associated businesses
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.080]  and we're not finished with this thing yet when washington wall street tells you well
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:35.440]  half the credit crisis or three quarters of the credit crisis of all of it it's over they're lying
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:40.880]  they want the market to go up so they can make money well this is the second year
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:45.600]  this is the same crowd that is telling us that inflation is a six percent
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:53.680]  no they're telling us it's three point nine you know i'm telling you it's it's twelve and five eight
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:59.760]  percent and that let me comment on that credit is eighteen percent i i i hear congress and others
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:05.360]  say it's six seven percent and the federal reserve still says it's three percent uh... what did what
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:09.600]  numbers i mean other going off the cpi and another but how do they even have that fake
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:15.440]  i mean even with their fake numbers they don't agree that's right and and it's starting to be
[1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:22.000]  widely questioned because the workbook uh... by myself and john williams and uh... a couple of other
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.480]  entities but no one that everybody's afraid to touch it because they'll they're afraid to
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:32.080]  end up with a hole in their head that's what this is all about you know of course within
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:37.920]  the structure with the analyst and the economist are in the insurance companies and banks of
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.680]  wall street and government they don't do you speak out because they'll lose their jobs
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:44.800]  but they know about the police are in
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:49.040]  you think you know i don't want to go through those exercises i don't want to shoot my
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:53.120]  fellow austinites and they're going to say good goodbye
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:45:56.560]  it's the same thing
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:06.800]  well the larger problem bob Chapman is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:10.160]  it instead of them trying to do some of the things that have been recommended by you and other
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:16.640]  experts uh... you know to try to lessen the crash landing it seems they're throwing coal
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:20.640]  into the furnace on the runaway train to get it going even faster over the cliff
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:29.440]  in order to keep it from going because they're not prepared for it they started it and the middle
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:36.240]  east went upside down on them and he just read uh... the big new brisminsky's writings
[1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:42.800]  of the past three years he's got his hand in his head saying oh my gosh they put world government
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:50.560]  back thirty years they're in a pickle they don't know how to get out well trapped ordered out of
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:57.760]  ko is their uh... is their favorite maxim and as you said they always want to start a war
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:03.280]  that's kind of like overturning the chessboard throwing a fit uh... just briefly because we're
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:09.040]  out of time the international forecaster dot com south africa is in riots military mass killings
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:16.000]  the black south africans are attacking now other black groups that have come in from other countries
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.720]  and they're attacking arab and middle eastern and central asian groups and uh... the reporting
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:28.080]  that strikes are so bad that powers getting turned off uh... plants are shut down mines are shut down
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.520]  from all the data i see coming out of south africa but you have a lot of friends there and live there
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:35.680]  and you watch it closely uh... is south africa unraveling
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:42.000]  uh... yes it is uh... all of the things left behind by the what we'll call it the white government
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:49.920]  uh... have been used up and they the government now which is marxist they don't know how to
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:55.920]  recreate things so now they're taking things away from the companies at a well run at a left
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:01.360]  not only in mining but insurance i mean a white person finds it very very difficult to get any
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:07.520]  kind of a job so all of the young people have to leave the country and go to england or america
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:14.240]  or wherever uh... to get themselves employed and uh... it and so you you have this
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:20.240]  race discrimination by the blacks against the whites and they think that everything should
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:25.920]  belong to them uh... because they're there and then when people come in from zimbabwe
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:30.640]  and because their government's even worse at this stage i'd like to go into detail you all know
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:36.000]  what it's like and i live there for three years i had a business there and uh... in saltry which
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:42.800]  is now called harabi and uh... you you're talking somewhere between three and five million people
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:49.840]  who have left zimbabwe to go to south africa to get enough money so they can feed themselves
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:58.960]  and the south africans some of whom are from the same tribes are upset that the others are coming
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:06.560]  in taking their jobs getting paid less and they're taking jobs away from them sort of like what we
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.800]  have with illegal aliens but see that's the thing historically the government acts like
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:17.280]  multiculturalism and injecting masses of foreigners uh... that it's bad to not want that it is
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:22.400]  hurting the black south africans the country is falling apart having millions of starving
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:27.840]  you know people running uh... from the lunatic that uh... you know the communist north of them
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:32.000]  i mean what do you expect people to do it's the same thing here it's just going to get
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:36.080]  and i see on every front the whole world going into what we see happening
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:44.960]  i think you're right uh... because every almost every country has a a group of people who have
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:50.640]  moved in that don't share the same culture and whenever you have that you have conflict
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:57.040]  it's usually religious and uh... sometimes it's ethnic now in the case of south africa
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:00.320]  you have the shona tribe of which is large representation
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:04.240]  in south africa as well as in bob way and then you have the zoos in the
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:11.200]  sangang and in the other tribe uh... usually generally who have gotten along with one another
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:16.240]  for the past hundred years although a lot of it was forced uh... by the government's which took
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:22.640]  over which were white dominated but uh... it's going to get worse there it's just not going to
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:28.480]  get better i have told people when i was when i saw this of the watch right you bought the
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:36.800]  the riots in south africa and uh... in nineteen seventy six in august i pulled all the investments
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:42.720]  that my clients had out of there and i said the game's over and i've said so ever since

[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:27.040]  history of mental illness nicky riley traveled by bus from plimoth to exeter yesterday morning

[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:07.520]  always the same mo a mental patient with a firecracker with some knack with some thumb tacks on it
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:12.800]  blows it up in his face and now they're ninnying running around freaking out and this happened
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:18.400]  right after they were before the european human rights court about secret arrest without habeas
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:27.440]  corpus and now um your el presidente is taking time out your prime minister from saying we need
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:32.560]  marshal law and we need a new world order he's taking time out to fear monger paul watson
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:40.880]  hello alex well yeah it's from what i can see it's basically dumb and dumb at part two you remember
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.880]  the uh terror attack on the glasgow airport a year ago that they called it a terror attack it was
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:52.960]  actually two retards setting fire to a jeep but it was in the news for about three weeks after
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.560]  and uh presented as another reason why we should you know put people in a terror
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:05.040]  database to fill me a bunch of flowers at a tube station but um from what the eyewitness has said
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:12.480]  about this one which happened yesterday morning in exeter which is a quite a small university
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:17.040]  town on the near the south coast of england my brother used to live there down by cornwall
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:25.200]  isn't it it's in that area though the eyewitnesses and it was in a packed restaurant but the actual
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:30.640]  bomb if you want to call it that was set off in a locked toilet and the eyewitness has described
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:37.520]  it as didn't sound like a bomb it sounded more like a light bulb exploding so again it's it's some
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:44.960]  pathetic individual that's got a history of mental illness um that's by being influenced by some
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:51.360]  propaganda and being radicalized by it and that's what they do they they now advertise oh see there's
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:56.640]  deadly al-qaeda it's white al-qaeda remember they said armies of white al-qaeda thousands
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:02.000]  trained with missiles totally deadly force and then they find them you know black uh mentally
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:06.560]  ill street kids mentally retarded uh they give them a hundred grand a videotape at fbi building
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:11.760]  bust them the news says an army of crack assassins so deadly trained they were unstoppable then it
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:18.080]  turned out some of them can't even talk uh and then it's always the same mo always the same mo
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:24.000]  well in britain they're trying to sell it on this so-called islamo fascism they actually
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:30.160]  they had a bust in burnley which is a northern town not too far away from where i live and it was
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:36.800]  a neo-nazi and he basically had a huge cache of rocket launchers and grenades and it was in the
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:43.200]  local newspaper once and it didn't even make you know bbc whereas this is all over bbc at the moment
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:49.840]  so they pick which ones they're gonna propagandize about very carefully and i don't this is not
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:55.200]  getting as much traction as dumb and dumb i did set fire to a jeep at glasgow airport but it's
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:04:00.480]  certainly there's more in the news today than it was yesterday so yeah you would have thought
[2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:06.080]  you would have thought giant alien spacecraft landed uh at the airport with tanks rolling by
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:12.640]  and blare freaking out and panicking and the media saying will britanya hold fast against the burning
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:20.560]  jeep i mean this is it's ridiculous it was crazy well i mean then you look at the real
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:26.960]  bombings the london bombings which is the bombers were completely coddled by uh mi5 and
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:32.080]  they didn't display the behavior of suicide bombers which is what they were so he runs

[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:15.920]  for all the viewers that tune into that each day up on the screen i have a image of rama govern
[2:08:15.920 --> 2:08:20.160]  at an event just a few weeks ago you'll notice he doesn't have a beard anymore he's got a chrome
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:25.040]  dome because he's got lymphoma and he's doing their chemotherapy but i just talked to him he is
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:29.840]  confident that he is going to beat it we should all pray for rama govern because he's been a great
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:37.520]  patriot to this country and one of the top senior cia analyst to several presidents gave george
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:45.520]  bush senior his daily briefing and under seven presidents for over 27 years presenting the morning
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:49.920]  intelligence briefings at the white house and he's giving us an intelligence briefing
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:55.760]  despite the fact that he's doing chemotherapy right now and we really do appreciate him coming
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:00.560]  on if i tried to go through the amazing career he's had it would take too long so we'll just go
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:04.320]  right to him but if you go to wikipedia they've got a pretty good write up on him it's pretty
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  accurate from what i know that uh and of course he was a vietnam veteran as well and so we are
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:18.320]  honored to have him on with us rama govern thanks for being here thanks alex good to be back with
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:23.440]  you well we appreciate your time especially with what you're going through right now well actually
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:28.800]  i've been kind of lucky uh aside from the fatigue the symptoms have been controllable and i'm
[2:09:28.800 --> 2:09:33.920]  looking forward in a couple weeks to get a getting a clean bill of health so i'm very fortunate i
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:39.680]  have reflected very much on how privileged i am uh to have the access to medical care that
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:46.160]  50 millions of my fellow americans lack so it's been a kind of wake-up call in many respects
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:52.240]  for me alex well for your age i remember meeting you in person you look 20 years younger than you are
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:57.840]  uh but uh so you're a tough guy and i'm but but but they're really saying they think you're gonna
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:02.960]  pull through it you know they they've really perfected the art on this kind of lymphoma it
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:08.000]  happens to be the kind that that red sox picture that pitched the no hitter last week uh had a
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:14.400]  couple years ago so i'm oiling my baseball glove down in the cellar and i'll be ready to go another
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:19.600]  you know the month good that's fantastic news it means to spend too much time on that you've written
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:24.640]  a lot of articles analyzing the fact that they may still be planning to attack iran israel said
[2:10:24.640 --> 2:10:29.680]  last week oh yeah top officials say they're gonna attack before bush leaves now can you break down
[2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:35.440]  the field give us an intelligence briefing on what you're being told by sources in dc and what
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:40.080]  we're getting from leaks in the media and from diplomatic sources about what they're planning
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:47.760]  are they gonna start a war well alex it looks pretty clear that the administration that is
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:54.560]  pushing cheney very much want to work it out after iran hit out on iran it would be this time
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:11:01.280]  uh with very little warning uh it would be from the air and from the sea the the missiles on those
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:07.760]  ships and so forth and uh we would as i say uh have very little warning now how it will all
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:14.480]  start is problematic it looked very much up until two weeks ago that they had decided well
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:20.320]  since the intelligence says that the iranians have stopped working on the nuclear weapons
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:24.800]  related part of their nuclear program you know it's going to be kind of difficult to
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:32.160]  to head out at the program that was stopped in mid to 2003 so they switched all the propaganda over
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:39.120]  to the fact that quote or the allegation that quote uh iranian supported groups with iranian
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:44.400]  weapons iranian training and iranian funding are killing hundreds of our troops in southern
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:50.320]  iraq and we're going to prove that to you now that the rub came when that patreus and
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:56.800]  admiral mullen who should know better i promised the the western press on the 25th of april
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:01.440]  that patreus has the goods on these guys and we're gonna have a big display of these weapons
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:05.040]  and that we're going to destroy them in front of you from in front of you right and they've done
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:09.440]  this like four or five times last few years always claiming they've proven iran did it
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:13.920]  and then they always retract very quietly and the media never makes a big deal about their
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:19.280]  deception you know alex that's the big story here you know here they tell the media on april
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:25.200]  25th that this is coming and two weeks later uh they cash all by the way and you know we'll
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:30.960]  keep with cancel that briefing and it's become very clear uh that all these weapons that they
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:36.560]  captured around carbo they couldn't trace one of them to iranian origin the best they could do
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:41.360]  is they found five hand grenades up with the al-qaeda types up there in the northern part of
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:47.760]  iraq five hand grenades that can clearly be be demonstrated have been made in iran give me a
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:54.080]  break five hand grenades so what's what's happening here is it become very embarrassing for uh
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:59.600]  the administration today well you know we're talking about these iranian weapons but we can't
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:05.520]  deliver any we can't show you any and Lieberman can ask patreus as he did uh is it true to say
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:09.600]  that hundreds of america servicemen have been killed by iranian provided weapons
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:13.360]  yes sir says patreus patreus doesn't know the difference
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:19.120]  iranian very much of general westmoreland at the end of the week well in the middle of the
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:24.880]  vietnam war how westmoreland did not tell the truth and i'll say that patreus does not tell the
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:29.600]  truth and this latest bit about patreus saying well you know just just wait till you know the
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:35.600]  summer where i'll probably recommend withdrawing more troops well how how many bait and switch
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:42.080]  things are the american people gonna put up with patreus is not to be trusted and uh this whole
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:48.560]  thing about iran now will reverse in my view toward the the big lie which is that akhmadini
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:55.760]  jet has threatened to push israel into the sea has threatened to destroy israel how many times
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:02.880]  has your president said that he didn't akhmadini jet did not say that it was a uh a terrible
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:08.560]  translation of what he did say and we can go into that later but the big lie is that israel is about
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:16.000]  to be um destroyed by the iranians and even though uh no one not even israelis say that
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:21.680]  iran has a nuclear weapon or is likely to get one in the next year or two um bush you don't
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:26.880]  you always got what seven eight more months and uh israeli ambassador here in washington
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:34.000]  hated you know sometimes they sort of slip and then say the truth the israeli why did why did
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:41.200]  admiral fallon really leave was that because he refuses to launch a hitlerian preemptive attack
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:47.360]  like hitler did on uh poland or chelsea vacchia i think that's the core of it alex uh it's very
[2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:54.240]  clear from that uh all those interviews he gave to that esquire reporter uh and that our article
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:15:01.920]  came out earlier this year that he wasn't about to take part in yet another illegal under international
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:09.120]  as well as domestic law illegal war of aggression because that's exactly the way nernberg the
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:16.160]  nernberg tribunal after world war two defined a preemptive or preventive war there's nothing
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:22.960]  in the un treaty there's nothing in the in the u.s congress uh legislation that that blesses or
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:31.840]  approves a a an offense uh an invasion or an attack on a country that does not pose an imminent
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:38.080]  threat and there is no one there is no one who knows anything about iran who can suggest with
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:45.040]  a straight face the iran poses an imminent threat to the united states of america do you ever
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:49.280]  do you ever feel like you're waking in the middle of a twilight zone that the united states would
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:54.960]  be the bad guys and that we would be attacking all these innocent countries and lying and that
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:16:01.360]  we'd have a war criminal president well alex it took me a while and my colleagues and veteran
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:10.560]  intelligence professionals for sanity took us a while in 2001 2002 uh to kind of be be okay with
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:17.280]  the notion that hey we really needed to turn our analytic skills developed at government expense
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:23.680]  at tax pay expense on our own leaders and yes it is true that they lie a lot whoops and you know
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:30.160]  this may be these lies may be leading up to what nernberg called the war of aggression we called it
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:35.600]  three months before we weren't the only ones scott ridder and others were also sounding the same
[2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:42.240]  the same note and but it happened and still it was hard for us to believe that our leaders and
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:47.920]  our former colleagues with the in and the intelligence services would cooperate with this
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:52.640]  and yet they all did but isn't that's what's so dangerous is they did cooperate now they're not
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:58.240]  cooperating as much i'm told the state department that you know they're jokingly putting hitler
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:04.560]  mustaches on the pictures of uh somebody is of of of the bush and the vice president but this
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:09.600]  isn't a joke i mean we're dealing with with people that have shown that they're willing to quote go
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:16.080]  for it and uh you know gulf of tonkin events staged events provocateur events are you worried
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:21.280]  about them trying to stage something uh because i don't see them being able even this alice in
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:27.760]  wonderland system uh you know this tea party of insanity to be able to attack iran without some
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:32.240]  type of stage provocation and then i'm sure you know we even talked to him and he admitted and
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:38.480]  clarified gary hart told us uh that yes he is afraid the government will stage blow up a ship
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:43.920]  and blame it on iran are you concerned about that i am alex and i think you're right
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:50.080]  some kind of provocation would be necessary now felon when he was a commander of sent
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:58.240]  sent com had very very strict regulations about uh what they call encounter engagements you know
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:03.760]  how you how you deal with little uh outboard motor boats that come speeding up to your naval
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:09.040]  vessel do you blow them out of the water or do you have to try to see if they have any
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:15.040]  dangers missiles or anything on them well obviously it's the latter now what is it now
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:20.240]  i don't know what it's now but there is a report that i have seen about the white house has insisted
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:27.760]  the next time that happens that uh the commander in in the persian gulf contacted the white house
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:33.520]  directly not the defense department to pursue instructions so that's one danger with all
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:38.560]  those uh with all those ships out there it could be a legitimate or it could be a manufactured
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:44.080]  provocation the other part of it is that the president has rhetorically put himself out
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:50.080]  out on the same kind of limb uh that he was before iraq and the people who have put him
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:55.360]  out there are the same kinds of folks richard pearl uh wolf woods and the rest of them that
[2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:01.920]  said then and are saying now look mr president you said that you would not ever permit iran to
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:06.720]  have a nuclear weapon looks like they may get well now are you just going to go out of office and
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:13.600]  and suffer the a program of history that would say oh big talk but george bush took no action
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:19.280]  you can't do that mr president and so uh what he has done is got him got in this country out on
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:26.480]  a limb as if we are automatically pledged to to uh to defend israel if it gets attacked by
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:32.640]  or you know gets attacked by anybody else and so we've lost the uh initiative it's it's not up
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:37.680]  to us anymore it could be israel that would set this thing off and that is really troubling

[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:17.200]  presidents the wide spectrum analysis of what we're facing a can we stop them attacking
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:21.760]  because as you said earlier israel and others are leaking that they plan to
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:27.040]  that's going to happen or is that another piece of propaganda but then we saw the preparations
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:33.360]  and then b if it happens uh what are we likely to see happen worldwide with the economy and
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:40.400]  then militarily reama govern well alex can we stop it uh we just have to stop it you know i
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:46.800]  don't know what's going to take uh the supreme hurdle of course is the captive press the the
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:52.320]  corporate dominated press that will not tell americans the real story but there have to be
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:58.000]  ways to have to be imaginative ways ways that you use and other commentators to get the word out
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:05.200]  that really there is no threat from iran and that this is all sort of a manufactured kind of threat
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:13.520]  of the same kind we saw prior to the attack on iraq um i uh as you know have made a kind of a
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:19.920]  college try to get admiral fallon to realize that it's not enough just to resign he needs to tell
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:25.200]  the american people i mean i'm sure that he's lost many sleepless nights thinking about what
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:31.600]  would happen if we attacked the iran from the air you know these these guys in the blue suits
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:36.800]  you know they say well hey we can just we can do it surgically and and everything will be fine well
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:40.880]  they never have to deal with the aftermath you know what the aftermath could involve
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:48.000]  it could involve cutting the supply lines between kuwait and bagdad that are vital to supplying
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:55.440]  our troops in iraq of which there are about 140 000 right now now if iran can do that and it could
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:02.080]  do that very readily uh we would have to prospect galaxy of having not you know 52 hostages in some
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:08.880]  embassy this time but 52 000 us servicemen cut off from their supply lines taken an effective
[2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:14.960]  hostages by the iranian revolutionary guards do we want that well fallon certainly didn't want that
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:20.320]  did he think he might be ordered to do something that would lead to that he did he saw who was
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:25.600]  calling the shots in the white house it's elliott abram's it's dick cheney it's not anybody else
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:31.440]  who by the way are chicken hawks um when sec when secretary of the army who was an enron crook i'm
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:39.200]  not defending him white said 500 000 troops they said you're fired this does have in my mind images
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:45.600]  of hitler in the bunker commanding armies that didn't exist well you know as many have pointed
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:51.680]  out especially andrew bushevich the boston university professor who's the best on this subject
[2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:58.000]  you know there aren't any troops but you know that there was a same in vietnam alex uh the
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.920]  the fellows in the blue suits you know they want a piece of the action so these generals from the
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:06.800]  air force come to cheney and then bush they say you know hey we have these smart bombs we have
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:12.160]  these stealth bombers nobody gets shot down this time we can knock out half of the iranian
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:17.920]  nuclear facilities one night second half the next night just let us do it you know well again
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:24.080]  yeah i'm showing my prejudice here having been an army infantry officer okay they never have to
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:29.520]  fight the enemy yeah they really they sort of sort of distance it's kind of you know you drop the
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:33.200]  bombs you said well you know they're well guided and you never see the aftermath you don't see the
[2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:38.400]  people were killed you don't see collateral damage you don't see the damage that that does to us
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:44.240]  and the emergence that that cultivates or or grows automatically so what i'm afraid of is that
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:50.400]  the cheney and bush before they leave since they really have not been held accountable for anything
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:58.320]  and since uh bush at least is incredibly risk-taking person and since he seems to have made
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:04.560]  the word the word sir i mean and let you disagree is extremely reckless reckless is the word yeah
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:10.480]  and if he feels as he seems to that he's made this promise to israel that he would deliver
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:18.320]  israel from this evil you know the vocabulary itself alex give me pause i think you know not
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:25.200]  until this regime have as the american administration talked about good and evil in the apocalyptic
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:31.040]  you know in the uh in the the kind of sense that these people have been using it well we know they're
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:38.160]  playing off of uh their minions uh in a really sadistic mean way some people who you know i
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:42.720]  guess want the end of the world but uh this is like i guess they really are making an apocalyptic
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:48.800]  then well it will be whether they realize that or not and that's that's the rub because
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:55.200]  fallen was smart enough to realize what this could mean and i just reduced one example alex i mean
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:00.400]  the other things they could do is actually attack is real with missiles uh they can you know
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:05.840]  hit the oil well heads in the in the in the gulf and put a lot of them and we'll be you know paying
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:10.480]  not four dollars a gallon we'll be paying ten dollars a gallon automatically they can do all
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:17.840]  these things and uh i'm just wondering if anyone in the very tight circle that is advising bush
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:22.560]  cheney whether they have the guts to tell bush that i mean do you remember just two months ago
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:27.440]  when the press said that mr president what do you think about the possibility of of four dollars
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:33.280]  uh stay there stay there rey mcgovern the senior former ci analyst but we'll be back we've got a

[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:15.200]  church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of god and of country that prompts or
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:20.080]  constrains us this will change the character not civil enforcement from history we saw that when
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:25.440]  church and state united known as papal roam religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly
[2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:30.560]  contrary to the great principles of our nation america and papal roam are uniting in this agenda
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:36.320]  protestant america awake before it is too late the prophecies are fast fulfilling jesus is coming
[2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:44.560]  soon for free materials call 888 211 1715 or write the bible says box 99 lanore city tennessee
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:52.240]  37771 no matter how hard you try you can't stop us now
[2:32:56.080 --> 2:32:59.840]  no matter how hard you try you can't stop us now
[2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:01.840]  oh
[2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:06.640]  we're the renegades and it's atomic age
[2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:14.240]  it's atomic age for renegade renegade renegades and it's atomic age
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:18.640]  it's atomic age for renegade renegade
[2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:23.680]  since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:27.680]  one down through the middle ages planet earths kept going through changes
[2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:31.120]  and then when it's okay the times continue to change
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:37.600]  not to stay the same but they were always renegades like you say for top rama govern
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:44.480]  top ci analyst multiple presidents combat infantry commander vietnam
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:53.040]  outspoken uh individual has been criticizing we have this clip we could play of him confronting
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:59.360]  um rumsfeld about his lies and there's all this media there and none of them will do it
[2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:04.560]  and they still really won't and then if about a month ago renegade govern you may have seen it
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:10.240]  then there was a clip with the uh good looking uh you know front lady they used it for the
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:16.400]  presidential spokesperson the press secretary and they come up to her and they say is it true
[2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:22.000]  the dollar being devalued's making oil prices go up and of course that's part of it the instability
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:26.400]  makes the speculation as well you know are they going to blow the middle east you know the pieces
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:31.200]  and so it boils up that's part of it but mainly dollar devaluation is it true that's why oil's
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:38.160]  so much and she just said i can't comment on that i'll be fired if i do uh and she said that like
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:44.480]  three times i mean that shows just to me that there's not a lot of connection between the press
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:50.560]  secretary uh and the president or the vice president and it shows kind of like a crying out for help
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.280]  i mean the way she looked and the way she was saying it and already fly sure before saying
[2:34:55.280 --> 2:35:00.960]  yeah they put out fake terror alerts for political purposes and then they removed him the next day
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:07.920]  i mean i'm seeing just a lot of really bad signs because to have an evil government's one thing
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:14.240]  that's bad but to have one that's out of control and delusional and i'm seeing just as a layman
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:20.480]  but but i've studied quite a bit you know history i'm getting a lot of signals that things are out
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:28.480]  of control do you have any comments on that well i agree alex uh and the situation is very much
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:35.520]  similar to that before the attack on iraq um on the day that colin pal spoke at the u n
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:41.200]  we veteran intelligence professionals for sanity issued our first corporate memorandum
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:47.440]  and we finished up by saying mr president we strongly advise that you brought in the circle
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:52.640]  of your advisors beyond those already bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:59.040]  and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic now
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:05.520]  we could see at that point in time that the key was this little tight circle of advisors of whom
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:10.880]  only colin pal knew which end was up really and we know what we know what he was worth and in
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:17.360]  final analysis and now we're we have an even tighter circle where we know the president
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:22.160]  doesn't read the newspapers daniel perino says well you know i can't act like i'll be fired
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:27.360]  and then when the president himself as i started mentioned before two months ago when he gets up
[2:36:27.360 --> 2:36:30.880]  before press conference somebody said well what do you think about the prospect of maybe four
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:36.800]  dollars a gallon and he looked shocked he said well wait a second where'd you get that and
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:41.120]  and it had been in the news like for the week previous well i'll have to ask my advisors
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:45.200]  about that because that's the first order about this well what are you paying at the pump now alex
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:50.960]  six four dollars right up four dollars so the guy is detached from reality he's uninformed
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:58.000]  and we know we know that cheney is able to keep the information flow to him and away from him so
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:04.240]  what he's being told with respect to weapons from from iran and southern iraq for example
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:11.840]  twelve days after it was clear that those recent charges by patrice and others will bogus the
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:17.520]  president is still telling the world openly that we're catching them we're catching those guys
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:22.480]  given those weapons to iranian insurgents and when we get them we're going to get them we know
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:27.600]  well that pursue them well that brings me to my next question i know you follow the news i'm glad
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:30.560]  you did pick up on that the white house press secretary story because i thought that was just
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:36.240]  amazing to me and there's so many other indicators that are the same uh or similar and that was a
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:42.960]  month ago whenever mccain was in uh baghdad and then surrounding uh you know capitals of other
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:50.000]  countries and he kept saying iran is funding al-qaeda iran is al-qaeda and everybody knows
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  they're shiites i mean that's that that's the opposite warring faction you know the two main
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.560]  branches of islam and then the and then sigh hers four years ago and then the white house last
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:03.520]  year admitted with their funding three different wahhabist groups attacking one of them headed
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:09.520]  up with a number three in al-qaeda and so here's our government or the the the executive funding
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:15.600]  al-qaeda to attack and blow up mosque and shoot people in iran suing us over it and then meanwhile
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:22.480]  but then mccain comes back and in a senate arm services committee says to betray us i mean
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:27.520]  betray us excuse me i just love the nickname betray us and says isn't it true that iran
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:33.200]  it funds al-qaeda and he said yes they're al-qaeda i mean this is a this is the propaganda is insane
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:41.760]  yeah problem is that uh normal americans you know they kick their shoes off in the evening and
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:46.640]  coming into fox news and they think they're getting the streets story we have to find
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:52.640]  imaginative ways to grab them by the collar of these these phonies and say look look betray us
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:59.520]  told us last october that there is absolutely no doubt that iranians are funding supporting
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:05.920]  giving weapons to and training his insurgents in in southern iraq well what proof has he
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:12.960]  of that he has none and this last fiasco which the mainstream press just kind of you know
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:18.480]  ignored for two weeks here's the mainstream press told hey we're gonna have a big press conference
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:23.360]  we're going to show you those Iranian weapons two weeks later well it's been canceled no story
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:30.080]  there give me one break in some respects alex the captive press here the control press is more
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:37.360]  controlled now than in the lead up to the war in iraq well here's an example they're having a 125
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:43.840]  world leaders meet to settle out of policy at the builder group coming up to chantilly outside
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:48.960]  dc through the fifth through the eighth i'll be going and just six seven years ago the media
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:52.480]  said it didn't exist now they admit that a lot of policy gets set there in the logan act it's
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:57.920]  violated and things like that happen uh but we have from inside bill deberg they don't normally
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:03.440]  meet in the us but every five years they're meeting uh here in north america again uh because
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:09.760]  they're saying we have the most controlled press and and and that the police will ban protest and
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:15.520]  so now elites are meeting here because we have less freedoms than europe i mean this is
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:22.720]  i mean that's something else that's just amazing to me that this type of stuff is going on you
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:30.560]  know alex the the parallel with with europe is very unsettling if you look at the at the
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:37.040]  parallel between the burning of the livestock the german parliament in 1933 and what happened at
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:45.360]  9 11 you can see that the germans uh reacted to that uh in a very very passive way uh they said
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:50.560]  well uh you know if terrorists and that was that that was the word used okay with these
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:55.760]  particular terrorists were accused of being communists but it was if terrorists uh burned
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:02.080]  the right stock down then we accept as a matter of course the telephone calls we intercepted
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:07.600]  that our decks desks would be broken into uh that a mail will be read it's just you know
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:11.760]  all the duty all the responsibilities the government had toward us and the constitution
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:18.080]  well they can be put in abeyance now we know what happened it was that was 1933 and hitler was able
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:24.160]  to hold away for the next few years against this passivity and what we have in our country is very
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:29.760]  similar today that ask your neighbor do you mind if your telephone calls are being monitored
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:33.440]  and you know what they'll say well you know what they'll say it's a well i don't mind because i'm
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:38.720]  not talk i'm not talking to us i'm a bin laden oh can you yeah they don't understand that they've
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:43.680]  used the patriot act hundreds of thousands of times and non-terror related they don't understand
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:48.720]  that the greatest threat isn't some guys in a cave even if the 9 11 attacks were really orchestrated
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:54.320]  by them hypothetically the greater threat is giving up our whole way of life for something
[2:41:54.320 --> 2:41:59.520]  that you have a better chance of dying from a peanut allergy or being struck by lightning or
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.080]  drowning or then you do have been killed by a terrorist and now they're training the austin
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:10.320]  police and albuquerque police and other police the feds are in roadside bomb detection i mean
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:17.520]  it's it's a hoax can you speak to that well yes i can you know just take the eavesdropping here
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:23.760]  which is probably going on as you and i speak so to speak oh no doubt now you know people need to
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:30.800]  know that uh the very reason that the faisal law the foreign intelligence surveillance act
[2:42:30.800 --> 2:42:37.680]  was put into effect in 1978 was to prevent the kind of thing that jago was doing as a matter
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:43.840]  of course not only to citizens like us but the senators represented the presidents okay now
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:48.720]  you may not you know your neighbor may not care if your phone is being tapped but
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:54.160]  do you care if Nancy Pelosi's phone is being tapped do you care if other democratic leaders
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:58.720]  are candidates that their phones are being tapped let me stop you this is not hypothetical
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.480]  it's come out the nixon obviously and clinton and now bush senior and all of them spy on each other
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:11.120]  but to give a monolithic homeland security boy how fascist is that the power to spy it just came out
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:21.200]  that mi6 and mi5 tony blair has had them spying on the house of commons and lords for political power
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:26.240]  and they've been using it to burn their enemies that is that is i mean we know they're going to do
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:32.240]  that and that gives the executive incredible power to set up a dictatorship please please comment on
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:38.400]  that well that's exactly why they put that law in and that's exactly why uh bush and cheney decided
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:44.480]  to to circumvent that law you know take take this general michael hayden okay he's head
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:49.840]  of the national security agency and the president or actually was cheney goes to him and said now
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:55.760]  we know that the first commandment over there at nsa is thou shalt not eavesdrop on americans
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:44:00.160]  but we got this terrorist threat now and we're going to do precisely that are you with us are you
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:07.440]  on our team general hayden now one of general hayden's predecessors told me that his saying yes
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:13.200]  to that he should have been court marshal because that's a violation of the law that's a violation
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:18.880]  of the supreme law and that that he should have been court marshal instead he saw well yeah i suppose
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:22.960]  i could do that and what are they gonna stop you again let me stop you again they always they
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:27.440]  always escalate they always push the envelope till there's nothing holding back anything now
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:32.800]  you're not that's not hyperbole that he should be court marshaled arrested they're having to go back
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:39.120]  and pass laws which themselves are unconstitutional retroactively so all these companies and people
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:46.000]  don't go to jail go ahead yeah well that of course is a great danger i'm i'm delighted that for once
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:50.960]  for the one and only time recently the democrats have been able to prevent that from happening
[2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:56.000]  so far but you know that's just one of these retroactive immunity things the thing that
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:45:02.560]  bothers me the most is the president forcing congress uh just before the congress changed hands
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:09.120]  to give him and all his minions retroactive immunity for torture and that came in the so
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:17.280]  called military commissions act signed in october of 1996 just before congress changed and what it
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:22.400]  did was say well uh whatever the president or others have done with respect to torture well
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:27.040]  they shall be held harmless just like they're trying to hold harmless the telecommunications
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:33.600]  giant and then once and then once that president said you have the furor precept of what nixon
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:39.920]  said he said it's not illegal when the president does it yeah well used to be and uh unless we
[2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:45.600]  get some spine into congressman unless we get a wholesale change and you know it's dubious but
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:50.400]  at least we get some change coming early next year uh you know there's not much hope for us
[2:45:50.400 --> 2:45:55.920]  that's why my focus is right now on preventing a new war because the new war you know one of
[2:45:55.920 --> 2:46:01.120]  their calculations could well be alex that the new war could help john mccain become president
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:07.680]  that is scary yeah he i mean he's got post-traumatic stress disorder he flies off the handle for no
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:13.440]  reason they they say it's been reported multiple times daily and i don't i mean it's one thing
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:17.120]  to have a hothead if you're a talk show host but i don't think you should be president uh
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:22.880]  it now i want to run through a couple quick questions here uh with you what do other not
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:28.240]  just people in your uh veterans uh veteran intelligence group for sanity but when you
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:32.800]  talk to other colleagues and other people you worked with in the nsa cia defense intelligence
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:38.240]  you know uh being in and around all those people i i mean are they i'm getting a sense from just
[2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:43.360]  reading and talking to people and other guests that that the government finally is freaked out
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:48.000]  and says man it's one thing to be corrupted one thing to be out of control in a big government
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.280]  but it's another thing to really be the bad guys and that they now see that the whole system may
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:47:00.720]  be wrecked by these people well there is that sense of question is how much power they could wield
[2:47:00.720 --> 2:47:07.520]  and without the press to replay their stories uh that power is minimal now i take some great
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:12.160]  encouragement from the fact that there are some people within integrity still working in the
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:16.400]  analytic section of cia i'm not talking about the torturers now i'm talking about the people
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:22.480]  who are trying to speak truth to power for these guys to come up and have blessed by their superiors
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:28.640]  a national intelligence estimate that goes 180 degrees betwixt what uh what bush and chenney
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:34.080]  was saying about iran's intentions to build a nuclear weapon as they did in december of last
[2:47:34.080 --> 2:47:38.240]  year that was true rebellion against the tyranny i mean that is a big split in the government
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:43.200]  for to to have the official estimates say that no there's no wmds no there's no war no we don't
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:50.400]  need a war yeah so there's that underlying basis of integrity um but that's you know that's a
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.040]  even even that has been sort of eroded their leaders mcconnell the head of the national
[2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:03.440]  intelligence and and and this despicable guy hayden i mean he makes a big speech out in
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:08.720]  oklahoma and he says well now it's my personal opinion it's my personal opinion that iran is
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:14.000]  held bent on getting a nuclear weapon well you know who cares about his personal opinion
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:20.640]  if the whole intelligence community 16 agency says iran stopped trying to do a nuclear nuclear
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:27.680]  weapons related part of this program in 2003 who cares about hayden's personal opinion and it's
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:32.720]  all been inspected they've been over the barrel they did that i mean they let him in they i mean
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:37.280]  that's what i don't usually get into a book's cover but i've watched a lot of hearings with hayden
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:41.680]  and seen a lot of him and seen him compared to the same type of person and i don't normally
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:45.680]  loathe people like i don't even loathe george bush i don't like him but there's something
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:51.360]  loathsome and something weak and and and and and and chicken neck and despotic about him and
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:56.560]  richard pearl they seem like two peas in a podge and the way he twists things and says there's no
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:00.960]  fourth amendment the fourth amendment means we can do whatever we say is reasonable i mean
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:06.560]  i think going against all of the precedent all of common law all of our tradition to just tell
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:11.360]  you know huge rooms of reporters and lawyers know we're allowed to spy on whoever we want
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:18.560]  without a warrant i mean he is i i pray i see him go to present well you know what we have
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:24.560]  there is a a martinette now he's got four stars on his shoulder and unfortunately the way you get
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:31.280]  one star these days is to just salute very smartly and say wonderful idea to the next guy up and so
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:37.440]  he's the example of the worst and uh you know there are lots of things that could be reduced to
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:43.200]  well let me just tell you a little true story here after i uh question rumsfeld down there in
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:49.040]  atlanta i was invited up to the dot show in new york okay so i'm waiting to go on and it was the
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:55.760]  period in which hayden had been nominated to be head of the cia now i had read something indicating
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:02.720]  that bobby inman the the great bobby ray inman who had enjoyed so much respect as head of nsa at
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:08.160]  one point and who was there when the fysol law was constructed and had a big hand at constructing it
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:12.960]  that at the new york public library two nights before he had said hayden clearly did something
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:17.360]  illegal here he knows better than anyone that the fysol law prohibited what he was doing
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:21.600]  it was a very sorrowful thing look at that's what that's what inman told the new york public
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:28.320]  library what happens next he arrives at lou dob show goes on before me cuts in ahead of me puts
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:33.840]  on a tie dob says what do you think of hayden and inman so i think he's supremely qualified for
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:40.000]  the job i was on next and i had i had i had i had the time i would run the government stay there

[2:53:53.200 --> 2:53:57.040]  i was talking behind the scenes for prison planet dot tv viewers was right in the government
[2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:06.400]  and uh he dropped a bombshell on me he said and our viewers he said that it's really up to israel
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:11.040]  right now on whether there's going to be an attack on iran or not both in the lobby and with
[2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:16.320]  things militarily that israel does uh they could even go back into lebanon and claim that's a
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:20.080]  threat to him and i mean anything could happen and he said in israel could stage a false flag
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:24.640]  now i you then talked about the uss liberty i want you to be able to elaborate on that you're
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:30.720]  going to hold over five minutes in the next hours we have time but uh i mean that is an
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:36.880]  amazing statement i remember in the washington post the week before 9 11 there was a pentagon
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:42.720]  analysis saying we're worried israel could stage a false flag to get us into a war in
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:49.280]  the middle east can you speak to that well yes um you know it seems terribly cynical to
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:56.160]  suggest that what uh what the president called quote our ally and quote israel would do something
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:02.880]  like that first off your listeners should realize that in a juridical sense there is no defense
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:08.080]  treaty with israel they are not our ally in any real sense of the term uh you know
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:13.520]  morally and so forth they have begun but that's not an obligation on our port to defend them
[2:55:13.520 --> 2:55:17.200]  but that's sort of an academic point as the president's promise to do per se
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:20.400]  plus they got one of the biggest militaries in the world 400 nukes
[2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:28.160]  yeah you know one boggles that the the so-called threat from one nuke from iran when they have
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:35.600]  400 but the the situation uh what what i think people really need to remember is that on the
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:43.760]  june 8th 1967 in the middle of that first war with the arabs israeli tried the israeli planes
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:50.480]  and uh and torpedo boats did their damnedest to to sink the uss liberty knowing full late full
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:58.320]  well that was u.s. naval ship they killed 34 liberties crew and wounded over 170 now we have
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:04.960]  their intercepted messages an american flag on that though you don't attack it you know we have
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:10.000]  the intercepted messages there's no doubt and by the way by the way they'd always denied that and
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:15.040]  now as you said last year nsa released the intercepts what we'd already had pilots come public
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:19.520]  and say they refused three times were ordered you attack and sink that america ship go ahead sir
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:25.680]  yeah so you know what's important for for listeners to understand is that there's no doubt that it
[2:56:25.680 --> 2:56:32.400]  was deliberate now why they would do such a thing there are some very cogent theories uh that's not
[2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:38.000]  clear in other words the uh there is some question as to why they would do that that they did it is
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:43.440]  there's no question about it and one of the things the listeners should also know is that the navy
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:51.280]  at the congress lbj mactamara everyone covered it up for decades and finally a book was written
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:57.760]  uh by a fellow named j crystal that espoused the israeli version of all this is just a
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:04.720]  terrible mistake and guess who endorsed that book the younger john mccain his father having been
[2:57:04.720 --> 2:57:09.520]  responsible for a bogus investigation of the incident itself now i'm i'm not saying the
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:17.600]  sense of the father should be visited on the sun i am saying that john mccain jr in a crash appeal
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:23.360]  to the lobby uh endorse the conclusions of this book which are clearly bogus in which the nsa
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:30.400]  intercepts now released show our country on our completely bogus the veterans such as the ones
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:37.200]  that survived the uss liberty deserve better and their story needs to be told why because it was on
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:47.760]  june 8 1967 and subsequent years the israeli government was persuaded for good reason that
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:54.000]  they could literally get away with murder and our congress and our executive and even our navy
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:58:00.240]  would not say anything about it that is a very very dangerous position to begin and be where
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:07.920]  of what might happen in the gulf ramah govern will be back in 70 seconds for the final segment

[2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:52.800]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:52.800 --> 2:59:57.040]  he did the morning briefings for multiple u.s presidents including the president's father
[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:03.760]  which means as a ci analyst they have different ties he's the one that integrated
[3:00:03.760 --> 3:00:08.640]  all the big threats together for a large picture that's the type of analysis we need
[3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:14.480]  because we try to get into my new show of each little sector it would it it's
[3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:20.240]  impossible got about five minutes left with him rey mcgovern you were just bringing up israel
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:25.600]  staging a false flag that is the elements that control israel at the time uh what is going
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:30.000]  on with israel i mean they're endangering the whole world the elite is seems to be totally
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:35.520]  power mad uh they want to get rid of iran when iran has tried to be friends with them going
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:40.480]  back for 50 years now when they could certainly work things out every time there's moderate
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:47.760]  moolahs in control they seem to freak out even more uh i mean what is this it is is this just
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:56.640]  over confidence i mean why we know alex and i think part of their problem is us you know i'm
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:02.800]  talking about elliott abram's arch neoconservative convicted convict for lying to congress during
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:07.600]  iran contra and yet running our foreign policy out of the white house a foreign policy toward
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:14.320]  that part of the world um what we're talking about here is a kind of delusional extremist fringe
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:22.800]  uh cheney abram's running this thing now they have counterparts in israel again extremist
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:28.960]  kind of lunatic fringe not the majority not only of the israelis but the israeli government
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:34.400]  and yet you know they're being sort of egging each other on thinking well we only have seven
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:40.080]  eight months left of george w bush we gotta gotta exploit his and we could be kings we could start
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:44.240]  world war three and then be the kings and then remake the world like after world war two and
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.400]  we can fix it all like that i was just about to say it seems like they egg each other on like a
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:53.600]  group of hunting dogs that get each other really excited you've ever seen that well exactly now
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:59.360]  what i'm saying here is that this is an incredibly myopic myopic view you know i care a lot about
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:06.800]  israel okay and most of the israelis i dare say most of them realize that this is a very myopic
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:13.600]  policy you know attacking lebanon as they did two summers ago that was crazy they lost okay now
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:18.320]  with his bullet is more powerful than lebanon lebanon than ever before and instead of having a
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.360]  melt multi confession with government on their border they're going to have a very hostile government
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:28.400]  similarly now they're talking with syria the alley day rooms isn't like that
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:35.040]  so there are some sensible folks in israel that have started to sort of dealing with
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:39.040]  those these folks as a sort of sort of a half measure so what do you think is going to happen
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:43.280]  we only got two minutes left what do you think is going to happen well i think that unless
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:50.000]  somebody puts a spoke in the juggernaut toward war that we will be uh we will be bombing
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:54.400]  and the missile attacking from our naval ships you run within the next two months
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:58.720]  and i think so you think that's the window is the next two to three months or
[3:02:58.720 --> 3:03:04.400]  well might that's that they guess okay i'm i'm more than fifty percent confident that's going
[3:03:04.400 --> 3:03:09.920]  to happen when it happens so you know maybe god doesn't even know but the problem is you know
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:15.760]  when you have people like kanya's or palosia other people think oh okay well well if you
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:21.280]  taxi run though we might think about impeaching well give me a break you know that that won't
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:26.400]  happen once the war started right i mean isn't this the failing forward where they know if they
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:32.080]  get us in a big enough tar baby americans will go man it doesn't matter if gas is ten dollars a gallon
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:36.720]  we got to do this for america we're getting our ass kicked by the iranians because the iranians
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:42.880]  are going to have the high ground if they counter strike right and so uh we have kind of uh the
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:48.400]  one candidate who wants to bomb bomb bomb bomb you run uh you know they may actually think that
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:54.960]  this could help that candidate then they've got the obliterate candidate well you know uh
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:59.440]  yeah it's going to be interesting these next couple of but i i think everyone needs to do
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:05.280]  something more than they have before alex say go go and go not only talk to but occupy your
[3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:10.160]  your congressman or congresswoman's or your senator's offices make sure they realize
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.840]  you know for palosian kanya's to say well now we'll impeach that indicates they have no no idea
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:21.040]  whatever of what a war with iran with with we haven't even talked about the terrorist threat i mean

[3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:19.600]  to even videotape on the street corner cops all over the country come over and say turn it off
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:25.680]  get out of here i could go to a third world country and they don't do that and i've been
[3:08:25.680 --> 3:08:30.000]  to latin american third world countries european third world countries i mean i i don't think
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:36.960]  americans realize how they've moved us into marshal law light how things have changed how
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:42.240]  the federal government was able to instruct locals to do that how this hysteria had done that uh
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:48.240]  do you have any comments on that well i do alex so you talk about marshal law light
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:57.040]  light well if anyone's looking for marshal law heavy or or black just wait until we strike iran
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:05.760]  if and when we strike iran from the air they can do in addition to the things i've already mentioned
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:12.160]  the kind of worldwide terrorism that would uh they started to say make uh make al qaeda look
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:17.840]  like you know the mount saint ursula volleyball team i mean the iranians have a worldwide capability
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:25.200]  to do real real terrorism and you can fully expect that if this happens now what do we like
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:31.280]  what likely to see in the next few weeks i think that it's going to be real hard for the americans
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:36.400]  to come up the american military to come up with enough iranian weapons to insert into southern
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:41.600]  iraq and say well we found them you know why because the iraqis are not cooperating the iraqis
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:46.720]  are talking to the iranians and the iraqi leaders are saying look we want evidence we don't want
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:51.520]  speculation about iranian weapons so what are they going to do they're going to resort to the big
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:58.160]  lie the big lie is the claim that iranians president had threatened to quote wipe israel off the map
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:05.200]  he didn't say that folks what did he say he said quote the regime occupying jerusalem must vanish
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:11.600]  from the pages of time period end quote i'll say that again the regime occupying jerusalem
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:17.600]  must vanish from the pages of time period end quote he was quoting homini okay now what is he
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:22.400]  saying he's saying that the regime occupying jerusalem in the occupied territories for the
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:28.000]  last 40 years more years than the soviets are occupied eastern europe should vanish from the
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:34.320]  pages of time i agree with that i agree with that i think they should obey the un resolution 242
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:42.080]  which we voted for back in 1967 so it's a big lie to say that what akhmed indijad was saying
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:46.560]  was he's going to wipe israel off the map or as the president so often says threatened to
[3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:51.360]  destroy israel he has done nothing of the kind and now besides all that he doesn't have the
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:58.080]  capability to do that so if we strike iran you'll be completely because our president has been
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:05.280]  has gocroft said mesmerized by the israeli leaders rama govern in closing i mean to be specific i
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:09.360]  don't want there to be a war i don't particularly like iran i like their people but you know i mean
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:13.600]  all these governments corrupt i'm not saying good guy bad guy obviously though the neocons are the
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:17.920]  bad guys if they attack uh so i'm not you know politicizing this i'm just looking at the you
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:24.000]  know the the the basic facts here and to me if iran doesn't have a capability of aircraft carriers
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:30.080]  and icbm's and whatever they're going to need to use asymmetrical warfare if a hundred two hundred
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:34.080]  a thousand there's different battle plans to blow up all their power plants blow up their
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:39.200]  bridges their their water plants anything for quote industry a total bombing of the stone age
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:45.360]  of their country mass murder i mean then any means they've got to fight back is that is i mean is
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:49.920]  that even really going to be quote terrorism in the media and the government's already said
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:54.960]  if they raise a fist to fight back it will be called terrorism and that they're then going to
[3:11:54.960 --> 3:11:59.040]  nuke them well the neocons have said is if you fight back we're going to nuke you
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:06.480]  yeah someone said once that the terrorist is a fighter without aircraft without stealth bombers
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:11.200]  you know if that's all you've got that's what you're going to use and you can be assured
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:17.040]  that attack on iran would let loose that kind of terrorism worldwide and i'm talking about worldwide
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:24.800]  and to include our country and instead of it being a fake saudi arabian us pakistan run
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:30.480]  al-cida we're talking about real terrorists we're talking about real what type of asymmetrical are
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:34.320]  we talking about people putting chlorine gas in high-rise apartments are we talking about
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:38.080]  blowing up bridges are we talking about blowing up power plants are we talking about
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:43.040]  going into malls and shooting 500 people you know i like to have to say what the germans
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:48.240]  say at this point uh... it's been you've got rocked i'm i'm overreacting i uh...
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:52.400]  i'm not a specialist in any of this and i you know i'm just guessing but this but the sky's the
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:57.040]  limit well you know i know their capability as well as their intentions in this case
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:01.760]  and their capabilities in europe in particular and in asia and to a slightly less degree in
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:09.440]  this country are as i say such as to put al-qaeda to you know to ridicule in terms of the how much
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:13.840]  the ratings could do so you know that's one reason and i think it's
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:19.920]  it's a big mistake on on iran's part but they're so damn small you know that they're so damn confident
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:24.880]  that we wouldn't possibly try to do this well in closing just look at the economy if they mine
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:31.360]  harbors if they if they uh... sink ships in canals they're in the key straits of or musa it's
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:37.200]  i mean that right there will send oil to five hundred dollars a barrel it would you know the
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:42.560]  question is whether anybody's telling bush that uh... you know he knows it's a big gas pump there
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:49.040]  in cropper and the he's got a lot of money and you know it it's an open question to me as to
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:55.280]  whether he gives a rat's ass part my my expression as to what happens after january of next year
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:59.680]  ramah governor there any particular websites for people to learn more about your organization
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.000]  and other groups you support of the best one is consortium news dot com run by robert parry

[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.600]  to say no to war uh... and and and and i guess get that estimate out that they aren't a threat
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:53.120]  uh... and not poke this sleeping uh... tiger

[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:01.920]  allowed to be part of the parade
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:05.040]  well let me clarify that we are the veterans for peace
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:08.720]  washington dc area chapter and uh... we have
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:12.800]  been in contact with this group um... american veterans center is the one that
[3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:16.880]  is sponsoring the parade and if you go to their website you will see such
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:19.040]  entities as um...
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:24.320]  lockheed martin uh... racy on khaki cac i which is a huge uh...
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:27.120]  subcontractor here in the washington dc area
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:31.040]  the national welfare association is also one of the sponsors and at one time i
[3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:32.000]  believe
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:34.800]  the government of kawaii was listed on their website as a sponsor
[3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:36.560]  okay sir sir sir you're here
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:40.400]  i'm just puzzled as to why they think groups like that do not have a
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:42.000]  political viewpoint but we do
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.800]  sure your phone's a little overdriven back off of it a bit so we can hear you
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:45.440]  clearly
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:47.920]  yeah they've got all these clearly political groups there
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:51.760]  but they play this game of oh we're not being political no first amendment for
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:53.280]  you
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:57.200]  that's exactly right and if you are also looking in past um...
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:17:00.640]  uh... parade here this this group american veterans center has a lot of
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:04.880]  groups like um... revolutionary war and actors active duty
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:07.680]  military groups to march and if and if those guys
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:11.840]  um... are not said to be carrying a political message and i do not
[3:17:11.840 --> 3:17:13.760]  understand why veterans for peace
[3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:17.840]  which opposes all wars and wants to let american people know the true cost of
[3:17:17.840 --> 3:17:22.480]  wars not only in dollar amounts which is in excess of one trillion dollars
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:26.400]  and moving upward very rapidly but we're also concerned about the four
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:30.000]  thousand plus uh... dead american service men
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:33.360]  and women and also the thirty thousand plus injuries
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:36.960]  uh... sustained by those troops as well as the family members who suffer from
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:40.080]  single loved ones out killed or injured and uh...
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:44.560]  the resources either from the military medical facilities and the veterans
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:45.760]  administration
[3:17:45.760 --> 3:17:48.320]  medical facilities are not adequate
[3:17:48.320 --> 3:17:51.680]  uh... very very very not even very close to being adequate to well mister
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:54.960]  marcello these injuries mister marcello the numbers we've got traumatic
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:57.040]  stress disorder with sure
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:00.880]  sure they don't count people who die outside country as you know so it's more
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:03.040]  like eighteen thousand now
[3:18:03.040 --> 3:18:06.080]  uh... dead troops and more like a hundred thousand injured so your
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:07.520]  numbers may be a little different
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:10.240]  the ones i've fared it out but even those official numbers
[3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:13.360]  are incredible plus we're five plus years into this
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:17.000]  i bet money if you guys try to go out there without the permit
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:20.440]  i bet they're gonna arrest you but maybe that's the attention we need are you
[3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:22.040]  still going to try to go out and
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:24.720]  be handing out flyers or educating people
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:27.640]  uh... what we're still talking about that right now we have some emails and
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:32.640]  some phone calls among members of our chapter and we haven't really
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:36.520]  started anything yet but uh... i know last year
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:37.840]  uh... in
[3:18:37.840 --> 3:18:41.600]  boston and last year i think it was in southern california want to see
[3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:45.160]  Santa Barbara maybe but two of our veterans for peace chapters were not
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:47.720]  allowed to march in veterans day parades
[3:18:47.720 --> 3:18:50.960]  uh... there's another chapter in washington state that is not allowed
[3:18:50.960 --> 3:18:53.520]  to march in this year's moral day parade so
[3:18:53.520 --> 3:18:56.480]  this is not an isolated incident and that's that's why we're trying to
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:59.320]  well yes sir stay there stay there i want to come back with another
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:01.560]  i want to stay there and then come up with another segment
[3:19:01.560 --> 3:19:03.560]  but the key here is
[3:19:03.560 --> 3:19:06.200]  a year and a half ago the poll was seventy one percent
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:09.640]  gallup poll of u.s. troops pulled in iraq or against the war the numbers
[3:19:09.640 --> 3:19:13.120]  more like eighty percent in other polls that have been regional around bases
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:16.920]  so they're also creating an illusion that the majority of troops are for the
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:17.760]  war
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:20.520]  with these fraudulent events for the general public
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:22.800]  so i'm gonna get your comment on that
[3:19:22.800 --> 3:19:27.880]  you represent the majority of veterans who are for this stinking war
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:31.000]  you got a percent of american people against it as well so again it's all
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:32.880]  part of this minority
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:38.880]  for forcing their view and their fraud on us and trying to borrow us equal access
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:40.080]  as veterans
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:42.240]  so it's all part of discrimination
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:45.520]  discriminate discrimination i can't say it
[3:19:45.520 --> 3:19:49.080]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:53.080]  in a ph balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly

[3:19:57.840 --> 3:20:01.360]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of

[3:20:08.840 --> 3:20:13.000]  human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:17.280]  are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline
[3:20:17.280 --> 3:20:18.040]  environment
[3:20:18.040 --> 3:20:21.720]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and
[3:20:21.720 --> 3:20:26.440]  doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now

[3:24:25.480 --> 3:24:28.360]  are bad and world government's good and these are good folks that are against
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:31.640]  the war in the new world order in many respects but regardless if i agree with
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:35.160]  them or disagree the vast majority of veterans are against the war the vast
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:38.200]  majority of troops are against the war all the polls show that
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:43.000]  and uh but no they can't be involved because that would shatter the illusion
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:47.160]  uh that the war is tied somehow to being patriotic
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:50.600]  when the people running the war halliburton have moved to dubai and
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:54.360]  cheney's got a house in dubai and the bushes want in paraglade and they're
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:58.520]  destroying the u.s uh their puppets for the new world order but they're doing it
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:02.360]  uh michael you've got a few minutes left and closing tell us about your website
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:04.760]  your group and any ideas on what you'll be
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:08.680]  planning on veterans day while the rest of americans are out or not veterans day
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:12.040]  memorial day while the rest of americans are out dodging uh
[3:25:12.040 --> 3:25:16.440]  police under federal funding sucking our blood for blood test
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:25.320]  uh well our website is www.vfpdc.org and um if you go online there there was a
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:29.400]  poll uh within the last day or two in the local paper about this and about
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:32.680]  three quarters of the folks are in favor of us marching in the parade so please
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:35.320]  go to our website and add your vote to that tally
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:39.800]  um right now we are still discussing if we want to just go as spectators
[3:25:39.800 --> 3:25:44.520]  and stand on the sideline uh and um hold our veterans for peace banner and
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:46.680]  another sign that said kick out a parade
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:50.040]  we know that we there will be some media that way and we were hoping that we
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:53.320]  will get our message across uh in in that manner in a calm
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:57.800]  now i wonder if enforcers who believe the first amendment is evil
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:01.160]  will come over and tell you that you're not allowed to do that youtube that get
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:04.680]  me and keep those cameras rolling 24 seven
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:07.960]  yeah we're gonna we're gonna try to see if we can get some folks with uh video
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:10.280]  cams and and that kind of stuff out there on uh
[3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:14.680]  on monday and and see what happened but uh so far all the most of the responses
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:17.640]  that we've got from being on top shows the last couple days have been very
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:21.400]  positive and uh we're gratified that the american people can see through the
[3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:25.080]  um stories and the lies and but that doesn't matter there
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:28.280]  their officers have now been taught that freedom and the first amendment is
[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:31.880]  evil so look out uh that that's my point how do people
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:34.680]  contact you who aren't even part of veterans for peace to come out and
[3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:39.080]  videotape support you you know kind of be observers of enemy operations

[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:26.120]  wants to put in a job application because they have thousands of
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:29.640]  servants in there for the summer getting the grove ready and for the
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:33.960]  15-day encampment and you want to talk to him so i called him and he said yeah i

[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:39.960]  there and i said man this is serious this isn't a
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:43.080]  joke they will set you up they will kill you and he's like well you got it and
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:48.200]  you were okay and i said yeah i am a public figure and it's it's harder
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:50.440]  for them to kill me doesn't mean they may not
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:55.080]  i said they've killed other people uh they have uh arrested other people
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:58.600]  and i said this is very serious and i said so i'm not telling you to do it but
[3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:01.320]  i said and i said i'm gonna get involved with you either
[3:37:01.320 --> 3:37:04.200]  and i know jack wasn't really either like well this is my volunteer web guy for
[3:37:04.200 --> 3:37:07.640]  a few years but he said better call alex jones he's been in there
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:10.840]  sure enough i get sent these memory sticks with video
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:16.280]  of inside the uh chalet where they hatched the manhattan project star wars
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:19.400]  cold war so much of it and that's they brag about that
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:24.440]  uh the image of the child they burned uh you know so much and i made order of
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:29.880]  death and you knew him as kyle and uh so i mean
[3:37:29.880 --> 3:37:33.080]  it was serious when i stuck in in 2000 it was serious when he stuck in and was
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:38.120]  working there and secretly shot video in 2005 now
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:43.960]  then a years later and then jack can go over the timeline here in the time we
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:47.720]  have with the basics i'm just giving you the background here
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:50.840]  you knew him as kyle the few times he was a guest on the show and i didn't even
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:53.320]  want to do that because i knew they could get voice print if he'd been in the
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:37:57.640]  military and things and
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:03.480]  i uh you know i had him on put the film out and then he showed neighbors and
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:06.040]  gave the whole neighborhood like we recommend copies of my film and the
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:10.280]  film he was in and then teenagers came over 14 15
[3:38:10.280 --> 3:38:14.120]  year olds he gave them copies and they were and it turned into like a witch
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:16.600]  hunt in the neighborhood they said he is killing
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:20.120]  this child in front of an idol they came and arrested him to investigate if he'd
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:24.200]  killed the child at behemian grove this is insane
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:28.680]  i mean understand the film he's giving people's aired on national television
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:32.120]  okay uh and the cops come and arrest him and he was convicted
[3:38:32.120 --> 3:38:37.560]  they said that showing 14 year olds and we've got all the court documents that
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:42.040]  that that that was a point apart a type of child abuse
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:45.640]  and they said we're targeting you and then and he didn't want to come on air a
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:48.840]  year ago when they started the court trial and the proceedings
[3:38:48.840 --> 3:38:51.400]  because he thought well i'll beat it this is ridiculous and he went in court
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:56.360]  and they showed the film and admitted that uh it was about this and admitted
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:38:59.560]  that and wouldn't let a lot of other stuff in and just said you're going to
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:04.360]  jail for this video now kelly rushing gave a ron paul video to a state police
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:06.440]  officer in kentucky this was in the newspaper
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:09.320]  they arrested him and said the ron paul speech was threatening
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:12.760]  and they went to trial and he was facing three years in jail
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:16.440]  uh for for two counts the ron paul video on the same tape was one of my films
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:20.040]  but they said the ron paul video i called the judge it was in the news
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:25.640]  and they tried to prosecute him so this is insane but but but this happened
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:29.320]  and so he got you that footage he got me that footage he went in
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:33.000]  on his own recognizance and now he's in deep trouble in jail
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:37.800]  jack mclean thanks for coming on with us hey brother good to be here
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:42.920]  great yeah very very important too we here at our two police and military
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:46.520]  associations are very worried about chris because
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:52.280]  uh just the other day oh i guess you know um when they first arrested him
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:55.960]  the inner powerful internationalist and um
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:59.960]  and politicians who came after him after
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:03.960]  recording their bohenium grove came after him through the court system and
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:07.560]  the first time they arrested him they took him down to
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:12.520]  theolacey jail there in uh orange california
[3:40:12.520 --> 3:40:16.600]  and the prison guards yelled to all the prisoners
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:23.880]  this man chris jones has f two little boys and uh they they yelled that out
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:27.400]  to all the prisoners and so they caught chris in the shower and beat him
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:31.800]  almost to death the prisoners did and that was all a
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:36.200]  staged event and now he's in jail down at the theolacey
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:40.040]  jail uh and we're in contact with the sheriff's
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:45.640]  uh assistance and sheriff there and uh telling him of our great concern that
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:49.400]  he's our brother he's been our webmaster for years he's a christian
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:55.320]  kid and he's he's really a good guy loves america loves loves this country
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:40:58.840]  and well i mean i've met him a few times in california at events he's really
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:01.320]  classy nice guy works for a good company
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:04.200]  uh you know nice girlfriend goes to church and i know
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:07.560]  i mean let's just bring it up mark dice goes to the same church with their
[3:41:07.560 --> 3:41:11.480]  girlfriends uh to church but but but the thing is
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:14.840]  that what he was convicted of was giving a video
[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:17.880]  to children which is aired on national television
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:22.840]  yeah he was convicted of three charges matter of fact out of six they charged
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:28.040]  him with six uh charges and they had to drop three because the young boys
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:31.240]  that he babysitted for eight nine years ago
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:36.040]  they said he molested these kids and they took these kids in the room like i've
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:39.640]  seen them doing the phoenix police department and child protective
[3:41:39.640 --> 3:41:44.520]  services comes in and and really psychologically beats the kids up
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:47.720]  until they finally yeah they i mean they'll keep them two days without food
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:51.160]  and water until they say that yeah exactly and yeah
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:55.400]  yeah and so uh that's what they did to the kids but when they the kids got the
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:59.560]  trial they got up and said that he never touched us
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:04.040]  he never did anything wrong to us and it just ticked the judge
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:08.200]  the criminal judge and the criminal prosecutor are so bad that they now jack
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:11.000]  jack i want to go back i want to stop me cover all the facts
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:14.520]  this started he was first arrested because i have all the court documents
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:19.560]  right or some of me sent me uh where where they said it was a video of a
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:22.600]  snuff film of burning a baby to an idol so that was the
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:27.320]  original arrest and they said he gave neighborhood kids a 1415 the video
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:30.600]  and then later they brought it like you said most this got dropped
[3:42:30.600 --> 3:42:34.040]  but i mean this is the insanity but but you're talking about then later stuff
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:38.120]  where they even went back i mean this was a right a a a hit job
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:41.960]  yeah eight nine years ago and these go ahead teenagers today
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:46.440]  and they they they told the truth on the on the witness stand but
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:49.880]  the judge had purposely stacked the jury
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:55.560]  uh luckily former fbi agent special agent in charge ted gunnerson sat in on
[3:42:55.560 --> 3:42:59.400]  the whole trial and then i've been in a conference over this
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:03.560]  uh and he told me that the judge when they selected the jury
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:08.120]  uh alex uh there was a guy in there that said he wanted to personally kill
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:12.440]  chris because of the charges against him and the judge says does that mean you
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:16.600]  can't be uh unbiased and serve on the jury
[3:43:16.600 --> 3:43:21.080]  and the guy says well i'll try judge and he says okay you're on the jury
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:25.800]  and so the judge just stacked the jury with people that were absolute idiot
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:30.280]  now let's go back i interrupted when you brought up the point about uh
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:33.720]  when the when the young man got up and said no it's all lies he didn't do anything
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:37.880]  to us what happened next well they they found a
[3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:42.040]  kid that had been accused of child molestation
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:48.280]  that chris had babysitted and um the guy got on the witness stand he's a
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:52.120]  teenager now too and uh he's a i guess he's a
[3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:55.320]  pedophile but they wouldn't let the jury know that but chris
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:43:59.960]  told me that and uh and the kid said that
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:03.400]  they were they they got into a raffling match and
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:09.800]  and pulled their pants down and chris sat down on the couch and he had a bulge
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:14.200]  bulge in his pants well chris says whenever you sit down with a loose
[3:44:14.200 --> 3:44:19.000]  pair of jeans on if they're not form fitting you have a bulge right there
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:23.720]  yeah that's the court record so so when he stood up when he stood up it was gone
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:26.920]  and so he was convicted for a bulge in his pants i mean
[3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:31.400]  even their star witness says he had a bulge in his pants this is the conviction
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:35.320]  that's it meanwhile cps and we have the court record meanwhile cps is flying
[3:44:35.320 --> 3:44:37.960]  little kids out to israel and saudi arabia right now
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:41.720]  yes that's right this is the new richard white house to
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:46.920]  uh into the capital for pedophilia you know and barney franken have
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:50.440]  14 year olds in his house running a brothel and that's okay
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:54.200]  but but but now now again jack this all started over the grove
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:58.440]  when they this all they all came and said you've got a video of a baby being
[3:44:58.440 --> 3:45:02.600]  killed right and then once it started they set him up
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:06.440]  uh huh yeah the they're they're really angry at chris
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:10.520]  and they're gonna i guess try to kill him in prison and here's how we know it
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:16.520]  they've sent a a shill in as his his uh were cellmate
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:21.640]  a um a stooge for the government and that guy got in the cell with chris here
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:26.200]  a few days ago and started telling him the same things to him about his
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:29.880]  homosexuality and everything chris's homosexuality
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:34.440]  and chris told him to be quiet and he refused to do it he kept hammering on
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:38.200]  chris and hammering on chris and so uh he couldn't
[3:45:38.200 --> 3:45:43.000]  get chris to get up and fight him so he yelled out through the bars
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:50.200]  that chris was going to give uh a sexual favor to everybody in the prison
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:53.960]  and so chris threw his three inch little pencil
[3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:57.880]  at the guy and hit him in the back with his three inch low pencil
[3:45:57.880 --> 3:46:03.880]  and he says assault assault guards uh uh chris just assaulted me i want to
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:06.920]  file charges on him well the guards came down and
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:11.080]  they uh they told him to sit down shut up that there was nothing to it
[3:46:11.080 --> 3:46:14.360]  because it was just a three inch little piece of pencil they only allow them
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:18.360]  to have those short low pencils you know and so
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:23.080]  then he said to chris i'm gonna get my buddies together we're gonna kill you
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:27.080]  now he's already been beaten half to death yeah he already been beaten half to
[3:46:27.080 --> 3:46:30.200]  death he was beat unconscious unconscious there
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:35.000]  when they first arrested him and so chris got scared and told his mom about it
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:37.240]  and their mom got a hold of us here at our
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:40.760]  two police and military association so i contacted
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:44.280]  the sheriff right away jack can we give numbers out
[3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:47.880]  um concerning this because i want to give some phone numbers out
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:51.240]  yeah the reason i asked to come on is very important
[3:46:51.240 --> 3:46:56.600]  alex that we've got the judge david thompson and we'd like everybody to
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:00.360]  mail just a a sentence or a paragraph to the judge
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:05.400]  asking the judge to let chris out because his life's in danger but but i mean
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:08.680]  how can i mean to be clear let's give the numbers out how can he do that i
[3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:10.920]  mean i i don't have all the stuff in front of me
[3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:14.840]  here how long is he going to be in jail what's the procedure now
[3:47:14.840 --> 3:47:19.000]  uh three years the judge just gave him three years in prison
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:23.240]  but he's under appeal for a quote appeal right now all right we'd like to
[3:47:23.240 --> 3:47:27.880]  have him let out during his appeal absolutely uh but well he never left
[3:47:27.880 --> 3:47:31.160]  i mean this went on for a year right but i mean this is the incredible part
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:34.920]  god with no criminal record uh and that he's been convicted of having a
[3:47:34.920 --> 3:47:38.840]  bulge in his pants nine years ago which is made up and it all began with him
[3:47:38.840 --> 3:47:42.600]  saying he killed a baby in front of an idol because neighbors saw the video and
[3:47:42.600 --> 3:47:45.800]  called the cops i mean is that what happens jack once the cops come they're
[3:47:45.800 --> 3:47:50.920]  just going to set you up or what well the the they have special cops like
[3:47:50.920 --> 3:47:55.400]  they did in the phoenix police department that they know will commit any crime
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:59.080]  and will do anything they're told to do ordered to do
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:02.680]  because that's who's promoted up through the ranks anybody that's
[3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:06.040]  totally committed to shooting their mother for a nickel and taking bets on
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:09.640]  which way she'll fall are promoted up through the ranks and the good
[3:48:09.640 --> 3:48:13.400]  officers with high moral character are never get promoted
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:18.760]  today in law enforcement and so they they always get these officers to go in
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:22.120]  and to commit these crimes against people like chris
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:26.520]  and they'll do anything say anything and follow orders exactly
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:29.960]  yeah there's no doubt that they have come after him and i told him how dangerous
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:33.080]  it was you know people won't realize how dangerous this
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:35.640]  is infiltrating the grove and him getting a job there
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:38.680]  everybody's giggling and laughing saying they're going to go get jobs there
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:41.800]  just be i'm not trying to scare you away from it folks but you remember jack when

[3:50:49.400 --> 3:50:52.280]  government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be
[3:50:52.280 --> 3:50:56.360]  the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years for the last three
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:50:59.480]  years the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce and
[3:50:59.480 --> 3:51:03.080]  it has now finally caught up with us in the u.s commodities such as flour and
[3:51:03.080 --> 3:51:06.200]  rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:09.960]  another four to five months it's fall in the southern hemisphere and many
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:12.680]  countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have
[3:51:12.680 --> 3:51:17.080]  stopped exporting certain commodities altogether remember our trade deficit
[3:51:17.080 --> 3:51:20.280]  trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing
[3:51:20.280 --> 3:51:24.600]  in to buy our food production at any price by late summer if not early fall
[3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:27.960]  it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports
