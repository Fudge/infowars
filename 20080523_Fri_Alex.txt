[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:05.511]  Well, my friends, we have quite a radio show lined up for you today.
[00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:36.290]  Quite a broadcast on this Friday edition, 23rd day of May 2008.
[00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:50.174]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster on all of the accelerating loss in the value of the dollar, exploding oil prices well above, well above $130 a barrel.
[00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:56.116]  And we got Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan, gave him his daily briefings, also George Bush Sr.
[00:00:57.048 --> 00:01:07.552]  He'll be joining us to talk about the police state, the venomous propaganda against Iran, the war drums, Israel saying the U.S.
[00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:12.073]  will be attacking by the end of this year before Bush leaves office.
[00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:14.714]  That means just in the next seven months or so.
[00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:18.753]  So it's all coming up today.
[00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:32.084]  And then Jack McClam, I know he's been on twice the last couple months, but he's on today because people always wondered who it was who snuck in two years ago and got new footage of Bohemian Grove.
[00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:44.375]  And it was Jack McClam's volunteer webmaster, who for many years had been the webmaster for his Aid in the Bed police and military against the New World War website.
[00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:44.495]  And
[00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:47.678]  His name is Chris Jones.
[00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:50.319]  We always called him Kyle, particularly his name.
[00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.021]  He worked in the Grove one year, and then he tried to get hired back again.
[00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:58.402]  They started harassing him and threatening him.
[00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:04.245]  The police came to his house in Southern California, arrested him, set him up, and I have the court transcripts.
[00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.186]  I have all... I have what they charged him with.
[00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:08.026]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:08.927]  He went to jail.
[00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:09.987]  He was convicted.
[00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:11.208]  He thought, oh, this is a free country.
[00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:11.928]  I'll go to jail.
[00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:20.927]  He showed some neighbor teenagers, he gave them a copy of Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and said, that's a mock human sacrifice.
[00:02:20.927 --> 00:02:24.488]  And the state of California said, yeah.
[00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:28.469]  They said he showed them a video and claimed it was a snuff film.
[00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.229]  He didn't.
[00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.710]  He said, this is a film of a mock sacrifice.
[00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170]  He gave them a copy of my film.
[00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.771]  They arrested him for that and said that it was a form of
[00:02:40.707 --> 00:03:08.884]  uh... pedophilia and he was going he's gone to prison and we didn't want to embarrass the guy or talk about it or cover it uh... until this uh... I mean it's dangerous to expose these people and people sit there and make up lies and say they let him into the grove they let him go in there and cover it and I've said on air you know I snuck in they questioned me I mean I guess in some weird twist of fate they might have uh... you know without me knowing uh... let me film and get it out but they were hopping mad I got death threats when I got out with it
[00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:11.332]  I got all sorts of threats.
[00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.134]  They were very upset.
[00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:16.316]  Others said the video wasn't real.
[00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:24.582]  Didn't Matter of the Grove told World of Wonder that made the production that aired on the British TV, Japanese, German, and then the U.S.
[00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:27.424]  aired more than 40, 50 times last time I checked.
[00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:32.548]  They said, you know, the film, no, he snuck in, he did videotape this, it is real, but his interpretation is different than ours.
[00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.441]  You know, I went to a lot of risk to do that, and people just say, no, it's not.
[00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:42.892]  Either it's not real, like Carl Wigglesworth in San Antonio on KTSA always says, and others nationally have said it.
[00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:46.841]  New York Times said I made it up and claimed it.
[00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.142]  That was in 2001, though.
[00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.462]  They said Bilderberg didn't exist either.
[00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.883]  Of course, they attend it sometimes.
[00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.583]  But Chris, I said, Chris, don't go in there.
[00:03:55.583 --> 00:04:05.265]  Jack McClam called me and he said, I've got a guy that does my website and, you know, I don't have time to manage this, but do you want to have him sneak in?
[00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.125]  He says he's going to go get a job there and do it.
[00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.926]  And I said, let me talk to him.
[00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:11.626]  And I said, sir, this is very dangerous.
[00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:16.445]  I said, you certainly don't want to tell anybody who you are, or you want to be very public.
[00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:20.146]  You need to either be a talk show host in a high profile, or be secretive.
[00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:22.807]  And I said, stop telling people.
[00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:24.968]  I said, stop, you know, telling people at parties.
[00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:26.129]  Stop, you know.
[00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.250]  I said, these are dangerous people.
[00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:40.875]  And he gave neighbor teenagers, when he was 14 year old, a copy of the film, and the police came and arrested him, and it was, he's gone to prison for a copy, just like Kelly Rushing was arrested for a Ron Paul video.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.145]  Uh, in a 40-minute speech he gave before the House of Representatives.
[00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:48.067]  And the police, I mean, it was in the newspaper.
[00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:50.309]  They said Ron Paul's illegal.
[00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:52.151]  I mean, this country is far gone, folks.
[00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.654]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.654 --> 00:04:56.076]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:56.076 --> 00:04:58.899]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:03.304]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:06.599]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.383]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:12.568]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:19.898]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:28.371]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:32.233]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.795]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:35.956]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.956 --> 00:05:36.756]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:38.017]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:38.998]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:40.159]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:05:51.686 --> 00:05:52.707]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.948 --> 00:06:02.874]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:02.874 --> 00:06:08.037]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:19.145]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:25.329]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:31.593]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:32.633]  What about you?

[00:06:56.547 --> 00:07:07.595]  Did you know that in the 1970s, Senior Scholastic magazine for high school showed students walking down the halls with barcodes on their foreheads or in their right hand?
[00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:12.778]  The article was telling the young people then about the New World Order economic system.
[00:07:12.778 --> 00:07:15.080]  No more coins, cash, or checks.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.543]  Only instant transfer of money from your bank account to the retailer's account.
[00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:26.044]  By use of scanners, which you run your hand or the barcode over.
[00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:30.006]  Or a chip in the right hand or in the forehead.
[00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:39.230]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and offer you a one year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:07:55.473 --> 00:08:02.118]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:05.101]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:23.116]  Okay, Bob Chapman in one hour, Ray McGovern in the third hour, fourth hour, Jack McClam with his webmaster being imprisoned, convicted.
[00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:24.257]  I've read the court record.
[00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:25.658]  I read the charges.
[00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:28.101]  This is like a year ago when it first happened.
[00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:30.684]  I was just talking about it to Chris Jones.
[00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:33.650]  Uh, who snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.652]  Well, he worked there for a summer, is what happened.
[00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:38.253]  He infiltrated by getting a job there.
[00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:44.177]  And that's why other people are, you know, getting jobs there and laughing, and, oh, it's fun, it's so easy.
[00:08:44.177 --> 00:08:51.822]  They have arrested people, they have charged them with trespassing, people have gotten fired from their jobs, people have mysteriously died that have snuck in there.
[00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.784]  Uh, this is not a joke.
[00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:56.666]  This is not a game.
[00:08:56.666 --> 00:09:01.489]  And, uh, that's why it's so irritating to me when people say, oh, you didn't really sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[00:09:02.478 --> 00:09:03.138]  You didn't really.
[00:09:03.138 --> 00:09:03.498]  Oh, really?
[00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:06.859]  There's just footage of us sneaking in.
[00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:09.420]  And, uh, you know, regardless, we got video of it, and that's what they do.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.641]  That's the mock human sacrifice ritual they do.
[00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:20.203]  And it takes from several different Babylon, mystery religion, Canaanite, um, type, uh, ceremonies.
[00:09:20.203 --> 00:09:21.904]  The occult's always an amalgamation.
[00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:29.106]  And regardless, instead of obsessing on me and the... Why don't you obsess on the footage and what your so-called Christian conservative leaders are doing?
[00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:53.171]  Now, they have a lot of homosexual sex in there, they ship in male prostitutes, that's been admitted all over the mainstream news, and Chris Jones, of course, no criminal record, upstanding, nice fella, webmaster for Jack McClam, for years, wanted to sneak in, and Jack called me about three years ago, right before he snuck in in 2005, and said, what do you think about this?
[00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:57.174]  I think, you know, you've been in there, can you advise Chris?
[00:09:57.174 --> 00:09:58.435]  And I, so I called Chris up,
[00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:02.726]  I said, uh, hey man, this isn't a joke.
[00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:03.866]  And he's like, oh, but it'll be fun.
[00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.226]  I want to go and get better footage than you got.
[00:10:06.226 --> 00:10:07.967]  And I said, uh, he did get some great footage.
[00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:11.007]  It's in Order of Death, the 45-minute film I made.
[00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:23.390]  And then when you get the DVD, you get the whole re-updated, you know, added to Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, an hour and 40 minutes long, with the 45-minute or 46-minute long Order of Death.
[00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.791]  It's 46 minutes, to be precise.
[00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.511]  And, you know, it covers the new information.
[00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:55.456]  And within months of him sneaking in there, and then within months of the film coming out, I guess what, in 2006, he was handing out to all his neighbors, as we recommend, copies of... I'm trying to get all this straight in my head because I just talked to Jack about this yesterday, and I'm trying to remember all the things that happened.
[00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.037]  So much happened.
[00:10:57.037 --> 00:10:57.218]  And he...
[00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:04.753]  He handed out to all his neighbors copies of the original VHS tape.
[00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:07.914]  And I guess it was in 2006 when Order of Death came out.
[00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:10.495]  He made copies of that and he handed that out.
[00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:14.176]  And so that somehow tied him into it.
[00:11:14.176 --> 00:11:22.138]  And then when he gave it all to the neighbors, adult neighbors, teenage neighbors, the teenage neighbors came over and said, we want more.
[00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:23.818]  They said, you really snuck in there?
[00:11:23.818 --> 00:11:24.939]  And they said, yeah.
[00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:28.680]  And so the neighbors all kind of turned into like a witch hunt.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.040]  Where
[00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:35.849]  It's my gosh, he was in there, he's part of it, he killed a baby.
[00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:42.171]  So the police come, and Chris was real nice and talked to him and let him in and said, no, no, it's Alex Jones, here he is online.
[00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:45.932]  I worked there for a summer, I got him some footage, it's in this film.
[00:11:45.932 --> 00:11:49.513]  You know, here's this film, it's aired on national television.
[00:11:49.513 --> 00:11:54.155]  And the cops said, alright, and they came in and talked to him, and then months and months later they came and arrested him.
[00:11:55.023 --> 00:12:03.005]  And then it took about a year for it to go to trial, and it went to trial, and then he was trying to appeal, and he couldn't believe it, and now he's gone to prison.
[00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:12.468]  And they said that, uh, basically, well, he was convicted of showing children a snuff film.
[00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:16.749]  Showing minors a snuff film in an attempt to have sex with them.
[00:12:16.749 --> 00:12:22.931]  But then they admit in the trial, well, he never did anything with them, and never said anything with them, but the film
[00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:31.491]  Talks about ritualistic murder of children and homosexual prostitutes being brought in.
[00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:40.594]  So that's improper to give youth and so he's gone to prison for that.
[00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:43.495]  I mean this is amazing.
[00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:46.316]  Don't forget it was in the newspaper in the Lyon County News.
[00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:52.658]  I remember Kelly Rushing in 2004 called me and said I've been arrested
[00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:56.476]  I pulled out of my house and the state trooper pulled me over.
[00:12:56.476 --> 00:13:03.322]  I'd given him a week before a copy of, it was a Ron Paul 40-something minute speech, the famous neocon speech that he'd just given in 2003.
[00:13:03.322 --> 00:13:17.315]  And then after it rode to tyranny, and I gave it to him and said, please watch this, and he pulled me over a week later and said, oh, and he put him in handcuffs and called his wife on the cell phone and said, the state trooper did, and said, I've got the VHS bandit.
[00:13:21.295 --> 00:13:25.377]  And he said, man, I just, you know, he's like, why'd you give me that?
[00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:26.498]  That's anti-law enforcement.
[00:13:26.498 --> 00:13:27.258]  That's insulting.
[00:13:27.258 --> 00:13:27.898]  That's threatening to me.
[00:13:27.898 --> 00:13:29.819]  And he said, sir, I just care about you.
[00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:33.495]  I mean, don't you care about your family?
[00:13:33.495 --> 00:13:34.596]  This country's in deep trouble.
[00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:38.860]  And they said, that's another charge, that's a threat to my family, and they did charge him with that.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.824]  So he had three charges of terroristic threats for the two videos, you know, the two films on the one tape.
[00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:52.611]  Each one was a threat, and then the third one, but they dropped the one as it went to trial for saying, don't you care about your children, your family, I'm doing this for your family.
[00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:56.274]  And they took him to jail.
[00:13:56.274 --> 00:13:57.895]  And I mean, the guy sounded credible.
[00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:02.300]  But even in 2004, I hadn't fully woken up yet.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:13.826]  I mean, I get more, quote, radical and hardcore every day because I find out and am shocked and amazed by the things I see on YouTube videos from police, their own squad cars, the things I personally experience.
[00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:17.909]  It just, it's hard to believe for me, and I've seen it.
[00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:25.773]  So I looked up rushing online, and I made calls, and I got like four or five numbers randomly on Kelly rushing.
[00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:36.715]  For Rushings in Lyon County, Kentucky, they're a well-known, actually middle-class, some of them wealthy, you know, founding family there in that county.
[00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:44.819]  And I'd call up, and I'd call Rushings, and they'd go, yeah, it's our cousin, great guy in the church, a deacon, blah, blah, blah, family guy, you know, owns a business in town.
[00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:46.720]  Yeah, we heard about him being arrested, it's really weird.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.080]  So I randomly called other numbers.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.242]  I mean, I've called like six, seven of them, because I was being, I was amazed.
[00:14:51.242 --> 00:14:54.724]  And they'd say, yeah, we know the Rushings, yeah, we heard about Kelly, small town.
[00:14:54.724 --> 00:14:57.005]  That's really weird, he's a gentle giant.
[00:14:57.925 --> 00:14:59.106]  Uh, that's very strange.
[00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:00.847]  Yeah, we heard about it.
[00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:04.528]  So I had the newspaper article.
[00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.929]  Somebody mailed it to me like a week later.
[00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:06.389]  I don't remember.
[00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:07.350]  I get the newspaper article.
[00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.730]  I read it on air five, six times.
[00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.911]  Those audio clips are on the web.
[00:15:09.911 --> 00:15:12.612]  Somebody ought to make a YouTube video with them.
[00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:14.333]  And, uh, I, and so I'm driving one day.
[00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:24.078]  I've written down, I've called and got the judge's number, but I'm kind of scared to call a judge because they'll set you up, a lot of them, and say you threatened to kill them, uh, if, uh, you know, if they don't like how you talk to them.
[00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:27.214]  I don't want to be SWAT teamed here, but I just couldn't help it.
[00:15:27.214 --> 00:15:35.298]  I was in a Home Depot parking lot, and I called the cell phone, the judge, and I go, is this Judge Blah Blah?
[00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:36.519]  That seemed in the paper.
[00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:36.979]  He said, yeah.
[00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:43.863]  And I said, you're trying, Kelly Rushing, for giving someone a videotape.
[00:15:43.863 --> 00:15:46.664]  And he said, yes, we are, but I'm not going to comment on the case.
[00:15:46.664 --> 00:15:47.405]  He's been indicted.
[00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.886]  And I said, yeah, I've got the news article.
[00:15:49.886 --> 00:15:52.147]  He said, well, that ought to tell you everything, because the judge was quoted in there.
[00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:59.774]  And it went to court and they came in and said this video of this uh... congressman, he was a charge!
[00:15:59.774 --> 00:16:02.555]  A charge in America!
[00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:08.018]  Now, for Chris Jones, he kept laughing about it, thinking he'd go to trial and be laughed out.
[00:16:08.018 --> 00:16:09.659]  Not in uh... San Diego.
[00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:11.800]  I think it's San Diego.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.820]  We got Jack McClam coming.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.341]  I haven't talked to Chris in months.
[00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:15.721]  He's been in jail for months.
[00:16:15.721 --> 00:16:17.082]  At the time he didn't want to go on air with it.
[00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:20.023]  He keeps thinking that justice will come and they'll let him go.
[00:16:20.023 --> 00:16:21.344]  They don't do that, folks!
[00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:27.202]  And so I guess if we've got permission, I'll get Jack McClam.
[00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:29.564]  I know he's got a lot of the documents and court records.
[00:16:29.564 --> 00:16:33.406]  I've got them around here somewhere from a year ago.
[00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:36.689]  We'll get them up on the web and do an article about it and just post them for you to read.
[00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:42.113]  And it just says he gave them a video.
[00:16:42.113 --> 00:16:44.334]  See, the public is so dumb, folks.
[00:16:44.334 --> 00:16:48.557]  They don't know who the vice president is, how many continents there are.
[00:16:48.557 --> 00:16:49.338]  I mean, you know the drill.
[00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:50.679]  They don't know anything.
[00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.891]  You can give them the scientific name for water, and they'll say, ban it.
[00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:56.692]  And so, most of them are cops.
[00:16:56.692 --> 00:17:00.893]  You know, brothers or sisters, or judges, brothers or sisters, or government people.
[00:17:00.893 --> 00:17:08.956]  And they just tell them, convict, and it was, uh... You know, they just said he gave minors, uh, this film.
[00:17:08.956 --> 00:17:14.738]  Truth is, he gave it to the neighbors, and then the teenagers came over and wanted more, and he talked to them and said, yeah, it's real.
[00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:18.539]  Kind of like, I'm a celebrity, I... You know, he was, I snuck in, yeah, it's me.
[00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.280]  And they were like, it was a witch hunt.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.180]  I'm surprised they didn't...
[00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:27.907]  Take him out in the street and put a thousand pound weight on his chest and crush him or burn him at the stake and this still goes on.
[00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:33.111]  They still have this stuff going on.
[00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:39.156]  But, uh, Jones even said later, you know, the police were basically told him.
[00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:44.300]  They said, well, you know, we basically had orders to come down on you, boy.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.303]  Because, uh, Chris told me that the police had heard about it in the neighborhood and then
[00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:52.450]  Like I said, came out and investigated and a long time later came after him.
[00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.370]  But I've already digressed.
[00:17:53.370 --> 00:18:01.014]  We'll talk about that with Jack McClam in the fourth hour today.
[00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:02.334]  Just so amazing.
[00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:08.958]  Okay, I just spent 15 minutes on that and I shouldn't have because I've got all this news and it's all amazing.
[00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:09.538]  Look at this.
[00:18:09.538 --> 00:18:12.999]  Veterans Group Ban for Memorial Day Parade.
[00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:16.961]  It's in the top 10 largest veterans group in the country, Veterans for Peace.
[00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:17.822]  This is from AP.
[00:18:19.108 --> 00:18:21.369]  Veterans group that opposes the march.
[00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:31.675]  I mean the war in Iraq has been blocked from marching Memorial Day Parade in Washington for being told its plans, which once included a caster representing war dead, would be too political for the event.
[00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:33.496]  Yeah, the war isn't political.
[00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:35.117]  So they've been banned from that.
[00:18:35.117 --> 00:18:37.979]  So see, first they say you gotta have a permit to own a gun.
[00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:39.280]  Then they just deny the permit.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.041]  Then you gotta have a permit to have a march.
[00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.862]  Then they deny the permit.
[00:18:42.862 --> 00:18:45.063]  That's how tyranny works.
[00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:48.125]  Bilderberg, luminary to select Obama's running mate.
[00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:57.917]  Fannie Mae CEO James A. Johnson was behind 2004 Edwards pick for Bilderberg, signaled approval.
[00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:07.243]  We've got to start organizing masses of people, I would just say media, because Virginia police will try to claim you don't have any right to demonstrate here in this third world police state.
[00:19:07.243 --> 00:19:14.988]  You've got very strong protections there, but you have it even stronger as the press to cover the elite meeting.
[00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.250]  And you watch, in the U.S., I bet money they're going to say,
[00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:21.150]  They're gonna try to just get out of here.
[00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.351]  I have authority.
[00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:22.892]  Just get out.
[00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:25.335]  Just don't stand on the sidewalk in America.
[00:19:25.335 --> 00:19:27.598]  Covering 125 world leaders.
[00:19:27.598 --> 00:19:29.841]  That's bizarre to want to know what they're doing.
[00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:32.264]  That's weird.
[00:19:32.264 --> 00:19:33.786]  I saw some video of a Marine.
[00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:37.010]  These cops want to randomly search his house basically.
[00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.811]  And he's saying no.
[00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:46.050]  And, uh, he goes, you know, you get the feds are trying to violate our rights, and the cop goes, oh yeah, the KGB too, and starts laughing.
[00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.753]  Like the feds haven't federalized police.
[00:19:48.753 --> 00:19:53.716]  Like all the warrantless checkpoints sucking blood from you all over the country under federal grants.
[00:19:53.716 --> 00:19:54.317]  That's not federal.
[00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:58.208]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:07.675]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:14.781]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:21.483]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.483 --> 00:20:32.267]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:33.047 --> 00:20:33.527]  I think so.
[00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:56.342]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:59.964]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:20:59.964 --> 00:21:02.306]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:05.447]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:21:05.447 --> 00:21:11.191]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:15.113]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:20.636]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:23.678]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:21:50.737 --> 00:21:52.498]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:21:52.498 --> 00:21:53.258]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:21:54.309 --> 00:21:55.369]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:55.369 --> 00:22:00.310]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:08.372]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:13.953]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:13.953 --> 00:22:20.935]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:21.235 --> 00:22:26.842]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:26.842 --> 00:22:31.908]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:39.498]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:46.401]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:47.461]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:47.681]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.134 --> 00:23:01.217]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:23:01.217 --> 00:23:07.159]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:11.301]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:16.203]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:23:16.463 --> 00:23:24.969]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[00:23:48.782 --> 00:23:49.943]  That's SnyderHealth.com.
[00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:27.752]  They're slowly, but not so slowly now, ratcheting up.
[00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:31.694]  There I was on YouTube, watching this Marine, fresh back from Iraq.
[00:24:31.694 --> 00:24:36.196]  They come to his house, wrong house, looking for some person who hadn't paid tickets.
[00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:40.589]  He says, this person doesn't live here, I don't know, or they demand to come in.
[00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:46.652]  They put him in handcuffs, and they're stomping around inside, and he said, you ought to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:50.993]  And, uh, then he goes, you know, this is all federal training, this is, everything's being federalized.
[00:24:50.993 --> 00:24:54.655]  And then they ask him, you know, what he did to the Marines, and he tells them, and they're all former Marines.
[00:24:55.698 --> 00:25:01.322]  And so they, uh, he says, you know, this is all federal training, and the cops all laugh and go, oh yeah, the feds!
[00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:03.183]  And they go, and the KGB too!
[00:25:03.183 --> 00:25:10.789]  Well, actually, yes, Brema Coff, former head of the KGB, was hired to help set up Homeland Security, as well as Marcus Wolf, former head of the East German Stasi.
[00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:12.910]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.852]  But there they were saying there's nothing federal.
[00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:17.213]  Our police are completely federalized.
[00:25:17.213 --> 00:25:20.416]  A lot of them even have now been given federal, you know, hazard pay.
[00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:22.317]  When they're out running checkpoints, searching your car,
[00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:26.220]  When they're out CPS'ing your kids, it's all federal, folks.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.282]  Denton County, this is up by Dallas, no refusal weekend targeting drunk drivers.
[00:25:31.282 --> 00:25:32.563]  We told you about this a few weeks ago.
[00:25:32.563 --> 00:25:49.072]  All over the country, started in Arizona a decade ago or so, and they just pull you over in the dark, and they admitted that it was, in Maricopa County, they stopped, I was reading some numbers yesterday, 44,000 people
[00:25:51.388 --> 00:25:54.770]  And less than 1% of what we're actually drinking.
[00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.871]  Didn't matter, though.
[00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:57.252]  A lot of people said, no, I have rights.
[00:25:57.252 --> 00:25:58.652]  I'm not doing a breathalyzer.
[00:25:58.652 --> 00:25:59.473]  Why are you stopping me?
[00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:02.395]  You'll have... One time they shut I-35 down.
[00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.936]  The one time I caught them in Austin.
[00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:04.736]  Heard it at other times.
[00:26:04.736 --> 00:26:07.938]  The whole highway was backed up for like 20 miles.
[00:26:07.938 --> 00:26:08.859]  Just insane!
[00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:11.520]  I mean, this was incredible!
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.722]  Was backed up through the city, all the way to Georgetown.
[00:26:14.722 --> 00:26:17.604]  From South Austin and Kyle, all the way to Georgetown.
[00:26:17.604 --> 00:26:18.464]  But I digress.
[00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:19.225]  It's just nuts.
[00:26:19.932 --> 00:26:27.353]  And that was a federal grant, but there we walked up and said, this federal grant's wrong, and the cops went, oh yeah, and I'm working with Serb troops.
[00:26:27.353 --> 00:26:29.874]  That's in Police State 2000.
[00:26:29.874 --> 00:26:32.734]  It's always a joke.
[00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:36.655]  They could be burning children at the stake, and they'd say, what are we doing, burning children at the stake?
[00:26:36.655 --> 00:26:40.596]  I mean, it's always a denial.
[00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:45.977]  And all over the country, federal training, federal funding to do these, and now the cops
[00:26:47.145 --> 00:26:55.330]  In Illinois, in Indiana, and in Ohio, and in areas of Texas, they are going to jam a needle in your arm.
[00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.593]  I mean, I've had nurses mess up, you know, and I've had to give blood over the years.
[00:26:59.593 --> 00:27:06.797]  It probably only happened ten times in my life giving blood, and half the time they're sitting there, because it's hard to find my veins for some reason, I guess I've got thick skin.
[00:27:06.797 --> 00:27:10.079]  But the point is, is they'll tase you, they'll beat you.
[00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:10.600]  They'll do it.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.123]  Now, in Denton it says they're going to have judges waiting at the jail, and that they're going to sign out a warrant.
[00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:28.066]  And so, that actually is quasi-constitutional, but them taking you to jail was not on probable cause, because these checkpoints, there was no reasonable suspicion, there was no way to kick in.
[00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:29.347]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:31.428]  I mean, we didn't do it before!
[00:27:31.428 --> 00:27:34.188]  It's something out of a nightmare science fiction movie!
[00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:44.252]  And this is all part of the public being trained to be violated, the police being trained to violate you, and I'm sorry, I am down to probably drinking a beer once a month now.
[00:27:44.252 --> 00:27:45.292]  And I'm even going to quit that.
[00:27:46.122 --> 00:27:47.003]  I'll be out with friends.
[00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:48.464]  Okay, I'll have a beer.
[00:27:48.464 --> 00:27:50.146]  No, because I refuse.
[00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:56.812]  And let me tell you, you pull me over and you want to stick a needle in me, it just isn't going to happen, buddy boy.
[00:27:56.812 --> 00:27:59.635]  I mean, I've just been pushed and I just can't be pushed anymore.
[00:27:59.635 --> 00:28:03.258]  And I mean, what's next?
[00:28:03.258 --> 00:28:04.599]  Well, forcible inoculations.
[00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:07.582]  They've been trained for that.
[00:28:07.582 --> 00:28:09.364]  They admit that, but they can't get the cops
[00:28:11.534 --> 00:28:15.875]  They ordered 14 million first responders in 2002 under no law.
[00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:17.576]  It was just our insurance says we have to have it.
[00:28:17.576 --> 00:28:19.736]  The Fed said we have to have it.
[00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:31.539]  Police, firemen, emergency workers, nurses, doctors, hospital staff, and less than 1% agreed to take it.
[00:28:31.539 --> 00:28:34.800]  So they're gonna force on us what they're smart enough to not do.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.681]  Just... Oh, it's sick.
[00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:44.230]  If you got caught drinking and driving this Memorial Day weekend, police will make you an offer that you can't refuse.
[00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.711]  See, Don Carleone language.
[00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:46.731]  That's what it is.
[00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:47.591]  Mafia.
[00:28:47.591 --> 00:28:54.013]  Law enforcement agencies across Denton County will participate in the first DWI no-refusal weekend.
[00:28:54.013 --> 00:29:00.215]  Intoxicated drivers and boaters... See how the psychology here is it's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:29:00.215 --> 00:29:05.756]  Intoxicated drivers and boaters who refuse to breathalyzer test... Well, how do you know they're intoxicated?
[00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:11.117]  We'll be taken to jail to give court-ordered blood samples.
[00:29:11.117 --> 00:29:19.620]  I know so many people that have had strokes or who have speech impediments who the cops take to jail and they do take blood and there's nothing.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:31.704]  Sponsored by the Denton County District Attorney's Office, this program is designed to ensure the evidence in the form of a sample of the suspect's breath or blood is obtained in order to determine the alcohol concentration in the suspect's system.
[00:29:31.704 --> 00:29:32.664]  Wait a minute, I thought it said
[00:29:33.724 --> 00:29:56.078]  Up here that it's intoxicated drivers, but down here it says Suspects guilty until proven slave and you are a slave We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network It is a big idea
[00:29:57.222 --> 00:29:58.983]  A New World Order.
[00:29:58.983 --> 00:30:03.884]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:30:03.884 --> 00:30:06.705]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:09.506]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:30:09.506 --> 00:30:12.687]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:30:12.687 --> 00:30:20.010]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:28.484]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:32.367]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:34.930]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.091]  Most people have no idea.
[00:30:36.091 --> 00:30:36.872]  They're not after money.
[00:30:36.872 --> 00:30:38.153]  They have all the money they need.
[00:30:38.153 --> 00:30:39.134]  They're after power.
[00:30:39.134 --> 00:30:40.275]  That's what they're after, these people.

[00:32:15.804 --> 00:32:19.909]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a bestseller.
[00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:26.777]  The balance bracelet has no magnets, but is ionized in such a way that wearers are so delighted they refuse to ever take theirs off.

[00:32:58.148 --> 00:33:16.373]  I wonder if you're wearing a magic bracelet, if the cops won't jab a needle in you.
[00:33:16.373 --> 00:33:22.194]  Denton County's No Refusal Weekend targets drunk drivers.
[00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:30.672]  Now, all over the country, the police take the blood.
[00:33:30.672 --> 00:33:36.454]  It says in Denton, they at least think there's some semblance, somewhere, of a Fourth Amendment.
[00:33:36.454 --> 00:33:39.595]  These aren't random checkpoints.
[00:33:39.595 --> 00:33:44.956]  And they have these saturation patrols, which I got pulled over by about a month ago.
[00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:45.777]  And I saw them.
[00:33:45.777 --> 00:33:48.117]  I noticed there were police cars just pulling cars.
[00:33:48.117 --> 00:33:50.018]  There were police everywhere.
[00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:52.439]  Coming out of downtown over Congress Street Bridge, I was at a meeting.
[00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:53.719]  It was about 9 o'clock at night.
[00:33:54.637 --> 00:33:56.197]  And I'm going 30 over the bridge.
[00:33:56.197 --> 00:33:57.858]  I remember looking at my speedometer.
[00:33:57.858 --> 00:33:58.798]  There were cops everywhere.
[00:33:58.798 --> 00:34:00.679]  I just pulled out of a restaurant.
[00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:01.559]  And he pulls me over.
[00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:02.979]  He looks in the car over this thing.
[00:34:02.979 --> 00:34:05.560]  I give him all my slave papers.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.461]  And, uh, and I was just like, man, you guys are everywhere.
[00:34:08.461 --> 00:34:10.742]  I go, this is part of a saturation patrol.
[00:34:10.742 --> 00:34:15.623]  And it was so shocking to him that a slave, you know, basically knew what was going on.
[00:34:15.623 --> 00:34:21.925]  And, you know, he's like, well, you were going, you know, too fast, but I'm just giving you a ticket for your insurance being out of date.
[00:34:22.546 --> 00:34:26.490]  Instead of speeding, and I'm like, yeah, I'm speeding, buddy, boy.
[00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:27.931]  I bet I am.
[00:34:27.931 --> 00:34:31.775]  Across Congress Street Bridge, what's full of traffic at nine o'clock at night still.
[00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:33.156]  Going about 32 miles an hour.
[00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:36.819]  Yeah, maybe I was going two miles over.
[00:34:36.819 --> 00:34:44.266]  It's just, this is not freedom, ladies and gentlemen, to have the police randomly searching you.
[00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:45.347]  This is Baghdad.
[00:34:45.347 --> 00:34:46.268]  This is Belgrade.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.762]  This is the Soviet Union.
[00:34:48.762 --> 00:34:51.665]  This is not America, land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:34:51.665 --> 00:34:55.268]  You know, the big weekend to remember our veterans, and how are we going to do it?
[00:34:55.268 --> 00:35:00.914]  Goons out checking our papers, but if you're an illegal alien and drunk, they've been told let them go because the judge just lets them go.
[00:35:00.914 --> 00:35:11.384]  I mean, I've told the story a hundred times, but one night I'm coming to work at about 10 o'clock, and they told him they thought he was suspicious because he pulled off when they were behind him.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:40.525]  They've already got a lot of, some of the cop cars in Austin, they've got them all over the country, have the license plate reading cameras, but these cars didn't have them, where they're illegally running everybody's plates without any Fourth Amendment, without any, you know, reasonable suspicion, some reason, you know, weaving, taillight out, burnout, license plate light, I mean, all those sorry excuses of a cop on quota,
[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.433]  Or a cop who's mad at his wife who, you know, just hung up the phone.
[00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:45.734]  He's gonna show somebody.
[00:35:45.734 --> 00:35:48.697]  You know, it's very rudimentary level psychology.
[00:35:48.697 --> 00:35:50.118]  And I'm tired of being fed on.
[00:35:50.118 --> 00:35:51.279]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:52.900]  The government's evil.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.364]  You individually may not be evil and corrupt, but the system you work for is.
[00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:57.064]  It's bankrupt.
[00:35:57.064 --> 00:35:58.726]  I have no respect for it.
[00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:02.790]  You know?
[00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.332]  And I'm also so clean, ladies and gentlemen, um...
[00:36:07.927 --> 00:36:11.450]  I'm such a square goody two-shoes that it just disgusts me.
[00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:15.152]  I want to be left alone by you.
[00:36:15.152 --> 00:36:26.480]  But one of my, actually a contractor who works here, is pulled in, my IT guy, and he's got an expired license, and they're putting him in handcuffs.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.405]  I told the story, and I started talking to him, and they go, yeah, yeah, we're not really supposed to arrest illegals because the judge just lets them go.
[00:36:33.405 --> 00:36:34.646]  It's discouraging.
[00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:37.228]  Yeah, we would let him go if he was an illegal alien.
[00:36:39.187 --> 00:36:43.090]  And I go, yeah, I've seen it in the news where sheriffs complain they arrest illegals and ICE won't come get them.
[00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.391]  Yeah, that's true!
[00:36:44.391 --> 00:36:44.831]  Sure is!
[00:36:44.831 --> 00:36:46.833]  Hey, I like your show!
[00:36:46.833 --> 00:36:48.634]  But you're still arresting him.
[00:36:48.634 --> 00:36:49.815]  I mean, why?
[00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:53.738]  Well, that's what we're told to do.
[00:36:53.738 --> 00:36:56.280]  I mean, that was even worse that the guy was telling me about.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.601]  I remember your show ten years ago.
[00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:59.102]  Remember the show about that?
[00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:01.284]  Remember one time in a Chevron you saw me?
[00:37:01.284 --> 00:37:02.185]  There's two other cops there.
[00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:03.446]  One of them's going, yeah, I like the show too.
[00:37:07.188 --> 00:37:09.811]  The woman cop was looking at me with total hatred, though she drove off with him.
[00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:11.532]  She's the one that bagged him.
[00:37:11.532 --> 00:37:16.057]  The one that did it.
[00:37:16.057 --> 00:37:18.899]  I bet money her mom's an illegal alien.
[00:37:18.899 --> 00:37:22.503]  But the point is, is that it was a victory.
[00:37:22.503 --> 00:37:27.127]  A victory over freedom, a victory over liberty, a victory over justice.
[00:37:27.127 --> 00:37:30.511]  I mean, the injustice
[00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.813]  Well, we arrest you now for no turn signal.
[00:37:34.813 --> 00:37:37.996]  We're told to arrest you now for expired driver's license.
[00:37:37.996 --> 00:37:40.138]  We're told to arrest you for no seatbelt.
[00:37:40.138 --> 00:37:44.322]  See how that's working?
[00:37:44.322 --> 00:37:49.726]  And if you smart off, we're gonna beat you up and then you're gonna get an assaulting an officer charge.
[00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:57.393]  And we got monkey juries that'll watch a squad car video of us tasering you and they'll send you to jail for resisting.
[00:37:57.393 --> 00:37:57.994]  How's that sound?
[00:37:59.554 --> 00:38:05.279]  Because we got a monkey public that likes being slaves and likes being tattletales and likes being petted by us.
[00:38:05.279 --> 00:38:13.325]  We got grandmothers and mothers and fathers that turn their children in, people that turn their parents in for petty crimes, for money.
[00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:17.188]  It's easy for us to rule you and dominate you because you're so weak and evil.
[00:38:17.188 --> 00:38:20.210]  I mean, cops, don't think I dislike you.
[00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.331]  At least you're predators.
[00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:23.373]  At least you know what you're doing, some of you.
[00:38:23.373 --> 00:38:24.754]  At least you enjoy the power.
[00:38:24.754 --> 00:38:26.936]  You know, at least you are what you are.
[00:38:26.936 --> 00:38:28.597]  It's the lukewarm, weak public.
[00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:38.952]  Who are so dumbed down and so stupid.
[00:38:38.952 --> 00:38:49.961]  We hope through this coordinated effort of all agencies and some of our judges this will be a safe Memorial Day weekend to Jamie Beck, First Assistant Criminal District Attorney.
[00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:54.445]  This should send a message that everyone should think twice before drinking and driving or drinking and boating.
[00:38:56.718 --> 00:38:59.259]  Yeah, it's now come out with all the witnesses signing affidavits.
[00:38:59.259 --> 00:39:03.442]  Cops pull up, see a rich football player, Ed Anker, out loud to drink.
[00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:09.985]  And they drug him over and beat him up and then poured water in his face and choked him.
[00:39:09.985 --> 00:39:11.526]  Another victory!
[00:39:11.526 --> 00:39:14.428]  They showed everybody that they're the boss.
[00:39:14.428 --> 00:39:17.989]  Cedric Benson.
[00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:19.430]  No refusal policies.
[00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:20.491]  Policies!
[00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.692]  Totally not a law, you scum!
[00:39:22.692 --> 00:39:24.813]  Have become increasingly common in North Texas.
[00:39:24.813 --> 00:39:26.254]  Oh yeah, absolute villainy up there.
[00:39:27.262 --> 00:39:32.365]  Most of the sheriffs, I mean everyone I knew about, was a narcotics trafficker.
[00:39:32.365 --> 00:39:40.469]  No refusal policies have become increasingly common in North Texas cities, and I mean it's boss hog everywhere up there.
[00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:55.437]  No refusal policies have become increasingly common in North Texas cities, and in some counties across the state, the programs have not only been successful in improving the rates of convictions for DWI drivers and boaters, but have also served as an effective deterrent, according to law enforcement officials.
[00:39:57.495 --> 00:40:00.677]  And I say, you know, don't go out at night.
[00:40:00.677 --> 00:40:04.159]  And that's kind of what they want, is the culture where we don't go out and we just watch our TVs.
[00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:12.985]  But just pray to God, meditate, think about your family, think about, you know, how you're going to go to city council and speak out against this the next week.
[00:40:12.985 --> 00:40:15.246]  Think about how you're going to wake other people up.
[00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:19.509]  Burn copies of my films, other films this weekend.
[00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:23.231]  Clean your firearms, take them to the shooting range.
[00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:24.092]  Prepare yourself.
[00:40:29.963 --> 00:40:33.025]  And then they keep calling themselves officials in this disgusting article.
[00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:36.347]  Officials, oh.
[00:40:36.347 --> 00:40:42.051]  Oh, they're the officials, oh my gosh.
[00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:55.640]  Man, you go to these medium-sized towns and even big cities and they just worship the judges and cops and bailiffs and they all just ninny around all soft and weak and it's all just... There's lots of little weird tics and things they do.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.041]  It's indescribable, you gotta see them.
[00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:58.081]  It's a certain type.
[00:40:58.081 --> 00:40:58.742]  It's called filth.
[00:41:01.414 --> 00:41:03.977]  It's called parasite scum.
[00:41:03.977 --> 00:41:05.618]  Those that want to run other people's lives.
[00:41:05.618 --> 00:41:07.140]  I mean, I can hardly run my own life.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.102]  And I'd be embarrassed to run other people's lives.
[00:41:09.102 --> 00:41:12.865]  I'd be embarrassed to try to dominate people I had authority over.
[00:41:12.865 --> 00:41:16.469]  Not them!
[00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:19.952]  So now they're coming with needles to jam them in your arms.
[00:41:19.952 --> 00:41:20.513]  Forcibly.
[00:41:20.513 --> 00:41:23.015]  And if you don't like it, they'll taser you till you die.
[00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:25.317]  Of course, the taser doesn't kill you, though.
[00:41:25.317 --> 00:41:25.898]  You just die.
[00:41:26.502 --> 00:41:27.922]  Gotta learn the double thing.
[00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:29.003]  Let me just run through some news here.
[00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:33.684]  Bilderberg Luminary to select Obama's running mate.
[00:41:33.684 --> 00:41:40.366]  Fannie Mae CEO James A. Johnson was also behind the 2004 Edwards pick for Bilderberg.
[00:41:40.366 --> 00:41:40.586]  U.S.
[00:41:40.586 --> 00:41:47.848]  home prices fall another 1% in the last month to all-time record low.
[00:41:47.848 --> 00:41:49.749]  OPEC oil market is going crazy.
[00:41:51.895 --> 00:42:00.802]  Oil well above $135 a barrel and rising right towards $200, like we told you two years ago it would, because Bilderberg runs things.
[00:42:00.802 --> 00:42:02.223]  And we go and cover them.
[00:42:02.223 --> 00:42:08.107]  We go and risk our lives to cover them for you.
[00:42:08.107 --> 00:42:10.729]  Think oil prices hurt now?
[00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:12.891]  Just wait.
[00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:19.356]  Again, Reuters is saying with gas at $4 a gallon on average a barrel, you need to get ready for $5, $6, $7 a barrel.
[00:42:22.105 --> 00:42:31.950]  Because we pay more for gas than anybody else, we pay more for prescription drugs than anybody else, we pay... Those are all taxes.
[00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:37.033]  Total, we pay more taxes than any other nation but a handful of European countries.
[00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:40.335]  But it's all hidden, it's all added on so that the cattle don't notice.
[00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:46.926]  French fishermen burn EU flag to protest fuel costs.
[00:42:46.926 --> 00:42:47.526]  That's the headline.
[00:42:47.526 --> 00:42:50.367]  They also attack stores looted.
[00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.467]  Yeah, they're getting angry.
[00:42:51.467 --> 00:42:52.828]  You wouldn't see that.
[00:42:52.828 --> 00:42:54.948]  Used to, Americans acted like that.
[00:42:54.948 --> 00:42:57.949]  Now it's the Europeans, because they're not as gelded as us.
[00:42:57.949 --> 00:43:01.130]  Or they're deeper into the slavery, and they're really... Well, they're all going bankrupt.
[00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.850]  They're losing everything.
[00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.950]  The farmers, the... It's all over.
[00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.991]  It's, you know, new world order.
[00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:07.911]  Lawmakers near agreement on domestic surveillance.
[00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:08.832]  That's right.
[00:43:08.832 --> 00:43:09.652]  Totally illegal.
[00:43:11.394 --> 00:43:16.797]  They now admit surveilling the entire American population, non-terror related.
[00:43:16.797 --> 00:43:19.318]  They tried to lie and claim it's just listening to Bin Laden's phone calls.
[00:43:19.318 --> 00:43:23.120]  Then they had to admit, no, it's listening to everybody, tracking everything you do illegally.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.823]  And, you know, they're getting ready to completely overturn the Fourth Amendment, which they can't do.
[00:43:26.823 --> 00:43:29.084]  The Constitution says Congress can't do that.
[00:43:30.157 --> 00:43:31.358]  Court says U.S.
[00:43:31.358 --> 00:43:33.679]  cash discriminates against the blind.
[00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:40.923]  A decade ago, I saw globalist policy reports where they would have billboards, TV ads saying cash was dirty, then discriminated against the blind.
[00:43:40.923 --> 00:43:42.964]  That's how they were going to get rid of cash.
[00:43:42.964 --> 00:43:45.505]  And they're now doing it!
[00:43:45.505 --> 00:43:49.687]  And folks, when that happens, the ramifications are unspeakable.
[00:43:53.374 --> 00:44:07.397]  Now, I told you, the old-timers told you 25 years ago, because they read Trilateral Commission documents, you called it a conspiracy, they would phase in colored money first to get you used to then having smaller bills that have RFID chips in them.
[00:44:07.397 --> 00:44:13.238]  And then we gave you the federal documents where they were testing it in some money in Canada, the Euro, and the U.S.
[00:44:13.238 --> 00:44:18.780]  People then said, we made that up, you can now Google RFID to be put in money, hundreds of articles, oh, right again as usual.
[00:44:21.511 --> 00:44:27.294]  They are going to now have it with RFID in it, so we don't quote discriminate against the blind.
[00:44:27.294 --> 00:44:29.216]  Yeah, that's really what it's about.
[00:44:29.216 --> 00:44:40.682]  Now, things become cashless then, and they scan it and track it and what you do and how you got it out of an ATM and what you did and where you spent it with a new national slash global carbon tax.
[00:44:40.682 --> 00:44:43.043]  It's going to be a sales tax, one of the many taxes.
[00:44:43.043 --> 00:44:44.664]  They're going to track everything you do with that.
[00:44:44.664 --> 00:44:45.525]  They've now announced that.
[00:44:46.169 --> 00:44:53.711]  Face scanners to, quote, make sure no one underage checked against national and international databases through the local driver's license or ID.
[00:44:53.711 --> 00:44:56.391]  You just have to have a job, unless you're an illegal.
[00:44:56.391 --> 00:44:59.352]  They're giving waivers.
[00:44:59.352 --> 00:45:00.812]  It's selectively enforced.
[00:45:00.812 --> 00:45:02.493]  You will all be face scanned to buy and sell.
[00:45:02.493 --> 00:45:04.033]  They're going in now.
[00:45:04.033 --> 00:45:06.733]  Lawmakers near agreement on domestic surveillance.
[00:45:06.733 --> 00:45:07.694]  Court says U.S.
[00:45:07.694 --> 00:45:09.574]  cash discriminates against the blind.
[00:45:09.574 --> 00:45:12.375]  We're looking for Treasury Department to redesign its money.
[00:45:14.873 --> 00:45:16.774]  They ignore rulings.
[00:45:16.774 --> 00:45:20.555]  There's hundreds of rulings in Texas about these warrantless checkpoints.
[00:45:20.555 --> 00:45:34.561]  There's two Supreme Court rulings in Texas, one, I mean, national, federal Supreme Court, one out of Austin, from the 80s, where you don't have to have an ID walking down the street, but the dumb cops have been told you do, and they still arrest people every day for it.
[00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:40.903]  I was almost arrested for not having an ID once walking from a convenience store 60 yards from my apartment, and that was back in, like, 1995, 94.
[00:45:44.278 --> 00:45:44.538]  I don't know.
[00:46:08.143 --> 00:46:12.686]  I mean, at that time I was a complete health food nut doing nothing bad for my body, not even cheeseburgers.
[00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:16.449]  I'd just run like five miles in there with these guys yelling at me.
[00:46:16.449 --> 00:46:21.373]  I still did like some junk food, though.
[00:46:21.373 --> 00:46:25.416]  The point is, is that, you know, they say, oh, the courts are making them.
[00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:27.658]  Oh, they've got to do it.
[00:46:27.658 --> 00:46:29.759]  Folks, they do whatever they want, okay?
[00:46:29.759 --> 00:46:31.620]  That's all staged.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.603]  I told you they do this a decade ago, because I read their documents.
[00:46:34.603 --> 00:46:37.285]  They're going to claim first apes
[00:46:38.476 --> 00:46:52.529]  Great apes, African great ape, chimpanzees and orangutans, getting into the other primates, the different monkeys, baboons, things like that.
[00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:58.335]  They're all going to have rights, but they really can't talk and can't defend themselves because they're not really humans.
[00:46:58.335 --> 00:47:00.477]  They're not even close.
[00:47:00.477 --> 00:47:03.660]  That's bull that their chromosomes are only 2% different, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:11.548]  When you look, they only count the last, you know, 4%, because they used to claim that was the only chromosomes that mattered.
[00:47:11.548 --> 00:47:14.549]  The other 96% are completely different.
[00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:21.812]  They were just ignoring all that, but yes, of the 4% that they would look at, they are half like us.
[00:47:21.812 --> 00:47:25.914]  See, that's a little semantical trick they play.
[00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:30.756]  Incidentally, dogs are very similar, but if you look at it according to only 4% of the chromosomes, 4% of the genetics
[00:47:35.547 --> 00:47:38.870]  European Court agrees to hear Chimp's plea for human rights.
[00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.031]  It's a human!
[00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:50.380]  But government, oh, you've got to give us millions of square miles that the UN's going to control, of course, and then strip mine later, five years later, when you forget.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.081]  Because it's for the chimpanzees.
[00:47:52.081 --> 00:47:56.205]  See, they can't speak for themselves, so they're going to be represented.
[00:47:56.205 --> 00:47:59.428]  See, notice how they always give everything hyper-rights?
[00:47:59.428 --> 00:48:01.890]  Oh, we've got to get rid of the money and add a cashless for the blind.
[00:48:04.463 --> 00:48:09.004]  But under eugenics, the government wants to euthanize the blind.
[00:48:09.004 --> 00:48:12.084]  The visually impaired.
[00:48:12.084 --> 00:48:13.165]  See?
[00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:17.185]  Oh, we care about the chimpanzees.
[00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:22.286]  That's why we do medical testing on them all over the world.
[00:48:22.286 --> 00:48:23.406]  Which I'm actually against.
[00:48:23.406 --> 00:48:26.487]  I think the higher-level primates, whales, things like that.
[00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:28.627]  I mean, but we don't need a global control on them.
[00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:32.408]  We need to boycott, and culturally, people in Norway need to stop eating whale.
[00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.971]  At least until they get into gigantic numbers again.
[00:48:35.971 --> 00:48:36.872]  I mean, they're wonderful.
[00:48:36.872 --> 00:48:38.613]  But see, it sounds reasonable.
[00:48:38.613 --> 00:48:42.574]  Then it turns into exterminate the humans.
[00:48:42.574 --> 00:48:43.775]  Teachers given a right.
[00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:44.756]  Oh, they're given a right.
[00:48:44.756 --> 00:48:46.236]  See how they phrase it?
[00:48:46.236 --> 00:48:49.678]  To screen pupils' computers and mobile phones and crack down on school gangs.
[00:48:49.678 --> 00:48:55.101]  And then really what it is, is down to elementary kids, they spy on them, ask about their parents, ask them in the medicine cabinet.
[00:48:55.101 --> 00:48:57.102]  It already happens here in the U.S.
[00:48:57.102 --> 00:48:59.783]  NBC, Army Stop Loss Policy, a backdoor draft.
[00:49:00.783 --> 00:49:02.925]  Actually, a pretty good report, but they minimize the number.
[00:49:02.925 --> 00:49:07.568]  It's way more than the amount of 58,000 they list.
[00:49:07.568 --> 00:49:13.112]  I mean, almost everybody I know in the Marines or the Army has been in Iraq for at least three tours.
[00:49:13.112 --> 00:49:14.053]  Let me think.
[00:49:14.053 --> 00:49:17.995]  Most people, they've been in like Afghanistan twice, Iraq twice, I guess more than that.
[00:49:17.995 --> 00:49:24.160]  Everybody I know has been in Afghanistan three times, Iraq twice, or Iraq three times, and Afghanistan once, or vice versa.
[00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:27.949]  And a lot of them signed up for three years, and they tell them no.
[00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:30.149]  I mean, they'll be in there two, three years after.
[00:49:30.149 --> 00:49:36.651]  You know, we're now five months, five years, and what, three or four months into the war in Iraq.
[00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:40.072]  We're now six and a half years in Afghanistan.
[00:49:40.072 --> 00:49:43.893]  So this story sounds bad.
[00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:46.273]  We'll play that after the break if I have time.
[00:49:46.273 --> 00:49:48.974]  But it's not half as bad as it really is.
[00:49:48.974 --> 00:49:52.015]  Democrats seek Iraq embezzlement probe.
[00:49:52.015 --> 00:49:52.155]  Ha!
[00:49:52.933 --> 00:49:56.916]  Man, if they were political points, they're all involved, by the way.
[00:49:56.916 --> 00:50:04.381]  I mean, there was a trillion nine missing, and it broke in the news two days before 9-11.
[00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:10.945]  Which is why they probably went ahead and went with that a little bit earlier than they'd been planning, according to our sources, you know, with the staged attacks.
[00:50:10.945 --> 00:50:14.768]  But now it's over four trillion last time I checked, and you're like, four trillion?
[00:50:14.768 --> 00:50:16.369]  The whole military budget's only 800 billion now.
[00:50:16.369 --> 00:50:16.469]  Well,
[00:50:20.638 --> 00:50:23.719]  That's because they took all the pension funds, all the investments.
[00:50:23.719 --> 00:50:26.359]  They had comprehensive annual financial reports.
[00:50:26.359 --> 00:50:29.440]  The Pentagon and sub-directorates all had investments.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.280]  They just dumped all those, and they won't even say where they went.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.981]  Of course they're going for martial law.
[00:50:34.981 --> 00:50:37.001]  Of course they're building camps.
[00:50:37.001 --> 00:50:40.261]  The military... Lockheed runs the red light cameras in most cities.
[00:50:40.261 --> 00:50:41.442]  They're training the police.
[00:50:41.442 --> 00:50:43.122]  They're taking over.
[00:50:43.122 --> 00:50:47.963]  It always happens in third world countries, and in Rome, and... I mean, it's real simple.
[00:50:47.963 --> 00:50:48.583]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.281]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:50:57.281 --> 00:50:58.841]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:50:58.841 --> 00:51:00.982]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:00.982 --> 00:51:02.883]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:02.883 --> 00:51:04.383]  The late great USA.
[00:51:04.383 --> 00:51:06.144]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:51:06.144 --> 00:51:13.166]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:52:00.139 --> 00:52:02.901]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:12.090]  Another untold story that you've not been told from another untold story dot com.
[00:52:14.525 --> 00:52:17.167]  Is America now the land of the free?
[00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:21.651]  A dated news article of a few years ago says no, not so free anymore.
[00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:27.796]  The article says, quote, UN drops United States to 13th in world in basic freedoms.
[00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:31.799]  Notes millions have missed out on the increasing national prosperity.
[00:52:31.799 --> 00:52:40.607]  The land of the free and home of the brave is trailing 12 countries in basic freedoms and ranks 7th when it comes to health, education and equal pay.
[00:52:41.207 --> 00:52:58.051]  According to the annual report of the United Nations Development Program released Wednesday in Washington, the United States is in 13th place behind the Scandinavian nations, Germany, Canada and France, in a new Human Freedom Index assessing 88 nations.
[00:52:58.051 --> 00:53:06.613]  A survey on human development progress in 58 countries put the United States behind Japan, Sweden, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway and Canada.
[00:53:07.353 --> 00:53:07.993]  End quote.
[00:53:07.993 --> 00:53:08.814]  And why?
[00:53:08.814 --> 00:53:13.615]  There is something missing in the minds and lives of the Americans.
[00:53:13.615 --> 00:53:16.496]  Something they're not being told about that makes the difference.
[00:53:16.496 --> 00:53:19.817]  We tell you about it at AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:19.817 --> 00:53:29.481]  AnotherUntoldStory.com where we tell you about it and we compare it to the United States of yesterday and the United States of today.

[00:53:47.503 --> 00:53:50.565]  Another untold story dot com.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.681]  Let me just boil it down very simply.
[00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:06.181]  I know you know this, listeners.
[00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:13.384]  Your body is smarter than I am, but for the general public who doesn't know history.
[00:54:13.384 --> 00:54:25.247]  In Rome, in Greece, in Europe, going back thousands of years, in Japan, in Latin America, you can go back 6,000 years, 7,000 years, right through to today.
[00:54:25.247 --> 00:54:29.449]  Generally, new dynasties, even under imperial systems or monarchies,
[00:54:31.283 --> 00:54:33.625]  The new dynasties would be the generals.
[00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:39.208]  They would band together, have a coup, overthrow the king, make themselves a new dynasty.
[00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.569]  Well, now things are scientific.
[00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:41.670]  And World War II happened.
[00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.391]  We came out of the depression that had been staged.
[00:54:43.391 --> 00:54:45.512]  That's been declassified.
[00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:50.275]  The public now trusted the government for the first time in 200 years of American history, of U.S.
[00:54:50.275 --> 00:54:51.156]  history.
[00:54:51.156 --> 00:54:52.376]  That time had been about 170 years of history.
[00:54:56.551 --> 00:55:03.239]  And you had the military industrial complex that Eisenhower and his farewell speech warned us about in 1961.
[00:55:03.239 --> 00:55:14.211]  They went in and took over 90% of research funding, all research funding, science, mathematics, speech, you name it, at the universities.
[00:55:15.524 --> 00:55:23.011]  And then, more than all the university funding in the country, they had black ops and huge, secret technology development systems.
[00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:34.480]  And they charted how the highways were built, and how the signs looked, and what color they were, and what electrical voltage went down the power lines, and grids, and control, and power plants, and built the country up!
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.323]  And a lot of it was good!
[00:55:37.323 --> 00:55:41.687]  But, from the beginning, it was meant for control and to make the U.S.
[00:55:41.687 --> 00:55:43.148]  an armed military camp.
[00:55:44.677 --> 00:55:46.118]  And it's a long strategic plan.
[00:55:46.118 --> 00:55:51.380]  The families that own the private defense contractors and the private banks got more power, more control.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.801]  They consolidated the economy.
[00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:55.943]  They bought up local economies with all this federal money they had.
[00:55:55.943 --> 00:55:58.124]  Everybody would fall over themselves for it.
[00:55:58.124 --> 00:55:59.064]  They leveraged that.
[00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:05.747]  They then put rules on local communities for money they took from us originally.
[00:56:05.747 --> 00:56:10.610]  And now, the red light cameras, the face scanning cameras, the license plate scanning cameras.
[00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.891]  Every major city has thousands of microphones.
[00:56:13.772 --> 00:56:15.953]  Austin has thousands of microphones since 1998.
[00:56:15.953 --> 00:56:21.796]  That's in my film, Police State 2000, released in 99 with Austin American Statesman cover story.
[00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:24.017]  And then the bills, the documents.
[00:56:24.017 --> 00:56:26.678]  You're all being listened to.
[00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:32.641]  And they're now going to shift the economy over to 1 in 10 college grads.
[00:56:32.641 --> 00:56:41.825]  That'll be about 1 in 20, roughly, in the country, will be a spy, a tattletale, a corrections officer, a cop,
[00:56:42.415 --> 00:56:43.756]  We're good to go.
[00:57:05.186 --> 00:57:15.192]  The symbol of energy, the symbol of food, the symbol of gas, the symbol of cars, the symbol of housing, the symbol of everything.
[00:57:15.192 --> 00:57:20.255]  And they are now restricting that, okay, by devaluing it.
[00:57:20.255 --> 00:57:23.037]  That actually restricts how much of it you have.
[00:57:23.037 --> 00:57:23.777]  It's an illusion.
[00:57:23.777 --> 00:57:26.259]  They print more of it, you have more of it, but it's worthless.
[00:57:28.975 --> 00:57:32.096]  And so things are getting worse and worse and more and more predatory.
[00:57:32.096 --> 00:57:33.636]  That puts pressure on you.
[00:57:33.636 --> 00:57:35.396]  They then still pose as the saviors.
[00:57:35.396 --> 00:57:37.717]  You ask them, what do we do to get it better?
[00:57:37.717 --> 00:57:39.617]  They go, more government, more control.
[00:57:39.617 --> 00:57:40.358]  Here's Hillary.
[00:57:40.358 --> 00:57:41.138]  Here's McCain.
[00:57:41.138 --> 00:57:43.098]  Here's Obama.
[00:57:43.098 --> 00:57:44.638]  All of them want open borders.
[00:57:44.638 --> 00:57:49.740]  All of them really want socialized health care and gun control and wars and everything else.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.660]  And so they're just bringing you into the next phase.
[00:57:54.192 --> 00:57:57.315]  As they incrementally turn the heat up in the eugenics program.
[00:57:57.315 --> 00:58:14.228]  And then meanwhile, the private corporations, the private defense companies that are owned by the private Federal Reserve predominantly, they now own the entire infrastructure, the land, and then, oh, a chimpanzee's a human, but it can't talk, so we represent it, we're the government, we're gonna take your property.
[00:58:14.228 --> 00:58:18.512]  Oh, the ducks have rights, but they can't talk, we're gonna take your property.
[00:58:18.512 --> 00:58:21.134]  It's like polar bears, there's more polar bears now than there were 20 years ago.
[00:58:22.011 --> 00:58:24.872]  There's over 40,000 of them in North America.
[00:58:24.872 --> 00:58:27.073]  And, uh, what's 43,000 last time I looked?
[00:58:27.073 --> 00:58:28.333]  Up from 30-something thousand.
[00:58:28.333 --> 00:58:29.754]  They don't care.
[00:58:29.754 --> 00:58:32.095]  They've now listed it as endangered.
[00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:35.336]  They're gonna take your property.
[00:58:35.336 --> 00:58:40.218]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:44.959]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:46.280]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:47.426 --> 00:58:49.186]  A New World Order.
[00:58:49.186 --> 00:58:54.088]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.088 --> 00:58:56.908]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:59.709]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.709 --> 00:59:02.890]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:10.212]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.243 --> 00:59:18.684]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.684 --> 00:59:22.565]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.565 --> 00:59:25.126]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.126 --> 00:59:26.266]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:27.066]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.066 --> 00:59:28.346]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.346 --> 00:59:29.087]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.087 --> 00:59:30.467]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:59:39.952 --> 00:59:41.994]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:41.994 --> 00:59:47.179]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.179 --> 00:59:49.581]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.581 --> 00:59:52.344]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.035 --> 00:59:59.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.377]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.377 --> 01:00:03.298]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.298 --> 01:00:07.121]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.121 --> 01:00:11.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:13.805]  It's really very simple.
[01:00:13.805 --> 01:00:16.827]  Private interest can come in.
[01:00:16.827 --> 01:00:18.348]  I've seen this broken down in different studies.
[01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.150]  It changes year to year.
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:26.173]  For every million dollars a big multinational corporation puts in
[01:00:27.245 --> 01:00:33.067]  To lobbying, they get around $4 billion back.
[01:00:33.067 --> 01:00:43.030]  And then I've seen numbers at the state level for every $1,000 a lobbyist puts in, on average they get about $200,000 back.
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:49.352]  And so they come in, and they've basically bought up almost everything.
[01:00:49.352 --> 01:00:52.493]  There's still pockets of land, pockets of assets they want.
[01:00:52.493 --> 01:00:55.454]  And so they're just gonna jack up oil prices, jack up carbon taxes,
[01:00:57.575 --> 01:01:04.057]  And they're going to destroy all the millionaires and middle class people that the working class thinks are rich.
[01:01:04.057 --> 01:01:12.119]  Some guy making $20,000 a year thinks somebody making $200,000 a year is as filthy rich.
[01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:18.141]  They have no idea that person is really lower middle class with true standard of living.
[01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:24.663]  So most of our wealth has been illusion and it was done to get us under their control and to get real assets.
[01:01:27.113 --> 01:01:32.394]  Let's play this NBC stop-loss piece, because you'd think it was being honest, but it's actually very dishonest.
[01:01:32.394 --> 01:01:33.415]  Here it is.
[01:01:33.415 --> 01:01:35.175]  NBC News in-depth tonight.
[01:01:35.175 --> 01:01:36.355]  Back to the front.
[01:01:36.355 --> 01:01:37.176]  The number of U.S.
[01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:46.278]  soldiers who've had their Iraq military service involuntarily extended under the so-called stop-loss policy is at its highest since the start of the war.
[01:01:46.278 --> 01:01:50.379]  That's despite a Pentagon pledge last year to cut back on its use.
[01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:54.100]  NBC's Jim Miklashefsky takes a look at the effect of this controversial policy.
[01:01:55.669 --> 01:02:02.355]  As Sergeant David White was preparing to wrap up his military career last year, he was stunned when the Army refused to let him go.
[01:02:02.355 --> 01:02:04.777]  I was just in disbelief.
[01:02:04.777 --> 01:02:07.479]  I did not think that something like that could happen to me.
[01:02:07.479 --> 01:02:14.325]  Instead, White was sent to Iraq for his second combat tour, leaving wife Crystal and newborn Eva behind.
[01:02:14.325 --> 01:02:20.871]  What the Army did is slap White with a stop-loss, which allows the Army to extend a soldier's enlistment, like it or not.
[01:02:21.431 --> 01:02:27.857]  I was going to be stuck in the army for an extra year and I was so close to getting out.
[01:02:27.857 --> 01:02:31.480]  58,000 soldiers have been stoplossed in the past six years.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.644]  Their service involuntarily extended from a few months to more than a year.
[01:02:36.644 --> 01:02:37.845]  You kind of felt helpless.
[01:02:37.845 --> 01:02:38.465]  You felt like...
[01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:40.587]  There's really nothing you can do.
[01:02:40.587 --> 01:02:41.887]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:47.230]  Stuart McKenzie's stop loss not only cost him his time, it nearly cost him his life.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.491]  The bomb was about five, five to seven feet away.
[01:02:49.491 --> 01:02:52.112]  Severed my left hand almost completely off.
[01:02:52.112 --> 01:02:54.493]  It was just dangling by some skin.
[01:02:54.493 --> 01:02:58.975]  Army surgeons reattach McKenzie's hand, which now gives him limited use.
[01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.096]  To this day, McKenzie blames the stop loss.
[01:03:02.096 --> 01:03:05.878]  You know, I got hurt right at the end of seven months.
[01:03:05.878 --> 01:03:06.898]  You know?
[01:03:06.898 --> 01:03:07.879]  I was only supposed to be there six.
[01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:17.784]  The Army says it uses stop-loss to keep soldiers who reach the end of enlistment from leaving the battlefield in the middle of a combat tour.
[01:03:17.784 --> 01:03:26.112]  They don't like it any better than I do, but it has proven necessary in order to maintain the force.
[01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:36.441]  But many lawmakers and critics claim the Army has used stop-loss as a backdoor draft to make up for the shortage of soldiers for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:03:37.521 --> 01:03:40.823]  It is going to destroy the morale of our troops.
[01:03:40.823 --> 01:03:43.024]  We've got to stop it.
[01:03:43.024 --> 01:03:48.828]  Senior Army officials predict, however, they'll still need stop-loss at least through the end of next year.
[01:03:48.828 --> 01:03:56.172]  That won't matter to David White, who will finally leave the Army in July, fulfilling his duty, and then some.
[01:03:56.172 --> 01:03:59.594]  Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the Pentagon.
[01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:04.157]  Now, did you hear them say the Army pledged not to do it anymore?
[01:04:05.555 --> 01:04:08.918]  If the government pledges something, you better be assured.
[01:04:08.918 --> 01:04:10.980]  They pledged they didn't do 9-11.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.182]  They pledged there were WMDs.
[01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:16.665]  They pledged fluoride is good for you in the water.
[01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:23.851]  They pledged there wasn't mercury in the vaccines, and then said, oh, we lied, it's in there, but it's good for you.
[01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:32.118]  And now they, the documents have come out, they say tens of millions have been brain damaged, their own internal CDC is public, and doesn't matter, they still call us conspiracy theories in the media.
[01:04:35.774 --> 01:04:36.415]  Just amazing.
[01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:40.597]  Of course, they won't need stop loss soon because the military is going to be felons and illegal aliens.
[01:04:40.597 --> 01:04:42.979]  Already is.
[01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:45.841]  Then they can have their way with us.
[01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:48.002]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman with all the financial news.
[01:04:48.002 --> 01:04:48.443]  Stay with us.
[01:04:50.859 --> 01:05:04.011]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:14.660]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.462]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:05:18.462 --> 01:05:20.224]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:59.367]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:05:59.367 --> 01:06:05.088]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:05.088 --> 01:06:06.569]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:06.569 --> 01:06:15.571]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:15.891 --> 01:06:17.733]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:07:06.679 --> 01:07:08.260]  Bring the wonders of nature home.

[01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:29.881]  Visit us or call 866-497-0274.
[01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:56.352]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.096 --> 01:08:16.478]  In this hour, we're going to cover the war.
[01:08:16.478 --> 01:08:22.982]  We're going to cover things imploding in South Africa, in race riots.
[01:08:22.982 --> 01:08:27.044]  Black against black, black against Pakistani.
[01:08:27.044 --> 01:08:31.547]  Things worse off there than ever, because Bob Chapman happened to live in South Africa.
[01:08:31.547 --> 01:08:32.387]  Also, U.S.
[01:08:32.387 --> 01:08:35.169]  home resales fall massively again.
[01:08:35.169 --> 01:08:38.951]  Talk about what's happening with oil, now above $135 a barrel and rising.
[01:08:44.611 --> 01:08:49.694]  I just said two weeks ago it was going to hit $140,000 by the end of July.
[01:08:49.694 --> 01:08:52.895]  Maybe I should reapprise my prediction and go up even faster.
[01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.117]  See, I think it'll probably go up to $145,000 by the end of July, maybe $150,000.
[01:08:56.117 --> 01:09:02.000]  Then it'll drop back down to $120,000, and you'll think you're lucky getting $120,000 throughout Christmas and the holidays.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.804]  And then, by next summer, not this summer, next summer, I bet it's going to be $200 a barrel, because our owners say so.
[01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:12.906]  They say our standard of living is too high, we're a bunch of spoiled brats.
[01:09:13.664 --> 01:09:15.765]  Man, we have to now be taught how to be third world.
[01:09:15.765 --> 01:09:17.265]  They even say that.
[01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:19.286]  Um, headline, think oil prices hurt now?
[01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:21.747]  Just wait, Reuters.
[01:09:21.747 --> 01:09:24.828]  Got a bunch of news on what's happening with the economy.
[01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.889]  In a story, Bilderberg Luminary to select Obama's running mate.
[01:09:29.076 --> 01:09:32.477]  Bob Chapman worked in military intelligence and counterintelligence.
[01:09:32.477 --> 01:09:35.238]  He then became a very successful broker.
[01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:38.559]  You know, Bob, I know you get tired of talking about yourself, but describe yourself.
[01:09:38.559 --> 01:09:40.940]  There's been a lot of new listeners every hour.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.561]  People tune in every day about the tens of thousands that were new.
[01:09:43.561 --> 01:09:48.423]  Tell us about Bob Chapman and some of the things you did, and let's get into all the news.
[01:09:48.423 --> 01:09:52.924]  Well, first of all, people with high IQs are really strange.
[01:09:52.924 --> 01:09:53.585]  That is true.
[01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:56.306]  We've got to get that in first.
[01:09:56.306 --> 01:09:57.106]  We're not normal.
[01:09:57.788 --> 01:10:03.052]  Anyway, you know, I came from very humble surroundings.
[01:10:03.052 --> 01:10:05.214]  I worked my way through college.
[01:10:05.214 --> 01:10:09.958]  I spent several years in counterintelligence with the government.
[01:10:09.958 --> 01:10:19.246]  In fact, I just got off another program where somebody from the State Department emailed in and commented upon something I had to say.
[01:10:19.246 --> 01:10:24.651]  He said that throughout the State Department, people are drawing mustaches
[01:10:25.613 --> 01:10:31.360]  On the photos of our President and Vice President, which was very illuminating.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.165]  And I went back to him and I said, that's interesting.
[01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:43.335]  And you know, there was a fellow who roomed with me when I was in counterintelligence named Peter Galbraith, who worked for the State Department, which he worked for.
[01:10:44.028 --> 01:10:45.429]  And I said, do you know him?
[01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:47.351]  And he said, he used to be my boss.
[01:10:47.351 --> 01:10:52.936]  But anyway, going forward, I was in the brokerage business for 28 years.
[01:10:52.936 --> 01:11:04.646]  I owned my own firm part of the time, and I've been writing the International Forecaster, I guess is the second or third vocation, for the last almost 20 years.
[01:11:04.646 --> 01:11:07.048]  And I've lived around the world.
[01:11:07.048 --> 01:11:09.530]  I speak several languages.
[01:11:10.323 --> 01:11:15.986]  Um, as Alex pointed out, I lived in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
[01:11:15.986 --> 01:11:22.990]  I lived all over Europe, Central South America, Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, Canada.
[01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:25.572]  And so, I get a lot of experience.
[01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:28.653]  I'm fortunate that I'm 73 to be healthy.
[01:11:28.653 --> 01:11:35.537]  And so I can keep on imparting what I hope is correct prognostications about what is going on.
[01:11:35.537 --> 01:11:37.098]  And incidentally, I've got to fit this in.
[01:11:37.938 --> 01:11:40.879]  Considering what you just said before we went to the break.
[01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:48.882]  And Ed, I got a letter in this morning from a subscriber who said he works in a federal prison in the dietary part.
[01:11:48.882 --> 01:11:58.946]  And he said next week the government is sending their recruiters to try to recruit people to go into the military.
[01:11:58.946 --> 01:12:06.349]  And I went back to him and I said, well what are they going to line up the murderers on one side and tell them you get the best chance of going in?
[01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:10.011]  So anyway, I had to throw that in, Alex.
[01:12:10.011 --> 01:12:13.354]  What level of security did he say this facility is?
[01:12:13.354 --> 01:12:14.015]  Didn't say.
[01:12:14.015 --> 01:12:14.735]  I don't know.
[01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:18.199]  Well, I mean, I was telling people this eight, nine years ago.
[01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:19.420]  It's incredible how time flies.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:26.626]  It was actually in 99 that I learned that they were recruiting, I mean, aggravated felons out of Texas prisons.
[01:12:26.626 --> 01:12:29.368]  I even got documents, but people wouldn't believe me.
[01:12:29.368 --> 01:12:33.252]  And now the biggest Army recruiting center in the world is not in the U.S.
[01:12:33.252 --> 01:12:34.513]  or in a protectorate.
[01:12:35.073 --> 01:12:45.775]  I mean, at this point, Bob Chapman, this government, I have no respect for it, it's bankrupt, and I have confirmed with sources that people inside government are seeing the preparations for martial law
[01:12:58.938 --> 01:12:59.559]  I think what they're
[01:13:28.703 --> 01:13:34.086]  I'm not planning on what they've created, that they can't stop, is a depression.
[01:13:34.086 --> 01:13:48.333]  And the people saying, you know, you gotta support me, you gotta feed me, and the people are losing their homes and their vehicles and their jobs and living under bridges, and people are running around with assault weapons saying, you know, who did this to me?
[01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:50.114]  And I think it's gonna get to that.
[01:13:50.114 --> 01:13:53.736]  And if the military steps in, they're not gonna win.
[01:13:55.757 --> 01:13:58.839]  If they shoot at American people, they are going to lose.
[01:13:58.839 --> 01:14:16.608]  By the way, the scenario in V for Vendetta, where they shoot the little girl who's wearing the mask, and then the people finally riot and start killing the cops, that has happened hundreds of times in the last century, mainly in Eastern Europe and Latin America and other places, and that happened here in 1776.
[01:14:16.608 --> 01:14:21.470]  That's how fast it can happen, Bob, and I don't want that to happen!
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:22.991]  And that's why we're on the air, Alex.
[01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:27.627]  To try to cut these guys off at the pass.
[01:14:27.627 --> 01:14:34.588]  But Bob, from living in these third world countries and living in war zones and knowing what you did in the military that I know you can't talk about, how do you see if it does go bad?
[01:14:34.588 --> 01:14:40.329]  And unfortunately the cards lean towards that right now really bad.
[01:14:40.329 --> 01:14:41.630]  What will it unravel like?
[01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:45.250]  What will civil war look like?
[01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:50.271]  You don't even want to see shooting, never mind dead bodies all over the place.
[01:14:50.271 --> 01:14:52.692]  I mean, you know, people can't handle it emotionally.
[01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:59.198]  People will be committing suicide, you know, rather than face somebody else shooting them.
[01:14:59.198 --> 01:15:00.759]  Or starving.
[01:15:00.759 --> 01:15:02.560]  I mean, look what they've done with food prices.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.382]  People are starving all over the world.
[01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:10.065]  Because they gotta have ethanol.
[01:15:10.065 --> 01:15:11.787]  It's not gonna be good.
[01:15:11.787 --> 01:15:15.289]  And you can't... You don't know what it's gonna be like until you get there.
[01:15:15.289 --> 01:15:17.951]  All I can tell you is it's not going to be nice.
[01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:19.632]  And that is the understatement of the year.
[01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:23.879]  Ask any veteran out there.
[01:15:23.879 --> 01:15:31.609]  Some of you veterans, call in and tell us what it was like in Vietnam, or in the Second World War.
[01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:36.336]  And maybe these people will get the message, you know, this is not some sort of a video game.
[01:15:38.903 --> 01:15:40.705]  I think you just hit the crux of the problem.
[01:15:40.705 --> 01:15:57.262]  Americans have become spectators in the bleachers, watching their neighbor get drugged off by the SWAT team, watching CPS take their co-workers' children for no reason, watching Friends and OJ2 and all of it, and they think it's a video game.
[01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:57.863]  No, no, no.
[01:15:57.863 --> 01:15:59.785]  This is a real world.
[01:15:59.785 --> 01:16:02.027]  This is a real government building FEMA camps.
[01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:12.632]  This is the 1930s in Europe all over again.
[01:16:12.632 --> 01:16:16.754]  And you still say... This time they're going to pick on everybody.
[01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:20.877]  And you think, you still think two to three years till total implosion?
[01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:33.744]  That's a good shot at it because I think they can keep the financial system humming to some degree and to keep the banks and other financial houses from going under for that period of time.
[01:16:33.744 --> 01:16:35.505]  But the key to the whole thing is
[01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:39.542]  The non-usage of money and credit.
[01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:42.825]  When that happens, deflation's going to take over.
[01:16:42.825 --> 01:16:48.589]  The caveat within that time frame is, are they going to invade another country?
[01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:50.250]  Are they going to have a draft?
[01:16:50.250 --> 01:17:02.118]  Are they going to ship our kids and grandkids out of the country and make people more fearful of having a war and losing their lives than they are at home not eating?
[01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:15.406]  I mean, this is a tried and true historical fact that dictator after dictator, oppressive government after one after another, have done this.
[01:17:15.406 --> 01:17:25.449]  It sticks out like a sore thumb in history.
[01:17:25.449 --> 01:17:27.550]  Bob, I'm looking for an article.
[01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:28.730]  I had my stack.
[01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:29.971]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:17:31.923 --> 01:17:41.593]  A government study, they have another university study saying that 7 million people starved to death during the Great Depression from 1929 until the 1938 or so and it's just
[01:17:49.972 --> 01:17:57.194]  Just amazing that 7 million starved then, when we were 85-90% agrarian and self-sufficient.
[01:17:57.194 --> 01:18:04.975]  We're now 90% living in cities, 10% in the country, with only 5%, half of that 10%, being self-sufficient.
[01:18:04.975 --> 01:18:10.336]  My God, if we had another depression, it would just be total societal breakdown.
[01:18:10.336 --> 01:18:13.937]  And it'll happen in many other countries as well.
[01:18:13.937 --> 01:18:16.138]  Some countries will be spared because they have
[01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:22.271]  The ability to be able to grow crops.
[01:18:22.271 --> 01:18:25.813]  But, you know, you take a place like Europe, it's going to be upside down.
[01:18:25.813 --> 01:18:35.920]  Canada, I mean, they don't have favorable weather and they have populations that can get out of control just like anybody else.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.582]  I mean, nobody has a monopoly on sanity.
[01:18:44.247 --> 01:18:52.909]  Bob Chapman, talk about oil, dollar devaluation, what's going on currently and what do you think is going to happen in the short term?
[01:18:52.909 --> 01:19:02.250]  Short term, we may form a double top here at $136 and retrench back to say $100 to $125.
[01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:07.811]  These are technical thought patterns I'm talking about now.
[01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:12.172]  Because markets go up, they go back, they settle, and then they see if they can go higher again.
[01:19:12.851 --> 01:19:17.352]  Um, I think, like you said earlier, $145.50 is very doable here.
[01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:26.294]  So it may clock up another $15 or $20, go to $150, and what they call in the brokerage business, back and fill.
[01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:30.015]  And it may do that, but... Okay, explain that when we get back.
[01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:36.857]  And by the way, $150 barrel in oil means $5 to $6, depending on where you are in the country, per gallon of gas.
[01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:39.929]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:19:39.929 --> 01:19:50.774]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:50.774 --> 01:19:52.355]  Ted Anders, Formidas, May 23, 2008, gold, 927.11.
[01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:55.556]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for 954.11, 469.90 for half, 234.95 for quarter.
[01:19:55.556 --> 01:19:56.056]  That's 954.11, 469.90, and 234.95.
[01:20:06.061 --> 01:20:12.005]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:20:12.005 --> 01:20:16.587]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a Yan revolution.
[01:20:16.587 --> 01:20:24.992]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:27.534]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:31.838]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:20:31.838 --> 01:20:38.505]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:42.048]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.048 --> 01:20:45.252]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:45.252 --> 01:20:45.552]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.552 --> 01:20:45.732]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.593 --> 01:20:55.374]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:55.374 --> 01:21:00.395]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:00.395 --> 01:21:05.876]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:05.876 --> 01:21:16.338]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:21.240]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.021]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:24.021 --> 01:21:27.603]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:27.603 --> 01:21:40.109]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:48.613]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:50.574]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:51.854]  Why should we fire Congress?
[01:21:51.854 --> 01:21:55.476]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[01:21:55.476 --> 01:21:57.777]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[01:21:57.777 --> 01:22:00.598]  That was their employment document.
[01:22:00.598 --> 01:22:01.658]  They haven't followed it.
[01:22:01.658 --> 01:22:03.559]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[01:22:03.559 --> 01:22:05.440]  Washington, you're fired!
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.981]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:14.369]  Washington You're Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[01:22:14.369 --> 01:22:27.644]  Washington You're Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the President's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills.
[01:22:27.904 --> 01:22:30.405]  How they affect you and what you can do about it.
[01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:34.788]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston tea party.
[01:22:34.788 --> 01:22:38.630]  Kem Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:40.531]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:42.092]  Help take back our government now.

[01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:56.728]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:23:56.728 --> 01:23:59.510]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:05.995]  Coming up at about 45 after, we're going to go to Paul Watson from England.
[01:24:11.999 --> 01:24:14.621]  A mentally ill person they claim controlled by Al Qaeda.
[01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:16.362]  It's always a mentally ill person.
[01:24:16.362 --> 01:24:18.784]  Always in government facilities beforehand.
[01:24:18.784 --> 01:24:23.108]  Had a tiny bomb and it blew up like a smoke bomb and cut his eyebrow.
[01:24:23.108 --> 01:24:36.799]  Then the whole country's locked down with fear and crying and gnashing of teeth because a cherry bomb with some nails on it, a firecracker with some nails on it, cut someone's eyebrow that set it off in front of their face.
[01:24:38.175 --> 01:24:40.257]  And we just gotta give all our rights up.
[01:24:40.257 --> 01:24:44.500]  It happened one day after they were in trouble for staging some anti-terror stuff.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.762]  And they just send their mentally ill person out to do it.
[01:24:46.762 --> 01:24:47.802]  And all their hyping of terror.
[01:24:47.802 --> 01:24:50.445]  I'm surprised there's not more real loons out bombing.
[01:24:50.445 --> 01:24:53.607]  But this guy's got all the government earmarks.
[01:24:53.607 --> 01:24:59.792]  Bob Chapman, where do you see gold going?
[01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:05.716]  I mean, if all the other commodities are skyrocketing, I'm surprised that it's not at 2,000 by now.
[01:25:05.716 --> 01:25:06.637]  How are they holding it down?
[01:25:08.089 --> 01:25:10.531]  Well, there's a number of ways.
[01:25:10.531 --> 01:25:14.553]  I think they still probably have the gold bullion to sell.
[01:25:14.553 --> 01:25:20.116]  They also buy puts, which means you're going to bet that gold's going to go down.
[01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:27.441]  They also can sell futures contracts, which would put pressure downward on gold prices.
[01:25:27.441 --> 01:25:37.647]  And it's my suspicion that this gold ETF, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is lending gold to the United States government because
[01:25:38.237 --> 01:25:49.163]  The company that manages the ETF is JPMorgan Chase, and they are used by the government to interfere in the market.
[01:25:49.163 --> 01:25:56.368]  And I think that is where some of the gold is coming from that is being sold into the market and then bought back again.
[01:25:56.368 --> 01:26:07.374]  And they know that they can't keep the price down indefinitely, but what they can do is interrupt the forward movement of the price from time to time.
[01:26:08.075 --> 01:26:13.777]  And that's why, as we go on further, you're going to see even greater volatility in gold and silver.
[01:26:13.777 --> 01:26:15.458]  It's not going to stop.
[01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:25.842]  And if you base gold prices on 1980 official inflation figures, gold should be selling at $2,268 an ounce.
[01:26:25.842 --> 01:26:27.362]  But we all know that 19... Selling at $9.25.
[01:26:27.362 --> 01:26:29.463]  It's selling at $9.25, instead of half the price.
[01:26:29.463 --> 01:26:30.283]  Why, Bob, or less than half?
[01:26:36.089 --> 01:26:39.712]  Now, that's official inflation.
[01:26:39.712 --> 01:26:40.712]  I know you've broken down.
[01:26:40.712 --> 01:26:45.576]  What's real inflation in 2008 versus 1980 numbers?
[01:26:45.576 --> 01:26:56.083]  Well, the best figures I've seen come from Jim Turk, who is a former banker and writes about this sort of thing like I do.
[01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:58.265]  And he's talking something like $645, $6,450 an ounce.
[01:26:58.265 --> 01:26:59.446]  And I think he's probably right.
[01:27:04.742 --> 01:27:07.963]  I've said gold's going over $3,000.
[01:27:07.963 --> 01:27:13.445]  I didn't attempt to pick out a number because it's early, and I don't have to do that.
[01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:24.150]  All I know is it's going higher, so you keep on buying it, and if you don't, you're going to be stuck because the value of all the other things that you have is going to go down.
[01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:30.332]  So you have to offset those losses by making gains someplace, and you can do that in gold and silver.
[01:27:33.149 --> 01:27:49.714]  But if oil is... I mean, all the mainstream media, 95% of the time, you do see it on a few shows here and there, but most of the mainstream media stays away from admitting that most of the oil price increase is that it's dollar-denominated and the dollar is tanking.
[01:27:49.714 --> 01:27:53.635]  And now I see the foreign press, they're admitting that's the main culprit.
[01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.536]  A, can you elaborate on that?
[01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:58.877]  And then B, what are some of the other reasons oil's exploding?
[01:27:58.877 --> 01:28:01.818]  Well, first of all, it used to be a great secret, but now they're admitting it.
[01:28:03.099 --> 01:28:04.920]  They're right, yes, finally.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.622]  They were forced to because of people like me writing about it.
[01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:16.305]  The second thing is that in the price of oil, about one-third of that price is through speculation, no question.
[01:28:16.305 --> 01:28:18.146]  And why is that speculation happening?
[01:28:18.146 --> 01:28:25.349]  It's because our president keeps on trying to find a way to turn Iran into a parking lot.
[01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:31.752]  And so as long as you have that sort of Damocles hanging over the oil market,
[01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:35.473]  You're going to have speculation, and rightly so.
[01:28:35.473 --> 01:28:44.742]  And I know everybody doesn't like paying more for gasoline, whether you're in Thailand or in New York City, but that's just the way it is.
[01:28:44.742 --> 01:28:56.534]  And by Congress, well the House of Representatives yesterday came out and said, we're going to bring anti-trust laws against these OPEC people for fixing the price of oil and
[01:28:57.506 --> 01:29:00.208]  And we're going to start fining them and this sort of thing.
[01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:02.489]  I never saw anything so stupid in my life.
[01:29:02.489 --> 01:29:03.270]  That's a red herring.
[01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:05.691]  The little pickle says, would you stop shipping your oil?
[01:29:05.691 --> 01:29:08.113]  How's that?
[01:29:08.113 --> 01:29:13.236]  Yeah, it's a cartel outside their control and they're also blaming the oil companies.
[01:29:13.236 --> 01:29:18.939]  When, Bob, isn't their profit set at 8-9% and they don't have anything to do with this?
[01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:22.762]  Well, I don't know about the setting of profits, but they're making more than that.
[01:29:22.762 --> 01:29:26.364]  And they've always been manipulating the oil price, the big companies.
[01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:28.816]  Both in London and New York.
[01:29:28.816 --> 01:29:31.877]  So you're saying some of the blame does go on the oil companies?
[01:29:31.877 --> 01:29:34.998]  It does, but not as much as it does on the other two factors.
[01:29:34.998 --> 01:29:36.459]  Yeah, that's the point.
[01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:41.180]  I mean, I'm not saying they're not scoundrels, but the point is they're not the main culprit.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:42.580]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.121]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:47.802]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.945 --> 01:29:52.066]  Storable food!
[01:29:52.066 --> 01:29:53.087]  Storable food!
[01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:57.290]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.
[01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:08.500]  Hemp, known around the world, will boost your immune system and increase energy levels, detoxifies the body and reduces junk food cravings, burns fat and builds muscle, and is easy to digest, non-allergenic, and gluten-free.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.623]  Can be made into smoothies, breads, muffins, pancakes, cookies, you name it!
[01:30:12.623 --> 01:30:15.446]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[01:30:15.446 --> 01:30:17.267]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall.
[01:30:17.267 --> 01:30:19.229]  The powder will feed the body vital minerals.
[01:30:19.409 --> 01:30:19.709]  I think so.
[01:30:43.303 --> 01:30:46.524]  908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:51.206]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[01:30:51.206 --> 01:30:52.626]  It is a big idea.
[01:30:52.626 --> 01:30:55.447]  A new world order.
[01:30:55.447 --> 01:30:59.809]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:31:00.356 --> 01:31:03.158]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:05.939]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:31:05.939 --> 01:31:09.121]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:31:09.121 --> 01:31:16.445]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:31:19.489 --> 01:31:24.913]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:31:24.913 --> 01:31:28.315]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:55.630]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:55.630 --> 01:32:00.652]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:32:00.652 --> 01:32:06.953]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[01:32:06.953 --> 01:32:11.414]  We promote a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.

[01:32:53.894 --> 01:32:56.896]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:32:56.896 --> 01:33:06.322]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:06.322 --> 01:33:18.510]  By the way, I talked to one of my friends at Sunday's showing of Truth Rising that won't be out until July 4th for PrisonPlanet.tv members, then of course on DVD for everybody else who wants it.
[01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.612]  And she'd been visiting family in Germany.
[01:33:20.612 --> 01:33:20.912]  In fact,
[01:33:21.783 --> 01:33:22.944]  I gave her number to my producer.
[01:33:22.944 --> 01:33:26.687]  I need to get her on Monday or Tuesday.
[01:33:26.687 --> 01:33:30.329]  And she was coming back, and they thumb scan U.S.
[01:33:30.329 --> 01:33:32.211]  citizens and all foreigners.
[01:33:32.211 --> 01:33:37.875]  And see, notice when you go to all foreign countries now that are Western, they take your thumbprints and biometric face scan.
[01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:41.377]  That's all part of an international agreement from 2000.
[01:33:41.377 --> 01:33:43.219]  Fingerprint registry and housing bill.
[01:33:43.219 --> 01:33:45.941]  Now they have one for all Americans to be fingerprinted.
[01:33:45.941 --> 01:33:47.362]  See, we're all criminals.
[01:33:48.355 --> 01:33:55.178]  Bob Chapman, all over the country they're announcing now, federally funded, that police are going to take blood at checkpoints now.
[01:33:55.178 --> 01:34:00.440]  Now they're going to get in our space, get, you know, past that extreme boundary.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:08.664]  Imagine an old Nazi Germany, a movie about that, black and white, if the Germans would have been sucking people's bloods on train.
[01:34:08.664 --> 01:34:12.365]  I mean, imagine that image of the Germans at checkpoints taking blood.
[01:34:12.365 --> 01:34:14.026]  How crazy does this have to get, Bob?
[01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:24.241]  Well, I think, you know, the world works on its stomach, and the kicker is going to be when we head into depression.
[01:34:24.241 --> 01:34:26.842]  And finally people are going to say, I can't take it anymore.
[01:34:28.003 --> 01:34:29.984]  I don't have a job, etc.
[01:34:29.984 --> 01:34:32.906]  And that's going to be the trigger.
[01:34:32.906 --> 01:34:34.546]  Bob, exactly, they know that.
[01:34:34.546 --> 01:34:35.727]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:34:35.727 --> 01:34:37.628]  Why are they doing saturation patrols?
[01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:39.348]  Why are they running more checkpoints?
[01:34:39.348 --> 01:34:40.729]  Why are they pulling families out?
[01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:43.650]  Why are they telling cops to be more aggressive?
[01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:46.352]  Do they think they're trying to intimidate us before the Depression?
[01:34:46.352 --> 01:34:49.473]  Or are they trying to make us fight back?
[01:34:49.473 --> 01:34:51.994]  No, I think they're trying to intimidate.
[01:34:51.994 --> 01:34:55.536]  I don't think they're lining people up to fight back because
[01:34:56.198 --> 01:34:59.000]  Most people don't do that unless they absolutely have to.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.082]  But I was about to say, it's not intimidating people.
[01:35:01.082 --> 01:35:05.164]  Everybody I know is just going lunatic crazy.
[01:35:05.164 --> 01:35:09.868]  Well, they're having the opposite effect and then perhaps they'll stop it.
[01:35:09.868 --> 01:35:12.049]  You know, they experiment with different things.
[01:35:12.049 --> 01:35:20.755]  You know, they don't know how certain things, they guess, but they don't know how certain things are going to work within this public sphere.
[01:35:20.755 --> 01:35:21.916]  So they experiment.
[01:35:24.867 --> 01:35:28.670]  You think the average cop, because I know the average cop isn't a bad person, the system's bad.
[01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:32.472]  Do you think an average cop realizes how they're being manipulated too, Bob?
[01:35:32.472 --> 01:35:33.573]  I think a lot of them do.
[01:35:33.573 --> 01:35:35.294]  I don't know what the numbers are.
[01:35:35.294 --> 01:35:37.616]  And I think they're very disturbed about it.
[01:35:37.616 --> 01:35:41.679]  And I think that probably 80% will not follow orders.
[01:35:41.679 --> 01:35:44.080]  And I'm hoping that that's so.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.181]  Maybe it's wishful thinking.
[01:35:45.181 --> 01:35:47.983]  And I think the same thing is true with the military.
[01:35:47.983 --> 01:35:53.967]  I do not think, you know, 80% will not participate unless they're shot at or something.
[01:35:54.753 --> 01:35:59.558]  And then they've got to shoot back, you know, to defend their lives.
[01:35:59.558 --> 01:36:02.462]  But I think that what you're going to see...
[01:36:03.537 --> 01:36:05.339]  Uh, it's more and more of what we're getting.
[01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:06.480]  It's a police state.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.421]  There's just no two ways about it.
[01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:11.544]  Bob, I thought you were right about that, and that's what was my view.
[01:36:11.544 --> 01:36:17.189]  Until Katrina, as long as they've got some cover or excuse, like, why aren't we shipping food in?
[01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:19.251]  Or why is it there, we're not giving it to them?
[01:36:19.251 --> 01:36:21.313]  Or why aren't we getting old people out of nursing homes?
[01:36:21.313 --> 01:36:24.555]  Why are we out confiscating guns with most of our manpower?
[01:36:24.555 --> 01:36:28.759]  And the troops are on the news going, I don't like confiscating guns in America, but I do it!
[01:36:30.843 --> 01:36:32.004]  So, I don't know.
[01:36:32.004 --> 01:36:47.411]  Well, confiscating guns and perhaps moving people around is one thing, but being told that mob over there has to be put down and there's no other way we can do it except shoot them all, that's another story.
[01:36:47.411 --> 01:36:51.113]  I agree, and I read Pentagon documents from 30 years ago.
[01:36:51.113 --> 01:36:52.994]  The last few years, we've read them on air.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.321]  Well, they'll be somewhat successful.
[01:37:17.611 --> 01:37:29.340]  But you gotta look at the whole picture, and I'm sure that the planners at Rand Corporation and places like that throughout the world are looking at this, and that is that you start shooting people, then people start shooting back.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:30.261]  That's what I was about to say!
[01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:38.667]  There's 450 million guns in the United States, and there's probably 125 million people who know how to use them effectively.
[01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:40.389]  Do you really think that the police
[01:37:41.136 --> 01:37:43.997]  And any army stands a chance against the public?
[01:37:43.997 --> 01:37:44.858]  I don't think so.
[01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.098]  Well, that's what you're right.
[01:37:46.098 --> 01:37:59.845]  And that's why the image of them shooting us with rubber bullets in one of the plans was, RAND Corporation from the 70s, was that the image of rubber bullets and the image of flashes gets the public ready to see people being shot.
[01:37:59.845 --> 01:38:01.145]  But there's one problem.
[01:38:01.145 --> 01:38:08.989]  When mama and daddy don't come home, or when your son or daughter doesn't come home, there's a big percentage of people
[01:38:09.449 --> 01:38:12.972]  And you're right, out of 100 million gun owners, 1% fights back, that's a million.
[01:38:12.972 --> 01:38:18.556]  You start killing people's kids, you're going to have like 20-30% that are going to come out looking to kill people.
[01:38:18.556 --> 01:38:19.677]  Guaranteed!
[01:38:19.677 --> 01:38:21.898]  And they're going to come and they're going to kill.
[01:38:21.898 --> 01:38:30.004]  And I hope the government realizes that once they cross that Rubicon, once they make us fight them, they're going to get their butt kicked, Bob.
[01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:34.788]  Yeah, and the people who are going to, you know, we know who's doing what to whom.
[01:38:34.788 --> 01:38:36.589]  And we're just going to go in and clean them out.
[01:38:37.938 --> 01:38:40.158]  And I'm not talking about the military and the government.
[01:38:40.158 --> 01:38:42.739]  I'm talking about the people behind the scenes.
[01:38:42.739 --> 01:38:49.500]  And they know that there's people like us out there who know who the culprits are.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.421]  And they're going to be brought to justice.
[01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:54.201]  And they're terrified of that.
[01:38:54.201 --> 01:39:05.463]  And that's borne out by the program I saw on CNBC this morning of Pete Peterson and David Walker talking about, my lord, my lord, what are we supposed to do?
[01:39:05.463 --> 01:39:06.663]  The system is falling apart.
[01:39:07.527 --> 01:39:08.868]  And they're terrified.
[01:39:08.868 --> 01:39:15.933]  And they're terrified because they know that if the system falls apart, everybody's going to say, well, gee, how did that happen?
[01:39:15.933 --> 01:39:28.421]  And then all of this looting and corruption and thievery that's gone on for so many years and who did it and how they got their fortunes, they're all going to get them taken away from them and they're going to sit in jail.
[01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:29.521]  And they're just terrified.
[01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:31.623]  They don't know what to do about it.
[01:39:31.623 --> 01:39:33.404]  And they're trying to blame the public for being
[01:39:34.108 --> 01:39:38.611]  Yeah, I've been studying this constantly for 15 years, Bob, and I can barely grasp the basics.
[01:39:38.611 --> 01:39:44.616]  I mean, you've been doing this your whole life, and aren't there whole areas of finance I would imagine you've got to check in with other experts?
[01:40:00.044 --> 01:40:06.147]  And it's a very complex thing because derivatives are all different.
[01:40:06.147 --> 01:40:07.207]  They're made to order.
[01:40:07.207 --> 01:40:10.409]  It's just like going and getting a suit made.
[01:40:10.409 --> 01:40:14.271]  You know, if you're a 48 long, I mean, you're a big fat guy.
[01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:20.480]  Uh, Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.981]  You can go there and get a free e-version of it.
[01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:27.563]  It goes out a couple times a week or twice a month in a hard, black, you know, paper format.
[01:40:27.563 --> 01:40:28.624]  Uh, very high quality.
[01:40:28.624 --> 01:40:30.144]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:40:30.144 --> 01:40:31.985]  Great intel on a host of issues.
[01:40:31.985 --> 01:40:35.327]  I want to get into South Africa, what's happening there, but first I want to get into housing.
[01:40:35.327 --> 01:40:42.751]  The housing numbers that came out and some of the other financial and, um, economic numbers we're getting, what do they mean?
[01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:46.012]  Well, we get an inventory of unsold homes that just jumped 10.5 percent.
[01:40:47.628 --> 01:40:52.189]  To an 11.2 month supply, the highest since records began.
[01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:59.731]  A single family home inventories of 10.7 months, the highest since 1985.
[01:40:59.731 --> 01:41:03.672]  And for condos, 14.2 months.
[01:41:03.672 --> 01:41:09.054]  Now we're seeing a little bounce coming in San Diego and Fort Myers.
[01:41:09.054 --> 01:41:11.454]  That'll be a dead cat bounce.
[01:41:11.454 --> 01:41:13.335]  And that means that it'll be a false
[01:41:15.674 --> 01:41:18.657]  So that's bargain hunters snapping up things?
[01:41:18.657 --> 01:41:21.699]  Yeah, and they're wrong.
[01:41:21.699 --> 01:41:26.323]  But most of them are not professionals.
[01:41:26.323 --> 01:41:30.167]  And the reason that they're wrong is that prices are going to go lower.
[01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:32.408]  In some areas, not much lower.
[01:41:32.408 --> 01:41:36.392]  San Diego and Fort Myers, as an example, might go 5 or 10 percent lower.
[01:41:36.392 --> 01:41:38.033]  That should do it for them.
[01:41:38.033 --> 01:41:41.396]  But there's whole areas of California and Nevada and Maryland
[01:41:42.152 --> 01:41:47.396]  Even in New England and New York City, it hasn't been really wrapped at the high end yet.
[01:41:47.396 --> 01:41:58.603]  And so there's going to be another full year, the worst full year, of subprime ALTA loan failures coming up.
[01:41:58.603 --> 01:42:04.787]  And so these figures I just gave you are going to be ten times worse by this time next year.
[01:42:04.787 --> 01:42:09.470]  And on top of it, what nobody talks about is the pick and pay loans, which are
[01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:11.710]  Let me ask you a question, Bob.
[01:42:33.841 --> 01:42:42.208]  If there are 15 million homes that people have already walked away from, that's the number I saw last week, A, is that accurate from what you know?
[01:42:42.208 --> 01:42:50.915]  And B is what's, I know it's plunging, but it's some parachute or kind of a streamer slowing down your fall a bit.
[01:42:52.044 --> 01:43:19.863]  Uh, that a lot of people I know are still demanding all this money for a house or a condo or an office building, and they admit that it's been a year, two years, three years, nobody's coming and leasing it, they're just stubbornly keeping it and paying the taxes, but a lot of them now, I'm starting to see even in Austin, supposedly the best real estate market in the country, it's finally softening by 10, 15 points just in the last month or so, and so I'm worried that they've had this false sense of confidence, and then, so when it goes, it's really gonna go.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:28.466]  It'll be expedited, and the framework is there for four and a half years.
[01:43:28.466 --> 01:43:36.492]  So, we're in the middle of 08, you're looking at 12, 2012, and then we'll probably hit bottom.
[01:43:36.492 --> 01:43:41.536]  And then we'll probably go sideways on the bottom for 5 to 15 years.
[01:43:41.536 --> 01:43:43.017]  There's no telling how long.
[01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:45.059]  Just like Japan, but much worse than Japan?
[01:43:50.914 --> 01:43:52.616]  No, not as bad as Japan.
[01:43:52.616 --> 01:43:54.057]  Oh, not even as bad?
[01:43:54.057 --> 01:44:01.943]  I think what you're going to see, Japan, we saw land prices down 80 to 90 percent, house prices down 70 to 80.
[01:44:01.943 --> 01:44:12.231]  I think what we'll see, what we saw in the Depression in America, the loss of values of anywhere between 40 and 60 percent.
[01:44:12.231 --> 01:44:15.294]  But that's horrid in itself.
[01:44:15.294 --> 01:44:18.496]  Probably 75 percent of builders will go bankrupt.
[01:44:18.496 --> 01:44:20.378]  That's why I have all those short positions.
[01:44:21.167 --> 01:44:25.890]  On builders and associated businesses.
[01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:28.191]  And we're not finished with this thing yet.
[01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:37.237]  When Washington or Wall Street tells you, well, half the credit crisis or three quarters of the credit crisis, of all of it, it's over, they're lying!
[01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:39.058]  They want the market to go up so they can make money!
[01:44:39.058 --> 01:44:44.982]  Well, this is the same crowd that is telling us that inflation is at 6%.
[01:44:48.405 --> 01:44:49.646]  No, they're telling us it's 3.9.
[01:44:49.646 --> 01:44:54.970]  You know, I'm telling you, it's 12 and 5 eighths percent.
[01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:58.453]  And that M3 money in credit is 18 percent.
[01:44:58.453 --> 01:45:04.798]  I hear Congress and others say it's 6, 7 percent, and the Federal Reserve still says it's 3 percent.
[01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:05.819]  What numbers?
[01:45:05.819 --> 01:45:10.423]  I mean, now they're going off the CPI and another, but how do they even have that fake?
[01:45:10.423 --> 01:45:13.345]  I mean, even with their fake numbers, they don't agree.
[01:45:13.345 --> 01:45:13.726]  That's right.
[01:45:14.782 --> 01:45:29.749]  And it's starting to be widely questioned because of work by myself and John Williams, and a couple of other entities, but knowing that everybody's afraid to touch it, because they're afraid they'll end up with a hole in their head.
[01:45:29.749 --> 01:45:41.754]  That's what this is all about, and of course within the structure, where the analysts and the economists are, and the insurance companies and banks and Wall Street and government, they don't dare speak out because they'll lose their jobs!
[01:45:42.779 --> 01:45:45.820]  But they know... In the same spot the police are in.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:51.801]  You say, you know, I don't want to go through those exercises, I don't want to shoot my fellow Austinites.
[01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:53.181]  And they're going to say, good, goodbye.
[01:45:53.181 --> 01:46:00.463]  It's the same thing.
[01:46:00.463 --> 01:46:04.104]  Well, you know, the larger problem, Bob Chapman, is that
[01:46:05.203 --> 01:46:07.524]  There is no light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:46:07.524 --> 01:46:21.731]  Instead of them trying to do some of the things that have been recommended by you and other experts, to try to lessen the crash landing, it seems they're throwing coal into the furnace on the runaway train to get it going even faster over the cliff.
[01:46:21.731 --> 01:46:26.873]  In order to keep it from going, because they're not prepared for it.
[01:46:26.873 --> 01:46:30.935]  They started it, and the Middle East went upside down on them.
[01:46:32.236 --> 01:46:37.939]  And you just read Zbigniew Brzezinski's writings of the past three years.
[01:46:37.939 --> 01:46:46.443]  He's got his hand on his head saying, oh my gosh, they put world government back 30 years.
[01:46:46.443 --> 01:46:47.384]  They're in a pickle.
[01:46:47.384 --> 01:46:48.524]  They don't know how to get out.
[01:46:48.524 --> 01:46:50.205]  They're trapped.
[01:46:50.205 --> 01:46:53.067]  Ordered Out of K.O.
[01:46:53.067 --> 01:46:55.228]  is their favorite maxim.
[01:46:55.228 --> 01:46:57.929]  And as you said, they always want to start a war.
[01:46:57.929 --> 01:47:01.171]  That's kind of like overturning the chessboard, throwing a fit.
[01:47:02.049 --> 01:47:06.052]  Uh, just briefly, because we're out of time, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:09.954]  South Africa is in riots, military, mass killings.
[01:47:09.954 --> 01:47:22.382]  The black South Africans are attacking now other black groups that have come in from other countries, and they're attacking Arab and Middle Eastern and Central Asian groups, and they're reporting that strikes are so bad that
[01:47:22.995 --> 01:47:28.238]  The power's getting turned off, plants are shut down, mines are shut down.
[01:47:28.238 --> 01:47:36.021]  From all the data I see coming out of South Africa, which you have a lot of friends there and live there, and you watch it closely, is South Africa unraveling?
[01:47:36.021 --> 01:47:37.382]  Yes it is.
[01:47:37.382 --> 01:47:45.226]  All of the things left behind by the, we'll call it the white government, have been used up.
[01:47:45.226 --> 01:47:50.989]  And they, the government now, which is Marxist, they don't know how to recreate things.
[01:47:51.505 --> 01:47:58.190]  So now they're taking things away from the companies that are well run to the left, not only in mining but insurance.
[01:47:58.190 --> 01:48:02.873]  I mean, a white person finds it very, very difficult to get any kind of a job.
[01:48:02.873 --> 01:48:11.519]  So all of the young people have to leave the country and go to England or America or wherever to get themselves employed.
[01:48:11.519 --> 01:48:18.184]  And so you have this race discrimination by the blacks against the whites.
[01:48:18.932 --> 01:48:23.556]  And they think that everything should belong to them, uh, because they're there.
[01:48:23.556 --> 01:48:31.602]  And then when people come in from Zimbabwe, and because their government's even worse at this stage, I don't have to go into detail, you all know what it's like.
[01:48:31.602 --> 01:48:34.784]  And I lived there for three years, I had a business there.
[01:48:34.784 --> 01:48:37.846]  And, uh, in Salisbury, which is now called Harare.
[01:48:37.846 --> 01:48:46.913]  And, uh, you're talking somewhere between three and five million people who have left Zimbabwe to go to South Africa to get enough
[01:48:48.038 --> 01:48:51.262]  Money so they can feed themselves.
[01:48:51.262 --> 01:49:05.076]  And the South Africans, some of whom are from the same tribes, are upset that the others are coming in, taking their jobs, getting paid less, and they're taking jobs away from them.
[01:49:05.723 --> 01:49:07.864]  Sort of like what we have with illegal aliens.
[01:49:07.864 --> 01:49:09.085]  See, that's the thing.
[01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:17.148]  Historically, the government acts like multiculturalism and injecting masses of foreigners, that it's bad to not want that.
[01:49:17.148 --> 01:49:19.369]  It is hurting the black South Africans.
[01:49:19.369 --> 01:49:27.473]  The country is falling apart, having millions of starving people running from the lunatic, the communists north of them.
[01:49:27.993 --> 01:49:30.235]  I mean, what do you expect people to do?
[01:49:30.235 --> 01:49:31.276]  It's the same thing here.
[01:49:31.276 --> 01:49:37.921]  It's just going to get... And I see on every front the whole world going into what we see happening.
[01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:39.823]  I think you're right.
[01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:48.670]  Because almost every country has a group of people who have moved in that don't share the same culture.
[01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:51.433]  And whenever you have that, you have conflict.
[01:49:51.433 --> 01:49:55.216]  It's usually religious, and sometimes it's ethnic.
[01:49:55.216 --> 01:49:56.657]  Now, in the case of South Africa,
[01:49:57.168 --> 01:50:02.856]  You have the Shona tribe, which has large representation in South Africa as well as Zimbabwe.
[01:50:02.856 --> 01:50:07.183]  And then you have the Zulus and the Sengang and the other tribes.
[01:50:08.487 --> 01:50:19.015]  Usually, generally, who have gotten along with one another for the past hundred years, although a lot of it was forced by the governments which took over, which were white-dominated.
[01:50:19.015 --> 01:50:22.017]  But it's going to get worse there.
[01:50:22.017 --> 01:50:23.718]  It's just not going to get better.
[01:50:23.718 --> 01:50:27.360]  I have told people, when I saw the riots in South Africa,
[01:50:31.607 --> 01:50:33.008]  Bob, we're out of time.
[01:50:33.008 --> 01:50:35.830]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:36.251]  Stay there.
[01:50:36.251 --> 01:50:38.673]  I want to talk to you during the break.
[01:50:38.673 --> 01:50:39.493]  Go get your free subscription.
[01:50:51.428 --> 01:50:55.230]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[01:50:55.230 --> 01:50:59.372]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[01:50:59.372 --> 01:51:06.176]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[01:51:06.176 --> 01:51:09.078]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[01:51:09.458 --> 01:51:18.864]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[01:51:18.864 --> 01:51:23.526]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[01:51:23.526 --> 01:51:26.648]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[01:51:26.648 --> 01:51:32.752]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[01:51:33.092 --> 01:51:39.474]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.

[01:51:42.155 --> 01:51:42.495]  Do it now!
[01:51:50.888 --> 01:51:52.849]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:51:52.849 --> 01:51:56.470]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:58.911]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:58.911 --> 01:52:01.953]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:01.953 --> 01:52:07.695]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:52:07.695 --> 01:52:11.597]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:52:11.937 --> 01:52:17.140]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:53:08.787 --> 01:53:09.948]  Here's the story.
[01:53:09.948 --> 01:53:18.094]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:53:18.094 --> 01:53:19.255]  And here's the best part.

[01:54:03.278 --> 01:54:07.241]  Don't forget, we got the Money Bomb coming up next Saturday.
[01:54:07.241 --> 01:54:08.662]  I want everybody to donate to it.
[01:54:08.662 --> 01:54:11.004]  Next Saturday, not this Saturday.
[01:54:19.457 --> 01:54:26.002]  Well, you're out dodging the blood-sucking checkpoints with a jab needles in you now in this free country of slavery.
[01:54:26.002 --> 01:54:32.847]  But the weekend after that, Moneybomb will try to upgrade the office, the equipment, start a network TV show.
[01:54:32.847 --> 01:54:34.628]  We can do it with your support.
[01:54:34.628 --> 01:54:36.310]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:42.834]  The main thing we need your help with is not just giving, but spreading the word on message boards, MySpace accounts, your email list.
[01:54:42.834 --> 01:54:43.395]  Please help us.
[01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:48.896]  Uh, now, uh, I want to just go to the answer for three minutes.
[01:54:48.896 --> 01:54:52.725]  Not only does this support the show and the network, this is a great deal.
[01:54:52.725 --> 01:54:56.012]  He locked in silver and gold at a price of a week and a half ago.
[01:54:56.795 --> 01:54:58.898]  He is almost out of the silver at that price.
[01:54:58.898 --> 01:55:02.082]  I know he's very close, because I'm going to try to buy a couple of these Franks.
[01:55:02.082 --> 01:55:03.363]  Best deal you can get.
[01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:05.866]  He's got some British Sovereigns, too, that are a great deal.
[01:55:05.866 --> 01:55:07.769]  These are basically at spot.
[01:55:07.769 --> 01:55:09.050]  Yesterday he said they're at spot.
[01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:11.053]  At spot for what it is now.
[01:55:11.053 --> 01:55:15.238]  Even adding in a small profit for Ted, because he bought them weeks ago, it's at spot right now.
[01:55:16.179 --> 01:55:19.063]  Amazing deal on silver, amazing deal on gold.
[01:55:19.063 --> 01:55:24.171]  Ted was telling me this morning he can't hold this much longer because gold has been going up for the last week and a half.
[01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:30.240]  It's at 930-something right now, went back up today, and it's clearly going to go above 1,000 again.
[01:55:31.841 --> 01:55:35.923]  And you heard a lot of big analysts are saying $6,000 an ounce for inflation.
[01:55:35.923 --> 01:55:39.605]  I think they'll suppress it, but $1,500, $2,000, who knows?
[01:55:39.605 --> 01:55:40.925]  The point is, it's real.
[01:55:40.925 --> 01:55:42.246]  It's got real value.
[01:55:42.246 --> 01:55:46.567]  You know, they're talking about pulling all the money out of circulation in the next few years.
[01:55:46.567 --> 01:55:50.169]  Big federal ruling over cash for the blind.
[01:55:50.169 --> 01:55:52.690]  Of course, we told you a decade ago that was their plan because we read it.
[01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:54.371]  It had nothing to do with the blind, folks.
[01:55:54.371 --> 01:55:55.371]  It's about cashless.
[01:55:55.371 --> 01:55:56.352]  It's going to have a chip in it.
[01:55:56.352 --> 01:55:57.152]  It's going to be smaller.
[01:55:57.865 --> 01:55:59.526]  God help us.
[01:55:59.526 --> 01:56:05.651]  And the whole economic ramifications of getting rid of all the mattress money, scanning, tracking all your money.
[01:56:05.651 --> 01:56:07.993]  You need to get into gold and silver right now.
[01:56:07.993 --> 01:56:09.794]  It's the perfect exchange.
[01:56:09.794 --> 01:56:12.576]  You can exchange it for whatever the new currencies are.
[01:56:12.576 --> 01:56:15.818]  Ted, tell them about the offers you've got today.
[01:56:15.818 --> 01:56:17.079]  Can you guarantee this through Monday?
[01:56:17.079 --> 01:56:20.542]  I will, Alex, but I can't go any further than Monday.
[01:56:20.542 --> 01:56:21.542]  My trader will be back.
[01:56:22.663 --> 01:56:27.304]  Right now, I mean, especially on those walking Liberty Haves at $182.
[01:56:27.304 --> 01:56:32.866]  I mean, silver now is at $18.27, so it's up another 20 cents from even yesterday.
[01:56:32.866 --> 01:56:35.266]  So wait a minute, this is below spot then?
[01:56:35.266 --> 01:56:36.306]  Yes, actually it is.
[01:56:36.306 --> 01:56:40.507]  You're selling silver at below spot, but you've got it in inventory.
[01:56:40.507 --> 01:56:46.649]  So what you're saying is if you sell out, you will lose money, you've done this before, and you will buy more.
[01:56:46.809 --> 01:56:49.290]  Well, obviously I will fill every order.
[01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:51.671]  I've always been good for all my commitments.
[01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:54.553]  But you think you've got enough to go through until Monday?
[01:56:54.553 --> 01:57:03.537]  Oh yeah, I'll hold this deal until Monday, but you're going to have to get your orders in until, you know, if this price holds on silver and it's Tuesday, I'm not going to be able to offer these at this price.
[01:57:03.537 --> 01:57:04.257]  It's going to be higher.
[01:57:04.597 --> 01:57:05.499]  Give them the number.
[01:57:05.499 --> 01:57:09.304]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:57:09.304 --> 01:57:13.150]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:57:13.150 --> 01:57:15.774]  Mention that you heard the Alex Jones Special.
[01:57:15.774 --> 01:57:18.819]  You want to take advantage of those Walking Liberty half dollars.
[01:57:18.819 --> 01:57:20.261]  Now tell folks about the gold.
[01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:22.441]  The gold is a great buy too, Alex.
[01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:27.183]  I mean, I picked this stuff when gold was at $888 an ounce.
[01:57:27.183 --> 01:57:30.603]  I've got franc coins right now, they're at $199 a coin.
[01:57:30.603 --> 01:57:32.724]  I have the British Sovereigns, they're at $250.
[01:57:32.724 --> 01:57:35.845]  It's the same deal that I was offering on Monday.
[01:57:35.845 --> 01:57:38.565]  This is really, I mean, the market's moving up.
[01:57:38.565 --> 01:57:40.626]  The dollar's down again today.
[01:57:40.626 --> 01:57:41.526]  Everything's happening
[01:57:42.286 --> 01:57:42.646]  Positively.
[01:57:59.237 --> 01:58:02.679]  I guess midnight tonight, but 8 or 9 at night, Saturday and Sunday.
[01:58:02.679 --> 01:58:04.561]  So call anytime 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:08.383]  You've got to call.
[01:58:08.383 --> 01:58:14.788]  If you don't tell them Alex Jones sent you and it's the Alex Jones Special from Friday, you will not get it at these prices.
[01:58:14.788 --> 01:58:18.211]  Gold at drop-bottom prices is super good.
[01:58:18.211 --> 01:58:19.392]  Silver at below spot.
[01:58:19.392 --> 01:58:20.352]  You cannot beat this.
[01:58:20.352 --> 01:58:20.793]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:21.253]  Here is the number.
[01:58:21.253 --> 01:58:22.934]  Get out of Federal Reserve notes, folks.
[01:58:26.817 --> 01:58:32.858]  1-800-686-237 Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:32.858 --> 01:58:41.380]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.780]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:45.621]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.621 --> 01:58:50.042]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.612 --> 01:58:53.335]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.335 --> 01:58:56.139]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.139 --> 01:58:59.322]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.322 --> 01:59:06.631]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.659 --> 01:59:15.103]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.103 --> 01:59:18.965]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.965 --> 01:59:21.547]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.547 --> 01:59:22.708]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.708 --> 01:59:23.488]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.488 --> 01:59:24.769]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.769 --> 01:59:25.750]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:26.891]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:38.418 --> 01:59:39.479]  You have been warned.
[01:59:43.688 --> 01:59:46.093]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.093 --> 01:59:48.859]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.456 --> 01:59:57.196]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.196 --> 01:59:58.817]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.817 --> 02:00:00.357]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.357 --> 02:00:04.538]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.538 --> 02:00:08.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.659 --> 02:00:19.362]  22-year-old Nikki Riley, a convert to militant Islam, described as a vulnerable man who's been preyed upon and radicalised.
[02:00:19.362 --> 02:00:21.463]  He has a history of mental illness.
[02:00:22.844 --> 02:00:27.211]  Nikki Riley travelled by bus from Plymouth to Exeter yesterday morning.
[02:00:27.211 --> 02:00:30.957]  He went to the Princess Hay shopping mall in the city centre.
[02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:34.183]  It's thought he went into the toilet at the Giraffe restaurant.
[02:00:34.183 --> 02:00:36.286]  Shortly afterwards, there was an explosion.
[02:00:37.748 --> 02:00:40.470]  Riley was arrested at the scene of the blast.
[02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:45.414]  He'd suffered cuts to his eye and some burns on his face when it went off.
[02:00:45.414 --> 02:00:48.817]  He's being treated at a hospital while under police custody.
[02:00:48.817 --> 02:00:49.797]  Okay.
[02:00:49.797 --> 02:00:52.399]  Alright, let's go to Paul Watson just for three minutes.
[02:00:52.399 --> 02:00:57.764]  Then we got Ray McGovern, scheduled top CIA analyst to go over the war, the economy, where he thinks things are going.
[02:01:00.065 --> 02:01:01.086]  You're there in England.
[02:01:01.086 --> 02:01:02.627]  I mean, it's always the same MO.
[02:01:02.627 --> 02:01:12.193]  A mental patient with a firecracker with some thumbtacks on it, blows it up in his face, and now they're ninnying, running around, freaking out.
[02:01:12.193 --> 02:01:19.177]  And this happened right after they were before the European Human Rights Court about secret arrest without habeas corpus.
[02:01:19.177 --> 02:01:26.341]  And now your El Presidente is taking time out, your Prime Minister, from saying,
[02:01:27.225 --> 02:01:30.187]  We need martial law, and we need a new world order.
[02:01:30.187 --> 02:01:32.008]  He's taking time out to Fearmonger.
[02:01:32.008 --> 02:01:33.769]  Paul Watson.
[02:01:33.769 --> 02:01:35.170]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:35.170 --> 02:01:40.374]  Well, yeah, it's, from what I can see, it's basically Dumb and Dumber Part 2.
[02:01:40.374 --> 02:01:45.517]  You remember the, uh, terror attack on the Glasgow Airport a year ago?
[02:01:45.517 --> 02:01:46.878]  They called it a terror attack.
[02:01:46.878 --> 02:01:50.640]  It was actually two retards setting fire to a jeep.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:56.384]  But it was in the news for about three weeks after, and, uh, presented as another reason why we should
[02:01:57.324 --> 02:02:02.447]  You know, be put in a terror database for filming a bunch of flowers at a tube station.
[02:02:02.447 --> 02:02:14.834]  But from what the eyewitnesses said about this one, which happened yesterday morning in Exeter, which is quite a small university town near the south coast of England.
[02:02:14.834 --> 02:02:16.234]  My brother used to live there.
[02:02:16.234 --> 02:02:17.975]  Down by Cornwall, isn't it?
[02:02:17.975 --> 02:02:20.016]  It's in that area.
[02:02:20.016 --> 02:02:21.057]  The eyewitnesses
[02:02:21.684 --> 02:02:29.269]  And it was in a packed restaurant, but the actual bomb, if you want to call it that, was set off in a locked toilet.
[02:02:29.269 --> 02:02:36.273]  And the eyewitnesses described it as, didn't sound like a bomb, it sounded more like a lightbulb exploding.
[02:02:36.273 --> 02:02:41.816]  So again, it's some pathetic individual that's got a history of mental illness.
[02:02:42.965 --> 02:02:47.668]  Um, that's by being influenced by some propaganda and being radicalized by it.
[02:02:47.668 --> 02:02:48.808]  And that's what they do.
[02:02:48.808 --> 02:02:52.510]  They now advertise, oh see there's deadly Al Qaeda.
[02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:53.451]  It's white Al Qaeda.
[02:02:53.451 --> 02:02:59.194]  Remember they said armies of white Al Qaeda, thousands trained with missiles, totally deadly force.
[02:02:59.534 --> 02:03:02.695]  Well, in Britain, they're trying to sell it on this so-called Islamo-fascism.
[02:03:02.695 --> 02:03:06.336]  They actually had a bus in Burnley, which is a northern town not too far away from where I live.
[02:03:30.072 --> 02:03:49.446]  It was a neo-Nazi, and he basically had a huge cache of rocket launchers and grenades, and it was in the local newspaper once, and it didn't even make, you know, BBC, whereas this is all over BBC at the moment, so they pick which ones they're going to propagandise about very carefully.
[02:03:49.446 --> 02:03:55.790]  This is not getting as much traction as Dumb and Dumber did setting fire to a jeep at Glasgow Airport, but it's certainly
[02:03:56.537 --> 02:04:00.658]  It's more in the news today than it was yesterday.
[02:04:00.658 --> 02:04:14.242]  You would have thought giant alien spacecraft landed at the airport with tanks rolling by and Blair freaking out and panicking and the media saying, will Britannia hold fast against the burning Jeep?
[02:04:14.242 --> 02:04:17.223]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:04:17.223 --> 02:04:18.344]  It was crazy.
[02:04:18.344 --> 02:04:22.365]  Well, I mean, then you look at the real bombings, the London bombings, which has
[02:04:23.297 --> 02:04:31.747]  The bombers were completely coddled by MI5 and they didn't display the behavior of suicide bombers, which is what they were.
[02:04:31.747 --> 02:04:33.750]  He runs PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:34.791]  We're out of time, Paul.
[02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:36.673]  Thank you so much for popping in.
[02:04:36.673 --> 02:04:37.835]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:04:37.835 --> 02:04:38.275]  Thank you.
[02:04:38.275 --> 02:04:38.916]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:48.807 --> 02:04:53.051]  Hi, my name's Don Whiskin and for over seven years I've been telling people about Cardivite.
[02:04:53.051 --> 02:04:56.615]  Here's Dr. John Mattson, a naturopathic doctor, and his views on Cardivite.
[02:04:57.995 --> 02:05:02.116]  Thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier because your products just make it so simple, right?
[02:05:02.116 --> 02:05:07.917]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[02:05:07.917 --> 02:05:16.318]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.
[02:05:16.318 --> 02:05:19.299]  That yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver hard.
[02:05:19.299 --> 02:05:26.100]  It also has metal chelating effect and most of the other herbs in there I find that strengthen the arteries, they help to neutralize free radicals.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:31.442]  Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program as you can get as far as one supplement goes.
[02:05:31.442 --> 02:05:35.563]  It's working on the gut, it's working on the liver, it's working on the arteries.
[02:05:35.563 --> 02:05:36.823]  What more can you ask for?
[02:05:36.823 --> 02:05:40.185]  To learn more, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at heartdrop.com.

[02:08:00.179 --> 02:08:08.123]  We are live, not just on the radio, but at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the viewers that tune into that each day.
[02:08:09.756 --> 02:08:17.418]  Up on the screen I have a image of Ray McGovern at an event just a few weeks ago.
[02:08:17.418 --> 02:08:18.979]  You'll notice he doesn't have a beard anymore.
[02:08:18.979 --> 02:08:23.980]  He's got a chrome dome because he's got lymphoma and he's doing their chemotherapy.
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:24.921]  But I just talked to him.
[02:08:24.921 --> 02:08:26.441]  He is confident that he is going to beat it.
[02:08:27.347 --> 02:08:32.334]  We should all pray for Ray McGovern because he's been a great patriot to this country.
[02:08:32.334 --> 02:08:38.381]  And one of the top senior CIA analysts to several presidents gave George Bush Sr.
[02:08:38.381 --> 02:08:40.985]  his daily briefing.
[02:08:40.985 --> 02:08:43.308]  And under seven presidents for over 27 years,
[02:08:44.736 --> 02:08:53.358]  Presenting the morning intelligence briefing to the White House, and he's giving us an intelligence briefing, despite the fact that he's doing chemotherapy right now.
[02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:55.979]  And we really do appreciate him coming on.
[02:08:55.979 --> 02:09:01.081]  If I tried to go through the amazing career he's had, it would take too long, so we'll just go right to him.
[02:09:01.081 --> 02:09:04.122]  But if you go to Wikipedia, they've got a pretty good write-up on him.
[02:09:04.122 --> 02:09:05.242]  It's pretty accurate from what I know.
[02:09:06.202 --> 02:09:15.447]  And, of course, he was a Vietnam veteran as well, and so we are honored to have him on with us.
[02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:17.087]  Ryan McGovern, thanks for being here.
[02:09:17.087 --> 02:09:17.728]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:09:17.728 --> 02:09:19.288]  Good to be back with you.
[02:09:19.288 --> 02:09:22.910]  Well, we appreciate your time, especially with what you're going through right now.
[02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:25.091]  Well, actually, I've been kind of lucky.
[02:09:25.091 --> 02:09:33.435]  Aside from the fatigue, the symptoms have been controllable, and I'm looking forward in a couple weeks to getting a clean bill of health, so I'm very fortunate.
[02:09:34.224 --> 02:09:43.726]  I've reflected very much on how privileged I am to have the access to medical care that 50 million of my fellow Americans lack.
[02:09:43.726 --> 02:09:48.067]  So it's been a kind of a wake-up call in many respects for me, Alex.
[02:09:48.067 --> 02:09:50.328]  Well, for your age, I remember meeting you in person.
[02:09:50.328 --> 02:09:52.388]  You look 20 years younger than you are.
[02:09:52.388 --> 02:09:56.610]  So you're a tough guy.
[02:09:56.610 --> 02:09:59.150]  But they're really saying they think you're going to pull through it.
[02:09:59.150 --> 02:10:02.471]  Yeah, they've really perfected the art on this kind of lymphoma.
[02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:15.053]  It happens to be the kind that that Red Sox pitcher that pitched the no-hitter last week had a couple years ago, so I'm oiling my baseball glove down in the cellar and I'll be ready to go another month.
[02:10:15.882 --> 02:10:17.202]  Good, that's fantastic news.
[02:10:17.202 --> 02:10:19.483]  Didn't mean to spend too much time on that.
[02:10:19.483 --> 02:10:24.205]  You've written a lot of articles analyzing the fact that they may still be planning to attack Iran.
[02:10:24.205 --> 02:10:28.946]  Israel said last week, oh yeah, top officials say they're going to attack before Bush leaves.
[02:10:28.946 --> 02:10:35.249]  Can you break down the field, give us an intelligence briefing on what you're being told by sources in D.C.
[02:10:35.249 --> 02:10:40.290]  and what we're getting from leaks in the media and from diplomatic sources about what they're planning?
[02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:42.331]  Are they going to start a war?
[02:10:43.854 --> 02:10:52.817]  Well, Alex, it looks pretty clear that the administration, that is Bush and Cheney, very much want to head out after Iran, head out on Iran.
[02:10:52.817 --> 02:10:56.659]  It would be this time with very little warning.
[02:10:56.659 --> 02:11:03.241]  It would be from the air and from the sea, the missiles on those ships and so forth.
[02:11:03.241 --> 02:11:07.143]  And we would, as I say, have very little warning.
[02:11:07.143 --> 02:11:09.604]  Now, how it will all start is problematic.
[02:11:10.259 --> 02:11:30.272]  It looked very much up until two weeks ago that they had decided, well, since the intelligence says that the Iranians have stopped working on the nuclear weapons-related part of their nuclear program, you know, it's going to be kind of difficult to head out at a program that was stopped in mid-2003.
[02:11:30.272 --> 02:11:35.076]  So they switched all the propaganda over to the fact that, quote, or the allegation that,
[02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:45.432]  Iranian-supported groups with Iranian weapons, Iranian training, and Iranian funding are killing hundreds of our troops in southern Iraq.
[02:11:45.432 --> 02:11:47.873]  And we're going to prove that to you.
[02:11:47.873 --> 02:11:55.896]  Now, the rub came when Petraeus and Admiral Mullen, who should know better, promised the Western press on the 25th of April
[02:11:56.997 --> 02:12:04.659]  That Petraeus has the goods on these guys, and we're going to have a big display of these weapons, and we're going to destroy them in front of your eyes!
[02:12:04.659 --> 02:12:15.081]  And they've done this, like, four or five times last few years, always claiming they've proven Iran did it, and then they always retract very quietly, and the media never makes a big deal about their deception.
[02:12:15.081 --> 02:12:17.201]  You know, Alex, that's the big story here.
[02:12:17.201 --> 02:12:26.663]  You know, here they tell the media on April 25th that this is coming, and two weeks later, they kind of go, oh, by the way, you know, people have canceled that briefing.
[02:12:27.324 --> 02:12:35.849]  And it's become very clear that all these weapons that they captured around Karbala, they couldn't trace one of them to Iranian origin.
[02:12:35.849 --> 02:12:47.335]  The best they could do is they found five hand grenades up with the al-Qaeda types up there in the northern part of Iraq, five hand grenades that can clearly be demonstrated to have been made in Iran.
[02:12:47.335 --> 02:12:49.876]  Give me a break, five hand grenades.
[02:12:49.876 --> 02:12:55.580]  So what's happened here is it's become very embarrassing for the administration to say,
[02:12:56.773 --> 02:13:00.356]  We're talking about these Iranian weapons, but we can't deliver any.
[02:13:00.356 --> 02:13:01.557]  We can't show you any.
[02:13:01.557 --> 02:13:09.723]  And Lieberman can ask Petraeus, as he did, is it true to say that hundreds of American servicemen have been killed by Iranian-provided weapons?
[02:13:09.723 --> 02:13:11.644]  Yes, sir, says Petraeus.
[02:13:11.644 --> 02:13:13.446]  Petraeus doesn't know the difference.
[02:13:13.446 --> 02:13:20.891]  He reminds you very much of General Westmoreland at the end of the, well, in the middle of the Vietnam War.
[02:13:20.891 --> 02:13:22.673]  Westmoreland did not tell the truth.
[02:13:22.673 --> 02:13:25.315]  And I'll say that Petraeus does not tell the truth.
[02:13:25.905 --> 02:13:30.068]  And this latest bit about Petraeus saying, well, you know, just wait till, you know, the summer.
[02:13:30.068 --> 02:13:32.810]  I'll probably recommend withdrawing more troops.
[02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:38.934]  Well, how many bait-and-switch things are the American people going to put up with?
[02:13:38.934 --> 02:13:40.975]  Petraeus is not to be trusted.
[02:13:40.975 --> 02:13:44.638]  And this whole thing about Iran now will reverse, in my view.
[02:13:45.202 --> 02:13:55.209]  Toward the big lie, which is that Ahmadinejad has threatened to push Israel into the sea, has threatened to destroy Israel.
[02:13:55.209 --> 02:13:57.751]  How many times has your president said that?
[02:13:57.751 --> 02:13:59.112]  He didn't.
[02:13:59.112 --> 02:14:01.214]  Ahmadinejad did not say that.
[02:14:01.214 --> 02:14:06.318]  It was a terrible translation of what he did say, and we can go into that later.
[02:14:06.318 --> 02:14:11.902]  But the big lie is that Israel is about to be destroyed by the Iranians.
[02:14:12.518 --> 02:14:24.194]  And even though no one, not even the Israelis, would say that Iran has a nuclear weapon or is likely to get one in the next year or two, Bush, you know, he only has, what, seven, eight more months?
[02:14:24.194 --> 02:14:29.282]  And the Israeli ambassador here in Washington has made it, you know, sometimes they sort of slip.
[02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:32.432]  And then say the truth.
[02:14:32.432 --> 02:14:36.096]  Why did Admiral Fallon really leave?
[02:14:36.096 --> 02:14:44.863]  Was that because he refuses to launch a Hitlerian preemptive attack like Hitler did on Poland or Czechoslovakia?
[02:14:44.863 --> 02:14:46.945]  I think that's the core of it, Alex.
[02:14:46.945 --> 02:14:55.633]  It's very clear from all those interviews he gave to that Esquire reporter, and that article that came out earlier this year,
[02:14:56.548 --> 02:15:15.653]  He wasn't about to take part in yet another illegal, under international as well as domestic law, illegal war of aggression, because that's exactly the way Nuremberg, the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II, defined a preemptive or preventive war.
[02:15:15.653 --> 02:15:16.894]  There's nothing in the U.N.
[02:15:16.894 --> 02:15:18.934]  Treaty, there's nothing in the U.S.
[02:15:18.934 --> 02:15:24.196]  Congress legislation that blesses or approves a
[02:15:25.598 --> 02:15:32.860]  An offense, an invasion, or an attack on a country that does not pose an imminent threat.
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:43.244]  And there is no one, there is no one who knows anything about Iran who can suggest with a straight face that Iran poses an imminent threat to the United States of America.
[02:15:44.202 --> 02:15:57.973]  Do you ever feel like you're waking up in the middle of a twilight zone, that the United States would be the bad guys, and that we would be attacking all these innocent countries and lying, and that we'd have a war criminal president?
[02:15:57.973 --> 02:16:05.118]  Well, Alex, it took me a while, and my colleagues and veteran intelligence professionals for sanity, took us a while in 2001, 2002.
[02:16:08.911 --> 02:16:20.800]  To kind of be okay with the notion that, hey, we really needed to turn our analytic skills, develop at government expense, at taxpayer expense, on our own leaders.
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.802]  And yes, it is true that they lie a lot.
[02:16:22.802 --> 02:16:23.302]  Whoops!
[02:16:23.302 --> 02:16:29.748]  And you know, this may be, these lies may be leading up to what Nuremberg called the War of Aggression.
[02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:31.709]  We called it three months before.
[02:16:31.709 --> 02:16:32.750]  We weren't the only ones.
[02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:35.872]  Scott Ritter and others were also sounding the same note.
[02:16:37.117 --> 02:16:45.852]  But it happened and still it was hard for us to believe that our leaders and our former colleagues in the intelligence services
[02:16:49.099 --> 02:16:55.483]  But isn't that what's so dangerous, is they did cooperate, now they're not cooperating as much.
[02:16:55.483 --> 02:17:05.910]  I'm told the State Department, you know, they're jokingly putting Hitler mustaches on the pictures of somebody of the Bush and the Vice President, but this isn't a joke.
[02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:10.093]  I mean, we're dealing with people that have shown that they're willing to, quote, go for it.
[02:17:10.713 --> 02:17:15.617]  And, you know, Gulf of Tonkin events, staged events, provocateur events.
[02:17:15.617 --> 02:17:18.839]  Are you worried about them trying to stage something?
[02:17:18.839 --> 02:17:29.606]  Because I don't see them being able, even in this Alice in Wonderland system, you know, this Tea Party of insanity, to be able to attack Iran without some type of staged provocation.
[02:17:29.606 --> 02:17:34.290]  And I'm sure you know, we even talked to him and he admitted and clarified, Gary Hart told us,
[02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:39.771]  That yes, he is afraid the government will stay, blow up a ship, and blame it on Iran.
[02:17:39.771 --> 02:17:41.772]  Are you concerned about that?
[02:17:41.772 --> 02:17:44.112]  I am, Alex, and I think you're right.
[02:17:44.112 --> 02:17:47.053]  Some kind of provocation would be necessary.
[02:17:47.053 --> 02:17:58.056]  Now, Fallon, when he was commander of CENTCOM, had very, very strict regulations about what they call encounter engagements.
[02:17:58.056 --> 02:17:59.496]  You know, how you deal with
[02:18:00.012 --> 02:18:04.295]  Little outboard motorboats that come speeding up to your naval vessel.
[02:18:04.295 --> 02:18:06.116]  Do you blow them out of the water?
[02:18:06.116 --> 02:18:11.480]  Or do you try to see if they have any dangerous missiles or anything on them?
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:13.782]  Well, obviously it's the latter.
[02:18:13.782 --> 02:18:15.243]  Now, what is it now?
[02:18:15.243 --> 02:18:23.469]  I don't know what it is now, but there is a report that I have seen that the White House has insisted that the next time that happens, that the commander
[02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:32.101]  In the Persian Gulf, contacted the White House directly, not the Defense Department, to pursue instructions.
[02:18:32.101 --> 02:18:33.301]  So that's one danger.
[02:18:33.301 --> 02:18:40.025]  With all those ships out there, it could be illegitimate, or it could be a manufactured provocation.
[02:18:40.025 --> 02:18:48.590]  The other part of it is that the President has rhetorically put himself out on the same kind of limb that he was before Iraq.
[02:18:48.590 --> 02:18:51.871]  And the people who have put him out there are the same kinds of folks.
[02:18:53.448 --> 02:19:03.071]  Wolfowitz and the rest of them that said then, and are saying now, look, Mr. President, you said that you would not ever permit Iran to have a nuclear weapon.
[02:19:03.071 --> 02:19:13.734]  It looks like they may get one, or are you just going to go out of office and suffer the opprobrium of history that would say, oh, big talk, but George Bush took no action?
[02:19:13.734 --> 02:19:15.675]  You can't do that, Mr. President.
[02:19:15.675 --> 02:19:22.137]  And so what he has done is gotten this country out of the limb as if we are automatically pledged to
[02:19:23.624 --> 02:19:29.566]  Uh, to defend Israel if it gets attacked by, or, you know, gets attacked by Iran or anybody else.
[02:19:29.566 --> 02:19:31.907]  And so we've lost the, uh, initiative.
[02:19:31.907 --> 02:19:33.408]  It's- it's not up to us anymore.
[02:19:33.408 --> 02:19:37.769]  It could be Israel that would, uh, set this thing off, and that is really troubling.
[02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:38.369]  Stay there.
[02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:44.291]  A senior CIA retired analyst, a believer in Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., Ray McGovern.
[02:19:44.291 --> 02:19:48.213]  We're gonna come back and talk about how we stop a war, or if it happens, what it's gonna look like.
[02:19:48.613 --> 02:20:01.767]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[02:21:25.251 --> 02:21:29.273]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.

[02:23:52.436 --> 02:23:57.079]  Riders on the storm.
[02:23:57.079 --> 02:23:58.620]  Riders on the storm.
[02:24:03.626 --> 02:24:15.333]  Well, we got a former top CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, who did the big world brief daily for multiple presidents, the wide spectrum analysis of what we're facing.
[02:24:15.333 --> 02:24:17.954]  A, can we stop them from attacking?
[02:24:17.954 --> 02:24:22.857]  Because as you said earlier, Israel and others are leaking that they plan to, that it's going to happen.
[02:24:23.823 --> 02:24:24.503]  Well Alex, can we stop it?
[02:24:24.503 --> 02:24:25.444]  We just have to stop it.
[02:24:25.444 --> 02:24:26.404]  I don't know what it's going to take.
[02:24:26.404 --> 02:24:29.005]  The supreme hurdle, of course, is the captive press.
[02:24:29.005 --> 02:24:33.367]  The corporate dominated press that will not tell Americans the real story.
[02:24:51.704 --> 02:25:10.955]  But there have to be ways, there have to be imaginative ways, ways that you use and other commentators to get the word out that really there is no threat from Iran, and that this is all a sort of manufactured kind of threat of the same kind we saw prior to the attack on Iraq.
[02:25:10.955 --> 02:25:18.480]  I, as you know, have made a kind of a college try to get Admiral Fallon to realize that it's not enough just to resign.
[02:25:19.318 --> 02:25:21.059]  He needs to tell the American people.
[02:25:21.059 --> 02:25:29.204]  I mean, I'm sure that he's lost many sleepless nights thinking about what would happen if we attacked Iran from the air.
[02:25:29.204 --> 02:25:36.568]  You know, these guys in the blue suits, you know, they say, well, hey, we can just, we can do it surgically and everything will be fine.
[02:25:36.568 --> 02:25:38.810]  Well, they never have to deal with the aftermath.
[02:25:38.810 --> 02:25:41.051]  You know what the aftermath could involve?
[02:25:41.051 --> 02:25:46.214]  It could involve cutting the supply lines between Kuwait and Baghdad
[02:25:46.681 --> 02:25:53.203]  That are vital to supplying our troops in Iraq, of which there are about 140,000 right now.
[02:25:53.203 --> 02:26:05.365]  Now, if Iran can do that, and it can do that very readily, we would have the prospect, Alex, of having not, you know, 52 hostages in some embassy this time, but 52,000 U.S.
[02:26:05.365 --> 02:26:12.047]  servicemen cut off from their supply lines, taken in effect as hostages by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
[02:26:12.047 --> 02:26:12.767]  Do we want that?
[02:26:13.337 --> 02:26:15.158]  Oh, Fallon certainly didn't want that.
[02:26:15.158 --> 02:26:18.680]  Did he think he might be ordered to do something that would lead to that?
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:19.681]  He did.
[02:26:19.681 --> 02:26:21.922]  He saw who was calling the shots in the White House.
[02:26:21.922 --> 02:26:23.263]  It's Elliott Abrams.
[02:26:23.263 --> 02:26:24.504]  It's Dick Cheney.
[02:26:24.504 --> 02:26:25.725]  It's not anybody else.
[02:26:25.725 --> 02:26:28.746]  Who, by the way, are chicken hawks.
[02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:36.291]  When Secretary of the Army, who was an Enron crook, I'm not defending him, White said, 500,000 troops, they said you're fired.
[02:26:36.291 --> 02:26:42.635]  This does have, in my mind, images of Hitler in the bunker commanding armies that didn't exist.
[02:26:43.723 --> 02:26:53.672]  Well, you know, as many have pointed out, especially Andrew Bacevich, the Boston University professor who is the best on this subject, you know, there aren't any troops.
[02:26:53.672 --> 02:26:57.495]  But, you know, it was the same in Vietnam, Alex.
[02:26:57.495 --> 02:27:00.958]  The fellows in the blue suits, you know, they want a piece of the action.
[02:27:00.958 --> 02:27:05.122]  So these generals from the Air Force come to Cheney and Bush and say, you know, hey,
[02:27:05.546 --> 02:27:06.707]  We have these smart bombs.
[02:27:06.707 --> 02:27:07.888]  We have these stealth bombers.
[02:27:07.888 --> 02:27:09.790]  Nobody gets shot down this time.
[02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:15.795]  We can knock out half of the Iranian nuclear facilities one night, second half the next night.
[02:27:15.795 --> 02:27:17.436]  Just let us do it, you know?
[02:27:17.436 --> 02:27:23.501]  Well, again, you know, I'm showing my prejudice here, having been an army infantry officer, okay?
[02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:25.023]  They never have to fight the enemy.
[02:27:25.023 --> 02:27:26.424]  Yeah, they really—it's sort of—
[02:27:26.943 --> 02:27:28.444]  Sort of distance.
[02:27:28.444 --> 02:27:32.805]  It's kind of, you know, you drop the bombs, you say, well, you know, they're well-guided, and you never see the aftermath.
[02:27:32.805 --> 02:27:34.326]  You don't see the people who are killed.
[02:27:34.326 --> 02:27:36.366]  You don't see the collateral damage.
[02:27:36.366 --> 02:27:42.228]  You don't see the damage that that does to us and the insurgence that that cultivates or grows automatically.
[02:27:42.228 --> 02:27:49.991]  So what I'm afraid of is that the Cheney and Bush, before they leave, since they really have not been held accountable for anything,
[02:27:50.586 --> 02:28:03.052]  And since Bush, at least, is an incredibly risk-taking person, and since he seems to have made a promise... Yeah, the word, sir, I mean, unless you disagree, is extremely reckless.
[02:28:03.052 --> 02:28:04.732]  Reckless is the word, yeah.
[02:28:04.732 --> 02:28:17.158]  And if he feels, as he seems to, that he's made this promise to Israel that he would deliver Israel from this evil, you know, the vocabulary itself, Alex, give me a pause, I think
[02:28:17.987 --> 02:28:30.552]  Yeah, not until this regime has, as the American administration talked about, good and evil in the apocalyptic, you know, in the kind of sense that these people have been using it.
[02:28:30.552 --> 02:28:36.935]  Well, we know they're playing off of their minions in a really sadistic, mean way.
[02:28:36.935 --> 02:28:42.917]  Some people who, you know, I guess want the end of the world, but this is, I guess they really are making it apocalyptic then.
[02:28:43.843 --> 02:28:46.584]  Well, it will be, whether they realize that or not.
[02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:51.967]  And that's the rub, because Fallon was smart enough to realize what this could mean.
[02:28:51.967 --> 02:28:54.828]  And I just reduced one example, Alex.
[02:28:54.828 --> 02:28:59.231]  I mean, the other things they could do is actually attack Israel with missiles.
[02:28:59.231 --> 02:29:04.833]  They can hit the oil wellheads in the Gulf and put a lot of them.
[02:29:04.833 --> 02:29:09.996]  And we'll be paying not $4 a gallon, we'll be paying $10 a gallon automatically.
[02:29:09.996 --> 02:29:11.157]  They can do all these things.
[02:29:12.549 --> 02:29:20.513]  I'm just wondering if anyone in the very tight circle that is advising Bush and Cheney, whether they have the guts to tell Bush that.
[02:29:20.513 --> 02:29:28.177]  I mean, do you remember just two months ago when the press said, Mr. President, what do you think about the possibility of $4?
[02:29:28.177 --> 02:29:29.118]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:29:29.118 --> 02:29:32.500]  Ray McGovern, a senior, former CIA analyst.
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:33.020]  We'll be back.
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:34.161]  We've got a long segment, sir.
[02:29:34.161 --> 02:29:35.301]  Plenty of time to get into this.
[02:29:35.301 --> 02:29:36.042]  Thanks for being with us.
[02:29:36.042 --> 02:29:36.382]  Stay there.
[02:29:36.382 --> 02:29:38.523]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:38.523 --> 02:29:39.924]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.924 --> 02:29:41.425]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.435 --> 02:29:48.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:50.162]  It is a big idea.
[02:29:50.162 --> 02:29:52.984]  A new world order.
[02:29:52.984 --> 02:29:57.408]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:29:57.867 --> 02:30:00.691]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:00.691 --> 02:30:03.475]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:30:03.475 --> 02:30:06.660]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:13.990]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:30:17.017 --> 02:30:22.441]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:30:22.441 --> 02:30:26.323]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:30:26.323 --> 02:30:28.885]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:30:28.885 --> 02:30:30.046]  Most people have no idea.
[02:30:30.046 --> 02:30:30.846]  They're not after money.
[02:30:30.846 --> 02:30:32.107]  They have all the money they need.
[02:30:32.107 --> 02:30:33.108]  They're after power.
[02:30:33.108 --> 02:30:34.249]  That's what they have to lose here.

[02:30:46.937 --> 02:30:48.018]  Good.
[02:30:48.018 --> 02:30:49.999]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:30:49.999 --> 02:30:56.964]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:30:56.964 --> 02:31:05.370]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:31:47.495 --> 02:31:49.097]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:31:49.097 --> 02:31:52.760]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:58.825]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[02:31:58.825 --> 02:32:02.888]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[02:32:02.888 --> 02:32:06.291]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[02:32:06.491 --> 02:32:07.032]  We're good to go.
[02:32:30.714 --> 02:32:33.476]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[02:32:33.476 --> 02:32:35.417]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[02:32:35.417 --> 02:32:36.998]  Jesus is coming soon!

[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.602]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:32:43.602 --> 02:32:44.803]  No matter how hard you try,
[02:33:19.999 --> 02:33:26.841]  Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst to multiple presidents, combat infantry commander Vietnam, outspoken
[02:33:48.422 --> 02:33:50.404]  Individual has been criticizing.
[02:33:50.404 --> 02:33:57.450]  We have this clip we can play of him confronting Rumsfeld about his lies.
[02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:01.453]  And there's all this media there and none of them will do it and they still really won't.
[02:34:01.453 --> 02:34:12.382]  And then about a month ago, Ray McGovern, you may have seen it, there was a clip with the good-looking front lady they use for the presidential spokesperson.
[02:34:13.283 --> 02:34:14.804]  The Press Secretary.
[02:34:14.804 --> 02:34:19.988]  And they come up to her and they say, is it true the dollar being devalued is making oil prices go up?
[02:34:19.988 --> 02:34:21.389]  And, of course, that's part of it.
[02:34:21.389 --> 02:34:23.770]  The instability makes the speculation as well.
[02:34:23.770 --> 02:34:27.433]  You know, are they going to blow the Middle East, you know, to pieces and so oil's up?
[02:34:27.433 --> 02:34:28.033]  That's part of it.
[02:34:28.033 --> 02:34:29.815]  But mainly dollar devaluation.
[02:34:29.815 --> 02:34:31.796]  Is it true that's why oil's so much?
[02:34:31.796 --> 02:34:34.038]  And she just said, I can't comment on that.
[02:34:34.038 --> 02:34:36.379]  I'll be fired if I do.
[02:34:36.379 --> 02:34:39.061]  And she said that like three times.
[02:34:39.061 --> 02:34:40.042]  I mean, that shows
[02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:50.628]  Just to me that there's not a lot of connection between the press secretary and the president or the vice president and it shows kind of like a crying out for help.
[02:34:51.306 --> 02:35:09.032]  I mean, the way she looked and the way she was saying it, and Ari Fleischer before saying, yeah, they put out fake terror alerts for political purposes and then they removed him the next day, I mean, I'm seeing just a lot of really bad signs, because to have an evil government's one thing, that's bad.
[02:35:09.032 --> 02:35:16.554]  But to have one that's out of control and delusional, and I'm seeing, just as a layman, but I've studied quite a bit, you know, history,
[02:35:17.454 --> 02:35:21.196]  I'm getting a lot of signals that things are out of control.
[02:35:21.196 --> 02:35:23.797]  Do you have any comments on that?
[02:35:23.797 --> 02:35:26.719]  Well, I agree, Alex.
[02:35:26.719 --> 02:35:32.921]  And the situation is very much similar to that before the attack on Iraq.
[02:35:32.921 --> 02:35:41.365]  On the day that Colin Powell spoke at the UN, we, veteran intelligence professionals for sanity, issued our first corporate memorandum.
[02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:44.407]  And we finished up by saying, Mr. President, we strongly advise
[02:35:45.094 --> 02:35:58.644]  That you broaden the circle of your advisors beyond those already bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason, and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic.
[02:35:58.644 --> 02:36:11.854]  Now, we could see at that point in time that the key was this little tight circle of advisors, of whom only Colin Powell knew which end was up, really, and we know what he was worth in the final analysis.
[02:36:12.378 --> 02:36:22.408]  And now, where we have an even tighter circle, where we know the President doesn't read the newspapers, Dana Perino says, well, you know, I can't answer that because I'll be fired.
[02:36:22.408 --> 02:36:32.538]  And then when the President himself, as I mentioned before, two months ago, when he gets up before a press conference, somebody says, well, what do you think about the prospect of maybe $4 a gallon?
[02:36:32.538 --> 02:36:33.338]  And he looks shocked.
[02:36:33.338 --> 02:36:35.100]  He says, well, wait a second.
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:35.781]  Where'd you get that?
[02:36:36.989 --> 02:36:39.530]  And it had been in the news, like, for the week previous.
[02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:43.211]  Well, I'll have to ask my advisors about that, because that's the first I heard about this.
[02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:45.971]  Well, what are you paying at the pump now, Alex?
[02:36:45.971 --> 02:36:46.752]  Four dollars, right?
[02:36:46.752 --> 02:36:47.752]  Yeah, four dollars.
[02:36:47.752 --> 02:36:49.772]  So the guy is detached from reality.
[02:36:49.772 --> 02:36:51.113]  He's uninformed.
[02:36:51.113 --> 02:36:57.454]  And we know, we know that Cheney is able to keep the information flow to him and away from him.
[02:36:57.454 --> 02:37:04.296]  So what he's being told with respect to weapons from Iran and southern Iraq, for example,
[02:37:05.143 --> 02:37:11.310]  Twelve days after it was clear that those recent charges by Petraeus and others were bogus,
[02:37:11.843 --> 02:37:22.372]  The President is still telling the world, openly, that we're catching them, we're catching those guys, giving those weapons to Iranian insurgents, and when we get them, we're going to get them.
[02:37:22.372 --> 02:37:23.833]  You know, we're going to pursue them.
[02:37:23.833 --> 02:37:34.922]  Well that brings me to my next question, and I know you follow the news, I'm glad you did pick up on that White House Press Secretary story, because that was just amazing to me, and there's so many other indicators that are the same, or similar.
[02:37:35.662 --> 02:37:47.394]  And that was a month ago, whenever McCain was in Baghdad and then surrounding capitals of other countries, and he kept saying, Iran is funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:47.394 --> 02:37:50.777]  Iran is Al-Qaeda, and everybody knows they're Shiites.
[02:37:50.777 --> 02:37:55.321]  I mean, that's the opposite warring faction, you know, the two main branches of Islam.
[02:37:55.321 --> 02:37:59.225]  And then Sy Hirsh four years ago, and then the White House last year admitted,
[02:38:00.006 --> 02:38:00.246]  I think?
[02:38:16.398 --> 02:38:28.766]  But then, McCain comes back, and in a Senate Armed Services Committee, says to Petraeus, I mean, Petraeus, excuse me, I just love the nickname Petraeus, and says, isn't it true that Iran funds Al-Qaeda?
[02:38:28.766 --> 02:38:30.427]  And he said, yes, they're Al-Qaeda.
[02:38:30.427 --> 02:38:33.349]  I mean, this is, this is, the propaganda is insane!
[02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:45.056]  Yeah, the problem is that normal Americans, you know, they kick their shoes off in the evening and tune into Fox News, and they think they're getting the straight story.
[02:38:45.974 --> 02:39:04.945]  We have to find imaginative ways to grab them by the collar, these phonies, and say, look, Petraeus told us last October that there is absolutely no doubt that Iranians are funding, supporting, giving weapons to, and training these insurgents in southern Iraq.
[02:39:04.945 --> 02:39:06.746]  Well, what proof has he of that?
[02:39:06.746 --> 02:39:07.486]  He has none.
[02:39:07.486 --> 02:39:14.470]  And this last fiasco, which the mainstream press just kind of ignored for two weeks,
[02:39:15.242 --> 02:39:18.684]  Here's the mainstream press told, hey, we're going to have a big press conference.
[02:39:18.684 --> 02:39:20.725]  We're going to show you those Iranian weapons.
[02:39:20.725 --> 02:39:22.907]  Two weeks later, well, it's been canceled.
[02:39:22.907 --> 02:39:23.907]  No story there?
[02:39:23.907 --> 02:39:25.268]  Give me one break.
[02:39:25.268 --> 02:39:32.893]  In some respects, Alex, the captive press here, the controlled press, is more controlled now than in the lead-up to the war in Iraq.
[02:39:34.167 --> 02:39:35.267]  Well, here's an example.
[02:39:35.267 --> 02:39:44.952]  They're having a 125 world leaders meet to set a lot of policy at the Bilderberg Group coming up in Chantilly outside D.C.
[02:39:44.952 --> 02:39:47.313]  through the 5th through the 8th I'll be going.
[02:39:47.313 --> 02:39:49.914]  And just six, seven years ago the media said it didn't exist.
[02:39:49.914 --> 02:39:55.416]  Now they admit that a lot of policy gets set there and the Logan Act gets violated and things like that happen.
[02:39:55.416 --> 02:40:02.239]  But we have from inside Bilderberg, and they don't normally meet in the U.S., but every five years they're meeting here in North America again
[02:40:03.199 --> 02:40:09.700]  Because they're saying we have the most controlled press and that the police will ban protest.
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:15.001]  And so now elites are meeting here because we have less freedoms than Europe.
[02:40:15.001 --> 02:40:21.743]  I mean this is... I mean that's something else that's just amazing to me that this type of stuff is going on.
[02:40:21.743 --> 02:40:27.624]  You know Alex, the parallel with Europe is very unsettling.
[02:40:28.522 --> 02:40:45.044]  If you look at the parallel between the burning of the Reichstag, the German Parliament in 1933 and what happened at 9-11, you can see that the Germans reacted to that in a very, very passive way.
[02:40:45.044 --> 02:40:46.586]  They said, well, you know,
[02:40:47.128 --> 02:41:06.523]  If terrorists, and that was the word used, these particular terrorists were accused of being communists, but it was, if terrorists burn the Reichstag down, then we accept as a matter of course that our telephone calls will be intercepted, that our desks will be broken into, that our mail will be read.
[02:41:06.523 --> 02:41:14.049]  It's just, you know, all the duty, all the responsibilities the government had toward us and the Constitution, well, they can be put in abeyance.
[02:41:14.049 --> 02:41:15.590]  Now, we know what happened.
[02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.810]  That was 1933.
[02:41:17.344 --> 02:41:22.591]  And Hitler was able to hold his way for the next few years against this passivity.
[02:41:22.591 --> 02:41:25.435]  And what we have in our country is very similar today.
[02:41:25.435 --> 02:41:30.021]  Ask your neighbor, do you mind if your telephone calls are being monitored?
[02:41:30.021 --> 02:41:30.982]  And you know what they'll say?
[02:41:30.982 --> 02:41:31.703]  Well, you know what they'll say.
[02:41:32.654 --> 02:41:37.216]  I don't mind, because I'm not talking to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:41:37.216 --> 02:41:43.017]  They don't understand that they've used the Patriot Act hundreds of thousands of times in non-terror related.
[02:41:43.017 --> 02:41:49.499]  They don't understand that the greatest threat isn't some guys in a cave, even if the 9-11 attacks were really orchestrated by them.
[02:41:49.499 --> 02:42:00.183]  Hypothetically, the greater threat is giving up our whole way of life for something that you have a better chance of dying from a peanut allergy, or being struck by lightning, or drowning.
[02:42:00.843 --> 02:42:07.505]  Well, then you do have been killed by a terrorist, and now they're training the Austin police and Albuquerque police and other police.
[02:42:07.505 --> 02:42:10.245]  The feds are in roadside bomb detection.
[02:42:10.245 --> 02:42:11.346]  I mean, it's a hoax.
[02:42:11.346 --> 02:42:13.666]  Can you speak to that?
[02:42:13.666 --> 02:42:15.647]  Well, yes, I can.
[02:42:15.647 --> 02:42:20.848]  Just take the eavesdropping here, which is probably going on as you and I speak, so to speak.
[02:42:20.848 --> 02:42:22.008]  Oh, no doubt.
[02:42:22.008 --> 02:42:24.329]  Now, you know, people need to know that
[02:42:25.336 --> 02:42:43.767]  The very reason that the FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was put into effect in 1978, was to prevent the kind of thing that J. Edgar Hoover was doing, as a matter of course, not only to citizens like us, but to senators, representatives, to presidents, okay?
[02:42:43.767 --> 02:42:51.231]  Now, you may not, your neighbor may not care if your phone is being tapped, but do you care if Nancy Pelosi's phone is being tapped?
[02:42:52.074 --> 02:42:56.236]  Do you care if other Democratic leaders are candidates if their phones are being tapped?
[02:42:56.236 --> 02:42:57.236]  Let me stop you.
[02:42:57.236 --> 02:42:58.897]  This is not hypothetical.
[02:42:58.897 --> 02:43:04.619]  It's come out that Nixon, obviously, and Clinton, and now Bush Sr., and all of them spy on each other.
[02:43:04.619 --> 02:43:11.741]  But to give a monolithic homeland security, boy how fascist is that, the power to spy, it just came out that MI6 and MI5
[02:43:13.582 --> 02:43:23.989]  Tony Blair has had them spying on the House of Commons and Lords for political power and they've been using it to burn their enemies.
[02:43:23.989 --> 02:43:31.433]  That is, that is, I mean we know they're going to do that and that gives the executive incredible power to set up a dictatorship.
[02:43:31.433 --> 02:43:32.454]  Please comment on that.
[02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:41.622]  Well, that's exactly why they put that law in, and that's exactly why Bush and Cheney decided to circumvent that law.
[02:43:41.622 --> 02:43:44.263]  Take this General Michael Hayden, okay?
[02:43:44.263 --> 02:43:59.486]  He's head of the National Security Agency, and the president, who actually was Cheney, goes to him and says, now we know that the first commandment over there at NSA is, thou shalt not eavesdrop on Americans, but we got this terrorist threat now, and we're going to do precisely that.
[02:43:59.486 --> 02:44:00.107]  Are you with us?
[02:44:00.107 --> 02:44:01.427]  Are you on our team, General Hayden?
[02:44:02.344 --> 02:44:10.286]  Now, one of General Hayden's predecessors told me that his saying yes to that, he should have been court-martialed.
[02:44:10.286 --> 02:44:16.828]  Because that's a violation of the law, that's a violation of the Supreme Law, and that he should have been court-martialed.
[02:44:16.828 --> 02:44:20.309]  Instead, he said, well, yeah, I suppose I could do that.
[02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:22.990]  Let me stop you again, let me stop you again.
[02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:27.451]  They always escalate, they always push the envelope until there's nothing holding back anything now.
[02:44:28.411 --> 02:44:31.874]  You're not, that's not hyperbole that he should be court-martialed, arrested.
[02:44:31.874 --> 02:44:40.262]  They're having to go back and pass laws, which themselves are unconstitutional, retroactively, so all these companies and people don't go to jail.
[02:44:40.262 --> 02:44:41.223]  Go ahead.
[02:44:41.223 --> 02:44:44.085]  Yeah, well, that of course is a great danger.
[02:44:44.085 --> 02:44:51.572]  I'm delighted that for once, for the one and only time recently, the Democrats have been able to prevent that from happening so far.
[02:44:52.236 --> 02:44:55.658]  But, you know, that's just one of these retroactive immunity things.
[02:44:55.658 --> 02:45:08.224]  The thing that bothers me the most is the President forcing Congress, just before the Congress changed hands, to give him and all his minions retroactive immunity for torture.
[02:45:08.224 --> 02:45:16.988]  And that came in the so-called Military Commissions Act, signed in October of 1996, just before Congress changed.
[02:45:16.988 --> 02:45:18.509]  And what it did was say, well,
[02:45:19.142 --> 02:45:28.028]  Whatever the president or others have done with respect to torture, well, they shall be held harmless, just like they're trying to hold harmless the telecommunications giant.
[02:45:28.028 --> 02:45:34.253]  And then once that precedent's set, you have the pure precept of what Nixon said.
[02:45:34.253 --> 02:45:37.615]  He said it's not illegal when the president does it.
[02:45:37.615 --> 02:45:47.722]  Well, it used to be, and unless we get some spine into congressmen, unless we get a wholesale change, and, you know, it's dubious, but at least we'll get some change coming early next year.
[02:45:49.102 --> 02:45:50.483]  You know, there's not much hope for us.
[02:45:50.483 --> 02:46:01.252]  That's why my focus is right now on preventing a new war, because a new war, you know, one of their calculations could well be, Alex, that the new war could help John McCain become president.
[02:46:01.252 --> 02:46:03.514]  That is scary.
[02:46:03.514 --> 02:46:06.257]  Yeah, he's got post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:46:06.257 --> 02:46:08.378]  He flies off the handle for no reason.
[02:46:08.378 --> 02:46:11.221]  They say it's been reported multiple times daily.
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.947]  And I don't, I mean it's one thing to have a hot head if you're a talk show host, but I don't think you should be president.
[02:46:17.947 --> 02:46:22.131]  Now I want to run through a couple quick questions here with you.
[02:46:22.131 --> 02:46:24.594]  What do other, not just people in your veterans,
[02:46:25.987 --> 02:46:54.561]  Veteran Intelligence Group for sanity, but when you talk to other colleagues, other people you worked with in the NSA, CIA, Defense Intelligence, you know, being in and around all those people, I mean, I'm getting a sense from just reading and talking to people and other guests that the government finally is freaked out and says, man, it's one thing to be corrupt and one thing to be out of control in a big government, but it's another thing to really be the bad guys, and that they now see that the whole system may be wrecked by these people.
[02:46:55.808 --> 02:46:57.028]  Well, there is that sense.
[02:46:57.028 --> 02:47:00.909]  The question is how much power they could wield.
[02:47:00.909 --> 02:47:05.931]  And without the press to replay their stories, that power is minimal.
[02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:13.973]  Now, I take some great encouragement from the fact that there are some people with integrity still working in the analytics section of the CIA.
[02:47:13.973 --> 02:47:18.854]  I'm not talking about the torturers now, I'm talking about the people who are trying to speak truth to power.
[02:47:18.854 --> 02:47:22.155]  For these guys to come up and have blessed by their superiors,
[02:47:22.634 --> 02:47:34.563]  A national intelligence estimate that goes 180 degrees betwixt what Bush and Cheney were saying about Iran's intentions to build a nuclear weapon, as they did in December of last year.
[02:47:34.563 --> 02:47:36.384]  That was true rebellion against the tyranny.
[02:47:36.384 --> 02:47:44.189]  I mean, that is a big split in the government to have the official estimates say, no, there's no WMDs, no, there's no war, no, we don't need a war.
[02:47:44.189 --> 02:47:50.454]  Yeah, so there's that underlying basis of integrity, but that's, you know, that's a
[02:47:51.718 --> 02:47:54.521]  Even that has been sort of eroded.
[02:47:54.521 --> 02:48:10.936]  Their leaders, McConnell, the head of national intelligence, and this despicable guy, Hayden, I mean, he makes a big speech out in Oklahoma and he says, well now it's my personal opinion, it's my personal opinion, that Iran is hell-bent on getting a nuclear weapon.
[02:48:10.936 --> 02:48:15.840]  Well, who cares about his personal opinion if the whole intelligence community, 16 agencies,
[02:48:18.152 --> 02:48:23.517]  Iran stopped trying to do a nuclear weapons related part of this program in 2003.
[02:48:23.517 --> 02:48:27.420]  Who cares about Hayden's personal opinion?
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:29.082]  And it's all been inspected.
[02:48:29.082 --> 02:48:30.343]  They've been over the barrel.
[02:48:30.343 --> 02:48:31.964]  They let him in.
[02:48:31.964 --> 02:48:40.232]  I don't usually get into a book's cover, but I've watched a lot of hearings with Hayden and seen a lot of him and seen him compared to the same type of person.
[02:48:40.912 --> 02:48:42.854]  And I don't normally loathe people.
[02:48:42.854 --> 02:48:44.174]  Like, I don't even loathe George Bush.
[02:48:44.174 --> 02:48:44.995]  I don't like him.
[02:48:44.995 --> 02:48:52.460]  But there's something loathsome and something weak and chicken-necked and despotic about him and Richard Perle.
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:54.101]  They seem like two peas in a pod.
[02:48:54.101 --> 02:49:00.866]  And the way he twists things and says there's no Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment means we can do whatever we say is reasonable.
[02:49:00.866 --> 02:49:06.790]  I mean, going against all of the precedent, all of common law, all of our tradition, to just tell
[02:49:07.310 --> 02:49:09.551]  You know, huge rooms of reporters and lawyers.
[02:49:09.551 --> 02:49:12.633]  No, we're allowed to spy on whoever we want without a warrant.
[02:49:12.633 --> 02:49:16.955]  I mean, he is... I pray I see him go to prison.
[02:49:16.955 --> 02:49:20.917]  Well, you know, what we have there is a Martinet.
[02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:23.218]  He's got four stars on his shoulder.
[02:49:23.218 --> 02:49:31.122]  And unfortunately, the way you get one star these days is to just salute very smartly and say, wonderful idea, to the next guy up.
[02:49:31.122 --> 02:49:33.063]  And so he's the example of the worst.
[02:49:34.707 --> 02:49:37.669]  You know, there are lots of things that could be adjusted.
[02:49:37.669 --> 02:49:40.111]  Let me just tell you a little true story here.
[02:49:40.111 --> 02:49:53.679]  After I questioned Rumsfeld down there in Atlanta, I was invited up to the Lou Dobbs Show in New York, okay, so I'm waiting to go on, and it was the period in which Hayden had been nominated to be head of the CIA.
[02:49:53.679 --> 02:49:57.442]  Now, I had read something indicating that Bobby Inman, the
[02:49:57.904 --> 02:50:13.848]  The great Bobby Ray Inman, who I've enjoyed so much respect as head of NSA at one point, and who was there when the FISA law was constructed and had a big hand in constructing it, that at the New York Public Library two nights before, he had said, Hayden clearly did something illegal here.
[02:50:13.848 --> 02:50:17.569]  He knows better than anyone that the FISA law prohibited what he was doing.
[02:50:17.569 --> 02:50:18.870]  It was a very sorrowful thing.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.241]  That's what Inman told the New York Public Library.
[02:50:22.241 --> 02:50:23.501]  What happens next?
[02:50:23.501 --> 02:50:29.503]  He arrives at Lou Dobbs' show, goes on before me, cuts in ahead of me, puts on a tie.
[02:50:29.503 --> 02:50:31.443]  Dobbs says, what do you think of Hayden?
[02:50:31.443 --> 02:50:35.124]  And Inman says, I think he's supremely qualified for the job.
[02:50:35.124 --> 02:50:38.245]  I was on next, and I had a headache ahead of time.
[02:50:38.245 --> 02:50:40.146]  Ray McGovern, stay there.
[02:50:40.146 --> 02:50:44.427]  We're on TV on one end of this, so we're going to keep talking during the break.
[02:50:44.427 --> 02:50:45.947]  We'll be back for everybody else in three minutes.
[02:50:45.947 --> 02:50:47.888]  Got to go to the InfoWars streams to hear this.
[02:50:49.170 --> 02:50:51.171]  It's a big idea.
[02:50:51.171 --> 02:50:52.932]  A New World Order.
[02:50:52.932 --> 02:50:58.256]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:50:58.256 --> 02:51:00.657]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.657 --> 02:51:03.439]  Could their objective be world domination?

[02:53:45.013 --> 02:54:01.086]  I was talking behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers with Ray McGovern, and he dropped a bombshell on me.
[02:54:01.086 --> 02:54:04.049]  He said, and our viewers, he said that
[02:54:05.026 --> 02:54:13.493]  It's really up to Israel right now on whether there's going to be an attack on Iran or not, both in the lobby and with things militarily that Israel does.
[02:54:13.493 --> 02:54:16.996]  They could even go back into Lebanon and claim that's a threat to them.
[02:54:16.996 --> 02:54:18.117]  I mean, anything could happen.
[02:54:18.117 --> 02:54:20.859]  And he said, and Israel could stage a false flag.
[02:54:20.859 --> 02:54:23.161]  Now, you then talked about the USS Liberty.
[02:54:23.161 --> 02:54:24.663]  I want you to be able to elaborate on that.
[02:54:24.663 --> 02:54:26.844]  You're going to hold over five minutes into the next hour, so we have time.
[02:54:30.058 --> 02:54:31.679]  I mean, that is an amazing statement.
[02:54:31.679 --> 02:54:43.769]  I remember in the Washington Post, the week before 9-11, there was a Pentagon analysis saying we're worried Israel could stage a false flag to get us into a war in the Middle East.
[02:54:43.769 --> 02:54:46.131]  Can you speak to that?
[02:54:46.131 --> 02:54:47.252]  Well, yes.
[02:54:47.252 --> 02:54:57.360]  You know, it seems terribly cynical to suggest that what the President calls, quote, our ally, end quote, Israel, would do something like that.
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:54:59.442]  First off, your listeners should realize that
[02:55:00.183 --> 02:55:04.105]  In a juridical sense, there is no defense treaty with Israel.
[02:55:04.105 --> 02:55:08.168]  They are not our ally in any real sense of the term.
[02:55:08.168 --> 02:55:13.651]  Morally and so forth, they have a gun, but that's not an obligation on our part to defend them.
[02:55:13.651 --> 02:55:16.972]  But that's sort of an academic point, as the President has promised to do.
[02:55:16.972 --> 02:55:20.094]  Plus, they've got one of the biggest militaries in the world and 400 nukes.
[02:55:20.094 --> 02:55:28.219]  Yeah, you know, one boggles the so-called threat from one nuke from Iran when they have 400.
[02:55:29.525 --> 02:55:51.512]  But the situation, what I think people really need to remember is that on the June 8, 1967, in the middle of that first war with the Arabs, Israeli planes and torpedo boats did their damnedest to sink the USS Liberty, knowing full well that it was a U.S.
[02:55:51.512 --> 02:55:52.792]  naval ship.
[02:55:52.792 --> 02:55:56.434]  They killed 34 of the Liberty's crew and wounded over 170.
[02:55:57.972 --> 02:55:59.634]  Now, we have their intercepted messages.
[02:55:59.634 --> 02:56:01.595]  There's an American flag on that.
[02:56:01.595 --> 02:56:04.798]  You don't attack it.
[02:56:04.798 --> 02:56:06.160]  We have the intercepted messages.
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:07.181]  There's no doubt.
[02:56:07.181 --> 02:56:09.963]  And by the way, by the way, they'd always denied that.
[02:56:09.963 --> 02:56:19.051]  And now, as you said last year, NSA released the intercepts, what we'd already had pilots come public and say they refused three times and were ordered, you attack and sink that American ship.
[02:56:19.051 --> 02:56:19.612]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:56:19.612 --> 02:56:20.453]  Yeah.
[02:56:20.453 --> 02:56:23.816]  So, you know, what's important for listeners to understand
[02:56:24.548 --> 02:56:26.929]  Is that there's no doubt that it was deliberate.
[02:56:26.929 --> 02:56:29.130]  Now, why they would do such a thing?
[02:56:29.130 --> 02:56:31.971]  There are some very cogent theories.
[02:56:31.971 --> 02:56:32.951]  That's not clear.
[02:56:32.951 --> 02:56:36.893]  In other words, there is some question as to why they would do that.
[02:56:36.893 --> 02:56:39.734]  That they did it, there's no question about it.
[02:56:39.734 --> 02:56:49.738]  And one of the things listeners should also know is that the Navy, the Congress, LBJ, McNamara, everyone covered it up for decades.
[02:56:49.738 --> 02:56:54.160]  And finally, a book was written by a fellow named Jay Kristol.
[02:56:54.876 --> 02:56:58.839]  That espoused the Israeli version that, oh, this is just a terrible mistake.
[02:56:58.839 --> 02:57:00.841]  And guess who endorsed that book?
[02:57:00.841 --> 02:57:08.327]  The younger John McCain, his father having been responsible for a bogus investigation of the incident himself.
[02:57:08.327 --> 02:57:11.910]  Now, I'm not saying the sins of the father should be visited on the son.
[02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:18.335]  I am saying that John McCain, Jr., in a crass appeal to the lobby,
[02:57:19.162 --> 02:57:27.967]  I endorse the conclusions of this book, which are clearly bogus, and which the NSA intercepts now released show are completely bogus.
[02:57:27.967 --> 02:57:35.411]  The veterans, such as the ones that survived the USS Liberty, deserve better, and their story needs to be told.
[02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:36.172]  Why?
[02:57:36.172 --> 02:57:47.058]  Because it was on June 8, 1967, and subsequent years, that the Israeli government was persuaded, for good reason,
[02:57:47.762 --> 02:57:56.377]  That they could literally get away with murder, and our Congress and our Executive and even our Navy would not say anything about it.
[02:57:56.377 --> 02:58:01.565]  That is a very, very dangerous position to be in, and beware of what might happen in the Gulf.
[02:58:04.167 --> 02:58:05.068]  Ray McGovern.
[02:58:05.068 --> 02:58:08.150]  We'll be back in 70 seconds for the final segment.
[02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:10.351]  Ray McGovern battling lymphoma cancer.
[02:58:10.351 --> 02:58:12.633]  Everybody should pray for him.
[02:58:12.633 --> 02:58:15.415]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:15.415 --> 02:58:19.578]  Boy, very bold today, and just amazing discussion.
[02:58:19.578 --> 02:58:20.518]  Final segment with him.
[02:58:20.518 --> 02:58:23.060]  Then for about 10 minutes, we've got Veterans for Peace on.
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:25.702]  They've been banned from the Memorial Day D.C.
[02:58:25.702 --> 02:58:29.885]  March.

[02:58:40.385 --> 02:58:44.008]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.008 --> 02:58:46.470]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:46.470 --> 02:58:49.512]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.512 --> 02:58:55.237]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:55.237 --> 02:58:59.160]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:46.201]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:59:52.987 --> 02:59:55.368]  He did the morning briefings for multiple U.S.
[02:59:55.368 --> 02:59:59.889]  presidents, including the president's father.
[02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:01.289]  Which means he's a CIA analyst.
[03:00:01.289 --> 03:00:02.149]  They have different types.
[03:00:02.149 --> 03:00:06.590]  He's the one that integrated all the big threats together for a large picture.
[03:00:06.590 --> 03:00:08.791]  That's the type of analysis we need.
[03:00:08.791 --> 03:00:16.353]  Because if we try to get into minutiae of each little sector, it's impossible.
[03:00:17.105 --> 03:00:18.386]  Got about five minutes left with him.
[03:00:18.386 --> 03:00:21.667]  Ray McGovern, you were just bringing up Israel, staging a false flag.
[03:00:21.667 --> 03:00:24.968]  That is the elements that control Israel at the time.
[03:00:24.968 --> 03:00:26.689]  What is going on with Israel?
[03:00:26.689 --> 03:00:28.390]  I mean, they're endangering the whole world.
[03:00:28.390 --> 03:00:31.731]  The elite seems to be totally power-mad.
[03:00:31.731 --> 03:00:38.814]  They want to get rid of Iran, when Iran has tried to be friends with them, going back for 50 years, when they could certainly work things out.
[03:00:39.617 --> 03:00:43.719]  Every time there's moderate moolahs in control, they seem to freak out even more.
[03:00:43.719 --> 03:00:47.300]  I mean, what is this?
[03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:49.461]  Is this just overconfidence?
[03:00:49.461 --> 03:00:50.121]  I mean, why?
[03:00:50.121 --> 03:00:55.464]  Well, you know, Alex, I think part of their problem is us.
[03:00:55.464 --> 03:01:08.589]  You know, I'm talking about Elliott Abrams, arch-neoconservative, convicted convict for lying to Congress during Iran-Contra, and yet running our foreign policy out of the White House, our foreign policy toward that part of the world.
[03:01:10.029 --> 03:01:15.933]  What we're talking about here is a kind of delusional, extremist fringe.
[03:01:15.933 --> 03:01:18.735]  Cheney, Abrams are running this thing.
[03:01:18.735 --> 03:01:21.156]  Now, they have counterparts in Israel.
[03:01:21.156 --> 03:01:24.579]  Again, extremist, kind of lunatic fringe.
[03:01:24.579 --> 03:01:28.641]  Not the majority, not only of the Israelis, but the Israeli government.
[03:01:30.516 --> 03:01:36.721]  They're being, sort of, egging each other on, thinking, well, we only have seven, eight months left of George W. Bush.
[03:01:36.721 --> 03:01:39.563]  We've got to exploit his... And we could be kings!
[03:01:39.563 --> 03:01:45.667]  We could start World War III and then be the kings and then remake the world, like after World War II, and we can fix it all!
[03:01:45.667 --> 03:01:51.272]  I was just about to say, it seems like they egg each other on, like a group of hunting dogs that get each other really excited.
[03:01:51.272 --> 03:01:52.352]  You ever seen that?
[03:01:52.352 --> 03:01:53.253]  Well, exactly.
[03:01:53.253 --> 03:01:56.916]  Now, what I'm saying here is that this is an incredibly myopic
[03:01:57.719 --> 03:01:58.399]  Myopic view.
[03:01:58.399 --> 03:02:01.281]  You know, I care a lot about Israel, okay?
[03:02:01.281 --> 03:02:07.843]  And most of the Israelis, I dare say most of them, realize that this is a very myopic policy.
[03:02:07.843 --> 03:02:12.125]  You know, attacking Lebanon as they did two summers ago, that was crazy.
[03:02:12.125 --> 03:02:13.566]  They lost, okay?
[03:02:13.566 --> 03:02:23.490]  Now Hezbollah is more powerful in Lebanon than ever before, and instead of having a multi-confessional government on their border, they're going to have a very hostile government.
[03:02:23.490 --> 03:02:26.271]  Similarly, now, they're talking with Syria.
[03:02:27.194 --> 03:02:29.955]  Elliott Abrams doesn't like that.
[03:02:29.955 --> 03:02:37.938]  So, there are some sensible folks in Israel that have started dealing with these folks as sort of a half measure.
[03:02:37.938 --> 03:02:39.198]  So what do you think is going to happen?
[03:02:39.198 --> 03:02:40.099]  We've only got two minutes left.
[03:02:40.099 --> 03:02:41.799]  What do you think is going to happen?
[03:02:41.799 --> 03:02:54.404]  Well, I think that unless somebody puts a spoke in the juggernaut toward war, that we will be bombing and missile attacking from our naval ships, Iran, within the next two months.
[03:02:55.880 --> 03:02:58.822]  So you think that's the window, is the next two to three months?
[03:02:58.822 --> 03:03:01.724]  Well, that's a guess, okay?
[03:03:01.724 --> 03:03:05.727]  I'm more than 50% confident it's going to happen when it happens.
[03:03:05.727 --> 03:03:08.410]  Maybe God doesn't even know.
[03:03:08.410 --> 03:03:18.798]  But the problem is, when you have people like Conyers or Pelosi or other people who think, oh, okay, well, if you tax Iran, then we might think about impeaching them.
[03:03:18.798 --> 03:03:21.080]  Well, give me a break, you know?
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:22.921]  That won't happen once the war started.
[03:03:22.921 --> 03:03:23.241]  Right.
[03:03:24.082 --> 03:03:27.165]  Great, and so we have kind of the one candidate who wants to bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.
[03:03:46.842 --> 03:03:49.964]  You know, they may actually think that this could help that candidate.
[03:03:49.964 --> 03:03:53.927]  Then they've got the obliterate candidate!
[03:03:53.927 --> 03:04:02.514]  Well, you know, yeah, it's going to be interesting these next couple of... I think everyone needs to do something more than they have before, Alex.
[03:04:02.514 --> 03:04:08.860]  Go not only talk to, but occupy your congressmen or your congresswomen's or your senators' offices.
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:13.123]  Make sure they realize, you know, for Pelosi and Conyers to say, well, now we'll impeach
[03:04:13.502 --> 03:04:20.668]  That indicates they have no, no idea, whatever, of what a war with Iran would... We haven't even talked about the terrorist threat.
[03:04:20.668 --> 03:04:25.472]  I mean, the terrorist threat from Iran, you know, makes Al-Qaeda look like Mount St.
[03:04:25.472 --> 03:04:28.374]  Ursula in terms of the damage they can do worldwide.
[03:04:28.374 --> 03:04:31.957]  Well, well, well, well, Ray, I mean, I don't want to take up more of your time.
[03:04:31.957 --> 03:04:37.021]  If you want to come back for five more minutes on the other side and tell people that's fine, or if you've got to go, we can have you back next week.

[03:04:40.842 --> 03:04:42.782]  Stack the next guest up on top of him.

[03:05:46.736 --> 03:05:49.560]  A new world order.
[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:50.481]  In the near future.
[03:05:51.371 --> 03:05:54.432]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:05:54.432 --> 03:05:57.253]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:05:57.253 --> 03:06:00.035]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[03:06:00.035 --> 03:06:03.236]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:03.236 --> 03:06:10.559]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:13.581 --> 03:06:19.025]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:26.630]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:27.410]  They're not after money.
[03:06:27.410 --> 03:06:28.691]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:28.691 --> 03:06:29.672]  They're after power.
[03:06:29.672 --> 03:06:30.813]  That's what they're after.

[03:07:49.010 --> 03:07:57.053]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:57.053 --> 03:08:00.414]  In about five minutes we're gonna get the head of Veterans for Peace on.
[03:08:05.263 --> 03:08:06.704]  They've been banned from the parade.
[03:08:06.704 --> 03:08:09.307]  They've always been allowed into parades.
[03:08:09.307 --> 03:08:17.413]  Wade McGovern, I want to get into Iran, but just briefly, I go out to a protest now, or I go out to even videotape on a street corner.
[03:08:17.413 --> 03:08:20.476]  Cops all over the country come over and say, turn it off, get out of here.
[03:08:20.476 --> 03:08:22.758]  I could go to a third world country.
[03:08:23.866 --> 03:08:25.087]  And they don't do that.
[03:08:25.087 --> 03:08:29.029]  And I've been to Latin American third world countries, European third world countries.
[03:08:29.029 --> 03:08:34.833]  I mean, I don't think Americans realize how they've moved us into martial law light.
[03:08:34.833 --> 03:08:36.434]  How things have changed.
[03:08:36.434 --> 03:08:39.675]  How the federal government was able to instruct locals to do that.
[03:08:39.675 --> 03:08:43.638]  How this hysteria had done that.
[03:08:43.638 --> 03:08:45.659]  Do you have any comments on that?
[03:08:45.659 --> 03:08:46.760]  Well, I do, Alex.
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:49.361]  You talk about martial law light.
[03:08:49.361 --> 03:08:52.123]  Well, if anyone's looking for martial law
[03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:55.432]  Heavy, or black.
[03:08:55.432 --> 03:08:59.294]  Just wait until we strike Iran.
[03:08:59.294 --> 03:09:13.603]  If and when we strike Iran from the air, they can do, in addition to the things I've already mentioned, the kind of worldwide terrorism that would, as I started to say, make Al-Qaeda look like, you know, the Mount St.
[03:09:13.603 --> 03:09:15.564]  Ursula volleyball team.
[03:09:15.564 --> 03:09:20.087]  I mean, the Iranians have a worldwide capability to do real, real terrorism.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:23.622]  And you can fully expect that if this happens.
[03:09:23.622 --> 03:09:28.265]  Now, what are we likely to see in the next few weeks?
[03:09:28.265 --> 03:09:38.132]  I think that it's going to be real hard for the Americans to come up, the American military, to come up with enough Iranian weapons to insert into southern Iraq and say, well, we found them.
[03:09:38.132 --> 03:09:38.893]  You know why?
[03:09:38.893 --> 03:09:41.114]  Because the Iraqis are not cooperating.
[03:09:41.114 --> 03:09:44.957]  The Iraqis are talking to the Iranians and the Iraqi leaders are saying, look,
[03:09:45.396 --> 03:09:46.137]  We want evidence.
[03:09:46.137 --> 03:09:49.120]  We don't want speculation about Iranian weapons.
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:49.981]  So what are they going to do?
[03:09:49.981 --> 03:09:52.323]  They're going to resort to the big lie.
[03:09:52.323 --> 03:09:58.330]  The big lie is the claim that Iranians president had threatened to, quote, wipe Israel off the map.
[03:09:58.330 --> 03:09:59.651]  He didn't say that, folks.
[03:09:59.651 --> 03:10:00.512]  What did he say?
[03:10:00.512 --> 03:10:01.393]  He said, quote,
[03:10:02.017 --> 03:10:08.739]  The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the pages of time, period, end quote.
[03:10:08.739 --> 03:10:09.700]  I'll say that again.
[03:10:09.700 --> 03:10:15.161]  The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the pages of time, period, end quote.
[03:10:15.161 --> 03:10:17.182]  He was quoting Khomeini, okay?
[03:10:17.182 --> 03:10:18.282]  Now what is he saying?
[03:10:18.282 --> 03:10:28.926]  He's saying that the regime occupying Jerusalem and the occupied territories for the last 40 years, more years than the Soviets have occupied Eastern Europe, should vanish from the pages of time.
[03:10:29.366 --> 03:10:30.507]  I agree with that.
[03:10:30.507 --> 03:10:31.408]  I agree with that.
[03:10:31.408 --> 03:10:33.130]  I think they should obey the U.N.
[03:10:33.130 --> 03:10:37.034]  Resolution 242, which we voted for back in 1967.
[03:10:37.034 --> 03:10:47.804]  So it's a big lie to say that what Ahmadinejad was saying was he's going to wipe Israel off the map, or as the President so often says, threaten to destroy Israel.
[03:10:47.804 --> 03:10:49.145]  He has done nothing of the kind.
[03:10:50.046 --> 03:10:52.769]  Besides all that, he doesn't have the capability to do that.
[03:10:52.769 --> 03:11:01.919]  So if we strike Iran, it will be completely because our president has been, as Scowcroft said, mesmerized by the Israeli leaders.
[03:11:02.774 --> 03:11:06.575]  Ray McGovern, in closing, to be specific, I don't want there to be a war.
[03:11:06.575 --> 03:11:07.956]  I don't particularly like Iran.
[03:11:07.956 --> 03:11:10.677]  I like their people, but all these governments are corrupt.
[03:11:10.677 --> 03:11:12.437]  I'm not saying good guy, bad guy.
[03:11:12.437 --> 03:11:17.339]  Obviously, though, the neocons are the bad guys if they attack, so I'm not politicizing this.
[03:11:17.339 --> 03:11:19.740]  I'm just looking at the basic facts here.
[03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:28.828]  And to me, if Iran doesn't have a capability of aircraft carriers and ICBMs and whatever, they're going to need to use asymmetrical warfare.
[03:11:28.828 --> 03:11:40.618]  If 100, 200, 1,000, there's different battle plans, to blow up all their power plants, blow up their bridges, their water plants, anything for quote industry, a total bombing of the stone age of their country, mass murder,
[03:11:41.298 --> 03:11:47.864]  I mean, then any means they've got to fight back, is that even really going to be, quote, terrorism?
[03:11:47.864 --> 03:11:55.732]  And the media and the government's already said, if they raise a fist to fight back, it will be called terrorism, and that they're then going to nuke them.
[03:11:55.732 --> 03:11:59.115]  What the neocons have said is, if you fight back, we're going to nuke you.
[03:12:00.387 --> 03:12:07.593]  Yeah, someone said once that a terrorist is a fighter without aircraft, without stealth bombers, you know?
[03:12:07.593 --> 03:12:18.423]  If that's all you've got, that's what you're going to use, and you can be assured that an attack on Iran would let loose that kind of terrorism worldwide, and I'm talking about worldwide, and to include our country.
[03:12:20.297 --> 03:12:28.224]  And instead of it being a fake Saudi Arabian U.S.-Pakistan run Al-Cieda, we're talking about real terrorists.
[03:12:28.224 --> 03:12:30.566]  We're talking about real... What type of asymmetrical?
[03:12:30.566 --> 03:12:33.608]  Are we talking about people putting chlorine gas in high-rise apartments?
[03:12:33.608 --> 03:12:35.430]  Are we talking about blowing up bridges?
[03:12:35.430 --> 03:12:37.351]  Are we talking about blowing up power plants?
[03:12:37.351 --> 03:12:41.555]  Are we talking about going into malls and shooting 500 people?
[03:12:41.555 --> 03:12:44.517]  You know, Alex, I have to say what the Germans say at this point.
[03:12:44.517 --> 03:12:46.038]  It's beneath you, Bill Falk.
[03:12:46.038 --> 03:12:47.159]  I'm over-esked.
[03:12:48.433 --> 03:12:53.317]  I'm not a specialist in any of this, and I'd be just guessing, but... But the sky's the limit!
[03:12:53.317 --> 03:13:10.510]  Well, you know, I know their capability as well as their intentions in this case, and their capabilities in Europe in particular, and in Asia, and to a slightly less degree in this country, are, as I say, such as to put al-Qaeda to, you know, to ridicule in terms of how much the Iranians could do.
[03:13:10.510 --> 03:13:13.292]  So, you know, that's one reason, and I think if
[03:13:13.982 --> 03:13:22.325]  It's a big mistake on Iran's part that they're so damn smug, that they're so damn confident that we wouldn't possibly try to do this.
[03:13:22.325 --> 03:13:24.286]  Well, in closing, just look at the economy.
[03:13:24.286 --> 03:13:31.509]  If they mine harbors, if they sink ships in canals, they're in the key straits of Ormuz.
[03:13:31.509 --> 03:13:36.090]  I mean, that right there will send oil to $500 a barrel.
[03:13:36.090 --> 03:13:36.811]  It would.
[03:13:36.811 --> 03:13:39.832]  You know, the question is whether anybody's telling Bush that.
[03:13:40.922 --> 03:13:55.451]  You know, he knows there's a big gas pump there in Crawford, and he's got a lot of money, and, you know, it's an open question to me as to whether he gives a rat's ass for my expression as to what happens after January of next year.
[03:13:55.451 --> 03:14:01.755]  Ray McGovern, are there any particular websites for people to learn more about your organization and other groups you support?
[03:14:01.755 --> 03:14:08.560]  The best one is ConsortiumNews.com, run by Robert Perry, one of the best investigative journalists in the country.
[03:14:09.295 --> 03:14:11.617]  Another one would be Common Dreams.
[03:14:11.617 --> 03:14:18.001]  Afterdowningstreet.org is a wonderful site if you want to keep up with just about everything that's going on in Congress.
[03:14:19.401 --> 03:14:21.923]  Afterdonningstreet.org.
[03:14:21.923 --> 03:14:24.825]  Okay, Ray McGovern, get well.
[03:14:24.825 --> 03:14:27.187]  I'm glad to hear the prognosis is good.
[03:14:27.187 --> 03:14:32.551]  And I'd love to, as things heat up, have you back for 30 minutes an hour in the next month or two.
[03:14:32.551 --> 03:14:39.596]  And certainly, if things kick off, we're even able to do this radio show to have you come back on as this unfolds.
[03:14:39.596 --> 03:14:41.497]  But I guess whichever way it goes, you're right.
[03:14:41.497 --> 03:14:45.160]  We've got to put the maximum effort out now to say no to war.
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:53.463]  And I guess get that estimate out that they aren't a threat and not poke this sleeping tiger.
[03:14:53.463 --> 03:14:55.283]  And just thank you so much for your time, sir.
[03:14:55.283 --> 03:14:57.184]  We really appreciate it and respect it.
[03:14:57.184 --> 03:14:58.424]  You're most welcome.
[03:14:58.424 --> 03:14:58.984]  All right, folks.
[03:14:58.984 --> 03:15:00.945]  There goes Ray McGovern.
[03:15:00.945 --> 03:15:02.265]  Do we have Veterans for Peace on?
[03:15:02.265 --> 03:15:04.926]  Okay, I apologize for them.
[03:15:04.926 --> 03:15:07.547]  I apologize for backing Jack McClam up, too.
[03:15:07.547 --> 03:15:08.587]  Just so much is happening.
[03:15:08.587 --> 03:15:11.148]  We've only got part of this segment and the next.
[03:15:11.148 --> 03:15:13.509]  I've got local news stories here out of Virginia.
[03:15:14.346 --> 03:15:14.746]  We're good to go.
[03:15:31.491 --> 03:15:31.791]  It's Marceau.
[03:15:31.791 --> 03:15:32.071]  It's Marceau.
[03:15:32.071 --> 03:15:32.492]  Like, it's Marceau.
[03:15:32.492 --> 03:15:33.252]  I'm at your house.
[03:15:33.252 --> 03:15:35.334]  You know me like Marceau, Marceau.
[03:15:35.334 --> 03:15:35.894]  I love your show, Alex.
[03:16:02.051 --> 03:16:06.073]  Well, let me clarify that we are the Investors for Peace Washington, D.C.
[03:16:06.073 --> 03:16:11.175]  area chapter, and we have been in contact with this group.
[03:16:11.175 --> 03:16:26.422]  American Veterans Center is the one that is sponsoring the parade, and if you go to their website, you will see such entities as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Kaki, CACI, which is a huge subcontractor here in the Washington, D.C.
[03:16:26.422 --> 03:16:26.742]  area.
[03:16:27.482 --> 03:16:28.983]  Sure, your phone's a little overdriven.
[03:16:28.983 --> 03:16:31.344]  Back off of it a bit so we can hear you clearly.
[03:16:31.344 --> 03:16:38.267]  Yeah, they've got all these clearly political groups there, but they play this game of, oh, we're not being political, no First Amendment for you.
[03:16:53.450 --> 03:17:23.370]  That's exactly right, and if you also look in past parades here, this group, American Veterans Center, has a lot of groups like Revolutionary War and Actors, active duty military groups to march, and if those guys are not said to be carrying a political message, then I do not understand why Veterans for Peace, which opposes all wars and wants to let American people know the true cost of wars, not only in dollar amounts, which is in excess of $1 trillion in moving upwards
[03:17:23.650 --> 03:17:24.250]  We're good to go.
[03:17:45.655 --> 03:17:45.916]  Sure.
[03:17:57.159 --> 03:18:10.845]  Sure, they don't count people who die outside country, as you know, so it's more like 18,000 now dead troops and more like 100,000 injured, so your numbers may be a little different from the ones I ferreted out, but even those official numbers are incredible.
[03:18:10.845 --> 03:18:13.466]  Plus, we're five-plus years into this.
[03:18:13.466 --> 03:18:20.288]  I bet money, if you guys try to go out there without the permit, I bet they're going to arrest you, but maybe that's the attention we need.
[03:18:20.288 --> 03:18:23.910]  Are you still going to try to go out and be handing out flyers or educating people?
[03:18:25.007 --> 03:18:26.667]  Well, we're still talking about that right now.
[03:18:26.667 --> 03:18:33.929]  We have some emails and some phone calls among members of our chapter, and we haven't really decided anything yet.
[03:18:33.929 --> 03:18:47.912]  But I know last year in Boston and last year, I think it was, in Southern California, I want to say Santa Barbara maybe, but two of our Veterans for Peace chapters were not allowed to march in Veterans Day parades.
[03:18:47.912 --> 03:18:52.833]  There was another chapter in Washington State that is not allowed to march in this year's Memorial Day parade.
[03:18:53.593 --> 03:18:57.216]  This is not an isolated incident, and that's why we're trying to... Well, yes, sir.
[03:18:57.216 --> 03:18:57.696]  Stay there.
[03:18:57.696 --> 03:18:58.036]  Stay there.
[03:18:58.036 --> 03:19:01.639]  I want to come back with another... I want to stay there and come up with another segment.
[03:19:01.639 --> 03:19:07.243]  But the key here is, a year and a half ago, the poll was 71% Gallup poll of U.S.
[03:19:07.243 --> 03:19:09.304]  troops polled in Iraq or against the war.
[03:19:09.304 --> 03:19:13.267]  The number's more like 80% in other polls that have been regional and around bases.
[03:19:13.267 --> 03:19:20.572]  So they're also creating an illusion that the majority of troops are for the war with these fraudulent events for the general public.
[03:19:20.572 --> 03:19:21.953]  So I want to get your comment on that.
[03:19:22.936 --> 03:19:28.000]  You represent the majority of veterans who aren't for this stinking war.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.402]  You got 80% of the American people against it as well.
[03:19:30.402 --> 03:19:40.209]  So again, it's all part of this minority forcing their view and their fraud on us and trying to bar us equal access as veterans.
[03:19:40.209 --> 03:19:42.250]  So it's all part of discrimination.
[03:19:42.250 --> 03:19:43.071]  Discrimination.
[03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:44.192]  I can't even say it.
[03:19:45.578 --> 03:19:51.421]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:19:51.421 --> 03:19:56.845]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:19:56.845 --> 03:20:02.228]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:20:02.228 --> 03:20:08.131]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:20:08.131 --> 03:20:12.414]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[03:20:12.594 --> 03:20:14.356]  Most people are overly acidic.
[03:20:14.356 --> 03:20:18.139]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:20:18.139 --> 03:20:22.963]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:20:22.963 --> 03:20:24.004]  Do your part.
[03:20:24.004 --> 03:20:26.626]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[03:20:45.191 --> 03:20:48.052]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[03:20:48.052 --> 03:20:49.612]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:20:49.612 --> 03:20:51.753]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:20:51.753 --> 03:20:53.653]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:20:53.653 --> 03:20:55.134]  The late great USA.
[03:20:55.134 --> 03:20:56.914]  America, freedom to fascism.
[03:20:56.914 --> 03:21:03.936]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:21:46.434 --> 03:21:47.875]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:47.875 --> 03:21:53.941]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:53.941 --> 03:21:54.742]  That's right.
[03:21:54.742 --> 03:21:57.164]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:57.164 --> 03:22:04.531]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:22:05.071 --> 03:22:13.217]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:13.217 --> 03:22:18.701]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:22:18.701 --> 03:22:24.505]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:24.505 --> 03:22:28.608]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:22:29.008 --> 03:22:29.289]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:29.289 --> 03:22:31.272]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:22:31.272 --> 03:22:31.873]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:31.873 --> 03:22:32.153]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:49.656]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[03:22:49.656 --> 03:22:54.542]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[03:22:54.542 --> 03:23:02.533]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[03:23:02.833 --> 03:23:11.840]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:16.784]  With PasswordSafe Pro, your passwords can be secured in an encrypted database within minutes.

[03:23:51.340 --> 03:23:54.541]  We got Michael Marceau, VP of the Local Veterans for Peace in D.C.
[03:24:18.414 --> 03:24:23.256]  It's a really nice organization, one of the little virulent hippie groups.
[03:24:23.256 --> 03:24:27.258]  I've been to some of their meetings, you know, I have to hear about how families are bad and world government's good.
[03:24:27.258 --> 03:24:30.600]  And these are good folks that are against the war and the new world order in many respects.
[03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:39.043]  But regardless if I agree with them or disagree, the vast majority of veterans are against the war, the vast majority of troops are against the war, all the polls show that.
[03:24:39.043 --> 03:24:42.345]  But no, they can't be involved because that would shatter the illusion
[03:24:43.450 --> 03:24:47.314]  Uh, that the war is tied somehow to being patriotic.
[03:24:47.314 --> 03:24:55.304]  When the people running the war, Halliburton, have moved to Dubai and Cheney's got a house in Dubai and the Bush's one in Paraguay and they're destroying the U.S.
[03:24:56.358 --> 03:24:59.079]  They're puppets for the New World Order, but they're doing it.
[03:24:59.079 --> 03:25:00.980]  Michael, you've got a few minutes left.
[03:25:00.980 --> 03:25:16.767]  In closing, tell us about your website, your group, and any ideas on what you'll be planning on Veterans Day while the rest of Americans are out, or not Veterans Day, Memorial Day, while the rest of Americans are out dodging police under federal funding, sucking our blood for blood tests.
[03:25:16.767 --> 03:25:18.488]  Well, our website is www.vfpdc.org.
[03:25:23.098 --> 03:25:32.501]  And if you go online there, there was a poll within the last day or two in a local paper about this, and about three-quarters of the folks are in favor of us marching in the parade.
[03:25:32.501 --> 03:25:35.761]  So please go to that website and add your vote to that tally.
[03:25:35.761 --> 03:25:46.824]  Right now, we are still discussing if we want to just go as spectators and stand on the sideline and hold our Veterans for Peace banner and another sign that said, kick out a parade.
[03:25:46.824 --> 03:25:51.185]  We know that there will be some media that way, and we are hoping that we will get our message across.
[03:25:52.667 --> 03:26:00.140]  Now I wonder if enforcers who believe the First Amendment is evil will come over and tell you that you're not allowed to do that.
[03:26:00.140 --> 03:26:02.825]  YouTube that and keep those cameras rolling 24-7.
[03:26:04.801 --> 03:26:21.440]  Yeah, we're going to try to see if we can get some folks with video cams and that kind of stuff out there on Monday and see what happens, but so far most of the responses that we've got from being on talk shows the last couple of days have been very positive and we're gratified that the American people can see through the
[03:26:23.562 --> 03:26:24.503]  But that doesn't matter.
[03:26:24.503 --> 03:26:30.668]  Their officers have now been taught that freedom and the First Amendment is evil, so look out.
[03:26:30.668 --> 03:26:31.468]  That's my point.
[03:26:31.468 --> 03:26:39.195]  How do people contact you, who aren't even part of Veterans for Peace, to come out and videotape, support you, you know, kind of be observers of enemy operations?
[03:26:39.195 --> 03:26:42.197]  Well, just look for the National Memorial Day Parade.
[03:26:42.197 --> 03:26:44.899]  It's right down Constitution Avenue in the heart of D.C.
[03:26:44.899 --> 03:26:51.825]  I think it starts about 2 p.m., so show up around noon, get a good front row seat, and kind of watch the festivities, as they say.
[03:26:54.111 --> 03:26:56.813]  And find out your website again, sir.
[03:26:56.813 --> 03:27:02.398]  Okay, it's www.vfpdc.org.
[03:27:02.398 --> 03:27:05.080]  And if you get lost, it's Veterans for Peace plus the D.C.
[03:27:05.080 --> 03:27:05.960]  chapter.
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:10.184]  You can find that in Google or YouTube, or by going to Yahoo.
[03:27:10.184 --> 03:27:11.825]  Well, thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[03:27:12.879 --> 03:27:20.726]  Hey, we appreciate the chance to tell our story and to understand that the rest of America is with us in spite of the silliness that goes on here in Washington, D.C.
[03:27:20.726 --> 03:27:23.990]  We know the rest of America is with us, and we certainly appreciate that.
[03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:27.593]  And to all my fellow veterans, have a safe and quiet and peaceful Memorial Day.
[03:27:28.115 --> 03:27:30.676]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[03:27:30.676 --> 03:27:31.717]  Take care.
[03:27:31.717 --> 03:27:32.977]  All right.
[03:27:32.977 --> 03:27:33.757]  Good talking to you, sir.
[03:27:33.757 --> 03:27:36.118]  Got to defend his First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:27:36.118 --> 03:27:45.722]  We're going to come back with Jack McClam with some really serious information in the next segment, so everybody be sure and stay with us for that.
[03:27:45.722 --> 03:27:47.223]  Before I end this segment,
[03:27:48.675 --> 03:27:53.958]  This show is made possible by my documentary film sales and by the other books and videos we carry.
[03:27:53.958 --> 03:27:56.839]  Like American Drug War isn't even available in stores yet.
[03:27:56.839 --> 03:27:58.300]  Huge success on Showtime.
[03:27:58.300 --> 03:28:00.221]  Three hours of extras on the DVD.
[03:28:00.221 --> 03:28:01.402]  You can't get anywhere else.
[03:28:01.402 --> 03:28:03.483]  The two-hour film and three hours of extras.
[03:28:03.483 --> 03:28:09.766]  All available right now at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[03:28:20.211 --> 03:28:24.632]  All 19 of my films, Truth Rising, will be up there July 4th for everybody.
[03:28:24.632 --> 03:28:30.054]  Then it'll ship out on DVD, but the first place you'll see it will be PrisonPlanet.tv, the most amazing film I've made yet.
[03:28:30.054 --> 03:28:33.595]  It's cinema verite, no voiceover, not a lot of Alex Jones.
[03:28:33.595 --> 03:28:35.536]  Meant to have none of me in it, but it's got me being arrested in it.
[03:28:35.536 --> 03:28:39.437]  I mean, the close-up, Geraldo Rivera flipping everybody off, the rest of it.
[03:28:39.437 --> 03:28:41.218]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[03:28:41.218 --> 03:28:44.759]  Remember, your support makes what we do here possible.
[03:28:44.759 --> 03:28:45.039]  Also,
[03:28:46.405 --> 03:28:57.608]  The donation buttons, and the mailing address, and the details of the Money Bomb, from our perspective, and where you donate, is going up on InfoWars.com in the next hour.
[03:28:57.608 --> 03:29:06.431]  I've just got to read all of it to prove it, but I've looked at it, it looks good, and it's got $10 buttons, $20 buttons, $50 buttons, $100 buttons, or a button for whatever you want to give on PayPal.
[03:29:06.431 --> 03:29:08.231]  There'll be a 1-800 line posted there.
[03:29:08.231 --> 03:29:12.852]  It'll be next Saturday, not tomorrow, but seven days from now, will be the Money Bomb.
[03:29:12.852 --> 03:29:13.633]  100%, you have my word.
[03:29:16.659 --> 03:29:17.380]  Of honor.
[03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:22.283]  We'll go to equipment and fighting the New World Order and none of it will go to Alex Jones.
[03:29:22.283 --> 03:29:30.367]  It'll all go to this office and starting a TV show and upgrading the servers and just up in the game here, big time.
[03:29:30.367 --> 03:29:32.329]  So, we'll see how much comes in.
[03:29:32.329 --> 03:29:33.549]  We need to have a good showing here.
[03:29:33.549 --> 03:29:34.830]  I need your support.
[03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:35.791]  The country does.
[03:29:35.791 --> 03:29:37.192]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.192 --> 03:29:39.713]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.713 --> 03:29:42.395]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:46.055 --> 03:29:49.817]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[03:29:49.817 --> 03:29:54.518]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[03:29:54.518 --> 03:29:59.820]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[03:29:59.820 --> 03:30:11.045]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[03:30:11.045 --> 03:30:13.406]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[03:30:13.806 --> 03:30:15.848]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[03:30:15.848 --> 03:30:16.768]  Let's face it.
[03:30:16.768 --> 03:30:19.611]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.

[03:30:47.430 --> 03:30:50.252]  A New World Order.
[03:30:50.252 --> 03:30:55.134]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:30:55.134 --> 03:30:57.975]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:30:57.975 --> 03:31:00.756]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:31:00.756 --> 03:31:03.938]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:31:03.938 --> 03:31:11.261]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:14.284 --> 03:31:19.728]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:31:19.728 --> 03:31:23.610]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:31:23.610 --> 03:31:26.172]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:31:26.172 --> 03:31:27.333]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:27.333 --> 03:31:28.113]  They're not after money.
[03:31:28.113 --> 03:31:29.394]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:29.394 --> 03:31:30.375]  They're after power.
[03:31:30.375 --> 03:31:31.536]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:31:56.843 --> 03:31:58.464]  His name is Steve Schenk.
[03:31:58.464 --> 03:32:00.985]  His radio show called Fearless Radio.
[03:32:00.985 --> 03:32:06.047]  He says solution to all the craziness in America is just get independent and healthy.
[03:32:06.047 --> 03:32:10.448]  So you can be fearless of all of the scary stuff you're not supposed to know about.
[03:32:10.448 --> 03:32:15.050]  Stay away from this stinker on website efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:15.370 --> 03:32:19.111]  I warned you, don't do efoodsdirect.com!

[03:32:32.856 --> 03:32:33.856]  This is Steve.
[03:32:33.856 --> 03:32:36.437]  We take your independence very seriously.
[03:32:36.437 --> 03:32:38.317]  Come and find me on Fearless Radio.
[03:32:38.317 --> 03:32:39.778]  Call 800-605-5868 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:56.897 --> 03:32:59.379]  We're good.
[03:33:28.549 --> 03:33:31.931]  All right, folks, we're back live here.
[03:33:31.931 --> 03:33:35.513]  Thank you for joining us today.
[03:33:52.299 --> 03:33:54.060]  We're gonna go to Jack McClam in just a moment.
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:58.362]  Two sponsors that make this broadcast possible and are also fabulous folks.
[03:33:58.362 --> 03:34:00.423]  One of them is eFoodsDirect.
[03:34:00.423 --> 03:34:10.247]  eFoodsDirect.com, big banner at the top of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with all the uncertainty with what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with the economy and so much more.
[03:34:10.247 --> 03:34:17.611]  You need to give eFoodsDirect a call to get a free catalog or to check into getting a year supply of food, two month supply of food at stores for more than 10 years.

[03:34:21.153 --> 03:34:23.434]  It's where I've chosen to get storable foods.
[03:34:23.434 --> 03:34:24.735]  It isn't because I'm living in fear.
[03:34:24.735 --> 03:34:31.299]  I'm living in control, or trying to live more in control, where I can take care of my family.
[03:34:31.299 --> 03:34:33.961]  And again, folks, the fine people at eFoods Direct

[03:35:00.602 --> 03:35:01.544]  I don't know.
[03:35:14.230 --> 03:35:15.070]  It doesn't make you feel bad.
[03:35:15.070 --> 03:35:17.951]  It doesn't have any speed or any caffeine in it.
[03:35:17.951 --> 03:35:22.051]  It's just got raw foods that your body actually absorbs.
[03:35:22.051 --> 03:35:26.312]  Dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, chlorella, spirulina.

[03:35:42.295 --> 03:35:42.455]  Okay.
[03:35:42.455 --> 03:35:45.757]  Briefly, at the start of the show, I mentioned this, and we'll have to have Jack back on about this as it develops.
[03:35:45.757 --> 03:35:48.938]  Just in a nutshell, Jack McClam calls me, I guess about three years ago, and he says,
[03:36:10.816 --> 03:36:13.498]  Whatever 2005 was, yeah, three years ago.
[03:36:13.498 --> 03:36:17.061]  He says, I've got a guy who volunteers and does one of my websites.
[03:36:17.061 --> 03:36:18.362]  Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[03:36:18.362 --> 03:36:19.002]  He's a great guy.
[03:36:19.002 --> 03:36:21.944]  His name's Chris Jones.
[03:36:21.944 --> 03:36:22.905]  He lives in California.
[03:36:22.905 --> 03:36:31.531]  He wants to put in a job application, because they have thousands of servants in there, for the summer, getting the Grove ready and for the 15-day encampment.
[03:36:31.531 --> 03:36:32.372]  And he wanted to talk to him.
[03:36:32.372 --> 03:36:35.434]  So I called him, and he said, yeah, I've got a little camera.
[03:36:35.434 --> 03:36:36.795]  I'm going to get a job there.
[03:36:36.795 --> 03:36:38.276]  I think I've got a job there.
[03:36:38.276 --> 03:36:39.577]  And I said, man, this is serious.
[03:36:39.577 --> 03:36:40.298]  This isn't a joke.
[03:36:40.891 --> 03:36:41.652]  They will set you up.
[03:36:41.652 --> 03:36:42.152]  They will kill you.
[03:36:42.152 --> 03:36:43.693]  And he's like, well, you got in and you were okay.
[03:36:43.693 --> 03:36:48.997]  And I said, yeah, I am a public figure and it's harder for them to kill me.
[03:36:48.997 --> 03:36:49.898]  Doesn't mean they may not.
[03:36:49.898 --> 03:36:52.420]  I said, they've killed other people.
[03:36:52.420 --> 03:36:55.222]  They have arrested other people.
[03:36:55.222 --> 03:36:57.104]  And I said, this is very serious.
[03:36:57.104 --> 03:36:58.585]  And I said, I'm not telling you to do it.
[03:36:58.585 --> 03:37:01.507]  But I said, I said, I'm not getting involved with you either.
[03:37:01.507 --> 03:37:02.748]  And I know Jack wasn't really either.
[03:37:02.748 --> 03:37:04.830]  He's like, well, this is my volunteer web guy for a few years.
[03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:06.591]  But he said, better call Alex Jones.
[03:37:06.591 --> 03:37:07.132]  He's been in there.
[03:37:07.772 --> 03:37:17.934]  Sure enough, I get sent these memory sticks with video of inside the chalet where they hatched the Manhattan Project, Star Wars, Cold War, so much of it.
[03:37:17.934 --> 03:37:20.135]  They brag about that.
[03:37:20.135 --> 03:37:23.515]  The image of the child they burned, you know, so much.
[03:37:23.515 --> 03:37:26.336]  And I made Order of Death.
[03:37:26.336 --> 03:37:29.117]  And you knew him as Kyle.
[03:37:29.117 --> 03:37:31.677]  And so, I mean, it was serious when I snuck in in 2000.
[03:37:31.677 --> 03:37:34.938]  It was serious when he snuck in and was working there and secretly shot video in 2005.
[03:37:38.226 --> 03:37:45.609]  Then, years later, and Jack can go over the timeline here and the time we have with The Basics.
[03:37:45.609 --> 03:37:47.989]  I'm just giving you the background here.
[03:37:47.989 --> 03:37:50.530]  You knew him as Kyle the few times he was a guest on the show.
[03:37:50.530 --> 03:37:55.272]  And I didn't even want to do that because I knew they could get voice print if he'd been in the military and things.
[03:37:55.272 --> 03:38:06.816]  And I had him on, put the film out, and then he showed neighbors and gave the whole neighborhood, like we recommend, copies of my film and the film he was in.
[03:38:07.719 --> 03:38:11.061]  And then teenagers came over, 14, 15 year olds.
[03:38:11.061 --> 03:38:12.701]  He gave them copies.
[03:38:12.701 --> 03:38:14.982]  And it turned into like a witch hunt in the neighborhood.
[03:38:14.982 --> 03:38:18.404]  They said he is killing this child in front of an idol.
[03:38:18.404 --> 03:38:21.865]  They came and arrested him to investigate if he'd killed the child at Bohemian Grove.
[03:38:21.865 --> 03:38:24.367]  This is insane.
[03:38:24.367 --> 03:38:28.869]  I mean, understand, the film he's giving people is aired on national television.
[03:38:28.869 --> 03:38:29.749]  Okay?
[03:38:29.749 --> 03:38:32.210]  And the cops come and arrest him, and he was convicted.
[03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:33.711]  They said that showing
[03:38:34.815 --> 03:38:42.341]  Fourteen-year-olds, and we've got all the court documents, that that was a point, a part, a type of child abuse.
[03:38:42.341 --> 03:38:50.769]  And they said, we're targeting you, and he didn't want to come on air a year ago when they started the trial and the proceedings, because he thought, well, I'll beat it, this is ridiculous.
[03:38:50.769 --> 03:39:00.457]  And he went in court, and they showed the film and admitted that it was about this, and admitted that, and wouldn't let a lot of other stuff in, and just said, you're going to jail for this video.
[03:39:01.084 --> 03:39:06.613]  Now, Kelly Rushing gave a Ron Paul video to a state police officer in Kentucky, and this was in the newspaper.
[03:39:06.613 --> 03:39:11.942]  They arrested him and said the Ron Paul speech was threatening, and they went to trial, and he was facing three years in jail.
[03:39:13.179 --> 03:39:14.519]  Hey brother, good to be here.
[03:39:14.519 --> 03:39:14.679]  Great.
[03:39:38.621 --> 03:39:40.682]  Yeah, very important too.
[03:39:40.682 --> 03:40:05.671]  We here at our two police and military associations are very worried about Chris because just the other day, oh I guess you know, when they first arrested him, the powerful internationalists and politicians who came after him after recording their Bohemian Grove, came after him through the court system and the first time they arrested him,
[03:40:06.451 --> 03:40:12.774]  They took him down to Theo Lacey Jail there in Orange, California.
[03:40:12.774 --> 03:40:22.120]  And the prison guards yelled to all the prisoners, this man Chris Jones has F'd two little boys.
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:25.041]  And they yelled that out to all the prisoners.
[03:40:25.041 --> 03:40:29.183]  And so they caught Chris in the shower and beat him almost to death.
[03:40:29.183 --> 03:40:30.984]  The prisoners did.
[03:40:30.984 --> 03:40:32.845]  And that was all a state event.
[03:40:32.845 --> 03:40:35.767]  And now he's in jail down at the Theo Lacey
[03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:36.500]  Yeah.
[03:40:50.720 --> 03:40:52.782]  He's really a good guy.
[03:40:52.782 --> 03:40:54.303]  Loves America.
[03:40:54.303 --> 03:40:55.684]  Loves this country.
[03:40:55.684 --> 03:40:58.426]  Well, I mean, I've met him a few times in California at events.
[03:40:58.426 --> 03:40:59.446]  He's really classy.
[03:40:59.446 --> 03:40:59.947]  Nice guy.
[03:40:59.947 --> 03:41:01.688]  Works for a good company.
[03:41:01.688 --> 03:41:02.709]  You know, nice girlfriend.
[03:41:02.709 --> 03:41:03.609]  Goes to church.
[03:41:03.609 --> 03:41:03.970]  I know.
[03:41:03.970 --> 03:41:05.270]  I mean, let's just bring it up.
[03:41:05.270 --> 03:41:09.674]  Mark Dice goes to the same church with their girlfriends to church.
[03:41:09.674 --> 03:41:17.059]  But the thing is that what he was convicted of was giving a video to children, which has aired on national television.
[03:41:17.958 --> 03:41:20.759]  Yeah, he was convicted of three charges.
[03:41:20.759 --> 03:41:25.320]  Matter of fact, out of six, they charged him with six charges.
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:34.003]  And they had to drop three because the young boys that he babysitted for eight, nine years ago, they said he molested these kids.
[03:41:34.003 --> 03:41:41.025]  And they took these kids in the room, like I've seen them do in the Phoenix Police Department, and Child Protective Services comes in and
[03:41:42.114 --> 03:41:51.439]  Yeah, and so that's what they did to the kids, but when the kids got to trial, they got up and said that he never touched us, he never did anything wrong to us, and it just ticked the judge
[03:42:04.218 --> 03:42:09.605]  The criminal judge and the criminal prosecutor are all so bad that they... Now, Jack, I want to go back.
[03:42:09.605 --> 03:42:11.147]  I want to stop you covering all the facts.
[03:42:11.147 --> 03:42:15.112]  This started, he was first arrested, because I have all the court documents.
[03:42:15.112 --> 03:42:15.793]  Some of them he sent me.
[03:42:17.543 --> 03:42:22.186]  Where they said it was a video of a snuff film of burning a baby to an idol.
[03:42:22.186 --> 03:42:24.047]  So that was the original arrest.
[03:42:24.047 --> 03:42:27.509]  And they said he gave neighborhood kids of 14 and 15 the video.
[03:42:27.509 --> 03:42:30.831]  And then later they brought in, like you said, most of this got dropped.
[03:42:30.831 --> 03:42:32.112]  But I mean, this is the insanity.
[03:42:32.112 --> 03:42:35.074]  But you're talking about then later stuff where they even went back.
[03:42:35.074 --> 03:42:38.256]  I mean, this was a hit job.
[03:42:38.256 --> 03:42:39.617]  Yeah, eight, nine years ago.
[03:42:39.617 --> 03:42:42.179]  And these are teenagers today.
[03:42:42.179 --> 03:42:45.741]  And they told the truth on the witness stand.
[03:42:46.607 --> 03:42:50.472]  The judge had purposely stacked the jury.
[03:42:50.472 --> 03:43:04.328]  Luckily, former FBI agent, special agent in charge Ted Gunnarsson sat in on the whole trial and Ted and I have been in a conference over this and he told me that the judge when they selected the jury, Alex
[03:43:05.069 --> 03:43:10.831]  Uh, there was a guy in there that said he wanted to personally kill Chris because of the charges against him.
[03:43:10.831 --> 03:43:16.793]  And the judge says, does that mean you can't be, uh, unbiased and serve on the jury?
[03:43:16.793 --> 03:43:18.933]  And the guy says, well, I'll try judge.
[03:43:18.933 --> 03:43:20.474]  And he says, okay, you're on the jury.
[03:43:21.327 --> 03:43:25.770]  And so the judge just stacked the jury with people that were absolute idiots.
[03:43:25.770 --> 03:43:26.670]  Now let's go back.
[03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:34.554]  I interrupted when you brought up the point about when the young man got up and said, no, it's all lies, he didn't do anything to us.
[03:43:34.554 --> 03:43:36.115]  What happened next?
[03:43:36.115 --> 03:43:44.640]  Well, they found a kid that had been accused of child molestation that Chris had babysat.
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:49.483]  And the guy got on the witness stand, he's a teenager now too.
[03:43:50.394 --> 03:43:54.697]  And, uh, he's a, I guess he's a pedophile, but they wouldn't let the jury know that.
[03:43:54.697 --> 03:43:56.818]  But Chris told me that.
[03:43:56.818 --> 03:44:06.443]  And, uh, and the kid said that they were, they, they got into a raffling match and, and pulled their pants down.
[03:44:06.443 --> 03:44:11.586]  And Chris sat down on the couch and he had a bulge bulge in his pants.
[03:44:11.586 --> 03:44:17.129]  Well, Chris says, whenever you sit down with a loose pair of jeans on, if they're not form fitting,
[03:44:17.771 --> 03:44:19.132]  You have a bulge right there.
[03:44:19.132 --> 03:44:21.694]  Yeah, that's the court record.
[03:44:21.694 --> 03:44:23.956]  When he stood up, it was gone.
[03:44:23.956 --> 03:44:26.638]  And so he was convicted for a bulge in his pants.
[03:44:26.638 --> 03:44:30.261]  I mean, even their star witness says he had a bulge in his pants.
[03:44:30.261 --> 03:44:31.522]  This is the conviction.
[03:44:31.522 --> 03:44:32.162]  That's it.
[03:44:32.162 --> 03:44:34.304]  Meanwhile, CPS, and we have the court record.
[03:44:34.304 --> 03:44:38.067]  Meanwhile, CPS is flying little kids out to Israel and Saudi Arabia right now.
[03:44:38.067 --> 03:44:39.208]  Yes, that's right.
[03:44:39.208 --> 03:44:40.229]  This is the new witch hunt.
[03:44:42.090 --> 03:44:45.252]  Uh, and to the Capitol for pedophilia, you know?
[03:44:45.252 --> 03:44:45.492]  Right.
[03:44:45.492 --> 03:44:45.612]  Right.
[03:45:02.782 --> 03:45:03.362]  Uh-huh.
[03:45:03.362 --> 03:45:04.283]  Yeah.
[03:45:04.283 --> 03:45:09.446]  They're really angry at Chris, and they're gonna, I guess, try to kill him in prison.
[03:45:09.446 --> 03:45:10.647]  And here's how we know it.
[03:45:10.647 --> 03:45:28.138]  They've sent a shill in as his cellmate, a stooge for the government, and that guy got in the cell with Chris here a few days ago and started telling him, saying things to him about his homosexuality and everything.
[03:45:28.138 --> 03:45:30.039]  Chris's homosexuality.
[03:45:30.039 --> 03:45:31.600]  And Chris told him to be quiet.
[03:45:32.350 --> 03:45:33.511]  And he refused to do it.
[03:45:33.511 --> 03:45:36.534]  He kept hammering on Chris and hammering on Chris.
[03:45:36.534 --> 03:45:40.578]  And so he couldn't get Chris to get up and fight him.
[03:45:40.578 --> 03:45:50.407]  So he yelled out through the bars that Chris was going to give a sexual favor to everybody in the prison.
[03:45:50.407 --> 03:45:57.354]  And so Chris threw his three-inch little pencil at the guy and hit him in the back with his three-inch little pencil.
[03:45:58.084 --> 03:46:00.747]  And he says, assault, assault guards.
[03:46:00.747 --> 03:46:03.089]  Uh, uh, Chris just assaulted me.
[03:46:03.089 --> 03:46:05.051]  I want to file charges on him.
[03:46:05.051 --> 03:46:11.217]  Well, the guards came down and they, uh, they told him to sit down and shut up that there was nothing to it.
[03:46:11.217 --> 03:46:13.680]  Cause they're just a three inch little piece of pencil.
[03:46:13.680 --> 03:46:16.923]  They only allow them to have those short little pencils, you know?
[03:46:16.923 --> 03:46:17.624]  And, uh, so
[03:46:18.447 --> 03:46:23.211]  Then he said to Chris, I'm going to get my buddies together and we're going to kill you.
[03:46:23.211 --> 03:46:25.473]  Now he's already been beaten half to death.
[03:46:25.473 --> 03:46:27.475]  Yeah, he's already been beaten half to death.
[03:46:27.475 --> 03:46:31.558]  He was beat unconscious there when they first arrested him.
[03:46:32.398 --> 03:46:42.182]  And so Chris got scared and told his mom about it, and her mom got a hold of us here at our two police and military associations, so I contacted the sheriff right away.
[03:46:42.182 --> 03:46:46.064]  Jack, can we give numbers out concerning this?
[03:46:46.064 --> 03:46:47.884]  Because I want to give some phone numbers out.
[03:46:47.884 --> 03:47:01.430]  Yeah, the reason I asked to come on is very important, Alex, that we've got the judge, David Thompson, and we'd like everybody to mail just a sentence or a paragraph to the judge asking the judge
[03:47:02.102 --> 03:47:05.004]  To let Chris out because his life's in danger.
[03:47:05.004 --> 03:47:05.465]  Well, three years.
[03:47:05.465 --> 03:47:07.226]  The judge just gave him three years in prison.
[03:47:19.079 --> 03:47:20.639]  But he's under appeal.
[03:47:20.639 --> 03:47:22.460]  He's under appeal right now, Alex.
[03:47:22.460 --> 03:47:25.360]  And we'd like to have him let out during his appeal.
[03:47:25.360 --> 03:47:27.100]  Absolutely.
[03:47:27.100 --> 03:47:27.941]  Well, he never left.
[03:47:27.941 --> 03:47:28.961]  I mean, this went on for a year.
[03:47:28.961 --> 03:47:30.061]  Right.
[03:47:30.061 --> 03:47:31.261]  But I mean, this is the incredible part.
[03:47:31.261 --> 03:47:33.482]  Guy with no criminal record.
[03:47:33.482 --> 03:47:37.922]  And he's been convicted of having a bulge in his pants nine years ago, which is made up.
[03:47:37.922 --> 03:47:43.643]  And it all began with him saying he killed a baby in front of an idol because neighbors saw the video and called the cops.
[03:47:43.643 --> 03:47:44.924]  I mean, is that what happens, Jack?
[03:47:44.924 --> 03:47:47.124]  Once the cops come, they're just going to set you up or what?
[03:47:48.012 --> 03:48:01.641]  Well, they have special cops like they did in the Phoenix Police Department that they know will commit any crime and will do anything they're told to do, ordered to do, because that's who's promoted up through the ranks.
[03:48:01.641 --> 03:48:11.447]  Anybody that's totally committed to shooting their mother for a nickel and taking bets on which way she'll fall are promoted up through the ranks, and the good officers with high moral character
[03:48:11.972 --> 03:48:12.293]  I don't
[03:48:31.124 --> 03:48:35.725]  You know, people don't realize how dangerous this is, infiltrating the Grove and him getting a job there.
[03:48:35.725 --> 03:48:39.346]  Everybody's giggling and laughing, saying they're going to go get jobs there.
[03:48:39.346 --> 03:48:41.066]  I'm not trying to scare you away from it, folks.
[03:48:41.066 --> 03:48:46.388]  But you remember, Jack, when you called me about this, and I told Chris, I said, you do what you want, buddy, I'm not involved.
[03:48:46.388 --> 03:48:51.509]  Because I can risk my life in being set up, but I'm not going to risk yours, and he sent me that great footage.
[03:48:52.970 --> 03:48:56.532]  David Thompson, give us the address, give us the jail number, give us some phone numbers.
[03:48:56.532 --> 03:49:02.335]  Please folks, just do a paragraph, a short little few sentences, and ask the judge to let Chris out.
[03:49:02.335 --> 03:49:06.858]  He's not a flight risk, he's not a threat to society.
[03:49:06.858 --> 03:49:18.685]  And write to Judge David A. Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N, and his address is 700 Civic Center Drive,
[03:49:21.895 --> 03:49:26.037]  And right after that, there's a large W and a period.
[03:49:26.037 --> 03:49:30.300]  It might be West, but don't spell out the word West because we don't know if it's a West or not.
[03:49:30.300 --> 03:49:38.124]  But it's 700 Civic Center Drive with a W period.
[03:49:38.124 --> 03:49:47.010]  And then it's Santa Ana, Santa, just like Santa Claus, Ana, A-N-A, California, 9-2-7-0-2.
[03:49:47.010 --> 03:49:48.070]  That's Santa Ana.
[03:49:51.877 --> 03:49:53.378]  California, 92702.
[03:49:53.378 --> 03:49:58.163]  Okay, phone numbers are even more important because he's in there, he's in danger right now.
[03:49:58.163 --> 03:49:59.504]  We need to call the jail.
[03:49:59.504 --> 03:50:00.765]  Jack, do you have those numbers?
[03:50:00.765 --> 03:50:06.490]  Well, now, let me tell you what happened yesterday after I called the sheriff and assistant sheriff J.B.
[03:50:06.490 --> 03:50:13.376]  Davis and told him that he was in fear of his life and that he had just been threatened that they were going to kill him.
[03:50:13.376 --> 03:50:18.881]  His mother wrote back to us and told us that a friend had just gone by the Theo Lacey jail
[03:50:19.878 --> 03:50:35.646]  And that Chris was immediately processed out and transferred to Wasco near Bakersfield, where they say he's undergoing a 90-day assessment.
[03:50:35.646 --> 03:50:43.269]  And his mother says, I can't imagine what they're assessing, but please pray for Chris because they could be shooting him up.
[03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:44.010]  No, no, they do that.
[03:50:44.010 --> 03:50:44.550]  Stay there, Jack.
[03:50:45.799 --> 03:50:48.320]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[03:50:48.320 --> 03:50:55.683]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[03:50:55.683 --> 03:51:01.286]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[03:51:01.286 --> 03:51:08.209]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[03:51:08.209 --> 03:51:14.832]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[03:51:15.615 --> 03:51:17.196]  Remember our trade deficit?
[03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:23.061]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[03:51:23.061 --> 03:51:29.446]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[03:51:29.446 --> 03:51:30.927]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[03:51:30.927 --> 03:51:31.007]  1-800-453-2202.

[03:51:46.058 --> 03:51:47.459]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:47.459 --> 03:51:50.282]  A New World Order.
[03:51:50.282 --> 03:51:55.166]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:51:55.166 --> 03:51:58.009]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:51:58.009 --> 03:52:00.812]  Put their objective being world domination.
[03:52:00.812 --> 03:52:03.995]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:03.995 --> 03:52:11.321]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:14.324 --> 03:52:19.768]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:19.768 --> 03:52:23.651]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:23.651 --> 03:52:26.213]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:26.213 --> 03:52:27.373]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:27.373 --> 03:52:28.174]  They're not after money.
[03:52:28.174 --> 03:52:29.435]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:29.435 --> 03:52:30.436]  They're after power.
[03:52:30.436 --> 03:52:31.737]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:53:50.313 --> 03:53:51.475]  We've only got five minutes left.
[03:53:51.475 --> 03:53:52.296]  We've got to move fast.
[03:53:52.296 --> 03:53:53.457]  We've got to get phone numbers out.
[03:53:53.457 --> 03:53:55.380]  What happens is they beat you.
[03:53:56.889 --> 03:54:00.430]  And then if you complain, they say you're mentally ill, then they drug you.
[03:54:00.430 --> 03:54:02.550]  This is when they're really politically targeting you.
[03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:13.912]  There's a famous dentist who was involved in a suit against the government over Medicare and Medicaid, and they just grabbed him and spent 10 years solitary confinement in prison, drugged.
[03:54:13.912 --> 03:54:15.992]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[03:54:15.992 --> 03:54:24.414]  And yeah, when you hear being assessed, that means they probably got him, put him on Thorazine, injecting him, and they'll say, look, he's slobbering, he's mentally ill.
[03:54:24.414 --> 03:54:25.594]  It's a very corrupt system.
[03:54:26.451 --> 03:54:30.793]  Jack McClam, do you have any phone numbers for us to give out for Chris Jones?
[03:54:30.793 --> 03:54:31.533]  Yeah, we do.
[03:54:31.533 --> 03:54:38.296]  Now, it's very important people write down Christopher Jones' name and his serial number.
[03:54:38.296 --> 03:54:40.077]  Okay, they must have his serial number.
[03:54:40.077 --> 03:54:53.843]  It's Christopher, C-H-R-I-S-T, like Christ, T-O-P-H-E-R, L is the middle initial, Jones, and his prison number is 243.
[03:54:57.073 --> 03:54:57.733]  9-3-2-1.
[03:54:57.733 --> 03:55:00.074]  2-4-3 9-3-2-1.
[03:55:00.074 --> 03:55:12.062]  And I have need that right away you get a paragraph off to the judge, but also there's a number here to call the criminal court.
[03:55:12.062 --> 03:55:14.923]  And I think it really is a criminal court.
[03:55:14.923 --> 03:55:18.786]  But it's in Santa Ana and it's where Judge Thompson is.
[03:55:18.786 --> 03:55:20.107]  And the phone number is 714 area code 834
[03:55:25.162 --> 03:55:26.963]  834-3593.
[03:55:26.963 --> 03:55:34.986]  That's 714, area code, 834-3593.
[03:55:34.986 --> 03:55:50.592]  And just tell the lady there, or tell the judge, if you can get through to the judge, to let Chris out during his appeal, that he's not a flight risk and that he's a proud member of the American Citizens and Lawmen Association.
[03:55:50.592 --> 03:55:53.313]  A lot of lawmen support him and know about him.
[03:55:54.148 --> 03:55:59.674]  And, uh, that, uh, he ought to be out during his appeal because they're talking about killing him now.
[03:55:59.674 --> 03:56:09.323]  Also, Alex, I would ask the people, please pray for Chris because when they're assessing him for this 90 days, they don't allow him to have any visitors at all.
[03:56:09.323 --> 03:56:11.545]  And he could be suicided in there.
[03:56:11.545 --> 03:56:13.447]  You know what I'm talking about?
[03:56:13.447 --> 03:56:18.552]  He could be depressed and they'll say, well, we found him very depressed and found him hanging from his, uh,
[03:56:20.416 --> 03:56:23.698]  Yeah, they want to make an example out of him.
[03:56:23.698 --> 03:56:25.760]  They don't want people getting jobs and going to the Grove.
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:28.702]  This is where the real power takes place.
[03:56:28.702 --> 03:56:31.764]  I had the head of the Kissinger Group on two weeks ago admitting that.
[03:56:31.764 --> 03:56:34.566]  And this is the price we pay to get the info out.
[03:56:34.566 --> 03:56:35.967]  We all should pray for him.
[03:56:35.967 --> 03:56:37.188]  Chris Jones is a hero.
[03:56:37.188 --> 03:56:40.370]  714-834-3593.
[03:56:40.370 --> 03:56:44.313]  And it's Agent David Thompson.
[03:56:44.313 --> 03:56:46.315]  Agent of Lucifer, David Thompson.
[03:56:46.315 --> 03:56:47.956]  That's the black-rubbed thug.
[03:56:48.816 --> 03:56:51.059]  Uh, but when you call the scum, be polite.
[03:56:51.059 --> 03:56:53.001]  Just let them know that the world's watching.
[03:56:53.001 --> 03:56:54.963]  What about calling the jail?
[03:56:54.963 --> 03:56:56.665]  Well, please do.
[03:56:56.665 --> 03:56:57.065]  Please.
[03:56:57.065 --> 03:56:59.267]  Well, he's gone from the jail now.
[03:56:59.267 --> 03:57:01.630]  I mean, he's at what facility?
[03:57:01.630 --> 03:57:03.011]  I mean, wherever he's at the prison.
[03:57:03.011 --> 03:57:07.296]  Uh, well, we don't know about this, uh, this Wasco.
[03:57:07.296 --> 03:57:09.538]  It's spelled like Costco, but with a W.
[03:57:10.562 --> 03:57:11.983]  We don't know anything about it right now.
[03:57:11.983 --> 03:57:22.511]  We're going to check into it, Alex, and find out what it is, but all we can find out is that inmates have gone there for assessment for 90 days and are allowed no visitors.
[03:57:22.511 --> 03:57:23.352]  Okay?
[03:57:23.352 --> 03:57:27.155]  So, we'll see if we can find out information about that, but right now,
[03:57:28.010 --> 03:57:34.015]  The jail that he was in, Theo Lacey Jail, the sheriff's jail, he's not there anymore.
[03:57:34.015 --> 03:57:37.297]  So now they put you into facilities where no one's even allowed to see you.
[03:57:37.297 --> 03:57:38.978]  Pretty soon it'll be forever.
[03:57:38.978 --> 03:57:40.880]  This government's so disgusting.
[03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:43.262]  Jack McClam will continue to watch this as it develops.
[03:57:43.262 --> 03:57:46.304]  Have you and maybe Chris Jones' mother on next week.
[03:57:47.144 --> 03:57:49.545]  That'd be wonderful.
[03:57:49.545 --> 03:57:52.065]  She's really fighting for her son.
[03:57:52.065 --> 03:57:59.086]  She knows how he was set up because Ted Gunderson told her all about the horrible, horrible trial there.
[03:57:59.086 --> 03:58:03.107]  As a matter of fact, I think she was there for the trial.
[03:58:03.107 --> 03:58:03.947]  Jack, we're out of time.
[03:58:03.947 --> 03:58:04.908]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:04.908 --> 03:58:05.748]  God bless you, brother.
[03:58:05.748 --> 03:58:06.708]  Thank you a lot.
[03:58:06.708 --> 03:58:08.548]  I warned Mr. Jones when he called me.
[03:58:08.548 --> 03:58:10.969]  I said, man, better think twice about this.
[03:58:13.616 --> 03:58:14.616]  Big trouble.
