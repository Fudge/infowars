[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:21.000 --> 00:29.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  It's Wednesday, January 29, 2020.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. InfoWars is here on air during this global crisis,
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  in defiance to the new world order who wanted us off the air long before they triggered what they've launched.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  Now, everybody can smell a rat. Everybody deep down knows that this is serious.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  Is it a serious hoax meant to dive the world economy?
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  Or is it a real super deadly bio-weapon meant to implode the economy and kill tens of millions of people
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  and usher in a planetary world government as the response to the crisis?
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  When you look at the background of the globalists saying they're going to use global pandemics
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  to make people accept and stay in a world government and you now see that unfolding
[01:26.000 --> 01:35.000]  and you see all the preparation and the censorship of anyone exposing the U.N. and Bill and Melinda Gates in the last few years.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  In the last three or four months, there's been completely draconian censorship level crackdowns.
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  Remember, six months ago, CNN said, oh, Facebook's now banned positive mentions of Alex Jones and others.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  And CNN said, next, they're going to start censoring private text messages in the WhatsApp that Facebook had bought.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's now official. Facebook admits they're doing it. It's not just Alex Jones.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Now it's Jordan Peterson. Next, it'll be Joe Rogan.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  You say, but Joe Rogan's played ball. He's been friendly to the system. But they know that Joe deep down is a patriot.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  I can tell you he is. They don't need me to tell them that. And they know he's got more power than they do.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  Just like M4 Wars has more power than they do because you have more power than the globalist. We are the people.
[02:24.000 --> 02:33.000]  But that's why this is all happening, ladies and gentlemen. It's A.I. live time watching everything you do.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  This is surveillance. This isn't just private companies doing what they want. This is the new communication system.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  Imagine if the FBI broke in on your phone call with A.I. listening to it and said, you can't say that in live time.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  They can now. Almost all the calls are now digital. Live time can break in.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  I told you this decades ago because they were theoretically talking about the plan. Now it's here.
[02:57.000 --> 03:07.000]  But again, they're implementing all this ahead of this release. And they're going to use this release as a beta test for bigger controlled plagues.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  They plan to release the future. That's undoubted. And that's the thesis of my film in game.
[03:12.000 --> 03:20.000]  Blueprint for global enslavement that was taken off of Amazon three weeks ago for violating community standards.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  It predicts the globalist staging worldwide pandemics incrementally expanding how deadly they are for full control.
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  And I show you where they met and even show you the documentation of their operations.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  So this is what we're laying out. This is what we're breaking down today.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  And we're going to be going over all of it in great detail how deadly the virus really is.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  We're not sure how far it spread. We're not sure. But we know the complete lockdown of China.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  And now all the flights in and out of China beginning to be totally canceled.
[03:54.000 --> 04:09.000]  That is already begun. And the secret evacuations, not just the ones that are on the news of U.S. State Department people, corporate individuals, military, out of China proper, not just out of that particular city, shows you this is serious.
[04:09.000 --> 04:22.000]  And I can tell you the virus has been in the United States for months. And I've had medical doctors on that work inside the military, inside Special Operations Command, Pachennic's heavily attached to that.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  He can tell you also he's joining us again today. This has already been going on. And they know that it does kill some people.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  So why are they now hyping it all up? It's hurting the economy. And that's what this is really about.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  And it's going to standardize control at a globalist level so they need global government to respond to a crisis like this.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  So we know this is contrived. We know it's a real virus. How deadly we're not sure. We know it's spreading. We know they're covering that up.
[04:49.000 --> 05:06.000]  We're going to work through it all today and break it down. This is a vital transmission. Please spread the live links to the show and tell everyone.
[05:19.000 --> 05:28.000]  You asked, we deliver. This easy option gives you the means to donate directly to the cause. Remember, we're all part of the fight. Infowars brought to you by you.
[05:28.000 --> 05:37.000]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas. Now we're bringing you an all new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[05:37.000 --> 05:53.000]  Ultra 12 from Infowars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, Methylkevolumin, to provide you with twice the B12. Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[05:53.000 --> 06:21.000]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[06:21.000 --> 06:34.000]  It's January 29th, 2020 on this live Wednesday edition. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:34.000 --> 06:45.000]  And we didn't just start playing air raid sirens as the panic over the coronavirus expanded. We've been playing it for the last six months every day.
[06:45.000 --> 06:58.000]  2020 hits, everything's going to change. You're going to see incredibly good things. You're going to see incredibly bad things. Newtonian physics, metaphysics, the Bible, history, common sense.
[06:58.000 --> 07:09.000]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction. And energy is not destroyed. It could just simply be put into another form.
[07:09.000 --> 07:21.000]  And evil's making its move against humanity right now. But humanity is awakening and responding. And you see everything the Bible talked about in times of great political and cultural change.
[07:21.000 --> 07:34.000]  When evil's been making its move, the earthquakes, the volcanoes, the swarms of locusts increasing, all of this is part of what's always happening on our planet, change.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  But historians in Rome and historians, Jewish historians, Chinese historians pointed out, even the legalists that didn't even really believe in God in China, they said,
[07:44.000 --> 07:55.000]  we notice when there's big political change, there's also earthquakes and volcanoes and storms and tsunamis. And in every case in history, people notice that it always lines up.
[07:55.000 --> 08:06.000]  Well, 2020 is just a number man has created. Okay, but it's all based on the earth orbiting the sun and ties into the basic mathematics of the universe.
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  But here we are in 2020 and no one can doubt 29 days in. All hell is breaking loose.
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  And China is on lockdown. Flights from around the world are being restricted or totally canceled.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  They are either hyping this as the hoax of all hoaxes to plunge the world economy.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  And to establish world government is the answer to the crisis, which the UN and Bill Gates are admitting they plan to do.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  Or it's far more deadly than they're saying with the response we've seen. And we do know a lot of people died from it.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  We do know the numbers are much higher than they've been saying. And we do know there have been cases here in the United States for months.
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.000]  And now the number of dead and dying is so high in China that their own people say you're covering it up.
[08:54.000 --> 09:05.000]  It's not 6,000 that are infected. It's not a couple hundred, 132 that are dead with the Wuhan coronavirus.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's much, much, much bigger. And now they're projecting a 5% negative growth rate for China.
[09:12.000 --> 09:25.000]  China on average has about a 10% growth rate. If China has a negative growth rate, that will take the world into a major recession to put it lightly.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  And the globalist said, if you ever try to pull out of our world government, there will be biological crises that will make you stay in it.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  You can pull that up. We've written articles about it. They constantly run their mouths.
[09:36.000 --> 09:46.000]  That migration crises, economic collapse, and biological weapons and other diseases will be the reason they bring in world government.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  Coronavirus. China has quarantined 50 million people. Experts worry that might backfire.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  That's NBC News.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  Plane carrying U.S. evacuees from China amid coronavirus outbreak diverted to California airbase.
[10:00.000 --> 10:08.000]  We'll play part of that Fox News report. Next segment, virus cases in China. Again, surging coronavirus evacuation flight lands in Alaska.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  Other evacuation flights land around the world.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  Countries evaluate evacuation of citizens from the virus epicenter completely.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  State Department orders U.S. employees in Wuhan to evacuate due to coronavirus.
[10:22.000 --> 10:32.000]  And they have the genome of this thing. Bill and Melinda Gates have patented it two years ago, a whole group of different sequences, a different variety of this virus.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  But for some reason, that's not being transmitted into the databases so when the virologists test this at hospitals and research labs, they don't even know how to identify it.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  And that's being done on purpose. And lab owners and others have been speaking out about this, including Mike Adams, but not just Mike Adams.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  And he's done an incredible job so far on being restrained but accurate.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's crystal ball level, but he speaks fluent Chinese and has businesses over there and his wife's from Taiwan. He's a great American.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  But he'll be hosting the fourth hour today. Dr. Steve Pacenna is going to be back on with us.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  We're going to be laying all of this out. But here's the bottom line.
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.000]  This is not the only crisis that we're going to face this year. We're going to face economic problems that come from this and uncertainty.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  We're going to face military crises and we're going to face cultural and spiritual crises.
[11:25.000 --> 11:40.000]  We're going to see the U.N. further throw third world populations at borders of the West and attempt to break the West in a massive clowered and pivot maneuver to then bring in a worldwide call for a planetary Marshall plan.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  Remember that. I said they'd call for a Marshall plan in Ukraine, a Marshall plan in Iraq.
[11:46.000 --> 11:58.000]  It's the term they always use, a corporate global takeover. You're going to be hearing for a worldwide Marshall plan six months from now.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  And so this is how the globalists are going to counter nationalists. This is how they're going to counter patriots.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  Now I'm going to stop right there.
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  I've been playing air raid sirens every day on air for three, four, five, six months.
[12:15.000 --> 12:25.000]  And I said on air, I'm doing that to note to everyone that the times have changed. We've gone into a red level crisis because humanity is awakening to the threat because the enemy is going to strike back.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  We're in the fight now.
[12:27.000 --> 12:41.000]  And so it's critical that patriots be self sufficient and it's critical that patriots be aware of what's going on. So you notice I didn't just start selling.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  Storeable foods.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  This week during this crisis.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  I've always been selling storeable food because it's insurance you can eat.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  And it's because I believe in it and I believe we should be self sufficient. It's the grasshopper that dies during the winter.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  It's the ants that go on and live into the future. So I'm sitting here last week.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  Ordering my family more storeable food so I can take care of people around me and and and ordering even more storeable food here to the office.
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  I've had enough storeable food for several hundred people for six months here at the office in a warehouse.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  About five years ago, some of them about two years ago. It's all there. I just bought more.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  So in case we have to shelter in place and stay on air during a crisis. And I thought, wait a minute, if I'm buying food.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  I better call our main supplier, who is the best highest quality in the country.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  I'm going to give it to them every day. You go to have the line when you do it with us where they're biggest seller.
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  My Patriots supply and they're ready our infowars line that is their highest quality, best and lowest price.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  And they said, we're surprised you hadn't called us. We're seeing record sales and institutional groups are trying to buy it.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  And FEMA just tried to buy from them again.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  They got their federal office call up and try to get them to give them everything.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  And they've got Matt Redhawk, the founder and owner, flying all over the country right now, trying to secure even more food.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  And I'll just tell you, at current sales rates, they've got two weeks of food.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  Everyone else they know is sold out, all the other big suppliers, but the others, most of them are not reputable.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  They will tell you they've got the food and then they will sit there on your money.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  They're in seven to 10 days, not because they don't have the food, but because they have to package it and they're running 24 hours a day.
[14:38.000 --> 14:48.000]  They've got food coming in 18 wheelers for the two week mark, but they're not counting that as if they have the food until it's in their facilities in Utah and three other states.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  So these guys are Patriots. They've been our big sponsor. They're 12 years old.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  They've been with us for 12 years because I knew they were about the lowest prices, high quality and having food when they say they do.
[14:59.000 --> 15:14.000]  M4warstore.com, you need to get your orders in now so that in case things do get bad, you get the food delivered to you because this coronavirus won't peak in China for two to three months.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  And then if it is going to peak here, it'll peak in the middle of the summer.
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  So I'm just telling listeners, ladies and gentlemen, I believe in having firearms and water filtration and knowing how to kick somebody's ass if I need to.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  I also believe in having storable food for my family and having the guns to protect it.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  And I'm just telling you right now, not just for this, but everything.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  I always go with what I do. So I'm ordering food. That's my marketing plan. It's just what I'm doing.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  Time for me to tell people about food. I'm buying it. See how that works?
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  I'm not sitting there going, oh, coronavirus, better get this. I'm buying food and going, there's trucks pulling up at the office with food.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  Why the hell am I telling the audience to buy it? Which you are doing infowarstore.com.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day.

[16:42.000 --> 16:48.000]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:50.000 --> 17:03.000]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:03.000 --> 17:13.000]  You owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[19:31.000 --> 19:39.000]  And people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen. And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago,
[19:39.000 --> 19:49.000]  and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com.

[20:35.000 --> 20:46.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[20:46.000 --> 20:54.000]  You're a very good observer, Cole. We have a very advanced program, something very different. An opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably.
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  And possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the Earth.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  No license, no prints, no warrants. But he took on five times like he was destined to the eyeballs.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  What year is this? What year do you think it is?
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  1996. That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
[21:17.000 --> 21:23.000]  I'm simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present trace the path of the virus.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  We're not in the present now.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  This is a place for crazy people.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill. I know you're crazy as a loon.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  The army of the 12 monkeys are the ones that spread the virus.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  Monkeys.
[21:36.000 --> 21:43.000]  You've been living in a meticulously constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  You haven't become addicted to that dying world?
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  No, sir.
[21:46.000 --> 21:47.000]  He needs help.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  I think I'm crazy when people start dying next month.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  I don't belong here.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  You're here because of the system.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  I know some things that you don't know.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  Yes, my son.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  You sent me to the wrong year.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  You're certain of that?
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  Science ain't an exact science.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  You had a bullet from World War I in your leg, James. How did it get there?
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.000]  The answers.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  You said that I had delusions. You said you could explain.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  I'm trying to.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  I want the future to be unknown.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  I can help you.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Get you out.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  You can't hide from them. Don't even try.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  We're all monkeys.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  They mutate. We live on your planet.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  They're watching you.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  I just want to do my part to get us back on top and charge the planet.
[22:34.000 --> 22:46.000]  World War I, World War I.
[22:46.000 --> 22:56.000]  World War I, World War I.
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.000]  The lights out in China only had a few days of food supplies in Wuhan.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Maybe a few weeks in other areas.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  And all the flights in a few days out of China will be ceased.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  And many other airlines are 100% ceasing flights.
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  But American airlines are just cutting back most of them as not to create a panic.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  And so I had an idea a few days ago, and I really appreciate the lead producer, Daria,
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  having the same idea because I tend to forget things that I want to do on the show.
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  And that's open the phones up so it's not just old Alex Jones up here flapping his lips
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  at people inside China.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Americans, Chinese, I don't care.
[23:44.000 --> 23:51.000]  Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Russian border with China, Japanese.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  I think you all got skin in the game more than the rest of us.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  I'd like to get your take on this.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  Merchant Marines, people that are going to the South China Sea.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  People that have family over there.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  That's who I want to open the phones up for the first round to make sure you can get in.
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  Then once we get those calls, we got to be disciplined listeners so this won't work.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  Everybody calls in.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  We won't be able to get to the people to call.
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  If you live in China or you live in the surrounding area and you have critical intel on this or you want to comment on what you're seeing,
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  we're getting a lot of emails from folks that are in China as well that want to come on the show.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  So you'll see that here.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  You'll see that on the war room.
[24:27.000 --> 24:34.000]  I'm undoubtedly going to be up here this week at night doing special live reports with witnesses inside China.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  People on the ground, that's all being lined up right now.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  So we get the intel on what's really happening because it is people inside China.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  Americans, Brits, Chinese, you name it, that are getting out the video showing.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  It's far worse than they're saying.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  There's way more sick people and way more dead people.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  And of course we know that.
[24:53.000 --> 25:00.000]  The response to SARS with the hysteria in the media was much bigger than this.
[25:00.000 --> 25:09.000]  There's not the hysteria in the media, but there's the clamp down going on and the cover up of how much of this is already in the United States.
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  And again, you get to a point where you learn information and then it's not that it's too dangerous to put it out.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  It's not that I want to be proven right later.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  It is.
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  It does get to the point of maybe Trump's right not to tell people how bad this is right now because of some timeline and they don't want hysteria to set in.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  And you just want people to incrementally get ready to have a lot of dead people around because we don't want to crash the stock market.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  But then you want to warn people at the same time as well.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  But I look, I'm going to think about it some more.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  And this is not a cliffhanger thing.
[25:43.000 --> 25:53.000]  I just I just I'm usually very decisive and I don't know what to do because I've got a lot of sources that are very, very good.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  And they know that it's broken containment on the West Coast.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  And because they never had containment up when this has already been going on in China for months.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  This has been incrementally building for months.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  It's far bigger exponentially than they say.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  The virus has been out longer.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  It is strengthening in its mutation as G.G.P. has said.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  And this just looks really, really bad.
[26:15.000 --> 26:26.000]  OK, and I can tell you that the Pentagon is mobilizing and that they're already getting set up to identify the cases as they come into hospitals.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  And in most cases, you're not going to be told that this is what's going on.
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  That's why they're not putting forward the gene sequencing to the labs so they can even be able to identify it.
[26:37.000 --> 26:45.000]  And I think the right thing to do is tell people now before it really starts spreading and killing a bunch of people so people know what to expect.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  I always tell my crew, give me the bad news right now.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  I want the bad news.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  I can't stand people that hide bad news.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  I want to get out in front of things.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  I want to know.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  I want to know now.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  Every time we lose, it's when I didn't get the information soon enough.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  And usually it's because we're just so busy and so much info is coming in.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  But I want to open the phones up for people in China or surrounding areas.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  I'm going to give the number out.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  It's 877-789-2539-877-789-2539.
[27:21.000 --> 27:48.000]  International dollar country code 1512-646-1776 or 877-789-Alex in 877-789-2539 or U.S. country code 1512-646-1776.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  And I'll go right to your phone calls from China or surrounding areas.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  And police listeners, we can only do this when you don't call in, which you've done a great job.
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  It's how we're able to say, hey, we need law enforcement in Virginia.
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  And then boom, we get like, you know, 10 calls from Virginia state police, local police get incredibly accurate information.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  And got a sense that almost all the police were totally upset and didn't like what was happening.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  And we're with the people.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And I got there and met them and they loved us.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  It was good to not let the system blame the police.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  It's not about kissing the police's ass.
[28:22.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's that they are being ordered to do this by the system and the system is trying to set it up where we have a clash in the future with the police.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  Instead of there's any clashes, which I hope there aren't, it's with globalists.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  Kingfiends, not the police that are fellow citizens, stuck in the middle of this BS.
[28:41.000 --> 28:50.000]  But that's just an example that I was talking about 877-789-2539, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  Share those links.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  People are ready to hear the truth.
[28:52.000 --> 29:21.000]  We're analyzing this crisis like no other organization.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:40.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:40.000 --> 30:03.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  You don't want my thanks.
[30:05.000 --> 30:11.000]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  You know what?
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[30:15.000 --> 30:24.000]  And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  I want to thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[30:38.000 --> 30:47.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  You have made history.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  We have made history together.
[30:51.000 --> 30:58.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:07.000]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high quality, organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[31:07.000 --> 31:16.000]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring, that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs,
[31:16.000 --> 31:24.000]  and then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[31:24.000 --> 31:30.000]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[31:30.000 --> 31:37.000]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[31:37.000 --> 31:50.000]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[31:50.000 --> 31:58.000]  So Winter Sun, taken out of the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[31:58.000 --> 32:08.000]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of Infowars.
[32:08.000 --> 32:19.000]  Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media, but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[32:19.000 --> 32:31.000]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[32:31.000 --> 32:40.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[32:40.000 --> 32:55.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[32:55.000 --> 33:10.000]  Ha ha, hey ol' Cobra!
[33:26.000 --> 33:41.000]  Infowars is going to go into caller mode, taking your calls on this incredible world we live in and all the insane things that are happening.
[33:41.000 --> 33:57.000]  Now the deep state globalist Democrats are trying to remove the president of the United States with all of their fraud while this crisis of the coronavirus is out of control and set to devastate the economy.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  And now that news is just rolling in.
[34:00.000 --> 34:10.000]  And all these major airlines canceling flights in to China, the evacuations that are taking place.
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  This is a big deal.
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.000]  And the question is how big will it get on the cost of life and of the economy?
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  Because the Chinese on the ground say a lot more people are sick and dying.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  I hope that's not the case, but that's what the people are saying on the ground.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  They say there's a government cover-up.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Then the government's locking down major cities.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  Now it's over 50 million people and not just Wuhan.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  Are they trying to create hysteria or is it really, really bad?
[34:39.000 --> 34:46.000]  Because the media is trying to play down with severity, but the crackdown and the response is the biggest we've ever seen.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  Makes me start sweating.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  So I said I want to get callers from China or surrounding countries, people that live inside China.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  We got hundreds of people calling in and they're like, hey, Sam's Club is empty of food and they live next to an Air Force base and see it being mobilized.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Those are the type of calls coming in.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Those are great calls.
[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  I need the lines to be open so that when 20 calls are coming in a second, we can get to the people that are calling from China.
[35:16.000 --> 35:25.000]  So please, right now, just folks from China, inside China, inside Wuhan, we're getting emails from folks that want to come on.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  It's the middle of the night over there right now.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  We're contacting them.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  We're going to get them on the broadcasts and on the war room, but probably this show today.
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.000]  But I need to keep those phone lines open to people calling us from China or border states with China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, people very, very close.
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  And internationally, all the country code and then 512-646-1776.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  Okay.
[35:58.000 --> 36:12.000]  Let me just mention, while we're looking at those calls, some of the other news that is unfolding.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Oh, my God, it's just insane.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  When I get in this mode, people say, someone's like, why do you start sweating sometimes on air?
[36:20.000 --> 36:29.000]  It's when I've got a thousand thoughts going through my head and I don't have public speaking fear.
[36:29.000 --> 36:38.000]  I don't have anxiety when it comes to being in the public, but it's the opposite.
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  It's that I need to be in an office just cogitating about all this.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  That's why I want to take the calls so we can just brainstorm what in hell is going on here because this is a big move on the globalist.
[36:52.000 --> 37:03.000]  We see all the synthetic pre-preparations for it and all the pre-programming, crocheting into a grand finale perfectly with this.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  The Netflix shows and the tabletop exercises and the world government announcements and the demonization of the anti-vaxxers and the censorship grids going into place.
[37:12.000 --> 37:22.000]  And the economic war going on and all of it, you look at it together, you know this is engineered as hell.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  Now, what is the attack though?
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  Because while we're watching this, it could be something else, but make no mistake.
[37:30.000 --> 37:41.000]  They've had articles in NBC News in places saying, wow, we went and tracked with computers and we know why the stock market went up one day because Alex Jones said this.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  And it's true.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  Any big prominent show that people think is credible that is credible can have a big effect.
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  And I know the stock market's a bubble, but I don't want to pop it because we'll go into a depression.
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  We have to have new innovations, new technologies, whole new economies.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's what can not even prop up a bubble, but stabilize it and actually make it work.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  And I'm not for bubble economies, but we're in one now and doing something else is a thing of the past.
[38:05.000 --> 38:12.000]  It's kind of like, again, I've given this analogy a lot of this whole Labrador retriever we had.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  And by the time he was like 12, he couldn't get up, couldn't walk, hip dysplasia.
[38:17.000 --> 38:34.000]  And the vet said, well, we can give him this depo-medrol steroid, anti-inflammatory, but it'll end up, you know, messing up his joints and things and maybe giving him a heart attack or whatever.
[38:34.000 --> 38:43.000]  In a couple of years. Well, I said, so we're going to kill the dog right now or keep my live comfortable a few years, shoot him up.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  And then the vet wouldn't give me more of it in about a year.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  I said, oh, he's already getting the main dose of it.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  But let's go ahead and put him down.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  And I said, but the dog's comfortable.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  So I just went to another vet and got double, just gave it to the dog and he lived three years happily.
[38:57.000 --> 39:05.000]  And he had a big, giant heart attack with me laying next to him on the carpet and lived to be 14, 15 years old.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  But the point of telling that story is America is that dog.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  And the world economy is that dog.
[39:12.000 --> 39:25.000]  So we can just get this big fat, juicy depression and war going right now and war on the streets and the EBT cards not working and just in time delivery and the breakdown of society that will make the Great Depression look like a cakewalk.
[39:25.000 --> 39:34.000]  Or we can innovate out of this because there's one way to get out of a bubble other than a depression.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  I was trying to eat breakfast taco during the break and a little piece of jalapeno went down on my lawn.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  Boy, that is painful as hell.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  So I don't see any callers from China.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  So I'm going to come back from break.
[39:55.000 --> 40:16.000]  I'm going to give the number out for military for people that have been in China recently for folks that have experienced or seen their family die from pneumonia like illnesses that we know are basically coming out of China and that are being covered up.
[40:16.000 --> 40:29.000]  It comes up for law enforcement for military for people that want to give out information and we're getting calls about food sold out being jerked off the shelves at Sam's clubs and Walmart's everywhere.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  And we're seeing that in the news and that makes me ask the question.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Why did info wars only start telling you that yesterday when I knew that before.
[40:39.000 --> 40:49.000]  And it's this pre conditioned pre program thing of oh I sell storeable food so I don't want to tell people that it's being sold out everywhere.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  When we've been selling storeable food since I got on air because I believe in it.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  It's all these fly by nighters that will sell you crap.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  So I was thinking we ought to be proud of the fact that we're telling people to get ready.
[41:01.000 --> 41:14.000]  And then hopefully it's not as bad as they're saying it's not as bad as it looks like and everything gets turned around. But yeah that's that's an important call because we've got callers calling in saying that a lot of places have their bulk foods that have been bought up.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  You've got confirmed cases now all over the world.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  This thing is going to be in every country in the world and now shutting off flights to China is too late.
[41:23.000 --> 41:33.000]  And I got to tell you Dr. Steve Pachennick is a smart guy and he sucked into a lot of folks. He said Trump needs to appoint a surgeon general now.
[41:33.000 --> 41:41.000]  He needs to make a big deal about it and not come out and panic folks but say we're ready we're prepared and we're going to deal with it.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  Ignoring it.
[41:44.000 --> 41:51.000]  When the news comes out that it's serious when this thing is already so out of control politically I mean the response is huge.
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  The panic is already there and it makes it worse that they're not saying everything's fine so big deal but oh by the way everything's locked down.
[41:58.000 --> 42:06.000]  When we know the Corona virus is here we need to hear from the U.S. government we need to hear from from from from diverse research groups and backgrounds about this.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  But instead we learn they're not sending out the genetic code of the virus to all these research labs all over the world.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  It's being held back so that people can't identify it.
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.000]  Well that's not good. Who's making that decision. The CDC the World Health Organization. Trump needs to get on this now.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  Because if the world economy goes down because of this it's not his fault he won't be blamed.
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.000]  But if he has a sluggish response when everybody else is having a huge response against this then that could really be used against the president.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  I know they've got him transfixed with the stupid trial.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  I'm just brainstorming here on air. What do you think 877789 Alex 877789 2539.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  And I'll just open the phones up then but I'm not going to have time to talk to most people long.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  I'm just going to move quick through your calls because I need to hear from the people I want to hear from you.
[42:54.000 --> 43:20.000]  I need to hear from you back. I want to hear from you.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  Yes now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader real.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  We have never been in some small village place that didn't matter.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  Everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  So it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.

[45:25.000 --> 45:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[45:31.000 --> 45:39.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago.
[45:39.000 --> 45:49.000]  It started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2. 40% off right now at m4store.com.

[45:56.000 --> 46:25.000]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  InfoWars private labels from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  And that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[46:50.000 --> 46:58.000]  But if you get your order in now at m4store.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to ten days.
[47:20.000 --> 47:30.000]  All our times have come.
[47:30.000 --> 47:36.000]  Fear but now they're gone.
[47:36.000 --> 47:49.000]  Seasons don't fear the river, not due to the winds.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.000]  Therapists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call Donald Trump anxiety disorder.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  Trump anxiety disorder.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  Trump derangement syndrome.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real.
[48:06.000 --> 48:13.000]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable.
[48:13.000 --> 48:21.000]  One minute, they're perfectly normal. The next, rapid.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly. Families and culture are collapsing.
[48:27.000 --> 48:35.000]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  You can't trust your mother.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  Get the hell out of here!
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  Get the fuck out of here!
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Your best friend.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Get that camera out of here!
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  The Maverick next door.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients, it started the morning after the election.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call post-Trumpmatic stress disorder.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  Pray, it doesn't happen to you.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  Let's all get dead!
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Revit.
[49:19.000 --> 49:47.000]  White males.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  This is reality. This isn't fantasy.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  We are seeing a cultural, spiritual degeneration.
[49:56.000 --> 50:03.000]  And every time it happens, civilization collapses back into the jungle.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  Back into the sand dunes or sinks into the swamp.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  We're live broadcasting worldwide. I see a lot of incredible sounding calls and humans here calling in.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  We've got Rhett in Florida, military police near Air Force Base, store shelves going empty.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  We're going to talk to him first.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  Then David in Tennessee travels to China for business frequency virus topic.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Anthony is going to be right after Rhett.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  And this is huge.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Wife is from China.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  He has flu symptoms. CDC is refusing tests.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  Mike Adams owns one of the only big top labs that's in Texas.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  He's got all the connections to this intel.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  That's what he's saying days ago.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  That's really scary right there, folks.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  John's a healthcare provider in Ohio, a possible local case of coronavirus.
[50:53.000 --> 51:04.000]  And like I told you, the last time I knew this many people sick from pneumonia and dying from it was when my uncle, my dad's uncle, and my cousin all lived on the same ranch, family ranch in East Texas.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  They all died in the same month.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  We were at three funerals.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  My cousin died, my uncle died, my great-uncle died.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  They all died about a week and a half out from each other.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  I was living basically in East Texas at that point.
[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  And there was nothing in the news about it, but everybody was like, gosh, everybody's dying of this pneumonia.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  And the doctors told me, no, the CDC is covering up what it is.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  So you can bet when they're hyping something like it's in the world, it's not.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  When they're telling you everything's okay, but the flights are all canceled, and this stuff's going on, you know there's a problem.
[51:35.000 --> 51:43.000]  And this stuff acts a lot faster than normal pneumonia.
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[51:48.000 --> 52:02.000]  A lot of you that are watching us on television right now are going to ask, what are these big black plastic tote containers, you know, a tote container like that probably cost you $10 at Walmart, just a container.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  Well, that's my Patriot supply.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  That is a sponsor for over 10 years.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  They've been around 12 years.
[52:09.000 --> 52:20.000]  They become the leading, you know, the top two or three verbal food company out there because they deliver on time because they have high quality food that's very, very affordable.
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and go through this big red folder I've got right here because I want to go to your phone calls.
[52:25.000 --> 52:32.000]  But I've got the side-by-side comparison of their food and the quality versus all the other competitors.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  They are the most inexpensive food of any of the major groups out there.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  It's high quality and they deliver it when they say.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  I'm going to tell you again, they're like me.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  They're neurotic about being honest.
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.000]  I had their CEO on interviewing last night, haven't heard it yet.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  I talked to the owner and they just said, we can't help it, but just go ahead.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  I guess tell people.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  They've got two and a half weeks of food in right now at current sales rates, but it's exponential.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  They've got 18 wheelers and food coming in from all over the U.S.
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  But they don't count that until it's in their warehouses and certified and everything.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  So they've got two and a half weeks of food.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  That's at current sales rates.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  It could be gone in two days at this level.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  You get your order in, you get it.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  There's a window that's closing.
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  Do you imagine if the store shelves are already getting cleaned out in a lot of areas, especially around military bases as they know what's going on,
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  that what's it going to be like in three, four, five months when this virus peaks here?
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  And we hope that's not the case.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  So yes, I'm always selling horrible food.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  I'm saying you need it because the election and what's going on in the world and how we don't live on farms anymore.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  And I know how to skin a buck and run a trot line.
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  But let me tell you, if I lived out in the woods, there wouldn't be many deer left pretty soon.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  That's about all I know how to do, shoot and kill deer.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  Okay.
[53:46.000 --> 53:53.000]  I know how to gut them and do all the rest of it and how to keep it, but I'm not like a mountain man or a hillbilly like my ancestors were.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  I mean, my dad knows how to do everything still.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  Electricity, plumbing, whole nine yards.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  You grew up on a farm.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  I don't know hardly any of that.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  And I'm like a astronaut compared to my children.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  I'm like a master engineer.
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  I've been a bad dad in many ways, but it's the way the world works now.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  I'm here on air.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  I don't can't teach them all that stuff.
[54:12.000 --> 54:21.000]  We've skinned some bucks, we've run some trot lines, but they didn't teach me how to climb through the attic and run electricity and ACDC and all that like my dad did.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  So everybody needs toiletable foods.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  This is the best you're going to get.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  You can find stuff that costs four or five times more that tastes gourmet.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  This just tastes good and it's got good nutrients and it lasts a long time.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Let me show you one more thing and I'm going to your calls.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  These suckers are heavy.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  I mean, I'm like, I'm doing a workout right here.
[54:40.000 --> 54:47.000]  Picking up one of these is you might want to have your husband do it.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  This is jam packed.
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  These guys aren't playing games and you open it up like this.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  This is food for my food was getting delivered extra stuff.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  You got to get it open.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  I do this on air.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  I can't open.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  It's like the paper car.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  You get near and it's just full of all this delicious food.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  It's absolutely nutritious and isn't got additives and crap in it.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  It's just jam packed folks.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  It's so heavy.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  You don't go to the grocery store and find containers like this.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  It's all like little skimpy things ripping you off.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  And this is way cheaper than the grocery store in better quality.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  They've even had vice shows and they go, let's look at what Jones sells.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  They go, gosh, this is actually good food.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  Wow.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Wow, this is good coffee.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Yeah, what do you think we're doing here?
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  This is what I use.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  This is what I do.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  Even, even if I was an evil person, I want to sell good stuff so you like me.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  But you left us cannot figure that out.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  You think treating somebody like you want to be treated as weak.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  You think it's dumb to have empathy.
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.000]  Just like you aren't in position to sell storeable food with the biggest company in the United States
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  and be the biggest distributor for them because you don't have foresight left us.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  You're idiots.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  Sorry, I'm not left us right now.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  I'm the idiots advice and all of them.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  You're morons.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  And if stuff ever hits the fan, you don't know how to tie your shoelaces or wipe your ass or kick ass.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  I could take on 50 of you leftist crap heads.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  Anyways.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  And it's not because I'm tough.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's because you're a joke.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  I'm going off and left this round.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  I apologize.
[56:15.000 --> 56:26.000]  I just change.org has a actual petition to change the name of the virus from the Wuhan virus to the Kung flu virus.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  We put that on screen.
[56:27.000 --> 56:34.000]  You realize, and of course the left's making big jokes about it, the left's online laughing about everything because they've never lived in a crisis.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  They're all glow-in-the-dark little chicken necks that think it's all funny.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  Well, my and my family tend to be prepared.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  So I'm done.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  I promise I'm going right to your calls.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  Rhett and Anthony, please don't hung up.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I don't know which call is more important.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  What about the store shelves, the military base or the things they have, the flus and the CDC won't test it.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  We're going to hit your calls.
[56:56.000 --> 57:02.000]  When we come back in two minutes, I promise, and I'm going to shut up, but just have your points and I'll move the next person.
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.000]  The point is, is that my patriot is not going to raise prices now.

[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  It goes right into the feed.

[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  They sell for even more distributors, but I've locked it in.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  Had to raise it a little bit because they've got to be able to buy food forward.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  But this is the best deal you're going to find at infowarstore.com.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  And yes, the money that comes in funds this operation to keep us in place.
[57:28.000 --> 57:36.000]  And I've got a little warehouse across the street from me with food for my own office, firearms and everything because I believe in being prepared.

[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  All we can see for miles and miles and miles, I'm Alex Jones, live coverage of whatever the hell's going on in China and the huge cover-up going on,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  but the massive clampdown we see. So, Rhett is in Florida Military Police near Air Force Base, says the store shelves going empty.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Rhett, thanks for calling. Thanks for holding. Tell us what you're witnessing.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Hey, former military police with the Army, what we're noticing is, on Monday night, we went to actually just go stock up on water, because we're supposed to be stocked if anywhere in Florida.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  And when we went into Sam's Club, we actually noticed that the waters, all the pallets, Don Sonny, Members Mark, all the different brands, the only thing that was left was the equivalent of one pallet.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  When we went in also, when we were standing there, there was two military guys standing there, loading up an entire cart.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  I'm talking up to the top with water, and then they were quietly saying, I think it's enough right now. Let's go ahead and get this out of here.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  When we walked through the store, dog food was gone, strikeaway matches were gone, surgical masks were gone.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  We went into the surrounding Walmart, here in Fort Walton Beach, which is next to Eglin Air Force Base, and also Herbert Field, where the Special Forces Operations Command is.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Also, we have a lot of defense contractors here, everyone that you can imagine, and the T-light candles, the matches, surgical masks, and also even the canned goods are running low.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And not just that one Walmart or Fort Walton Beach, but also in Navarre, which is surrounding these military bases.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  It's not just us that's noticing it. It's also other business owners that we know, people that own flower shops that were actually going to Sam's Club today and yesterday,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  who actually said that aate of water is missing, and they noticed it too. It looks like Hurricane Michael, but it's not as loud.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  So it's not like you're seeing big red flashing lights. They were here to take everything. It's like they're just quietly, things are just quietly disappearing, and they have disappeared.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  So when you get on the Sam's Club app, you can actually look and see, when you get on a Walmart app and you look at strikeaway matches, for instance, in this area, they're even out on the actual Walmart and Sam's Club apps.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  So that's something that we noticed. It's not paranoia. It's just looking at it and putting.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Well, you just said that perfectly. I'm just noticing this the last few days, because I call the food distributors, they go, yeah, we're surprised you didn't call.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Everybody's selling out institutional government buyers. And I had the CEO on yesterday. I haven't aired it yet. I taped it last night at like, you know, eight at night, night at night.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And in fact, I should just go ahead and probably start airing some of the interview later. I was playing a player in the war room, and he talks about the U.S. government agency, the main procurement agency,
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  above FEMA, just said, we want everything you've got. And they learned that the government's buying up what everybody else has. Everybody else is just selling.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  It's not that we're against the government, but we believe the people, and that's why with my patriot, should be able to get the food.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And so that's really happening. And now you're calling in with this, because you're near those military bases, they know something the public doesn't know.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And I think it's clear. I think this is going to end up being pretty serious, probably.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  There is something else that's kind of just something to look at. We have Kratos, Lockheed, Martin, Bowling. We have Mag Aerospace.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  There's a lot of defense contractors and people who basically are what we would consider spooks, you know, spook contractors.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  What we noticed is, is not only has special forces, people that we know that weren't supposed to deploy until the end of the year, they're gone.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  They just often left over the last few days. I mean, just they're like, hey, we had to leave out.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Then on top of that, when we actually go down in some of these areas and you see the parking lots where these defense contractors used to have a ton of cars in there and normally they're packed.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Like today, they're fined. Parking lots are about a quarter to a half full right now.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  And part of that's the buildup in the Middle East with Iran, the 20,000, but that's not going to cause that where you're at.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Exactly. This is bigger. And that's actually the information I have that I haven't released yet. And I just, I keep trying to decide whether or not I should release this information.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  But God bless you, sir. Thank you for the information, Rhett.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  All right, we come back. Anthony in Detroit. White was from China. He has hallucinative CDs. He's refusing to test.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  That's exactly what Mike Adams was confirming a few days ago. Back in 60 seconds, please stay with us.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins. There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.

[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  200 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Tokyo Wednesday morning.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Meantime, the United Arab Emirates just confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the Middle East.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  The disease has now been detected in at least 16 countries. In China, where the outbreak began, the death toll now stands at 132.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  With nearly 6,000 confirmed cases. KPI X5's Betty Yu is at SFO, where one major airline is taking drastic action tonight.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Already, United Airlines has suspended 24 flights between the U.S. including here at SFO and Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong between February 1st and 8th due to what they say is a significant decline in demand.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Meanwhile, CBS News is reporting that the White House is considering suspending all flights between the U.S. and China.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Tonight in the international terminal at SFO, it wasn't hard to find travelers returning or leaving for flights wearing face masks.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Everybody's kind of nervous. Yeah, and people are buying masks. Where did you just come from? From Taiwan.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  Federal health officials here in the U.S. are expanding screening for the virus to 18 major airports and two land border crossings.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  What we ask is that anyone who has traveled to China within the last 14 days to watch carefully for symptoms.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  And if you've traveled and you develop fever and respiratory symptoms like cough or shortness of breath, we ask you to call your provider.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  While there are no reported cases of the new coronavirus in the Bay Area, Santa Clara County's Public Health Department has formed two quick response teams just in case.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Abby Alfonso is leaving for the Philippines tonight for a month.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  I think it's just important that everyone, you know, takes extra precautions, especially around crowded places like airports.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  It's never too bad to be safe.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Even though we've seen...
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  So they start out by saying, oh, there's just lack of demand. That's why they're not going to China.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  While British Airways and all the rest of them basically are saying they're ending all flights to China as virus spreads to Middle East, Europe, and onward.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  No cases in Russia yet. Japan's got cases. It's all over the U.S. is getting more and more cases.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  We're on to your calls right now.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  I just want to point out that this is either some big worldwide health U.N. drill.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And they've decided to hype a real virus but make it a huge deal for a drill for a mega outbreak down the road.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And they've decided now to create fear to push vaccines, which we know they brag and say they're going to do with pandemics.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  And they've had an over-response while saying it's not a big deal to test the public.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Or this thing is a lot worse than they're saying.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  And I've experienced these new designer pneumonia's because I hardly ever get sick.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  I haven't had a fever in over four years.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Six years ago when my uncle and my dad's uncle and my cousin all died because they all lived in the same three ranch houses on top of Hill or family ranch.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  I just ignored it and was coughing and wheezing for several months.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And I finally guzzled a super dose like three bottles of total silver, which I'm sure was not good for my liver or kidneys.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  A lot of it's not good for you folks, but desperate times, different measures, and it finally went away.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  My dad was really sick.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  And I went and poured aggressively bottles down him.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And my mom's like, that's dangerous at that level.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  What are you doing? It doesn't say that on the bottle.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And I just said, these are really nice.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  But mom, I said, mom, shut up.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  I said, he's been taking antibiotics.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Everything is not helping him.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And I poured three bottles down him as well over three days.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  He pissed green, but he lived.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  So all I'm telling you is, is that people need to be prepared and they need to be ready.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And something big is going on.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And I think everybody can feel it.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Everybody knows it.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And it's about crashing the economy.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  We know that.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  And that's a whole other subject I'll get to later.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  We're going to go to your calls.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  There's so many amazing calls here.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  We look what people are talking about here.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Jen, friends in quarantine in China has intel and virus.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Jim, we're going to go to you.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Victor, general caller on hospitals.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I can prepare this.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Health care provider, hospital, local case of a possible case of coronavirus.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Alex, delivery worker to all major stores, shortages.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  That's a key call.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  These are all key.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Anthony, Detroit, wife is from China has flu symptoms going to him first.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  David, Tennessee, travels to China has intel.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  AJ, I'm not going to go through it all.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Grace, we're going to all of you.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Thank you for calling.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  This is amazing.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Anthony in Detroit.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Thanks for holding.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Please tell us what's happened.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Good Lord, Alex.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Absolutely.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  So I recently went to China for the American New Years.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  So that was January, December 28.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  We came back on the 1st or the 2nd.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  My wife then traveled back to Beijing and then came back here.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  So this stuff's been going around since October from what I know.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  And basically I came down with flu symptoms.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  First, my throat started scratching, I woke up one morning, I could barely breathe.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  So I go ahead and set a schedule with my doctor who refuses to say,
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  we can't even test for it here at the doctor's office.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  They said they couldn't take a sputum sample, which just sounded ridiculous to me.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  But either way.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  So then I went to another emergency clinic after that.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And then they did the test there and sent it off to the CDC.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  I just got word back that they will not move on with any tests.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  If you have not been to those regions,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  therefore, if anybody travels from China and then passes the virus to somebody else,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  they will not test that person.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  And so basically it's just going to let it go rampant.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  I even have the call on record and talking with the fellow from the CDC.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And I mean, it's just wild.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And he even agreed with me.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  He's like, they're just going to let it go crazy.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  I mean, he was suggesting that that's what would happen if we go about it
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  and the route that they're going about it.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  So I just wanted to call in and let you guys know what's going on.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I figured it would be a good thing to know.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Well, I'm not an engineer and I don't own a major testing lab.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  But when Mike said that, I looked it up and they even saw an article about it.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Mike Adams, who's hosting the fourth hour.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  They're not sending out the code because they can, you know,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  test viruses down very quickly with computers.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  They're not sending its breakdown so people can't test for it.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  Why the hell would the CDC be doing that?
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Because they don't want people to know the virus is all over the place.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Like Pachinik said.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And by the way, he didn't just make that up.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Like, where's Pachinik?
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  He's almost dead.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  He can't come on.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Sorry.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  He finally got on.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  I was like, damn, he looks 10 years older.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Heads all shaved last night.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  And he almost died from what he believes is the same virus out of China.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Because he was meeting with the Chinese on that.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  So, and I know there's a lot of stuff in Asia, believe me.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  He sent me photos when he was in North Korea.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  People said, that sounds like hype.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  No, no, it's already been here for a while.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And I think it's already building exponentially.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  And I think that's why there's, what do you gut level things going on here?
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  I mean, you got really sick from it.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  You think it's real?
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I mean, I think it's real what they're doing.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I think that they're just going to try to let it go rampant.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  I mean, instead of trying to take care of the situation, which blows my mind.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And then they'll blame Trump.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  I'm sure they will.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Because you know they're telling them everything's fine.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  But suddenly you hear, he wants to cancel all flights.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Remember how they bitch when he canceled flights from six countries that don't even have passport programs?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  They literally are just run by jihadis.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  They have dirt airways.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  So the people take off from that country on a dirt runway, fly into another,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  and then get on with a passport issued by their Imam that he wipes his ass with.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Sorry, it's true.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And then they're here.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And Trump said, no, you're not flying from caveman world here.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And the judges tried to block him.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Remember that?
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I wonder if judges would block Trump now if he banned all flights from China,
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  which I think is imminent if the president's doing his job.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  Well, it's just wild what they're doing up in.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It's just wild what they're doing with the government right now.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  It just blows my mind.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  You know, it's like a soap opera or something.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  It is.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  The government is in a state of civil war.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  It's the government in a civil war with globalist versus Americana.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  God bless you.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  All right.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  We only went to one color that segment because I had to play that clip.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  I promise we're taking at least three colors when we come back.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  And these colors are amazing.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  And I'm going to call them back to you.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  We have a doctor.

[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:47.160]  People ask how I predicted 9-11. They were pre-programming it right before it happened
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:52.560]  I mean, it's like when a new Chevy car new Camaro's coming out. You see the promos. I mean

[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:37.160]  We have never been in Kansas. We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter everything

[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:55.600]  And the grid the global is built to control us
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:02.520]  Zimmy nothing more than a projection system to empower humanity in the end
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:31.480]  We're going to go back to your phone calls because they're gonna throw curveballs at us and they're testing our response to this
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:35.480]  It's obviously synthetic. It's obviously a bio weapon
[1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:40.520]  What curveballs are going to throw this is an attack on the world economy that that's the prime
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:46.600]  Result we get out of this is is that of my people we're taking your calls right now
[1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:49.160]  Jin in Utah gave us the number
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.440]  For a friend quarantine in china and all circuits are busy
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:00.680]  And china reportedly is basically incrementally cutting the internet off because they don't want video
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:07.320]  And streams of what's happening getting out and suddenly Facebook is blocking Alex Jones and Jordan Peterson's
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:11.760]  Names text messages, and it's going to expand from there
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:17.800]  The AI is in place and there's videos of the panicked buying at the grocery stores as
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:21.800]  The society breaks down. Let's let's fade up some of the audio of this
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  Because the Chinese
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:28.440]  Uh are pretty famous
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:36.440]  Not as much as japanese but at not misbehaving during prices
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.420]  So now you've got women fighting over vegetables in china
[1:22:43.420 --> 1:22:57.180]  Those are pretty orderly people you can look down on them for that, but they're hard-working and tough
[1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:02.780]  That's why it's sad the global's having this robot slaves as they're dangerous as hell under their global's control
[1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:07.500]  They're building a freaking high-tech army against us robot army. You name it
[1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:10.460]  Those people are good
[1:23:10.460 --> 1:23:15.820]  If you take the average spoiled rotten american, there's a lot of bad-ass americans a lot of incredible americans black white
[1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:19.100]  Hispanic old young you name it. I mean we've got it, but let me tell you
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:25.500]  I didn't know you could stack crap so high when I go to universities and places. I mean, I mean they look like servile
[1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:28.060]  soul-sucked creatures
[1:23:29.340 --> 1:23:32.460]  All right, I said I'd take your calls and I'm ranting I'm ranting right now. I'm sorry
[1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:34.300]  um
[1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.060]  Jen in utah
[1:23:36.060 --> 1:23:38.700]  Tell us what's happening. I wasn't just attacking americans
[1:23:38.700 --> 1:23:42.620]  I'm just saying if we have a big real crisis here you think the chinese are misbehaving
[1:23:44.780 --> 1:23:47.260]  One week of the ebt card stuff not getting delivered
[1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:53.740]  Are there to be no food with those ebt cards and the liquor and the cigarettes aren't there every city will burn
[1:23:55.020 --> 1:23:57.020]  Because the left has pre-programmed
[1:23:57.420 --> 1:24:02.380]  People to do that and they're the blame and the fact that we've let them behave like this is dangerous
[1:24:03.180 --> 1:24:05.180]  So we've sowed the wind
[1:24:05.180 --> 1:24:11.100]  And we're going to reap the whirlwind. I mean, I think the ride is on the wall for 2020 all of our foreboding all the dread
[1:24:12.220 --> 1:24:14.220]  I think you're going to start seeing why that's the case
[1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:16.220]  I'm sorry us
[1:24:16.220 --> 1:24:21.180]  Uh, jen and utah your friends in quarantine in china. We were trying to call her. Thanks for giving us her number
[1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:23.660]  It's all circuits are busy
[1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:29.660]  Yeah, alex are you there? I am thanks for calling from utah. Tell us what you know
[1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:31.580]  um
[1:24:31.580 --> 1:24:37.340]  I have a friend Travis who uh, he's been living over in that region for several years. Um
[1:24:39.580 --> 1:24:41.420]  He uh
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:47.820]  Traveled from thailand and flew into wuhan china the next day the travel ban was put into place
[1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:51.500]  He immediately um from his uh
[1:24:52.460 --> 1:24:54.460]  Messaging text to me
[1:24:54.460 --> 1:25:01.340]  He immediately went to the embassy. They told him that they had no plans or ideas to evacuate anybody
[1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:03.980]  including themselves
[1:25:04.780 --> 1:25:09.580]  And then his next message read I can't get through to the beijing and
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:14.700]  Embassy wuhan's embassy is acting stupid like they don't know
[1:25:15.580 --> 1:25:17.580]  And then the next thing he says is
[1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:21.340]  I'm okay so far the embassy tells me nothing
[1:25:21.340 --> 1:25:26.300]  The next one is the embassy workers left. They left us here
[1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:30.460]  Pathetic, I thought they were supposed to be the last ones to go
[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:38.380]  Um, let's see people aren't honorable and our government at least at that level is just filled with scum
[1:25:38.860 --> 1:25:41.980]  Well, that's terrible. So the embassy's evacuated leaving us citizens
[1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:50.540]  Absolutely, and then uh, he just wrote me like while I was on hold with you and you guys were trying to get a hold of him
[1:25:50.540 --> 1:25:55.980]  He said my hotel friend Tony just notified me his boss died of it tonight
[1:25:56.700 --> 1:26:02.140]  One of the other bosses reopened the hotel that has been closed because of the virus
[1:26:02.300 --> 1:26:05.820]  They are to house and beat 300 doctors and nurses there
[1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:08.860]  um
[1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:12.700]  Wow because there's some people online saying people dropping
[1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:19.340]  Down and bashing their brains out is fake. You can watch those videos. It's not it's it's not no actor can just drop
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.980]  And then hit their head on the pavement. No, that's real anybody's seen that happen knows when it's real
[1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:27.340]  And and the fact that he's saying he's there in the hotel says
[1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:29.900]  People are that work. They're dead
[1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:34.860]  That is that is that I mean, that's amazing real human communication. Uh, hopefully
[1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:39.660]  We can text you the hotline number and maybe he can get through on a circuit
[1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:43.180]  Um, and in fact, we'll put you on hold them and give you that number
[1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:47.180]  And hopefully he can get through to us, but we we we're all circuits are busy right now
[1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:55.500]  Right and it's really weird because he just cut off my uh, my message early that we've been communicating
[1:26:56.300 --> 1:27:00.060]  On I mean daily um several times a day
[1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:04.620]  um, the one thing he did say and I would like to say is that he says
[1:27:05.340 --> 1:27:11.420]  I like trump to death, but when he said china has it under control last week and praised president z
[1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:14.300]  and said
[1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:17.500]  What a great relationship they had I was pissed
[1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:22.060]  And I well, I understand but if you know what trump says, this is a crisis
[1:27:22.700 --> 1:27:25.980]  The stock market will tank and then they'll be able to remove him
[1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:29.980]  So I get where trump's at but I think he's I think he's behind the curve
[1:27:30.220 --> 1:27:33.660]  He needs to get out ahead of this needs to be nuanced because this is serious
[1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:42.060]  Right. I am but they've piled so much other BS on him, but this needs to come forefront. These are american citizens
[1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:45.660]  Who are stuck in countries who are going to die?
[1:27:45.820 --> 1:27:52.300]  I mean he wrote a good buy letter to his three young daughters because he doesn't think he's gonna get out
[1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:57.420]  He was listen. I'll hold you over and go the calls, but what is he saying? It's like he's saying the hotel manager
[1:27:57.820 --> 1:27:59.820]  Who died? Who died?
[1:28:00.300 --> 1:28:01.260]  um
[1:28:01.260 --> 1:28:03.260]  One of the owners at the hotel
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:07.580]  A hotel died last night from the virus
[1:28:07.580 --> 1:28:11.180]  Uh, they they opened the hotel
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:13.340]  to house
[1:28:13.340 --> 1:28:18.860]  And feed 300 doctors and nurses there after his death that was his wish
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:21.420]  I mean, I guess the government has made them
[1:28:22.060 --> 1:28:25.100]  closed down the hotels under the quarantine
[1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:27.740]  but um this hotel owner that
[1:28:28.460 --> 1:28:30.460]  Yeah, don't don't don't hang up because
[1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:33.580]  We've got to get your friend on the line stay there
[1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:39.900]  Folks, I'ma tell you this is not looking good. Okay. We're just a show and this lady's calling in and then her friend
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:42.380]  They're at the hotel. It's all quarantine people are dying. I mean
[1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:51.980]  Yeah, this response is massive. We hope this isn't a big deal. Okay, but you can feel it. It doesn't feel good does it?
[1:28:55.820 --> 1:29:00.620]  Hi, I'm dan Pilla. I started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house

[1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.140]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral
[1:30:26.620 --> 1:30:30.700]  Calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth
[1:30:31.340 --> 1:30:33.340]  Then it has the patented silver
[1:30:33.420 --> 1:30:38.620]  Sol silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes genzavirus. This is all proven you can make claims with this
[1:30:39.180 --> 1:30:42.220]  But I had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good

[1:30:54.300 --> 1:30:59.660]  That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[1:31:00.140 --> 1:31:06.940]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:31:07.260 --> 1:31:11.660]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[1:31:11.660 --> 1:31:13.660]  And respiratory function
[1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:19.020]  In the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:26.860]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[1:31:27.100 --> 1:31:33.820]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:38.140]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[1:31:38.140 --> 1:31:43.340]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:48.060]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[1:31:48.540 --> 1:31:50.700]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[1:31:51.180 --> 1:31:55.980]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[1:31:56.540 --> 1:32:03.660]  This time of year i'm always promoting winter sun our high quality organic vitamin d3

[1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:14.780]  It's in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin d it needs
[1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:22.700]  And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there
[1:32:22.780 --> 1:32:28.140]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live not just to defend against these viruses
[1:32:28.140 --> 1:32:35.020]  So right now we have winter sun still available even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall winter and spring

[1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:35.580]  Nationalists and patriots and pro-humans pro-free market anti-communist being elected all over the world
[1:33:36.140 --> 1:33:38.140]  available in the gates and the un say
[1:33:38.700 --> 1:33:40.300]  the specter
[1:33:40.300 --> 1:33:44.460]  Of global pandemic will train us to worship world government
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:47.980]  I have not even gotten into the news
[1:33:47.980 --> 1:33:51.260]  Of what's happening during the trial of the president
[1:33:52.380 --> 1:33:54.380]  But it's so fitting
[1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:57.660]  That the dinosaurs in the federal government
[1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:01.100]  Are transfixed
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.660]  With the idiocy
[1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:07.660]  Of the president conducting foreign policy when it's all based on quid pro pro
[1:34:08.380 --> 1:34:14.780]  And they're trying to paralyze him where he can't even engage in any communications and schumer came out yesterday
[1:34:14.780 --> 1:34:21.820]  I I saw it live made a big deal about it on there senator paul's never blown up like this. He goes. He's probably a communist chinese agent
[1:34:22.700 --> 1:34:24.700]  We know hunter biden
[1:34:25.260 --> 1:34:27.900]  We know barisma. We know joe biden
[1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:33.180]  Did it in front of everyone and bragged about it hiking their leg like a dog pissing on you
[1:34:33.980 --> 1:34:35.980]  And there's not a word out of these criminals
[1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:43.980]  And of course it turns out that
[1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:48.540]  The star witness against the president they're trying to roll forward
[1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:51.100]  Is on the fetid tit
[1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:56.060]  Of the ukrainian cash machine as well that state department gives the ukrainians
[1:34:56.300 --> 1:35:03.100]  And then the ukrainians give back to john bolton back to hillary. It's how it works foreign aid is about here's a bunch of us money
[1:35:03.260 --> 1:35:05.260]  Give it back to us
[1:35:05.260 --> 1:35:10.300]  That's what the imf and world bank are and trumps like we're not doing business this way. We're going directly in straight shooting
[1:35:11.020 --> 1:35:13.020]  corporate business
[1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:17.180]  And the globalists are like no you're not doing that and he's like yeah, we're doing it
[1:35:18.620 --> 1:35:20.620]  We're doing it
[1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:25.180]  There's nothing more americana. Let's say we're gonna have straight up laze fair capitalism
[1:35:26.060 --> 1:35:31.180]  You know, they always demonize laze fair capitalism for things they do that isn't laze fair
[1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:36.140]  But i'll tell you the type of laze fair i don't like
[1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:43.020]  Trump shut down first seven than six countries
[1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:48.060]  Because they didn't have passport systems and i agree with that
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:55.260]  You don't have runways and planes and we're gonna accept your passports from your imam and you literally are a famous terrorist. No
[1:35:55.260 --> 1:36:02.700]  And federal courts tried to block them took a year for trump to win at the supreme court now those judges are resigning good
[1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:05.420]  Don't the door hit you on the ass
[1:36:06.380 --> 1:36:08.380]  But then we've got coronavirus
[1:36:09.500 --> 1:36:13.020]  That you know lands it studies killing 18 percent of people that get it
[1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:20.300]  My dad dies from that i'll be upset my mom dies i'll be upset i love them they're old
[1:36:20.300 --> 1:36:24.780]  My wife dies i'll be pissed one of my kids dies i'm gonna hold people in government responsible
[1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:27.660]  That's the fault on me and my family
[1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:36.220]  So the president better stop watching the stupid trial. It's obviously the left-hand one look over here the magician
[1:36:36.380 --> 1:36:40.460]  Look at my beautiful assistant while they are stabbing us with the right hand
[1:36:41.340 --> 1:36:42.780]  trump
[1:36:42.780 --> 1:36:48.220]  Better seal those borders now regardless of what's going on here because like nightfall is day
[1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:54.620]  They are going to blame this on the president and you know what he waits more than 48 hours. He deserves it
[1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:57.740]  Because i'm not some donald trump cult
[1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:00.780]  i'm in jesus christ cult
[1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:03.580]  and i love america
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:06.060]  And i'm gonna leave it at that go back to your calls

[1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:52.140]  And
[1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:56.140]  When I learned from callers and my sources and I knew this last week and I was like, okay
[1:38:56.140 --> 1:39:01.100]  I'm not gonna go with that because you know, you just you live around these crises so much you get where you don't take them
[1:39:01.100 --> 1:39:02.540]  Serious anymore
[1:39:02.540 --> 1:39:04.540]  Like I told you last week. I'm sitting there going
[1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:09.740]  Okay, I'm ordered horrible food for my house in the office wait
[1:39:10.380 --> 1:39:12.380]  Maybe I should be promoting this the audience
[1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:17.420]  And then they're like, yeah, we're selling out. What the hell we haven't heard from you, but we figured you'd call us
[1:39:17.420 --> 1:39:19.420]  Yeah, it's everybody else has sold out. It's insane
[1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:25.100]  And then you hear people yeah, I'm at the military base. They're grabbing all the food. The public doesn't know what's going on
[1:39:26.620 --> 1:39:27.900]  The
[1:39:27.900 --> 1:39:31.980]  Something big is happening right now. I don't think you need me to tell you that
[1:39:33.340 --> 1:39:36.700]  And we can talk about all day exactly what's going on. I don't think any of us know
[1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:40.700]  But this is a an attack on the economy of the world
[1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:44.300]  And they want us to be hit flat-footed
[1:39:45.580 --> 1:39:47.580]  And I don't intend for that to happen
[1:39:47.580 --> 1:39:49.580]  I don't intend for that to happen
[1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:54.140]  John's a health care provider possible local case of coronavirus

[1:40:08.300 --> 1:40:15.100]  Yes, sir. The reason why I'm calling is that I do deliveries down and uh from Key Largo all the way down to Key West
[1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:20.300]  I've never seen so many Chinese people out here. I don't know if they have a travel season
[1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:22.940]  I don't know what's going on. No, they've evacuated brother
[1:40:24.380 --> 1:40:28.540]  Man, I'll tell you what people are freaking out out here everybody every time I go to a store
[1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:31.260]  I see them in the store. I'll hold my breath for like two minutes
[1:40:31.580 --> 1:40:35.900]  I'm scared and all the people that are in the store are just like they don't like dear
[1:40:36.460 --> 1:40:39.900]  Oh, I never go to Starbucks because they're anti-gun and anti-cop
[1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:43.260]  But I went one because they got good coffee and I was tired the other day
[1:40:43.260 --> 1:40:49.180]  And there was like five Chinese dudes looking all paranoid and one with a mask in there. I mean, yes, that's what you're seeing
[1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:52.140]  Yes, sir, and and all the Walgreens
[1:40:52.540 --> 1:40:58.620]  CVS down here are autumn. They're out of map. They don't have no basement. They're out completely
[1:41:00.860 --> 1:41:02.860]  So what do you think's going on?
[1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:08.940]  Man, I don't know man. It's just so scary. You know, I I see them and I'm I'm scared, you know
[1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:13.660]  So everybody out here scared down in the key. But you're a delivery driver. You're a person that lives on the road
[1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:18.220]  And you're saying nothing against Chinese folks, but I mean no, I agree. It's like I don't a lot of Chinese and Austin
[1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:20.380]  But my god, they're all over the place all of a sudden
[1:41:21.420 --> 1:41:26.780]  Well, they're not out here that often, you know, I'm always down here in the keys. It's so it's so rare to be a tiny person
[1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:30.620]  Down here in the key. It's it's rare. You know, it's you're not out here
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:35.740]  You know, it's just white and Hispanic. That's all you see down in the keys and key largo
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:40.780]  Marathon, that's all you see. So when you see a Chinese person, it freaks people out. Everybody's freaking out
[1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:44.700]  And you're saying they're buying up the mask
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:52.620]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. They're buying there's no mask and no store down and from Key West all the way down to Key Largo
[1:41:52.940 --> 1:41:55.260]  There is no face mask at all
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:58.140]  What are the store managers thing?
[1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:02.300]  Oh, man, they're freaking out. I was just talking to one earlier down the key Largo
[1:42:02.300 --> 1:42:08.380]  And he's just like, well, you know what I'm saying? Like there's so many of them here. That's what everybody keeps saying. There's so many
[1:42:08.380 --> 1:42:10.380]  There's so many. I told my wife. I said
[1:42:10.860 --> 1:42:15.340]  You need to keep the kids, you know, when they go to school and home and we don't need to be because
[1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:18.780]  I don't even mean to Chinese. I mean, I walk around the grocery store. I was like, what's up suddenly?
[1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:22.620]  I haven't lived in China. I haven't made a big deal about this yet. But yeah, you're seeing that
[1:42:23.980 --> 1:42:29.980]  Yeah, man, we're running people are running from the aisles. You see them and they just see them and they don't know what's going on
[1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:35.740]  The aisles you see them and they just see them in the aisle. They start walking real quick. I'm telling you, I'm holding my breath
[1:42:35.820 --> 1:42:41.340]  I hold my breath for two minutes. No, I did the same thing and the Chinese folks look at me like, yeah, they get it
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:47.500]  Oh my god, I don't know what's going on. This is huge. Thank you, Alex for your call. All right. We're coming right back

[1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:53.180]  This is

[1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:18.780]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of furble foods because of institutional and governmental buyers
[1:43:18.780 --> 1:43:24.220]  That's right the rich the powerful the elite big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates

[1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:40.220]  They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days
[1:43:40.220 --> 1:43:43.020]  But if people wait it may end up being longer

[1:46:37.580 --> 1:46:43.580]  You see when you expose our false flags and fake media
[1:46:43.580 --> 1:46:49.580]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with alex jones
[1:46:49.580 --> 1:46:53.580]  Blaming in for mass shootings. We committed
[1:46:53.580 --> 1:47:15.580]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:37.580]  Music
[1:47:37.580 --> 1:47:45.580]  I'm going right back to your phone calls as fast as I can here in just a moment, but I want to slow down for a second
[1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:57.580]  Yes, infowarstore.com has a direct line to my patriot goes right to them you get the order in and if you get it in in the next few days you're guaranteed within 7 to 10 days to be delivered
[1:47:57.580 --> 1:48:09.580]  They have the food you're in the queue you're getting all the other big suppliers are out they're famous for not having food and telling you they do and they don't my patriots famous for having it
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:19.580]  The best deals on it drop shipped every day they've got more food and big big purchases they've made on the way to their factories and 18 wheelers
[1:48:19.580 --> 1:48:29.580]  But in two weeks they'll be out of food with the current food they have so they're saying they have two weeks of food at current sales rates that could change any day because it's just exponentially growing
[1:48:29.580 --> 1:48:40.580]  They're refusing to sell the FEMA and the office of budgetary planning and the purchasing I mean the Pentagon tried to buy it all they're not against the military there's like no Americans should be able to buy this food
[1:48:40.580 --> 1:48:46.580]  The others are selling out of it but but let me show you this this is the type of stuff I get here I'm going to go to your calls
[1:48:46.580 --> 1:49:00.580]  We have a famous nano tech company out of Colorado that are listeners and that's how we have the super silver wound gel the strongest FDA approved
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:13.580]  You know how much that cost to get that wound gel that you put on your skin your body before the military uses this before you go into zones where your skin might get nicked up and you get fleshing bacteria you name it
[1:49:13.580 --> 1:49:22.580]  You can use it after do not ingest it it's super bad news inside the body but it's it's it's it's it's it's strong as you can sell over the counter
[1:49:22.580 --> 1:49:29.580]  Okay that is still discounted even though we're going to sell out of it but they can get to as quick out of Colorado
[1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:42.580]  But let me show you a document cam shot with all what's going on you should be getting sunlight you should be getting vitamin D3 you should be getting vitamin C you should be getting things like iodine
[1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:56.580]  This is this product that my dad who is a oral surgeon and dentist he's retired now he's lost his license he was so excited about this I said that I don't like something called gargle but turned out to be a really big seller
[1:49:56.580 --> 1:50:05.580]  This is colloidal silver but to be ingestible where you can drink it they wanted at 15 parts per million well it's just a giant bottle of it so you just drink more
[1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:25.580]  Nobody sells a giant 16 fluid ounce container of colloidal silver for $14.97 and listen right now I can sell this for $50 we're selling more of this in a day than we sold in a month before even though it's a good seller
[1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:41.580]  I'm still keeping it right there because it cost us about $78 a bottle it's for sale for $14 right now and what you do is you order these other bottles the immune gargle travel or the personal one
[1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:55.580]  You get them all together separate and you just reload this you spray on your hands spray it in your mouth and it's got a bunch of other great things that are good for your body this is a great product and we will sell out of this in probably a week or two at this rate
[1:50:55.580 --> 1:51:00.580]  I'm going to keep it at the sales rate at this
[1:51:00.580 --> 1:51:26.580]  But immune gargle is the name this has had for three years it's for your immunity and it's 15 parts per million colloidal silver you're not going to get look at that 100% reviews on this and this is from some of the top labs in the country we just call it colloidal silver but it's really nano silver
[1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:41.580]  So you're getting the very best there is out there but but but let me shut up and go to the calls let me just show you this though because they went ahead and call this last night they said look because this going on we want you to go ahead and release the secret information
[1:51:41.580 --> 1:52:01.580]  Now they were authorized this has been congressional Defense Department hearings to release this classified information this is classified about this product the Defense Department is using this special forces is using this this is private level by us but this is this is this is the top lab
[1:52:01.580 --> 1:52:26.580]  Look at this this is Texas A&M University System Health Science Center confidential and the Pentagon finding in 2013 no no 2003 11 1303 that the nano silver that they created because it's a nano tech company
[1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:35.580]  is effective against the SARS family of viruses which this particular virus you're currently seeing right now the coronavirus isn't that family
[1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:46.580]  So I'm showing you information that only Congress had and the owner of the company Andrew C. Vaughn
[1:52:46.580 --> 1:53:01.580]  Eckenbach was a big listener of the show she said go ahead and authorize the showing of this staff action officer so that's the Department of the Army
[1:53:01.580 --> 1:53:25.580]  and you've got the owner of the company several persons you've got Andrew C. Vaughn Eckenbach MD Commissioner of Food and Drugs Food and Administration to the owner of the company you all show you right here I got that mixed up the point is I mean this is the stuff I've got I mean you understand I don't just go get like some silver product and sell it to you I go and say who's the very best and we call them and like they're like F.U. whatever someone's calling oh the director loves you oh here let's talk to the Pentagon
[1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:41.580]  yes general and so that's what this is so this is the head at that time of the whole project for the Army trying to figure out how to treat wounds and stop viruses and stop infections Andrew C. Vaughn Eckenbach MD
[1:53:41.580 --> 1:54:04.580]  Commissioner of Food and Drug and Food Administration with a letter certifying through the defense operations at the University of A&M that they have certified that this takes out SARS the nano silver that's in this and the nano silver that's in this and I'm not bragging folks we it's just what we do
[1:54:04.580 --> 1:54:21.580]  I mean just like our information is explosive we don't play games that's all I'm telling you and so it's simple I fund our operation promote and freedom promoting products that I already use and already believe in
[1:54:21.580 --> 1:54:48.580]  we got under Steve Pachennick coming up and we got so much more to cover I've gotten really interested in this because I knew they were suppressing it now they accept that silver and nano silver and stuff in all the hospitals is their big savior now antibiotics aren't working I was 25 years ago they're like the FDA would arrest you if you promote this now it's like oh it's a savior because it is
[1:54:48.580 --> 1:55:04.580]  but I've lost family to this all I care about is keep us on the air to defend the second of everything else there's like this guilt I'm like I've got the best horrible food I'm guilty to say it I'm bad to tell you we have the best silver no we're not bad we're good we are homework we're badass we're badass thanks to you seriously
[1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:22.580]  I mean we're awake we're alive we're focused it's just true it's like Del Earnhardt he wasn't bragging when they called him the intimidator because he kept winning all the damn races it's just what it is but all glory goes to God we're in the position with the best horrible foods we're in the position with the best silver products
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:38.580]  because I don't like burying my family members and I'm sick of it and all I know is 2020 29 days in is insane I'm gonna stop running at this point I can't even keep track of it anymore
[1:55:38.580 --> 1:55:59.580]  I bitch it my dad I'm on his ass all the time even though he's old I need his help and it's the truth is he got us the best silver sponsor he got us all the contracts like the Pentagon's best silver I mean I am I mean we've got the best stuff folks because if I've got something really good I learned there's something better I go to that
[1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:09.580]  and to me that's not even hard to understand like if I was a restaurant I'd want to get the best ingredients have the best food because I want you to have a great time I want you to love me I want you to come back
[1:56:09.580 --> 1:56:21.580]  the left though the religion is about effing people over we're not doing that folks when we promote something it's a passion for us and it's a war and it's a total commitment
[1:56:21.580 --> 1:56:38.580]  and I feel like a disrespectful jerk you've heard the incredible callers we've had I've got like 20 of them right here Dusty and Sean and John and Victor and David and AJ and Grace and Martin and and I've just disrespected you but there's no way that's why I'm thinking about doing like a three hour a day commercial free
[1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:50.580]  podcast that's on satellite and radio but no ads because the radio stations want 15 minutes ads an hour and I get it they have to have those but I don't want to go to break I don't want to have ads I know that's all for the networks
[1:56:50.580 --> 1:57:06.580]  I don't want you to sit on hold but I've got to say what I've got to say so here's what's going to happen you're going to get a chance to talk to Steve Botanic he was a very interesting character because we're going to take your calls while he's on and before he gets on I promise which has to break all the time
[1:57:06.580 --> 1:57:21.580]  we're going to break ER nurse on virus hospitals preparing health worker viral pneumonia spreading locally you know that's what this is David Tennessee travels to China for business and these calls are all incredible
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:40.580]  wife is teacher on university's Chinese students they arrested the big Harvard professors a Chinese spy I mean I told you there's like two years ago I was talking to this famous black ops Patriot soldier who UT wouldn't even hire I said yeah where does they're all Chinese spies he goes actually I was going to infiltrate him I was
[1:57:40.580 --> 1:58:01.580]  going to go plant but the point I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers when force your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US
[1:58:01.580 --> 1:58:06.940]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:12.540]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:16.620]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China,
[1:58:17.260 --> 1:58:22.060]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that
[1:58:22.780 --> 1:58:28.620]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:33.260]  against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them,
[1:58:33.260 --> 1:58:39.100]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[1:58:39.100 --> 1:58:44.300]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.

[2:00:07.500 --> 2:00:10.940]  I've been telling you since the start of the show, I don't know if I should break this news or not,
[2:00:11.980 --> 2:00:15.900]  but it's not going to matter because it's all about the break soon. That's good because there's
[2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:22.380]  some times I don't need a person to break things. Dr. Steven Chenix joining us will take calls with
[2:00:22.380 --> 2:00:28.220]  him. Mike Adams is going to be taking over as well. Obviously, stuff is so crazy. I'm going to need
[2:00:28.220 --> 2:00:32.220]  to come in and do some special broadcasts that are commercial free just to get your calls on record.
[2:00:32.220 --> 2:00:37.660]  So, let's try to get to some of those calls right now. Should I just go to who's been holding the
[2:00:37.660 --> 2:00:45.260]  longest? Because I'm not trying to choose whose call is most important. I mean, like
[2:00:46.060 --> 2:00:51.100]  student Miami University students being tested for it, healthcare provider, possible case of
[2:00:51.100 --> 2:00:57.260]  coronavirus, general caller, hospital's lack of readiness, wife's teacher, university's Chinese
[2:00:57.260 --> 2:01:02.700]  students, is a pandemic possible related to coronavirus locally, nursing homes on lockdown
[2:01:02.700 --> 2:01:10.780]  locally, ER nurse on virus, hospitals are preparing, healthcare worker. Let's talk to AJ in Ohio.
[2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:15.340]  AJ, what do you know and thanks for calling. Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I'll make this
[2:01:15.340 --> 2:01:23.340]  fast so you can get the other callers. But yeah, I oversee in Northeast Ohio two nursing homes.
[2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:33.740]  And here we've in the last month, one of my nursing homes has about 70 or so patients. And in the last
[2:01:33.740 --> 2:01:45.180]  month, we've lost five people to pneumonia, which turns to sepsis very quickly. And they pass away
[2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:53.420]  relatively quickly now. We'll take the time we need. This is important. Start over. So describe
[2:01:53.420 --> 2:01:57.260]  this. This is a big deal. You're saying you're seeing higher than normal rates of people dying
[2:01:57.260 --> 2:02:06.140]  from pneumonia. And half of them to two thirds of them have gotten the Prevenor 13 pneumonia
[2:02:06.140 --> 2:02:13.420]  vaccine as well. You're saying you see just a correlation, they get the vaccine, they die?
[2:02:13.420 --> 2:02:20.620]  I'm not saying that, but I am saying that it seems to be ineffective. Now, could it be,
[2:02:20.620 --> 2:02:25.100]  could they be spreading it through the vaccine? Absolutely. I do believe that that could be a
[2:02:25.100 --> 2:02:30.540]  possibility. Well, there are hundreds of studies. Anybody can look these up that vaccines lower
[2:02:30.540 --> 2:02:36.540]  immunity to other pathogens. They may work on the pathogen, but they lower immunity each shot 50%
[2:02:37.180 --> 2:02:43.260]  in a Canadian study, but flew to the next flu virus. Yeah, I believe that was University of
[2:02:43.260 --> 2:02:50.140]  Toronto. Yes, I remember correctly. Now, that being said, also, I'm seeing an epidemic. Now,
[2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:55.900]  I've been in the healthcare business for a long time now. And I've noticed that the crowd of people
[2:02:55.900 --> 2:03:00.620]  that I'm getting into my nursing homes are actually a lot younger in age. We're getting 30
[2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:05.740]  year olds, 40 year olds, 50 year olds that are getting cellulitis and abscesses. And it's like,
[2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:10.300]  to me, it seems like the return of leprosy. I'm watching these people, their skins flaking off
[2:03:10.300 --> 2:03:18.140]  their body. I've never seen anything like this, Alex. It's very frightening. And I myself have
[2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:22.700]  gotten this, if you can't hear my voice, I've had this sinus infection that's been giving me a powerful
[2:03:22.700 --> 2:03:26.300]  sinus headache for two weeks now. And I've been snorting clodal silver, like, you know,
[2:03:26.300 --> 2:03:30.940]  a Colombian with a bag of cocaine. What they're doing, the deep state is on record. They're
[2:03:30.940 --> 2:03:35.900]  releasing soft kill weapons. So you can't tell who hit. And there's no doubt what you're saying,
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:40.060]  neurological disorders, people are getting Alzheimer's at 35 now. So what you're saying
[2:03:40.060 --> 2:03:46.780]  is on record. Wow. Yeah. And you're saying now your nursing homes are full of, I'm sorry.
[2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:52.620]  Sorry, your nursing homes are full of young people. Oh, yeah, I got a guy here 45 years old with
[2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:56.860]  cellulitis and abscesses all over him, his skins flaking off with dermatitis and all this.
[2:03:56.860 --> 2:04:03.500]  This isn't right, Alex. This is not normal. And that being said, I had kind of an epiphany while
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:08.780]  I was waiting on hold here. And you said that you were, you were thinking that it's possibility
[2:04:08.780 --> 2:04:13.660]  that this could be a test run for a future pandemic. And I was kind of thinking, what if it's not a
[2:04:13.660 --> 2:04:19.500]  virus at all that's going around? Think about where they have the 5G weapons systems that right now.
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:23.900]  What if this is a test on the 5G weapons systems over in China, and they're telling us it's a virus?
[2:04:23.900 --> 2:04:28.140]  I mean, people were dropping in the streets all that. That's my gut. I was thinking that last
[2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:35.500]  night. Wow, you just said it right there. It's who the hell knows what's really going on. And
[2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:39.580]  that's what I get. I think is it's something else. And they're telling us it's this. That's just what
[2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:45.340]  my subconscious mind is more powerful than my consciousness is telling me. In my nursing homes
[2:04:45.340 --> 2:04:49.580]  with the younger and younger people that are coming in here. God bless you, brother. I appreciate
[2:04:49.580 --> 2:05:19.540]  your call. More calls. Well, it's here, the year 2020. World government's out in the open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer. And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow. Yes. Now we know we're right. The new world order is
[2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:33.140]  real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader real. But we're real as well. And we love God. And we're standing up and saying no. But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas. We have never been in some small,
[2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:50.700]  filled place that didn't matter. Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through. So it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of
[2:05:50.700 --> 2:06:07.300]  m 4 4.com is critical. So please take action. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:46.700]  Okay. It's clear that this thing is designed to sabotage the economy. Is it high? Is it real? I think it's in between the two. And I don't want to be the guy they pen on. Oh, you created hysteria. But now they've got the military flights coming in, not just the ones you hear about. They got a lot of people dying from this, like Steve
[2:06:46.700 --> 2:07:03.700]  Puchenek said yesterday's doctor medical doctor. A lot of people have already had this and I opened the phone number up. We've got nurses calling doctors calling people with boyfriends in China, who are American citizens that are on locked out with the hotel manager dead and all these medical
[2:07:03.700 --> 2:07:22.700]  doctors. I mean, it looks bad. And like Steve Puchenek said yesterday, it's true. Trump has got to not have them say he was hit flat footed. He's got to appoint a certain general that's a virologist or a crisis manager. And he's got to go ahead and say everything's okay. But this, you know, we'll handle it. We handle
[2:07:22.700 --> 2:07:42.700]  World War Two. We handle whatever we got to handle this because we're all focused on this ridiculous show trial in the Senate. And I made a big deal about it yesterday. So did Senator Paul. I mean, now they're saying Trump's a Chinese agent. I mean, this with no evidence. This is this is sabotage. I want to go through calls with Dr. Puchenek while he's here.
[2:07:42.700 --> 2:08:11.700]  He's a very busy guy, Steve Puchenek.com. And again, he was involved in the founding of Delta Forest co-wrote books with Tom Clancy, did the TM David Accords, did so many other big things since then. It's a lot of trouble on my show in general. And people always see the stuff I do. And I'm not bragging. I'm just saying how the world works. There's doers. And then there's people that sit on the sidelines. And there's those that claim they were the doers. I've learned in my life. I don't want to be gross here. But it's like a woman that puts out and likes it. She's like having sex constantly and loves it. There's women that act like they want sex. They don't.
[2:08:11.700 --> 2:08:23.700]  So it's kind of like in politics or life. There's people that do stuff. There's people that don't. So Puchenek always says this stuff on air and listeners are like, this guy, he said he did this. He said he did that. What's crazy is I went and looked up. He did it.
[2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:36.700]  So, you know, I don't want to compare him to like, you know, Marilyn Monroe or someone she did in Hollywood. But you're either doing stuff or yarn. And I'm in the arena, Puchenek's in the arena. I want to, these calls are insane. I want to go to those two.
[2:08:36.700 --> 2:08:49.700]  But this, look, I don't want to cause a panic, obviously. But the Pentagon's buying up all the food. China, they're shutting down the flights. We're getting calls. There's dead people all over the place. Doc, I get it.
[2:08:49.700 --> 2:09:09.700]  pneumonia is bad. It's the bad every year. They never hype it up. pneumonia is much worse than flu. They obviously flu is this biggest killer. pneumonia is, I know pneumonia is bad. It kills a lot of my family. So I get that you're saying it's normal. It's okay.
[2:09:09.700 --> 2:09:20.700]  But why is the White House so subdued? What do you and your prime projection sees going on here? And who was behind? They're like hyping it, but saying they're not hyping it. It's very nuanced.
[2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:33.700]  Okay, let me start by saying that I heard what your last caller said and I respect what he is. I'm not here to deny or claim anything. Number one, this is not biological warfare.
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:42.700]  I wrote a whole novel on biological warfare 20 years ago predicting what would happen. The truth of the matter is why would the Chinese attack themselves?
[2:09:42.700 --> 2:10:00.700]  No, it's not something that Chinese want to do. Again, you've got to remember, you're granting to the leaders of most countries powers and capabilities that they don't have. Trump is effective in what he does, but he can't be totally effective.
[2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:04.700]  No, no, I totally agree. The average world leader just goes around pontificating.
[2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:27.700]  Let me explain what this virus is. The bats of China and all over the world carry the coronavirus. They happen to carry many, many diseases. They're one of the few mammals in our hierarchy which can live with multiple viruses and diseases, and they transmitted very quickly to humans.
[2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:39.700]  We in turn, as mammals, cannot carry many viruses. What's happening now, with all due respect, number one, this is not biological warfare. Number two, this is not weaponized.
[2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:50.700]  Number three, we already have the genetic coding on this virus, and the reason we have it now and we didn't have it in SARS is that we're moving very fast.
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:57.700]  As much as I said, I still hear all that. I don't want to, I want to believe it. Bat soup did this.
[2:10:57.700 --> 2:11:05.700]  Well, it's not a question of theory. It's a question of that's the reality that bats carry from China and we have it here in the United States.
[2:11:05.700 --> 2:11:10.700]  Why are they shutting down the flights? Why are they hysteria?
[2:11:10.700 --> 2:11:22.700]  It's not hysteria. What's happening is the airlines do not want to be part of the vector that transmits the actual virus. That's reasonable. That's part of public health service.
[2:11:22.700 --> 2:11:33.700]  When I said, look, we need a public health service plan, whatever is happening. And guess what? As a result of your show, AZA showed up, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:41.700]  But more importantly, there's a young... Do you really think us calling for Trump to take action had an effect? Because they're not saying they may shut down all the flights.
[2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:58.700]  No, no, no. It had an effect. And I'll tell you why. For personal reasons, the gentlemen who trained me at Cornell University Medical College and is now the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases and Allergies is Anthony Fauci.
[2:11:58.700 --> 2:12:09.700]  You cannot corrupt Fauci. Let me tell you, this is an excellent clinician. He's been there 30 years. Fauci stepped forward and clearly said the following.
[2:12:09.700 --> 2:12:18.700]  What I said yesterday, I didn't influence him. He said, look, we broke down the genome in 24 hours. We never did that before.
[2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:28.700]  With a SARS virus, it took us three months to figure out what is the genetic makeup of that virus. Now we broke it down. We know exactly what the makeup looks.
[2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:40.700]  Now we can develop that vaccine within a few days to a month. The problem is, if we go through the clinical trials, which are animals and humans, we have to shorten that.
[2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:56.700]  And having been in that business with my last company, I would suggest to Tony Fauci and others that you cut out the dog elements. You speed up the clinical tests and go into phase two and three because it's so important.
[2:12:56.700 --> 2:13:10.700]  In other words, what you did without realizing it, what we had done was to bring forth Azar and Tony Fauci to explain to the country, this is what's going to happen. We don't need to panic.
[2:13:10.700 --> 2:13:30.700]  Number two, with all due respect to you and my respect to me as Marilyn Monroe, there is no financial effect on it. I do day trading and I would have told you yesterday, Tuesday afternoon, we had a problem and today the markets are roaring up for one simple reason.
[2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:35.700]  America cannot be, you know, it's the notion of the Republic, what we said very clearly.
[2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:41.700]  The worst things get around the world, we get stronger. I get it.
[2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:49.700]  I'm a medical doctor like you, but I know that I can get a little bit of a bad thing. My body learns how to defeat it. I know vaccines, real technology, I want good vaccines.
[2:13:49.700 --> 2:14:03.700]  The history of corruption and problems and all of this, that's where people have issues. They go, oh, you're against vaccines. No, we're against, you even, I saw retweeted that when we put it out, the UN head scientist saying they're covering up problems with vaccines.
[2:14:03.700 --> 2:14:06.700]  We need to fix those problems.
[2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:20.700]  Okay, let me get into, you know, Johnson and Johnson, these corporations are going into make vaccine. I'm not as interested in the manufacturing part as I was in the fact that we have a de novo model, a paradigm.
[2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:29.700]  In other words, when Fauci says to you publicly, and I know him because he trained me for years and we were friends and he's an excellent clinician and researcher.
[2:14:29.700 --> 2:14:45.700]  This is not a man who you can corrupt, trust me. And he basically said exactly what I said, within 24 hours, we know the genome within a month, we will probably have the vaccine, but it'll take us few more months because we will do the clinical trials.
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:56.700]  What I'm suggesting now, and believe me, they listen to you, is that they cut out the animal part of the trials, part three, and then even part two and go into the clinical trials right away.
[2:14:56.700 --> 2:15:07.700]  That's an unusual expedition. This is not about making money because the spotlight is on every corporation that can make money. They're not interested at this point in making money.
[2:15:07.700 --> 2:15:14.700]  They actually failed in developing drugs that were so expensive, quite frankly.
[2:15:14.700 --> 2:15:24.700]  I understand. I hear a medical doctor getting the technical stuff. Why is there such hysteria then? Hysteria on one side is saying, oh, it's not a problem on the other. What do you really think is going on?
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:37.700]  The real dynamic, with all due respect, Alex, it's always a dyadic relationship. When we say this corruption, we also have the anti-porn, we have the opposite of the corruption.
[2:15:37.700 --> 2:15:47.700]  The hysteria is not generated by the central government. Trump hasn't said anything. He still talks about the Israeli deal and NIH and HHS.
[2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:54.700]  But the people are organically pissed. I didn't generate this hysteria.

[2:18:53.700 --> 2:19:05.700]  I wanted to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[2:19:05.700 --> 2:19:17.700]  You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:30.700]  And it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:19:30.700 --> 2:19:55.700]  It feels so good. It feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[2:19:55.700 --> 2:20:05.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:05.700 --> 2:20:32.700]  All right, you talked about a character. We got Dr. Steve Piccini who has been involved in everything you can imagine in the U.S. government, but I think he's a good guy on the Patriot.
[2:20:32.700 --> 2:20:40.700]  He's here selling us on a vaccine. We all need for this. And I want to explain something. I'm not agreeing with them just to agree with them.
[2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:53.700]  Vaccine technology is real. If it isn't full of cancer viruses and adjuvants and toxins and cover ups and secret vaccine funds, they always go, you don't believe in science. You're against vaccines.
[2:20:53.700 --> 2:21:06.700]  My grandmother, who died a few years ago at 92, her doctor told her, you got it from the vaccine. And she just tucked it out and was in her iron lung for a while and still lived on.
[2:21:06.700 --> 2:21:13.700]  But my mother, when she was three years old, watched her in that iron lung. That was dramatic. So I always learned about the vaccine, did that to my grandma.
[2:21:13.700 --> 2:21:25.700]  So, you know, they say, oh, well, the problems are outweighed by the benefits. But separate from a vaccine, Dr. Piccini, and then Mike Adams is popping in.
[2:21:25.700 --> 2:21:34.700]  I promised all the callers. God bless them. They're amazing. We're going to get to them with you separately. Why are they hyping it up so big if it isn't a big deal?
[2:21:34.700 --> 2:21:45.700]  I want to believe you. Why are they acting like it's the end of the world? Is it some global world health drill to get folks ready for something? Is it a vaccine drive? I mean, you're hooked into a lot of smart folks.
[2:21:45.700 --> 2:21:49.700]  I know that. What do you think is really going on?
[2:21:49.700 --> 2:21:58.700]  Let me add what, again, remember, you and I understand there are what appears to be contradictory forces in everything we do.
[2:21:58.700 --> 2:22:08.700]  On the one hand, I'm telling you that there is a vaccine that could stop this virus. On the other hand, I told you that I treated it with antibiotics and I'm fine.
[2:22:08.700 --> 2:22:16.700]  I went through this thirdly and most importantly, and why I said there is a condition where I do not approve the vaccines.
[2:22:16.700 --> 2:22:26.700]  And that's when these are young kids and you're giving them 22 or 23 or 30 vaccinations for measles, mumps and everything.
[2:22:26.700 --> 2:22:28.700]  That's where I disagree with this.
[2:22:28.700 --> 2:22:33.700]  I mean, I don't stalk you, but I've seen you tweet our stuff exposing vaccine danger.
[2:22:33.700 --> 2:22:37.700]  That's correct. But let us let us not throw out the baby in the bath.
[2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:44.700]  No, no, I get it. I get it. I get it exactly like kids are getting too many, but clean vaccines could be good for adults.
[2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:55.700]  That's correct. Now, by the time let me make another prediction by the time the vaccine is out, I will guarantee you this virus will be gone.
[2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:59.700]  The coronavirus will be gone. It will be contained.
[2:22:59.700 --> 2:23:06.700]  Some people will die as a result of whatever the immune system is and that we cannot prevent.
[2:23:06.700 --> 2:23:08.700]  So what is the hysteria then?
[2:23:08.700 --> 2:23:10.700]  I don't know where the hysteria is coming from.
[2:23:10.700 --> 2:23:16.700]  Well, China is locking down and the flight is being carried. This is way bigger than like bird flu hoax.
[2:23:16.700 --> 2:23:20.700]  Well, no, no. But listen, when we had Ebola, we had the same thing.
[2:23:20.700 --> 2:23:26.700]  Ebola was far more lethal and we had to put in military soldiers overseas.
[2:23:26.700 --> 2:23:29.700]  What's happening now is what I said before.
[2:23:29.700 --> 2:23:35.700]  There are standard procedures for an outbreak of any type of flu or problem.
[2:23:35.700 --> 2:23:39.700]  That standard procedure is you do not become a vector.
[2:23:39.700 --> 2:23:44.700]  In other words, you do not facilitate the carrying of that virus to other countries.
[2:23:44.700 --> 2:23:50.700]  And because we have such fluid mobility, we didn't have it in 1918 when 20 million died.
[2:23:50.700 --> 2:23:55.700]  1919 when another 20 million died. This is not going to happen now.
[2:23:55.700 --> 2:23:59.700]  What we have now is sanitation. What you said yesterday was correct.
[2:23:59.700 --> 2:24:05.700]  Sanitation is what did it, not the vaccine. So why is Trump waiting not to create a panic?
[2:24:05.700 --> 2:24:13.700]  I think Trump was focusing on something else. I would have loved for him to step forward and say, look, America, we don't have a problem.
[2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:16.700]  We don't want to overshadow the fake trial. Be presidential.
[2:24:16.700 --> 2:24:20.700]  Say the military is going to take care of it. Because that's the military's job.
[2:24:20.700 --> 2:24:23.700]  I'm not, the left-exlect is calling the military's fascist.
[2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:28.700]  The military involved with the border. And if fascist disease is their job in the Constitution.
[2:24:28.700 --> 2:24:39.700]  I understand. But what I told you last time, I don't want, I was part of something where we deployed to Liberia and Sierra Leone to stop Ebola.
[2:24:39.700 --> 2:24:48.700]  Last time, we have deployments into China to bring back people who will be isolated because they might be carriers.
[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:51.700]  That's not hysteria. That's just a common practice.
[2:24:51.700 --> 2:24:55.700]  Hysteria would be if we shut down everything, nobody's going anywhere.
[2:24:55.700 --> 2:24:58.700]  No, I get it. Mike Adams has breaking news. Stay right there.
[2:24:58.700 --> 2:25:04.700]  CDC diverts flights. American evacuees to military base. California's coronavirus pandemic spreads.
[2:25:04.700 --> 2:25:09.700]  I'm a smart guy. Steve Bachanik, sir. Whether it's Steve Bachanik.com. Mike Adams, what do you have?
[2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:12.700]  Thanks for having me on, Alex. Fascinating discussion, listening to both of you.
[2:25:12.700 --> 2:25:15.700]  I don't mean to take much time. You've got important callers as well.
[2:25:15.700 --> 2:25:23.700]  But the CDC has diverted a flight in California to a military air reserve base.
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:28.700]  This flight was of the evacuees from China up to 240 Americans.
[2:25:28.700 --> 2:25:36.700]  It was screened in Alaska. The flight was supposed to land in the Ontario International Airport in California where they were going to be quarantined.
[2:25:36.700 --> 2:25:45.700]  Instead, they were diverted to this military air reserve base, and now it's not clear whether they're going to be quarantined or just released into the public.
[2:25:45.700 --> 2:25:51.700]  Furthermore, it's now confirmed, these are statements from the Pentagon. We've got the links in the story.
[2:25:51.700 --> 2:25:59.700]  The U.S. military has activated its Defense Threat Reduction Agency, CTRA, which has been working alongside the CDC as a...
[2:25:59.700 --> 2:26:04.700]  So that standard procedure, that's good. What about the Chinese coming in on other flights?
[2:26:04.700 --> 2:26:07.700]  That would be my question. We already had this two days ago, Mike. You're just saying it.
[2:26:07.700 --> 2:26:12.700]  I was in the news. They already are ready for a whole major scenario on the West Coast.
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:17.700]  Yeah, the point is that publicly, we're being told this is no big deal.
[2:26:17.700 --> 2:26:22.700]  It means everything is being deployed for this. And by the way, Ebola, yes, it's more fatal,
[2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:28.700]  but Ebola can't spread very much because it doesn't have an incubation period where it's infectious.
[2:26:28.700 --> 2:26:35.700]  So this coronavirus is far more at a higher transmission capability than Ebola ever could imagine.
[2:26:35.700 --> 2:26:39.700]  Mike, I'll co-host with you next hour and take calls. We'll cover it then. Thank you.
[2:26:39.700 --> 2:26:40.700]  Sounds good. Thank you.
[2:26:40.700 --> 2:26:46.700]  And I promise callers Angel and Sean and Dusty and Mike and John and Martin and Keith and David and Grace, we're going to you.
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:49.700]  Steve, I saw you shaking your head. What do you want to say about that?
[2:26:49.700 --> 2:26:55.700]  That's not true. Ebola is far more lethal. I mean, with all due respect to Mike, I mean, we had the...
[2:26:55.700 --> 2:26:57.700]  I meant transmission.
[2:26:57.700 --> 2:27:02.700]  No, let me say this. I said yesterday we would deploy military and we are deploying it.
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:11.700]  The reason they're going to a military base is very simple. We can control in the military the environment around the individuals.
[2:27:11.700 --> 2:27:13.700]  We can select whom we want to...
[2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:15.700]  No, that's good. We should have the military.
[2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:23.700]  That's my point. It is. This is not hysteria. This is standard operating procedures when you don't have a public health service that came to the forefront.
[2:27:23.700 --> 2:27:32.700]  This is exactly what I said yesterday. We're using our soldiers. DOD listened to what she said. Fauci listened to what she said.
[2:27:32.700 --> 2:27:37.700]  And in fact, this is not hysteria. What's happening is we have controlled this system.
[2:27:37.700 --> 2:27:46.700]  We brought in the people who might have been infected in Wuhan because we have embassy officials, including operatives and all types of individuals,
[2:27:46.700 --> 2:27:54.700]  but we don't want them transmitting it outside the system. This virus is not lethal. Mark Lyons is wrong.
[2:27:54.700 --> 2:28:00.700]  The number of people that have had this compared to the number of deaths...
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:05.700]  Okay, I want to believe that. What is the genesis of hysteria?
[2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:14.700]  The genesis... I don't see the hysteria. Quite frankly, I do what they say. Before I came on your show, the markets kept going up.
[2:28:14.700 --> 2:28:23.700]  If we would have had hysteria and we would have had a panic, I can guarantee you on Tuesday afternoon, within an hour and a half, we lost 400 points.
[2:28:23.700 --> 2:28:30.700]  That's not what's happening in the markets. And instead, the markets are saying, you know what? We don't give a damn about what's going to happen.
[2:28:30.700 --> 2:28:36.700]  Why is China... I want to believe this. I got children. We'll come back. Why is China... We'll go to calls.
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:43.700]  Why is China then locking down cities, doing all this? Is this some political diversion for them? I want to believe you.
[2:28:43.700 --> 2:29:01.700]  Because I've lost family to this type of virus. I want to believe it. Call straight ahead and stay with us.
[2:29:13.700 --> 2:29:19.700]  We're off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here, right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:19.700 --> 2:29:25.700]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:29:25.700 --> 2:29:31.700]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:31.700 --> 2:29:39.700]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX Microgrid System at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:39.700 --> 2:30:03.700]  This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward.
[2:30:03.700 --> 2:30:12.700]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:30:12.700 --> 2:30:20.700]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us, and it's symbiotic.
[2:30:20.700 --> 2:30:26.700]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[2:30:26.700 --> 2:30:34.700]  And people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen, and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago,
[2:30:34.700 --> 2:30:38.700]  I started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[2:30:38.700 --> 2:30:47.700]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it. It's amazing.
[2:30:47.700 --> 2:30:53.700]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWar, a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[2:30:53.700 --> 2:31:05.700]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week, and that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[2:31:05.700 --> 2:31:07.700]  It's amazing. Go check it out for yourself.
[2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:16.700]  Then we've got back in StockX2, our best-selling deep-earth crystals iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body,
[2:31:16.700 --> 2:31:18.700]  and I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[2:31:18.700 --> 2:31:23.700]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:28.700]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off infowarstore.com, and it funds the M4.
[2:31:28.700 --> 2:31:35.700]  And then, vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, winter sun.
[2:31:35.700 --> 2:31:41.700]  You don't have sun during the winter. Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3. That's why people get so sick.
[2:31:41.700 --> 2:31:45.700]  That's the main reason. Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption. It's amazing.
[2:31:45.700 --> 2:31:50.700]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:50.700 --> 2:31:54.700]  Protect yourself and fund the M4. 360 win.
[2:31:54.700 --> 2:32:02.700]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China, and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[2:32:02.700 --> 2:32:11.700]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries, and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States west coast.
[2:32:11.700 --> 2:32:20.700]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:26.700]  That's right. The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food storage at alarming rates.
[2:32:26.700 --> 2:32:32.700]  Info wars, private labels from my patriot supply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[2:32:32.700 --> 2:32:37.700]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks.
[2:32:37.700 --> 2:32:45.700]  And that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven to 10 days, but if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[2:32:45.700 --> 2:33:07.700]  But if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[2:33:15.700 --> 2:33:22.700]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:30.700]  I want to be clear, because I get the text message, I get the calls like Alex, you're saying it's a big crisis and I understand it's not.
[2:33:30.700 --> 2:33:37.700]  I don't know what's going on. I'm not getting talking points from somebody. And then I go and regurgitate those. I'm a real person.
[2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:46.700]  I make the decisions here. And then I get guest on. I call and go, Hey, good. Dr. Pachenek on. He's a smart guy. And then he comes on and says whatever he's going to say.
[2:33:46.700 --> 2:33:55.700]  That's why in force is popular. It's not a cult. We get guest on. We get callers on. We don't scream. We are about to say it's real.
[2:33:55.700 --> 2:34:01.700]  It's a real human discussion, which we're supposed to happen. And sometimes I'm like, well, I kind of agree with that. I don't agree.
[2:34:01.700 --> 2:34:11.700]  I'll even be of a dual mind on something. That's what freedom is all about. I want to take a bunch of calls, Dr. Pachenek, because they've been holding grace and Sarah and David and Keith and Martin and
[2:34:11.700 --> 2:34:20.700]  John and Victor and Connor and Angel and Sean. We'll get to a lot of them now. Some of the next hour when I co host with Mike Adams, but just I get it.
[2:34:20.700 --> 2:34:33.700]  You don't want a crisis. You don't want to panic. You just dealt with a very deadly, you know, type virus, pneumonia. We know it's much worse than people always hype up flu to meet pneumonia.
[2:34:33.700 --> 2:34:42.700]  I've seen is a really deadly one. I hope you're right. I'm just asking why there's such a freak out in China. What do you think's happening?
[2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:53.700]  The freak out in China is not a freak out. It's the way that Chinese work from a centralized committee. In other words, Xi has never been in one of these problems before.
[2:34:53.700 --> 2:35:05.700]  This is what he knows. This is what he does when you have 19 cities or 30 cities in China and you have 119 million people in one city, 21 million in another city.
[2:35:05.700 --> 2:35:21.700]  You have to close them down very quickly because this January and this is what was not emphasized. The new year, the Chinese new year was intended to bring everybody from the major cities back to the rural area.
[2:35:21.700 --> 2:35:36.700]  What she did, he said, that's it. We're not moving. Your people are not going to your hometown. And within a week, you will remain where you are so that we can maintain some sense of order and containment on this epidemic.
[2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:51.700]  Instead, what would have happened is literally hundreds of millions of people would have spread that virus all over China. Not only for Hunan and Hubei, you would have had Shanghai, Beijing, and it's already there.
[2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:58.700]  I get it. How communicable and how deadly is the virus?
[2:35:58.700 --> 2:36:10.700]  It is highly communicable. It is not highly deadly. Given the numbers of thousands of people who've had it, you've had about a thousand so who died. We don't know exact numbers, but I had it.
[2:36:10.700 --> 2:36:18.700]  I treated it and I'm a living proof that a man over 60 can have the virus get sick.
[2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:28.700]  So what was that thing six years ago that they covered up in the US because callers called it all over. They had like dead bodies everywhere. Did you hear about that six years ago, that whatever that was?
[2:36:28.700 --> 2:36:40.700]  That was the Ebola. What we did was in fact to make sure that you did not know about it. It was a totally different problem. Fauci was not in charge. We didn't have a public health service.
[2:36:40.700 --> 2:37:00.700]  We didn't have a surgeon general. I was asked what we would do. We sent over 3000 soldiers into Sierra Leone, Liberia to reconfigure the entire capability in those countries and make sure that those people who had the far more lethal, far, far more lethal
[2:37:00.700 --> 2:37:12.700]  make sure that you had the ball of an element and make sure it was never coming into the states. So when you say like six years ago, Ebola was going then, there was a really bad pneumonia six years ago, too.
[2:37:12.700 --> 2:37:24.700]  Well, they could have been SARS or MRS. There's always a flu. And when the flu is not contained, and we normally don't give antibiotics, that's really the standard procedure.
[2:37:24.700 --> 2:37:30.140]  procedure. Explain to me, I've read that. How does the antibiotics counter a virus?
[2:37:30.140 --> 2:37:34.580]  Because it's not constantly a virus. It's what we would call a primary, atypical type
[2:37:34.580 --> 2:37:39.940]  of virus. So it uses bacteria to spread the virus. It's in between a virus and a bacteria
[2:37:39.940 --> 2:37:45.500]  because I've been doing this for 40 years, treating the so-called virus. The virus uses
[2:37:45.500 --> 2:37:51.500]  bacteria to spread. So if you kill the bacteria, it can't spread. No, no, no, no. I'm not sure
[2:37:51.500 --> 2:37:56.700]  these are always viruses genetically. They transnude very quickly because otherwise,
[2:37:56.700 --> 2:38:01.420]  how does the antibiotic work on what I'm doing? And it's effective over 30, 40 years.
[2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:05.260]  So they're saying it's viral, but you're seeing antibiotics work.
[2:38:05.260 --> 2:38:10.780]  It works for me. It worked for me for over 30, 40 years. So what I'm saying is that clinically,
[2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:17.860]  we don't normally see the pneumonia on the X-rays. We don't normally culture them out
[2:38:17.860 --> 2:38:23.740]  and spew them. But clinically, guys like me would train in the ways of medicine. We take
[2:38:23.740 --> 2:38:29.340]  our antibiotic doses and guess what? It goes away. And we don't, we get a pneumonia, but
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:32.380]  the pneumonia cures itself as a result of it.
[2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:36.740]  The antibiotic suppresses biological stuff to begin with so the virus can't spread in
[2:38:36.740 --> 2:38:41.020]  a suppression. It poisons the body. The antibiotic is the type of chemotherapy. So it suppresses
[2:38:41.020 --> 2:38:44.460]  biological activity. That suppresses viral flow.
[2:38:44.460 --> 2:38:49.020]  Not exactly. Well, it's interesting theory, but no, I believe that the virus that we're
[2:38:49.020 --> 2:38:55.100]  talking about doesn't remain in a viral stage, or at least within its transmutation. It's
[2:38:55.100 --> 2:38:56.100]  a, it can't be effective.
[2:38:56.100 --> 2:38:59.300]  But it's got to have a bacterial carrier to jump into if that's your theory.
[2:38:59.300 --> 2:39:03.740]  Well, I don't have a clinical theory. I'm just, I'm giving you the clinical output
[2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:08.060]  of what I've done for 30 years. And I know very well, I just got the coronavirus.
[2:39:08.060 --> 2:39:12.700]  Hey, I know they treat viruses with the antibiotics and it works. So that's what I'm saying. What
[2:39:12.700 --> 2:39:16.700]  is viral theory then?
[2:39:16.700 --> 2:39:22.420]  Viral theory is exactly that. Viral theory. I'm not a theoretician. I'm a clinician. And
[2:39:22.420 --> 2:39:26.860]  I believe in what I know clinically has worked on me and my children and others.
[2:39:26.860 --> 2:39:32.060]  No, I get it. Antibiotics work on viruses. So what the hell's going on?
[2:39:32.060 --> 2:39:38.340]  Well, because the purity, look, the medical profession has their own heuristic models,
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:43.980]  meaning they have their own kind of theories. Do I buy into them? No, what I buy into, I'm
[2:39:43.980 --> 2:39:44.980]  a clinician.
[2:39:44.980 --> 2:39:45.980]  I buy into theories that work.
[2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:50.620]  Well, that's what I am. I'm a clinician. Basically, what works is what has happened
[2:39:50.620 --> 2:39:57.140]  and what effectively has created a cure rate or a positive outcome. I'm not interested
[2:39:57.140 --> 2:40:01.300]  in the theories because those are all secondary.
[2:40:01.300 --> 2:40:05.860]  I'm result based, have always been. As I said to you yesterday, did I know we would
[2:40:05.860 --> 2:40:09.860]  have military deployment? Nobody told me, but I knew we would have it. And I knew we
[2:40:09.860 --> 2:40:14.820]  would take out the people from China, from Africa, any country, which has that.
[2:40:14.820 --> 2:40:19.540]  No, I get it. We can't figure out the minutiae, but throw it against the wall. What works
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:21.540]  go with that?
[2:40:21.540 --> 2:40:26.740]  That's exactly right. That's why I said to you, we are a formidable country. We're
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:32.580]  not in a panic mode. We are far stronger than that. We're not China. We're not even Europe
[2:40:32.580 --> 2:40:37.820]  in this way. And that way, we can contain what we're concerned about. You got to remember,
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:43.540]  these are people we sent to Hunan to represent us in the business administration or counselor
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:45.980]  or intelligence.
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:51.140]  For the most part, I don't have a public health service. You haven't seen it. I haven't
[2:40:51.140 --> 2:40:58.180]  seen a surgeon general. So what I have is Tony Fauci, head of NIH. I have ASR, head of HHS.
[2:40:58.180 --> 2:41:03.420]  And more importantly, I have Esper, who's deployed military soldiers over the world,
[2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:08.940]  with Trump's approval. And I know from my previous experience with military soldiers
[2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:18.740]  that I can effectively cordon off any kind of a virus or whatever Ebola epidemic, because
[2:41:18.740 --> 2:41:20.660]  we've done it in the past.
[2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:25.700]  Now, is the military trained for that? There are units that are trained for this type of
[2:41:25.700 --> 2:41:30.540]  situation. Would I have preferred a surgeon general to come out? Yeah, but we don't seem
[2:41:30.540 --> 2:41:31.540]  to have one.
[2:41:31.540 --> 2:41:35.500]  All right, Steve Puchenik, I really appreciate you spending so much time with us today. It's
[2:41:35.500 --> 2:41:39.340]  been thought provoking. And I would love a vaccine that counters all this. And I get
[2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:44.020]  that science is real. I just know why it's always tainted and messed up and the cover
[2:41:44.020 --> 2:41:48.660]  ups. But thank you for coming on The War Room yesterday and my show. And please join us
[2:41:48.660 --> 2:41:52.660]  StevePuchenik.com, your new book, which you've never tried to promote. It's excellent. I actually
[2:41:52.660 --> 2:41:56.540]  read it a few months ago. People are like, God, this sounds like craziness. No, you can
[2:41:56.540 --> 2:42:00.980]  look this up. He did all this stuff. It is the book American Warrior in Crisis Tales
[2:42:00.980 --> 2:42:05.900]  of Political Psychiatrists. Amazing. Thank you, Dr. Puchenik. We really appreciate you.
[2:42:05.900 --> 2:42:08.580]  And please join us anytime you can.
[2:42:08.580 --> 2:42:10.100]  I will. Thank you.
[2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:14.380]  All right. I know I've got 20 callers that have been patiently holding on average 51
[2:42:14.380 --> 2:42:18.380]  minutes. I can see that right there on the screen. And I'm going to take all your calls
[2:42:18.380 --> 2:42:24.500]  before the next guest host takes over. So I'm going to try to shut up and just go to
[2:42:24.500 --> 2:42:29.460]  you when we come back. But a lot of callers are calling in. I'm getting text messages.
[2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:33.300]  We're promoting vaccines. I've always told you, I'm not just in line with Puchenik.
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:38.860]  I agree. Vaccines are real technology like a combustion engine. But you need clean gas
[2:42:38.860 --> 2:42:43.660]  in that tank to make that stuff. I don't want saltwater in there. And there's saltwater
[2:42:43.660 --> 2:42:47.700]  in these damn vaccines. It's come out. The globalists have like, quote, clean vaccines
[2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:53.900]  for themselves. I want the elite to take the same vaccines I take.
[2:42:53.900 --> 2:43:01.220]  This time of year, I'm always promoting winter sun or high quality organic vitamin D three
[2:43:01.220 --> 2:43:06.780]  vitamin K combo because it's in the fall. It's in the winter. It's in the spring that
[2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:12.580]  people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs. And
[2:43:12.580 --> 2:43:17.620]  then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly
[2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:22.260]  viruses that are wreaking havoc out there. It's on record that you've got to have this
[2:43:22.260 --> 2:43:28.580]  to live not just to defend against these viruses. So right now we have winter sun still available
[2:43:28.580 --> 2:43:32.500]  even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall winter and spring. I'm
[2:43:32.500 --> 2:43:40.060]  going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23. Despite the fact that I could
[2:43:40.060 --> 2:43:44.820]  sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you protecting
[2:43:44.820 --> 2:43:50.340]  yourself and your family. So winter sun taken out of the tongue super high quality 40%
[2:43:50.340 --> 2:43:55.660]  off available now at infowarstore.com. It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming

[2:45:54.980 --> 2:45:59.260]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the InfoWar, but I know you're like me.
[2:45:59.260 --> 2:46:03.580]  You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship
[2:46:03.580 --> 2:46:07.460]  and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back. And
[2:46:07.460 --> 2:46:11.700]  you know what? I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team. And it's
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:18.420]  why InfoWars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus
[2:46:18.420 --> 2:46:24.660]  the people on taking action against the globalist, because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[2:46:24.660 --> 2:46:29.220]  And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are
[2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:34.420]  the InfoWar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020, however you can.
[2:46:34.420 --> 2:46:38.300]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at InfoWars, I want
[2:46:38.300 --> 2:46:42.540]  to thank you all because you are the InfoWar, and you know that's not just words, that's
[2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:50.860]  reality. You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:57.380]  because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[2:46:57.380 --> 2:47:11.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:11.860 --> 2:47:19.980]  You know, there's a strange form of guilt about being right. I promote and sell products
[2:47:19.980 --> 2:47:25.940]  that I know, I use, that I believe in. I promote this immune gargle that my father and old
[2:47:25.940 --> 2:47:34.460]  surgeon and dentist developed that's got nano silver, not just colloidal silver in it, that
[2:47:34.460 --> 2:47:40.660]  you can gargle, you can even drink, that is documented to destroy bad bacteria and viruses.
[2:47:40.660 --> 2:47:45.380]  I'm still keeping that massively discounted. I think it's 40% off right now, despite the
[2:47:45.380 --> 2:47:51.300]  fact that we're going to sell out of this within a week of current sales rates, because metaphysically
[2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:57.780]  I can't charge you full price on something during a crisis like this. I must treat you
[2:47:57.780 --> 2:48:03.140]  like I treat myself. Just like a vampire has to trick you to let him in. Well, I had to
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:09.020]  treat you like I am, or I become the vampire. We've got it in three different sizes. It
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:15.300]  will sell out very quickly because I just had Dr. Steve Pachena Khan, who's a really
[2:48:15.300 --> 2:48:20.380]  interesting guy. I mean, he's done the things he said he was involved with wrong governments
[2:48:20.380 --> 2:48:28.380]  and assassinations. I mean, he's the real deal. And he has his own agenda. Everything's
[2:48:28.380 --> 2:48:36.740]  fine. We're going to handle it. That's his job to say that. And you know what? I've got
[2:48:36.740 --> 2:48:49.620]  three daughters and a son. And I sure hope that's the case. But it's 2020. And I don't
[2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:55.500]  see that as the cards we've been dealt. And you know what? No one will be happier than
[2:48:55.500 --> 2:49:02.500]  me when I'm proven wrong. I will celebrate the fact I'm wrong. Something begs going down.
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:06.700]  So you've been holding for over an hour. Grace and Sarah and David and Keith and Martin and
[2:49:06.700 --> 2:49:14.220]  John and Victor and Connor and Angel and Sean to get a Sarah and Sean. We never I'm going
[2:49:14.220 --> 2:49:21.580]  to go to your calls right now. But I'm gonna leave it at this. I don't sell storeable foods
[2:49:21.580 --> 2:49:28.220]  to you and colloidal silver and iodine because I think a crisis is coming. And then once
[2:49:28.220 --> 2:49:35.060]  it comes, we are selling out of all of it. I sell it to you because I had Dr. Group ten
[2:49:35.060 --> 2:49:41.500]  years ago for two years ago, Alex Alex, you got to promote I don't. It's the good halogen
[2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:46.100]  all the bad ones. It's the big conspiracy. It'll make your skin clear. Alex, it'll make
[2:49:46.100 --> 2:49:52.100]  your sex life better. But you got to have the real you got to and I'm finally I take
[2:49:52.100 --> 2:49:57.900]  it and I'm like, what the hell? God, I wish I would have listened earlier.
[2:49:57.900 --> 2:50:03.060]  And so all I'm telling you is about stuff I already know. I'm not a leftist that sells
[2:50:03.060 --> 2:50:08.780]  you something because it makes me powerful. I sell you something because it worked for
[2:50:08.780 --> 2:50:13.780]  me. The globalist don't promote things that work because they don't want you having those
[2:50:13.780 --> 2:50:20.380]  answers. I'll tell you, if you can get real Himalayan salt, not all that has it, but real
[2:50:20.380 --> 2:50:27.020]  Himalayan salt has ancient deep earth iodine that's almost as good as ours for like $10
[2:50:27.020 --> 2:50:36.500]  a bottle. So don't buy ours. Just if you go out and you get Himalayan salt, it's the real
[2:50:36.500 --> 2:50:42.100]  Himalayan salt. Two, three weeks in, you start using down your eggs in the morning and your
[2:50:42.100 --> 2:50:46.700]  hamburger at night or wherever you're doing your salad. You're going to feel this stuff's
[2:50:46.700 --> 2:50:52.740]  incredible. So listen, don't get it from me. Get it from Himalayan salt. It's got it as
[2:50:52.740 --> 2:50:58.140]  well. It's a little more bound. It's about a third as strong, but so what? Just crank
[2:50:58.140 --> 2:51:08.340]  the tube. Just please, please get it for yourself because it's literally, I was already so awake
[2:51:08.340 --> 2:51:14.140]  and I was already powerful spiritually. But man, when I finally got on iodine, it was
[2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:19.980]  like I stuck my dick in a light socket. And I'm sorry, I've got a family audience, but
[2:51:19.980 --> 2:51:29.020]  sometimes these are the only words I've got. I am more virile taking all of our products
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:34.820]  because these are superfoods than I was when I was 15 years old and I was a bad asset 15.
[2:51:34.820 --> 2:51:42.580]  I mean, I was a murder machine and I'm at 45, about to be 46 in just a couple of weeks.
[2:51:42.580 --> 2:51:48.900]  And I can tell you that if I didn't take clean fish oil and if I didn't take clean iodine
[2:51:48.900 --> 2:51:52.740]  and if I didn't do this, I wouldn't be able to. This is the stuff God gave us. You think
[2:51:52.740 --> 2:51:57.780]  the drug companies gave us something? Like my, my crews are great. You know, Tim Prusier,
[2:51:57.780 --> 2:52:00.980]  we don't do much marketing. He's like, Hey, food's the big hot seller and you need to
[2:52:00.980 --> 2:52:08.460]  promote that. Please stop. Food's great. It's a backup and emergency, but your brain, your
[2:52:08.460 --> 2:52:16.500]  transmitter to God, it wants fish oil. It wants iodine. It wants turmeric and man. I
[2:52:16.500 --> 2:52:20.620]  mean, I remember I was never a big drug guy, but like in high school and stuff. I mean,
[2:52:20.620 --> 2:52:27.100]  I spoke pot. I did this or that a few times. This, that what you happens with things that
[2:52:27.100 --> 2:52:31.820]  God gave us, it doesn't happen in 10 minutes, like a sort of cocaine or something. It happens
[2:52:31.820 --> 2:52:41.300]  over time. But what you get from it is so incredible, is so empowering, is so amazing
[2:52:41.300 --> 2:52:46.900]  that I'm just like, wow, why didn't somebody tell me about this? Cause let me take a group
[2:52:46.900 --> 2:52:50.700]  to come by. I already sold a few of his products like 10 years ago. He like, you need a hot
[2:52:50.700 --> 2:53:00.260]  dog. They say talks. I'm going to get sick in three weeks when you take it. He's just,
[2:53:00.260 --> 2:53:04.140]  he kept like, like a, like a drug dealer. You take this and you take this and I took
[2:53:04.140 --> 2:53:11.260]  it and nothing's been the same. Everything I was became twice as strong. I'm strong.
[2:53:11.260 --> 2:53:18.060]  I'm stronger at 45 than I was at 18. And I was a bad ass in 18. Not bragging. It's just
[2:53:18.060 --> 2:53:24.140]  a fact. And I think people figured out I'm on BS in here. And so all I'm saying is God
[2:53:24.140 --> 2:53:32.540]  newly would, would come into attack. So don't buy my iDynex2. Go get real Himalayan salt
[2:53:32.540 --> 2:53:38.700]  and see what it does. I told you I go out to your calls and I'm done. But I'm all about
[2:53:38.700 --> 2:53:52.220]  solutions. And I get Pachennic, you know, wants to stabilize stuff. And that's totally reasonable.
[2:53:52.220 --> 2:53:56.860]  You know, there's no way to just pick who the best caller is. That's why I just respect
[2:53:56.860 --> 2:54:01.780]  these callers so much. And I've disrespected them. I'm making them whole. And I apologize.
[2:54:01.780 --> 2:54:08.500]  Who's been holding the longest? That would be John in Ohio, healthcare provider, possible
[2:54:08.500 --> 2:54:12.700]  case of coronavirus. John, thank you for holding. I appreciate you. Go ahead.
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:19.180]  Hey, Alex, how are you, man? I'm hiring the kite online brother.
[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:27.100]  Good. Hey, I want to let you know. So Miami University here in Oxford, Ohio, according
[2:54:27.100 --> 2:54:38.060]  to WLWC channel five, we have a possible student with the coronavirus. Now, my concern is with
[2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:42.060]  this is we're going to see this with all the universities throughout the United States.
[2:54:42.060 --> 2:54:48.460]  Are these going to be the breeding grounds? You know what I mean?
[2:54:48.460 --> 2:54:52.660]  You're the boss. I'm listening to you. What do you think's going on? Obviously, there's
[2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:57.780]  a cover up. And I'm not trying to be mean to Trump, but the more he waits, if this is
[2:54:57.780 --> 2:55:03.340]  as bad as they're saying, I'm getting pissed. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, we're dealing
[2:55:03.340 --> 2:55:08.540]  with, you know, the Chinese basically hijacking our education system already. So is this the
[2:55:08.540 --> 2:55:14.780]  major indictments happen today? Yeah. And, you know, but he had some good
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:19.580]  points, you know, I mean, you know, and the most important thing is, you know, as you've
[2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:24.860]  been, you know, promoting the thing is, is we need to make sure that, you know, we need
[2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:31.780]  to take our vitamin D and vitamin C, you know, like I always, in my clinic, I always
[2:55:31.780 --> 2:55:39.780]  push crystal vitamin C with a little bit of baking soda to make it sodium escorbinate,
[2:55:39.780 --> 2:55:43.940]  you know, and that's actually a basic version. I know why is Pauline on the Nobel Prize
[2:55:43.940 --> 2:55:48.460]  for that? Explain. What is that combination due to vitamin C? Make it a bio available?
[2:55:48.460 --> 2:55:55.780]  What happens? So, so, so our body, you know, if you look at it this way, the body pH runs
[2:55:55.780 --> 2:56:05.580]  between 7.35 and 7.45. So we run a little bit more on the basic side of, you know, neutral.
[2:56:05.580 --> 2:56:10.700]  So when we start making things a little bit more basic, it's a little bit more easily
[2:56:10.700 --> 2:56:16.740]  or more bio available. When we put it in the more basic form, which is really one of the
[2:56:16.740 --> 2:56:25.420]  reasons why we have this huge push for outlet of water, because our body uses it faster.
[2:56:25.420 --> 2:56:31.940]  Amazing. Gut level approximation. You saw the smart guy, John. What the hell's going
[2:56:31.940 --> 2:56:36.740]  on? Is this a hype? Is this hysteria? Is it real? What do you think?
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:40.340]  You know, I mean, honestly, you know, I mean, it's a little bit, to me, it's a little bit
[2:56:40.340 --> 2:56:46.180]  of both. You know, as a health care provider, I've been seeing a lot of flu move through.
[2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:50.000]  Believe me, you know, I've seen it too. My heart office has been like, we can barely
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:54.580]  stay on air with, I mean, Owen's tough and he's in bed right now, really ill.
[2:56:54.580 --> 2:56:59.540]  It's been crippling people. My next door neighbor, I mean, her daughter has been down
[2:56:59.540 --> 2:57:06.220]  for 10 days. It's incredible. And so, you know, my thing is, is are we dealing with
[2:57:06.220 --> 2:57:12.940]  something where we're kind of mopping the floor and taking care of the low life quote
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:17.820]  unquote, where, you know, people who just really can't get good health because they
[2:57:17.820 --> 2:57:23.780]  don't have good health insurance and or, you know, good lifestyle, you know, behaviors.
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:28.500]  No, you just said it. All the tough people sit at home and battle it out. And all the
[2:57:28.500 --> 2:57:34.420]  coke heads and drug addicts and meth heads, they just stop up the hospital's energy. Wow.
[2:57:34.420 --> 2:57:38.420]  In my bones, I feel a major attack. I just go with my gut. I think something big's happening.
[2:57:38.420 --> 2:57:44.160]  All right. Well, they're right back. Thank you, John. More calls for you. I love watching
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:47.940]  David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other
[2:57:47.940 --> 2:57:52.620]  shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you. We run during the breaks, a lot of news
[2:57:52.620 --> 2:57:58.020]  reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad.
[2:57:58.020 --> 2:58:02.220]  I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely paying the bills
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:06.540]  here and I want to expand the face. The globalists not contract. I don't want them to win. So
[2:58:06.540 --> 2:58:11.580]  listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We sell enough product, we'll have less ads
[2:58:11.580 --> 2:58:15.780]  and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.

[2:59:44.540 --> 3:00:10.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:24.900]  I don't have the crew to go back six months ago, three months ago, a month ago, but you
[3:00:24.900 --> 3:00:32.740]  all heard it. You already knew it. Am I kissing around? It's just true. We already know it.
[3:00:32.740 --> 3:00:38.580]  That the bio attack would be the way to counter the economy. And I sit here during the breaks.
[3:00:38.580 --> 3:00:43.020]  I just lean back and I just get in my spirit and I go, what is this? It's an attack on
[3:00:43.020 --> 3:00:47.980]  the world economy. Whether this virus is as deadly as they say it is or it isn't, that's
[3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:54.540]  what this is. And I've got this tendency to not be arrogant because I'm not arrogant.
[3:00:54.540 --> 3:00:59.580]  But then my spirit says, stop holding back. Just tell them what you think they tune in
[3:00:59.580 --> 3:01:04.780]  because they respect you and I respect him. So I'll just tell you this virus is dangerous.
[3:01:04.780 --> 3:01:11.140]  It's not that deadly. This is a very communicable virus as Dr. Pachennick said, but it's it's
[3:01:11.140 --> 3:01:19.020]  not that deadly. But he's old saying like, if if your neighbor's jobless, it's a recession
[3:01:19.020 --> 3:01:24.340]  of your jobless, it's a depression. It's very real if it's killing your family, but there's
[3:01:24.340 --> 3:01:31.780]  pneumonia is rampaging. They always hype up flu. It's it's pneumonia. So it's real.
[3:01:31.780 --> 3:01:39.460]  But is it what they're saying? No, it's for a reason. And we've got to suss out together
[3:01:39.460 --> 3:01:50.740]  what that is. And they want to embarrass Trump and say nations didn't deal with it. And there
[3:01:50.740 --> 3:01:56.500]  may be some other thing they're about to release. That's my mind. The gut is is just stalled.
[3:01:56.500 --> 3:02:01.940]  It's not speculation. It's your it's your subconscious best guess. But then if you consciously try
[3:02:01.940 --> 3:02:08.060]  to analyze the subconscious, you're like, I don't know why. But I've learned it's it's
[3:02:08.060 --> 3:02:18.060]  never wrong. So that's where I am right now. And you can see the pre preparation for this
[3:02:18.060 --> 3:02:24.340]  crisis. You can see it. So you know it's fake. Does it mean the virus is fake? Does it mean
[3:02:24.340 --> 3:02:30.980]  it's real? Does it mean we don't know we see the pre preparation? They can't help that.
[3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:35.020]  That lets us know it's a major move. I think that's undoubtable. I don't think you can
[3:02:35.020 --> 3:02:38.700]  debate that. I don't think anybody watching or listening doesn't get hey, something's
[3:02:38.700 --> 3:02:49.180]  wrong here. This has been cooked up. It's easy to know it's cooked up. What's hard is to
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:58.980]  know what it is, though. Think about that. It's easy to know something as BS. But what
[3:02:58.980 --> 3:03:06.140]  is it? That's the question. Okay, so who's been holding the longest next now? Let's go
[3:03:06.140 --> 3:03:10.180]  to Victor in Texas. Victor, thank you. I'll go to Grace Saturday with others. Victor,
[3:03:10.180 --> 3:03:15.260]  what do you think's going on? Thanks for holding. All right, brother Jones, I got me a seven
[3:03:15.260 --> 3:03:22.220]  beds for 1000 people. Currently, this is a study that I saw at seven seven beds for
[3:03:22.220 --> 3:03:30.220]  1000 people. No strain. No strain on the hospital. When that demand increases. This is where
[3:03:30.220 --> 3:03:35.940]  the week. This is a weak link by a weapon. It was a multi headed deal. This is the POTUS
[3:03:35.940 --> 3:03:43.340]  buster. This one right here is also is a ping destroyer. This is to try and get a accessibility
[3:03:43.340 --> 3:03:52.180]  to 227 tons of gold that China has. You have no workers in China. I tend to disagree. I
[3:03:52.180 --> 3:03:57.260]  agree with Dr. Steve, because if there's no workers, there's no production. No production.
[3:03:57.260 --> 3:04:02.500]  There's no money. And China will create a global depression. And I don't I don't want
[3:04:02.500 --> 3:04:07.100]  to be the one that says that causes the panic. But what you said is true. So lying is something
[3:04:07.100 --> 3:04:14.100]  I won't do. I agree gut level. I'm really concerned. The economy dips. And then here's
[3:04:14.100 --> 3:04:22.420]  the thing. So then, uh, for Dr. Kinnick, he's doing what he does best, bro. He he he worked
[3:04:22.420 --> 3:04:29.700]  us right now. So I go with Mike. I go with you. No vaccines for nobody. I'm not taking
[3:04:29.700 --> 3:04:35.620]  them. This right now they're creating the fear factor. I believe in Jesus Christ and
[3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:41.300]  in silver and stuff that you have the canary in the in the coal mine. Hold on, Victor,
[3:04:41.300 --> 3:04:44.860]  don't look up. No, I mean, it's true. But Cheney, I think it's a good guy, but he came
[3:04:44.860 --> 3:04:48.940]  on and told us about. Don't worry, a vaccine is coming. Let's go. They think this is going
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:55.740]  to be serious. Stay with us. Well, it's here the year 2020. World governments out in the
[3:04:55.740 --> 3:04:59.780]  open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government
[3:04:59.780 --> 3:05:04.780]  as the answer. And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place. It's coordinated
[3:05:04.780 --> 3:05:11.260]  by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus
[3:05:11.260 --> 3:05:16.900]  and the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow. Yes. Now we know we're right. The new
[3:05:16.900 --> 3:05:21.260]  world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader real, but we're real as
[3:05:21.260 --> 3:05:25.100]  well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no. But I just want to make the
[3:05:25.100 --> 3:05:29.820]  point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas. We have never been in
[3:05:29.820 --> 3:05:35.380]  some small, little place that didn't matter. Everything we do, every decision we make governs
[3:05:35.380 --> 3:05:39.220]  the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to
[3:05:39.220 --> 3:05:42.420]  go through. So it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being
[3:05:42.420 --> 3:05:47.660]  aware and being involved. But just remember your action now via prayer, word of mouth
[3:05:47.660 --> 3:06:11.660]  and financial support of important.com is critical. So please take action. Live from Austin, Texas,
[3:06:11.660 --> 3:06:21.660]  Texas.
[3:06:21.660 --> 3:06:34.740]  You've made a lot of great points. I got the esoteric angles. What's your prime projection,
[3:06:34.740 --> 3:06:39.260]  your bottom line, Victor? All right. The very first thing we got to look out for is the
[3:06:39.260 --> 3:06:45.660]  first death that occurs in the colonists. When it happens here, this is when everything
[3:06:45.660 --> 3:06:50.820]  is going to break out. The first death, we haven't seen it yet. My target date, I look
[3:06:50.820 --> 3:06:58.620]  at the 15th of February and like I said, that will be the canary. Victor, what's your background?
[3:06:58.620 --> 3:07:05.380]  You sound like a really smart guy. I'm just retired and really tired. I got a lot of time
[3:07:05.380 --> 3:07:12.220]  to do research. Pastor Sam said something a couple of nights ago that really was very,
[3:07:12.220 --> 3:07:19.620]  very interesting. In another show that I listened to, he said that was this a race specific
[3:07:19.620 --> 3:07:25.260]  bio weapon? And this is why we need to see, if we see the first death, then we know that
[3:07:25.260 --> 3:07:30.580]  we're in trouble. If we don't see it, then we know that it was geared for the Asian
[3:07:30.580 --> 3:07:39.140]  people. Now, the thing is that when you can't know this because the HIPAA law, they won't
[3:07:39.140 --> 3:07:44.580]  release that information out to the public. No, you're right. Because most of these viruses
[3:07:44.580 --> 3:07:53.660]  are Chi-Com specific. And then there's another thing that people don't really realize. Everybody
[3:07:53.660 --> 3:08:01.060]  blames it on the Jews. Okay, I have no hate against them. But the Kaidon is a very elite
[3:08:01.060 --> 3:08:06.500]  massage group. And I believe they had something to do with it. You know, they were smiling
[3:08:06.500 --> 3:08:13.300]  at ching ching ping. And when they got in there, they were the ones that cost the release.
[3:08:13.300 --> 3:08:18.180]  I don't know how they did it. I don't know these things. I just see, I just see the the
[3:08:18.180 --> 3:08:25.420]  overall picture. They were the ones that did it. And now this is why this virus was not
[3:08:25.420 --> 3:08:31.660]  released in Brazil, like Mike said. They jumped the shark over there, but it was intentional.
[3:08:31.660 --> 3:08:37.620]  They did it on purpose because they need to get to 227 tons of gold that China has.
[3:08:37.620 --> 3:08:42.340]  Alright, brother, I appreciate you. Very interesting. Thank you. Okay, who's been home the next
[3:08:42.340 --> 3:08:46.500]  longest here? That'd be David in Tennessee. David, thank you so much for holding. We really
[3:08:46.500 --> 3:08:53.820]  appreciate you. Please tell us what you think about this. Hello, Alex. My first time, first
[3:08:53.820 --> 3:08:59.860]  time caller, been a listener for about three years. Thank you. And yeah, it's been a, it's
[3:08:59.860 --> 3:09:05.460]  been a pleasure to I was always kind of half awake and through myself fully awake, but
[3:09:05.460 --> 3:09:13.580]  through your show and in a certain event, such as Las Vegas and Epstein, etc. Come full
[3:09:13.580 --> 3:09:19.180]  circle. Yeah, Vegas was going to get out of their beginning. Yeah, it was it was nuts.
[3:09:19.180 --> 3:09:22.460]  And I just want to say for the past eight or nine months, I've been using your products
[3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:29.940]  and brain force plus ultra four ultra 12 and turbo force those really reenergize my life.
[3:09:29.940 --> 3:09:36.620]  Help me get off of a big farmers game changing because no one almost no one puts out real
[3:09:36.620 --> 3:09:41.060]  pharmaceutical great stuff we do. I mean, because I want you to want to buy it again.
[3:09:41.060 --> 3:09:46.220]  Plus, I mean, I metaphysically cannot screw you over. You understand? I can't. I can't
[3:09:46.220 --> 3:09:50.380]  sell out. It's not like I'm Mr. Goodie to shoot. I just cannot do it. So the products
[3:09:50.380 --> 3:09:56.020]  are the best we can get. I'll just say also the Krillin has been amazing. Just like you
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:10:01.780]  said, and also my 10 year old happen on Krillin because that stuff is hallucinogenic. Like
[3:10:01.780 --> 3:10:06.460]  I think like three of them before bed. Wow. Yeah, well, I'll tell you this. I got on a
[3:10:06.460 --> 3:10:10.620]  roll for my son because he's really smart, but he deals with ADHD. So instead of putting
[3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:14.300]  him on drugs, I put him on the honor roll and he cannot get enough of that stuff. I
[3:10:14.300 --> 3:10:18.300]  have to ration him out. He wants to take three or four of those things a day. I'm like, well,
[3:10:18.300 --> 3:10:22.100]  I'll let you take three. Let's take two or three. Let's not use the whole bottle. Who
[3:10:22.100 --> 3:10:26.980]  would know that the very essence of a fish in the beautiful ocean, our brain just drinks
[3:10:26.980 --> 3:10:31.900]  it up. Yeah, it's fantastic. Well, I used to live in Tokyo for eight years and I got
[3:10:31.900 --> 3:10:36.500]  a lot of fish oil there. Of course, you got to be careful eating raw. It's mercury filled.
[3:10:36.500 --> 3:10:41.180]  The difference is ours is mercury free. That's supplement my diet here. But yeah, what I
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:47.260]  caught about today, um, I travel often on business to East Asia, including China. Um,
[3:10:47.260 --> 3:10:51.780]  but most recently I was in Taiwan and then in Japan for eight and a half years. And I'll
[3:10:51.780 --> 3:10:56.980]  tell you, if this gets out in places like Japan, it's a game over. Um, I'm not saying
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:11:02.980]  that it will. Um, and it does look like the death rate is lower than it might have been.
[3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:07.220]  I think it's a serious issue because if you look at places like Japan, everybody trust
[3:11:07.220 --> 3:11:11.500]  the government for everything. You've got 10 plus million riders on the Metro, a city
[3:11:11.500 --> 3:11:18.980]  of 37 plus million in Tokyo. Um, and it's heard the news recently where 200, um, Japanese,
[3:11:18.980 --> 3:11:24.900]  uh, were, uh, he backed back to Tokyo. You've got a bus driver that, um, has contracted
[3:11:24.900 --> 3:11:29.740]  the disease, um, from people from. Clearly it's out there. It's a time bomb. The question
[3:11:29.740 --> 3:11:34.980]  is, is it a hoax or is it as deadly as they say? Because if it's deadly as they say,
[3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:39.540]  this is 2020. This is the takedown of nations. This is the global crisis. This is the big
[3:11:39.540 --> 3:11:46.620]  enchilada. Thank you so much, David. All right. Next holding the longest would be Grace
[3:11:46.620 --> 3:11:51.980]  in New York, Grace, ER nurse on virus hospital for bearing. Thanks for holding. I really
[3:11:51.980 --> 3:11:57.020]  thank you for that. Go ahead. Hi, uh, just wanted to call you. I'm an ER nurse here in
[3:11:57.020 --> 3:12:04.300]  New York. Thank you. And we are getting ready. They have, uh, given us a whole bunch of PPE
[3:12:04.300 --> 3:12:09.540]  to wear and we have set up different areas in our triage area and we are just screening
[3:12:09.540 --> 3:12:13.820]  people and first checking to see if they've traveled anywhere and then trying to separate
[3:12:13.820 --> 3:12:19.340]  them. We think we've had cases, but we don't have the test in yet. So we can't tell 100
[3:12:19.340 --> 3:12:25.300]  percent if, um, we're just diagnosing if we've had any cases. You elaborate because Mike
[3:12:25.300 --> 3:12:30.580]  Adams owns a diagnostic lab and I checked it. I respect Mike, but I checked it. They're
[3:12:30.580 --> 3:12:34.300]  not setting the genetic code of the virus. I don't even know they have it for the, for
[3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:40.500]  the labs to test. Can you talk, speak to that? So what, from my understanding is that we,
[3:12:40.500 --> 3:12:45.940]  we don't have the exact test for it. We've just been diagnosing as viral pneumonia. So
[3:12:45.940 --> 3:12:50.300]  we don't know if that's what it is, but we've been isolating those patients that we. So,
[3:12:50.300 --> 3:12:53.860]  so speak your mind because you're the expert, but are you seeing an increase in what you
[3:12:53.860 --> 3:13:00.780]  call viral pneumonia? Yes. Absolutely. Wow. Speak to that please. Respiratory problems.
[3:13:00.780 --> 3:13:06.220]  We were told not to go within four feet for a long period next to these patients and we
[3:13:06.220 --> 3:13:13.180]  were in N95 duckbill mask and usual PPE if we don't, uh, contaminate other patients.
[3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:17.700]  So we suit up almost like a bowl of the not quite. If the patient, if the patient is to
[3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:21.900]  be confirmed, I haven't seen one yet. We would put on a full, um, like what you would see
[3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:26.380]  on TV, like I have met you with a respirator on it. Um, and then we would have to decontaminate
[3:13:26.380 --> 3:13:31.780]  coming out of the room because it is easily spread, especially with the elderly and children
[3:13:31.780 --> 3:13:39.420]  were looking out for the most. So, so what I say about this call nurse talks about coronavirus
[3:13:39.420 --> 3:13:48.300]  training in the US. So we did, um, when Ebola was a big deal, we did all kinds of training.
[3:13:48.300 --> 3:13:52.540]  We would have every shift. They would have like a pretend patient come in and we would
[3:13:52.540 --> 3:13:57.140]  suit up into the whole costume that you see. And then we have, we only have most hospitals
[3:13:57.140 --> 3:14:04.100]  only have like three or four isolation rooms in the ER for it. Uh, so they have, uh, a stand
[3:14:04.100 --> 3:14:09.500]  by tent set up that we can spring up pretty quickly. If a lot of cases confirmed cases
[3:14:09.500 --> 3:14:14.700]  come in or suspected cases come in, uh, but we're not fully set up where we can take hundreds
[3:14:14.700 --> 3:14:19.140]  of patients by any means is kind of frightening. That part is, and a lot of doctors and nurses
[3:14:19.140 --> 3:14:26.980]  are starting to call out. So, um, you know, the healthcare staffing is an issue as well.
[3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:31.180]  Gut level. What are the staff saying? Do they believe the coronavirus is in your area or
[3:14:31.180 --> 3:14:34.780]  are they thinking it's coming or they think this is just training? We've had it already.
[3:14:34.780 --> 3:14:38.980]  Yeah. We think we've, we think that, uh, they've isolated some patients once they went up to
[3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:44.380]  the ICU in these negative pressure room circles. And they think that we have, that we just
[3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:51.900]  haven't gotten the full test to confirm yet. So New York nurse believes coronavirus is
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:58.140]  in the big apple. Yes, absolutely. I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be shocked at all if
[3:14:58.140 --> 3:15:01.820]  they said that we've actually taken care of it. Well, let me ask you this and the whole
[3:15:01.820 --> 3:15:06.740]  music guys. I want to get this answer. I don't like they hype it, but then they say it's
[3:15:06.740 --> 3:15:12.020]  no big deal. Gut level. What do you guys, is this really a serious virus? Is this hype
[3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:18.980]  or what is this? It's very scary because it, it, you don't, you don't touch anybody to
[3:15:18.980 --> 3:15:22.300]  get it. You, if you do touch somebody, you can get it, but it's just leaving the air.
[3:15:22.300 --> 3:15:26.940]  It's usually, it's something like this usually transmitted through droplets in the air, but
[3:15:26.940 --> 3:15:33.420]  because it's just straight up air, that's scary because it's so easily to catch it.
[3:15:33.420 --> 3:15:37.620]  It's so easy. Even I'm worried even going from patient to patient because I can get
[3:15:37.620 --> 3:15:42.420]  it on my, on my clothing or if I don't cover everything completely, I can actually carry
[3:15:42.420 --> 3:15:47.660]  it into the next area. Wow. So, so this could be the big one. Wow. Thank you, Grace. You're
[3:15:47.660 --> 3:15:50.620]  amazing. More calls straight ahead than my guns.

[3:20:57.380 --> 3:21:00.940]  to come in here and probably do some three or four hour commercial free shows and just
[3:21:00.940 --> 3:21:06.140]  take calls because I'm not kissing the caller's ass. I feel criminal making them hold. These
[3:21:06.140 --> 3:21:12.700]  callers have been incredible. I mean, they've been in who none they've been. I mean, at
[3:21:12.700 --> 3:21:16.940]  the military bases, they've been and you hear how you hear them. You just know it's credible.
[3:21:16.940 --> 3:21:21.380]  I mean, plus we have the data, but it's just like, whoa, this isn't some Netflix horror
[3:21:21.380 --> 3:21:27.140]  movie. This is a real world. So you've got my commitment tonight and tomorrow. When I
[3:21:27.140 --> 3:21:32.900]  come in here, I'm not going to listen to myself talk. I'm going to take calls from the minute
[3:21:32.900 --> 3:21:37.340]  the show starts tomorrow on what you're seeing around the world and what you think's going
[3:21:37.340 --> 3:21:44.700]  on because you are human. You are the intelligence. You are the resistance to this global system.
[3:21:44.700 --> 3:21:50.260]  Sean, Angel, Martin and Sarah will finish up with you guys before we end this hour.
[3:21:50.260 --> 3:21:55.300]  Sarah is law enforcement officer, pharma tech on vaccines. Sarah, God bless you. Give us
[3:21:55.300 --> 3:22:00.540]  your take on things. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, honored to speak with you today. Can you hear
[3:22:00.540 --> 3:22:06.140]  me all right? I hear you close for crystal. All right. Perfect. Um, yeah. So long time
[3:22:06.140 --> 3:22:12.420]  listener. I've been listening to you for a year or not to take too long. Um, just,
[3:22:12.420 --> 3:22:16.420]  no, you're not. Just think right on your mind. It was clear and broke up. No, take
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:20.580]  your time. You've been holding for an hour. Tell us what's happening. Perfect. Okay. Well,
[3:22:20.580 --> 3:22:25.260]  I just wanted to let you know. So I am a work in law enforcement in Florida here and we
[3:22:25.260 --> 3:22:31.420]  just got a report yesterday that a school had closed down because of a possible exposure.
[3:22:31.420 --> 3:22:36.940]  Interestingly, this school has connections to a United Nations program in Yale University.
[3:22:36.940 --> 3:22:42.340]  We're still waiting to hear back on results of whether the students are have tested positive.
[3:22:42.340 --> 3:22:47.940]  But as of right now, we have one full school that is closed down. Um, I work in the area.
[3:22:47.940 --> 3:22:51.660]  That is international news. You've been holding for an hour to say that you're saying is law
[3:22:51.660 --> 3:22:58.260]  enforcement in Florida. There is a school shut down potentially because of this right
[3:22:58.260 --> 3:23:04.260]  now. That is incredible. Yes, that's, that's correct. Um, and I found it interesting that
[3:23:04.260 --> 3:23:09.220]  it has ties to the United Nations in Yale. That's huge. So we got plenty of time to talk
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:14.860]  to you. Specifically, you tell us what school district so we can look into it. Yeah, so
[3:23:14.860 --> 3:23:21.100]  the school is located in Palm Beach, which is about 45 minutes north of Miami. It's called
[3:23:21.100 --> 3:23:28.860]  the Benjamin School. They had a Chinese student come from that area of China and speak to
[3:23:28.860 --> 3:23:33.860]  a group of students. They had been involved in a United Nations panel or some kind of
[3:23:33.860 --> 3:23:39.740]  a program. And by the way, the Sun Sentinel is reporting what you're saying right now.
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:45.940]  Yes. Yeah. So it is, you know, it kind of it broke yesterday late afternoon. Let me just
[3:23:45.940 --> 3:23:53.820]  stop you. It freaks me out how the callers are like 99% accurate. She just called in
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:59.620]  we, we, it's already in the news. So sorry to interrupt you. Please continue. No, no,
[3:23:59.620 --> 3:24:03.860]  that's fine. And so I personally work in the Miami area. So as you know, we have, we are
[3:24:03.860 --> 3:24:08.260]  hosting the Super Bowl. So not only is law enforcement super heightened right now about
[3:24:08.260 --> 3:24:12.660]  all the security issues, but we have tons of thousands of people coming in from all over
[3:24:12.660 --> 3:24:20.380]  the world. And it's a recipe for disaster. It really is. Yeah. And like you said, you
[3:24:20.380 --> 3:24:24.700]  know, I think it's this is something really fishy. I mean, we definitely don't know what
[3:24:24.700 --> 3:24:29.260]  they're planning. But what do you think though? What are people because I, I don't know what's
[3:24:29.260 --> 3:24:36.300]  what do you think's going on? You know, I think that, you know, as of right now, a lot
[3:24:36.300 --> 3:24:41.860]  of people aren't too concerned in this area from what I've heard. But I, I think that
[3:24:41.860 --> 3:24:45.940]  like your other caller was said, once somebody dies here in the U S or once we start seeing
[3:24:45.940 --> 3:24:50.940]  a number spike, there's going to be immense panic. I mean, as you guys were reporting
[3:24:50.940 --> 3:24:56.220]  all the N 95 masks are selling out, you know, people are starting to gather all their supplies.
[3:24:56.220 --> 3:25:02.420]  Miami is just a soup pot basically for best during this disease with everyone that we
[3:25:02.420 --> 3:25:06.540]  have constantly coming into our borders and international flights. And then of course
[3:25:06.540 --> 3:25:12.540]  with the Super Bowl. So I ordered a bunch of N 95 masks myself the other day, just in
[3:25:12.540 --> 3:25:19.460]  case. But I think I think it could be, you know, like you said, a recipe for disaster
[3:25:19.460 --> 3:25:26.780]  in closing. And I appreciate you Sarah holding to talk about this. Talking to other colleagues,
[3:25:26.780 --> 3:25:32.980]  what are they thinks going on? You know, a lot of them, I think are trying to hold back
[3:25:32.980 --> 3:25:37.660]  on their fear of like, this could be, you know, a pandemic. So I think they're trying
[3:25:37.660 --> 3:25:41.340]  to laugh it off and talk it off because they don't want to accept the fact that this could
[3:25:41.340 --> 3:25:47.460]  be something super serious. And I hope they're right, by the way, I don't need to. And I
[3:25:47.460 --> 3:25:52.140]  know I don't have a lot of time, but I'd like to talk to you either offline or with one
[3:25:52.140 --> 3:25:58.140]  of your crew, but I have information regarding how Novartis, a pharmaceutical company that
[3:25:58.140 --> 3:26:04.420]  uses vaccines has been relabeling all the ones that they don't use. And they relabel
[3:26:04.420 --> 3:26:08.420]  them. And so people are getting vaccinated with the flu vaccine and other vaccines that
[3:26:08.420 --> 3:26:15.140]  are years old, which also is, I believe, you know, I know they do that because whatever
[3:26:15.140 --> 3:26:20.380]  the new vaccine is, it never covers the latest mutation. But you're saying, well, guys, here's
[3:26:20.380 --> 3:26:24.700]  my problem. I've got such a thin crew. My biggest frustration is we can't respond to
[3:26:24.700 --> 3:26:29.860]  incredible intel like this. So yes, Rob do is obsessed with this because he really cares.
[3:26:29.860 --> 3:26:33.780]  He's interviewed a lot of people who victimize will give you your name and number to Rob.
[3:26:33.780 --> 3:26:39.260]  I'll call you to today, Sarah. I promise you're amazing. God bless you. Thank you, Sarah.
[3:26:39.260 --> 3:26:43.860]  Get Sarah's name and number and let's let's talk to them because I had my pediatrician
[3:26:43.860 --> 3:26:50.020]  for my children. I've got three children, four, I got four children, three of my first
[3:26:50.020 --> 3:26:56.540]  wife and one of my new wife. But this guy owned the big pediatrics clinic in Austin,
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:27:01.980]  you know, like all over the town, like 10 clinics. And he comes to me. It's more today,
[3:27:01.980 --> 3:27:07.100]  more than 10 clinics. And he goes, we're putting cancer viruses in these. We're giving them
[3:27:07.100 --> 3:27:17.020]  the Simeon virus 40 in the polio. And I go, well, that's been illegal since 1972. He goes,
[3:27:17.020 --> 3:27:22.340]  you know that? He goes, exactly. He goes, we shouldn't be giving oral anyways. We're
[3:27:22.340 --> 3:27:29.460]  giving children cancer virus that causes cancer. And I said, I know, and he this is a big guy.
[3:27:29.460 --> 3:27:35.740]  He grabs you by the arm. He goes, you don't tell anybody I told you that. And I went,
[3:27:35.740 --> 3:27:42.340]  dude, I already know that. And I said, and get your get your arm up my hand. He backed
[3:27:42.340 --> 3:27:47.320]  off, but it wasn't a tough guy moment. He like set it as a human to me and then got
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:55.820]  scared right after. And that guy is the biggest owner. He was the biggest owner of pediatrics
[3:27:55.820 --> 3:28:02.700]  clinics in Austin. And man, he was a big guy. He grabbed my arm and he said, you vote him
[3:28:02.700 --> 3:28:06.700]  not. And I said, I pulled back and I said, man, you just told me, but I said, I already
[3:28:06.700 --> 3:28:12.340]  know that. And I actually don't want to act up. And I said, I'll beat your ass, man. Let's
[3:28:12.340 --> 3:28:15.140]  go. He backed. I mean, because I'm not going to take some dude doing that. You know what
[3:28:15.140 --> 3:28:19.580]  I mean? Like, okay, you want to back it down to the globalist. You want to fight? But it
[3:28:19.580 --> 3:28:25.260]  was a big old frickin rich millionaire doctor. Like, oh, God, we're giving them cancer viruses.
[3:28:25.260 --> 3:28:29.460]  And I'm like, what's the yes. He's like, grab money. You better not tell anybody. And I
[3:28:29.460 --> 3:28:32.620]  said, you better get your hand off my arm. Yeah. He's like, Oh, really? And I said, yeah,
[3:28:32.620 --> 3:28:37.500]  I'm about to stomp your ass in the ground. Let's not talk, man. That's what we do. But
[3:28:37.500 --> 3:28:43.340]  I don't want to beat his ass. I want him to go public. And I'm so close to saying his
[3:28:43.340 --> 3:28:48.940]  name. I'm that close because he didn't provide us though it before. My God, I'm about to

[3:30:52.540 --> 3:31:00.180]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high quality, organic vitamin D3,
[3:31:00.180 --> 3:31:05.460]  vitamin K combo. Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring, that
[3:31:05.460 --> 3:31:11.220]  people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs, and
[3:31:11.220 --> 3:31:16.300]  then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly
[3:31:16.300 --> 3:31:20.980]  viruses that are wreaking havoc out there. It's on record that you've got to have this
[3:31:20.980 --> 3:31:26.580]  to live, not just to defend against these viruses. So right now, we have Winter Sun
[3:31:26.580 --> 3:31:30.380]  still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter
[3:31:30.380 --> 3:31:37.980]  and spring. I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the
[3:31:37.980 --> 3:31:42.820]  fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize
[3:31:42.820 --> 3:31:47.780]  you protecting yourself and your family. So Winter Sun, taken out of the tongue, super
[3:31:47.780 --> 3:31:52.620]  high quality, 40% off, available now at infohorsestore.com.

[3:33:13.500 --> 3:33:21.460]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[3:33:21.460 --> 3:33:30.540]  All right, Mike Adams has taken over, naturalnews.com, and then we've got the war room that I'm
[3:33:30.540 --> 3:33:35.580]  going to be hosting. Because Owen is sick. We hope it isn't the coronavirus, 3 p.m. central,
[3:33:35.580 --> 3:33:41.860]  in about 30 minutes. But I swore to take these calls. So real fast, Sean in Florida, paramedic,
[3:33:41.860 --> 3:33:46.140]  possible related info, coronavirus locally. Go ahead.
[3:33:46.140 --> 3:33:52.260]  Hey, Alex. Great to hear you. Like I said, I am a paramedic in Florida, and I've been
[3:33:52.260 --> 3:33:54.580]  doing your, can you hear me? Yes, sir.
[3:33:54.580 --> 3:33:59.220]  Oh, wow, it got really quiet. Okay. I've been doing iodine for about a year now, and when
[3:33:59.220 --> 3:34:03.220]  I was doing my due diligence, trying to figure out the ins and outs of it, I came across
[3:34:03.220 --> 3:34:12.900]  a study that in 1945, that was a study with mice in the effects of iodine. And I believe
[3:34:12.900 --> 3:34:16.340]  it's Spanish influenza, but I'm not sure. They put them in a box with basically a miss
[3:34:16.340 --> 3:34:22.020]  of nothing but influenza. They put a dab of iodine on their nose. None of them got sick.
[3:34:22.020 --> 3:34:27.740]  So for about a year now, as part of my standard procedures, all I do is I put a little inside
[3:34:27.740 --> 3:34:33.260]  my nostrils every day in the morning. I haven't had even a twinge of, like, a throat tickle
[3:34:33.260 --> 3:34:35.740]  in over a year now.
[3:34:35.740 --> 3:34:39.940]  Iodine is magic, brother. I mean, it's the building block to so much of the body, and
[3:34:39.940 --> 3:34:44.340]  I have seen some of what you're talking about in studies. It's really incredible. What is
[3:34:44.340 --> 3:34:48.060]  your view on the related info on the coronavirus?
[3:34:48.060 --> 3:34:53.820]  Honestly, you know, we're all gearing up. I mean, we're carrying Tyvek suits and SCBA
[3:34:53.820 --> 3:35:01.580]  now, and we disinfect the ambulances between patients way more diligently. I do really
[3:35:01.580 --> 3:35:06.580]  believe that this is probably going to blow over, kind of like Steve said, but you can
[3:35:06.580 --> 3:35:12.220]  hope for that, but you've got a plan for it, and everybody is gearing up, and it's just
[3:35:12.220 --> 3:35:14.340]  going down that route like that.
[3:35:14.340 --> 3:35:20.420]  Well, thank you for the intel, Sean. Thanks for holding. Mike Adams is about to take over.
[3:35:20.420 --> 3:35:25.820]  Let's go to Martin in Ohio, a student, Miami University, two students are now being tested.
[3:35:25.820 --> 3:35:29.700]  We keep your calls from Florida, Florida, Florida. Real quick, Martin, what's going
[3:35:29.700 --> 3:35:30.700]  on?
[3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:35.100]  Yeah, I just wanted to provide, I can provide some confirmation and further details on what
[3:35:35.100 --> 3:35:40.220]  John was saying earlier. So the details on that is they sent out, I'm a part-time student
[3:35:40.220 --> 3:35:48.460]  at Miami. They sent out an email to the entire university yesterday saying that two students,
[3:35:48.460 --> 3:35:55.940]  one was presented, one presenting to the Student Health Center with symptoms and being with
[3:35:55.940 --> 3:36:02.500]  them from China. They met the qualifications to be screened for the coronavirus. So they
[3:36:02.500 --> 3:36:08.140]  sent those tests to the CDC. They're waiting on those test results to come back now, but
[3:36:08.140 --> 3:36:14.220]  those, that one student who had the symptoms along with his roommate, who's also Chinese,
[3:36:14.220 --> 3:36:17.420]  are being quarantined in an off-campus apartment at the moment.
[3:36:17.420 --> 3:36:22.380]  Well, it's crazy as whatever callers call in with, we search it and boom, it's right
[3:36:22.380 --> 3:36:27.340]  there in the news. So incredibly accurate callers. What do you think's going on?
[3:36:27.340 --> 3:36:33.220]  I mean, I know Miami's got about a 7% of their student population is Chinese international
[3:36:33.220 --> 3:36:39.860]  students and I know we have some from Wuhan. So that's not all that comforting. I'd like
[3:36:39.860 --> 3:36:43.820]  to ask the administration about it, but they don't really talk to me. They're not my biggest
[3:36:43.820 --> 3:36:48.860]  fans because they kind of know who I am.
[3:36:48.860 --> 3:36:53.060]  Martin, thank you so much for the call and thanks for holding. Angel, and then Mike Adams
[3:36:53.060 --> 3:36:58.860]  takes over. Angel, general callers, CDC hasn't released any statements. That's a good point.
[3:36:58.860 --> 3:36:59.860]  Go ahead.
[3:36:59.860 --> 3:37:06.500]  Exactly. Yes, sir. Yeah, I'm down. I'm a Desert Storm veteran, 1991 disabled veteran.
[3:37:06.500 --> 3:37:10.420]  And they haven't been really talking much down here in Atlanta about it because I mean,
[3:37:10.420 --> 3:37:15.460]  I've been listening to you for about 14 years. And you know, Alex, you knell it on the head
[3:37:15.460 --> 3:37:20.820]  with Dr. Picenic, I'm 50-50 on that. And I'm more with you on your side, but I feel,
[3:37:20.820 --> 3:37:24.940]  I mean, I mean, I'm asking you the question, could you also think this is a test and they're
[3:37:24.940 --> 3:37:29.460]  testing us to see how we react to this, to these situations, the flu and we have the
[3:37:29.460 --> 3:37:30.960]  coronavirus now?
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:34.340]  That's what I think. I think it's a globalist test. That's what I've said.
[3:37:34.340 --> 3:37:38.100]  Exactly. And, you know, this is the whole thing that I'm saying because I worked with
[3:37:38.100 --> 3:37:42.780]  some Africans from Sierra Leone for about 10 years at a tire shop. And even back then,
[3:37:42.780 --> 3:37:47.020]  when the Ebola did break out, they were still sending people in because they were taking
[3:37:47.020 --> 3:37:51.180]  bringing people to the shop as soon as they got off the airplane. And I'm literally about
[3:37:51.180 --> 3:37:56.700]  less than four miles from the airport straight down the road. So, you know, I wanted, you
[3:37:56.700 --> 3:38:00.620]  know, I had told a lot of people I wanted to try to be a reporter for you here in Atlanta.
[3:38:00.620 --> 3:38:04.500]  So that way I can get everything taken care of and get all the news out because the CDC
[3:38:04.500 --> 3:38:08.580]  down here, it just seems like they're not really trying to concentrate on what's going
[3:38:08.580 --> 3:38:12.660]  on or any prevention procedures or anything we need to carry on.
[3:38:12.660 --> 3:38:16.700]  Well, brother, God bless you. Let's hear your name and number. Thank you, sir, for holding.
[3:38:16.700 --> 3:38:19.700]  Mike Adams, who was supposed to be on the whole hour, I appreciate him holding, takes
[3:38:19.700 --> 3:38:23.580]  over right now. If the rest of the segment of the next naturalnews.com, then I'm going
[3:38:23.580 --> 3:38:28.100]  to be hosting the first of the War Room with Owen Schreuer in FullWars.com, Board's Last
[3:38:28.100 --> 3:38:31.700]  Show, Band.Video. Mike Adams, take over.
[3:38:31.700 --> 3:38:36.540]  Well, incredible callers today, Alex. And in fact, if you hadn't taken all the calls
[3:38:36.540 --> 3:38:40.780]  on the board, I was going to insist that we do as well because the callers are bringing
[3:38:40.780 --> 3:38:46.540]  in remarkable information from all over the United States. Now, my phone has been ringing.
[3:38:46.540 --> 3:38:51.460]  People are texting me and demanding that I correct Dr. Pechenik's misinformation from
[3:38:51.460 --> 3:38:57.860]  the last hour. I respect Dr. Pechenik. He's highly intelligent. He has done more in his
[3:38:57.860 --> 3:39:03.060]  life than most human beings ever will. Not attacking him personally, but this is not
[3:39:03.060 --> 3:39:09.500]  his area of expertise. And what he said on the show an hour ago was incorrect information
[3:39:09.500 --> 3:39:15.220]  and I will logically and scientifically lay out the corrections to that information in
[3:39:15.220 --> 3:39:19.420]  the next segment here. But what we need to be aware of here is the
[3:39:19.420 --> 3:39:24.820]  callers today. We had one caller who called in and said the CDC is not testing secondary
[3:39:24.820 --> 3:39:29.580]  infections of people in the United States who did not travel to the Wuhan province.
[3:39:29.580 --> 3:39:35.200]  This is absolutely key. As I said yesterday on the show, the CDC is backlogged for weeks
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:39.340]  on testing these samples. And there was a nurse in New York who called in the show today
[3:39:39.340 --> 3:39:44.500]  and said that they're not even being provided the testing kits. China is artificially keeping
[3:39:44.500 --> 3:39:49.460]  the numbers low by creating scarcity of testing kits. That's been reported by the Epoch Times
[3:39:49.460 --> 3:39:54.700]  and South China Morning Post as well as Breitbart.com by the way. Everything that I tell you here
[3:39:54.700 --> 3:40:02.420]  is rooted in cited news, scientific studies, biological reality. I don't stand here and
[3:40:02.420 --> 3:40:06.380]  have to invent anything because it's all in the media. It's just that most people don't
[3:40:06.380 --> 3:40:11.780]  do the research. But what these callers are saying here is that the situation in America
[3:40:11.780 --> 3:40:15.980]  is far worse than what's being officially announced. There are far more than five or
[3:40:15.980 --> 3:40:21.140]  six people who are infected right now at this moment. And it's hitting the universities.
[3:40:21.140 --> 3:40:27.100]  It's the returning students from the Wuhan province. And when they infect other students,
[3:40:27.100 --> 3:40:31.460]  those students in those universities are not being tested by the CDC because the current
[3:40:31.460 --> 3:40:36.180]  rule is no testing for people who did not travel directly to Wuhan province or Wuhan
[3:40:36.180 --> 3:40:41.700]  city in a larger province. So think about this. Given the high transmissivity rate of
[3:40:41.700 --> 3:40:46.420]  this virus, we know that according to the Lancet, 83% of those who are exposed to this
[3:40:46.420 --> 3:40:50.460]  are infected. We know that it can be spread through casual contacts such as just shaking
[3:40:50.460 --> 3:40:54.900]  hands or touching a surface that someone else touched. Another healthcare worker called
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:40:57.660]  into the show today and confirmed that it's spread through the air. It doesn't have to
[3:40:57.660 --> 3:41:03.100]  be droplets. It can just be, I think she said, regular air where there's an infected patient
[3:41:03.100 --> 3:41:07.940]  in the room and then there are new people getting infected. Because of this, mark my
[3:41:07.940 --> 3:41:15.220]  words, there are right now in America, American students who are infected with this coronavirus
[3:41:15.220 --> 3:41:20.140]  who are not being tested and who are not even yet aware that they have symptoms because
[3:41:20.140 --> 3:41:28.220]  this is a symptomless incubation period of up to 14 days. And during that period, unlike
[3:41:28.220 --> 3:41:33.060]  Ebola, during that period with coronavirus, you can spread the disease to other people
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:37.180]  even when you yourself are not aware that you have it. And that's a huge difference
[3:41:37.180 --> 3:41:42.740]  with Ebola. Ebola has a very high fatality rate. In fact, it's so high that no one survives
[3:41:42.740 --> 3:41:47.580]  long enough to spread it. This is a key point to understand when you look at microbiology
[3:41:47.580 --> 3:41:53.580]  or virology or epidemiology. High fatality rates do not create a bioweapon because it
[3:41:53.580 --> 3:41:58.180]  kills people too quickly to spread it. And Ebola's symptoms are very abundant. You can't
[3:41:58.180 --> 3:42:04.020]  miss it when someone is bleeding out of their eyes. You can't miss it. But with coronavirus,
[3:42:04.020 --> 3:42:08.700]  the symptoms are not present. And we know from the Lancet study also that 2% of those
[3:42:08.700 --> 3:42:13.860]  who are infected showed no symptoms of fever, no symptoms of respiratory distress, which
[3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:17.980]  means they can move right through airport security and pass through the screening that's
[3:42:17.980 --> 3:42:22.620]  being put in place all over the country. 2% of those who are infected will pass through
[3:42:22.620 --> 3:42:28.700]  airport screening. That means this is not being contained. Now, there are many other
[3:42:28.700 --> 3:42:32.500]  facts that you need to be aware of. We've covered some of it yesterday, but I have new information
[3:42:32.500 --> 3:42:37.740]  today. We've got one more segment coming up here on Infowars. Stay with me. This is Mike
[3:42:37.740 --> 3:42:42.220]  Adams, the Health Ranger. I'll bring you those facts after this short break. We will
[3:42:42.220 --> 3:42:46.460]  cover the information that you have not yet been told. We'll be right back after this
[3:42:46.460 --> 3:42:53.460]  break with all those answers and more.
[3:43:16.460 --> 3:43:41.740]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out a tax and then
[3:43:41.740 --> 3:43:48.740]  explain you what we've done with Alex Joe's blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[3:43:48.740 --> 3:43:55.500]  Hey, oh, come on. Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing
[3:43:55.500 --> 3:44:01.260]  pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[3:44:01.260 --> 3:44:07.580]  symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory
[3:44:07.580 --> 3:44:14.020]  function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:44:14.020 --> 3:44:19.460]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect
[3:44:19.460 --> 3:44:24.380]  in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast
[3:44:24.380 --> 3:44:29.660]  acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is
[3:44:29.660 --> 3:44:35.220]  natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it
[3:44:35.220 --> 3:44:40.100]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies
[3:44:40.100 --> 3:44:46.140]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:44:46.140 --> 3:44:52.220]  Head to info wars life dot com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:44:52.220 --> 3:44:57.460]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars. Your support and
[3:44:57.460 --> 3:45:03.660]  your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny
[3:45:03.660 --> 3:45:09.020]  has really caught hold, not just in the US but worldwide. And President Trump's fearlessness
[3:45:09.020 --> 3:45:15.020]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well. He's still lacking
[3:45:15.020 --> 3:45:20.060]  on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but trying
[3:45:20.060 --> 3:45:24.420]  to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China. Trump's been
[3:45:24.420 --> 3:45:29.980]  doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being
[3:45:29.980 --> 3:45:36.100]  targeted because we are effective. And the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:45:36.100 --> 3:45:40.220]  against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[3:45:40.220 --> 3:45:45.140]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[3:45:45.140 --> 3:45:50.380]  at us. That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused
[3:45:50.380 --> 3:45:56.380]  and stay happy. We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in
[3:45:56.380 --> 3:46:01.100]  China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out. We know the virus has already
[3:46:01.100 --> 3:46:06.580]  spread to more than a dozen countries. And many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed
[3:46:06.580 --> 3:46:11.860]  to be arriving on the United States West Coast. We've now confirmed from major food suppliers
[3:46:11.860 --> 3:46:16.260]  across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods because
[3:46:16.260 --> 3:46:20.700]  of institutional and governmental buyers. That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite,
[3:46:20.700 --> 3:46:25.900]  big corporations are now buying up food storage at alarming rates. In full wars, private labels
[3:46:25.900 --> 3:46:30.540]  from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory. They called and
[3:46:30.540 --> 3:46:34.740]  let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a
[3:46:34.740 --> 3:46:39.180]  few weeks and that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven
[3:46:39.180 --> 3:46:43.900]  to 10 days. But if people wait, it may end up being longer. But if you get your order
[3:46:43.900 --> 3:46:55.860]  in now at infowarstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[3:46:55.860 --> 3:47:12.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Mike
[3:47:12.020 --> 3:47:19.660]  Adams. All right, we're continuing here on the Alex Jones show, Mike Adams. And thank
[3:47:19.660 --> 3:47:24.820]  you for tuning in. This is the final segment for today. And then Alex takes over at the
[3:47:24.820 --> 3:47:30.340]  war room with an old shawyer out for today, I believe due to sickness. Now, as I mentioned
[3:47:30.340 --> 3:47:35.540]  in the in the previous segment, I'm going to cover what I believe was bad information
[3:47:35.540 --> 3:47:40.860]  given to you by a previous guest. But look, I want to mention I have the greatest respect
[3:47:40.860 --> 3:47:46.580]  for Dr. Steve Piccini. He's a highly intelligent person. He is a patriot. And the way that
[3:47:46.580 --> 3:47:53.060]  you know that the the news here on info wars is real is because sometimes guests disagree.
[3:47:53.060 --> 3:47:58.700]  But none of us can be experts in all areas. And Dr. Piccini is an expert on US history
[3:47:58.700 --> 3:48:03.860]  and and political coups in foreign countries and and the way the the military and the deep
[3:48:03.860 --> 3:48:10.020]  state work to accomplish their specific goals. He's an expert in all those areas. And I'm
[3:48:10.020 --> 3:48:13.980]  not an expert in those areas. I don't I don't challenge him to a debate over the history
[3:48:13.980 --> 3:48:21.860]  of political coups. I'm an expert in these areas of lab analytics. I am a scientist.
[3:48:21.860 --> 3:48:26.500]  I'm a published scientist in these areas. I understand microbiology. I have millions
[3:48:26.500 --> 3:48:31.900]  of dollars of lab equipment that I run every day in an ISO credit to laboratory. And when
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:37.580]  I heard Dr. Piccini speaking, he was giving out a lot of just I'm sorry to say, but just
[3:48:37.580 --> 3:48:43.260]  bad, not true information about how things work in microbiology. So I feel a duty to
[3:48:43.260 --> 3:48:48.700]  correct that not an attack on him, not challenging his intelligence. He's a brilliant guy in
[3:48:48.700 --> 3:48:54.460]  many other areas. But when he said that he had coronavirus, and he said that he had treated
[3:48:54.460 --> 3:48:59.660]  it with antibiotics, and that he had successfully overcome it with antibiotics, right there,
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:05.060]  it's a major red flag. Every doctor in America knows that you can't treat viral pandemics
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:09.260]  with antibiotics. It doesn't work. And the reason it doesn't work is because viruses
[3:49:09.260 --> 3:49:15.340]  are not living. Viruses are not bacterial strains. They're very, very different. And
[3:49:15.340 --> 3:49:20.740]  Dr. Piccini also said that he thought this was what are my notes here in between a virus
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:28.140]  and a bacteria? Well, again, my apologies to everyone for pointing this out. It's just
[3:49:28.140 --> 3:49:33.740]  that it sounds like transgenderism among the liberals who think that boys can become girls
[3:49:33.740 --> 3:49:39.420]  and women can become men. If you think a virus can become a bacteria, I'm sorry, what is
[3:49:39.420 --> 3:49:45.180]  that trans viralism? It means you don't have baseline knowledge of basic biology and
[3:49:45.180 --> 3:49:50.700]  virology and epidemiology. Viruses and bacteria are completely different. Viruses are dead.
[3:49:50.700 --> 3:49:56.180]  Bacteria are living. Bacteria have cell membranes and cell walls and nucleoids and cytoplasm,
[3:49:56.180 --> 3:50:01.900]  and they have means of mobilization. They swim around. They respond to the environment.
[3:50:01.900 --> 3:50:06.500]  They are full functioning living creatures that are just a single cell. Viruses are nothing
[3:50:06.500 --> 3:50:11.780]  of the kind. Viruses are just fragments of RNA and DNA surrounded by protein, sometimes
[3:50:11.780 --> 3:50:17.300]  glycoproteins, for example, and they are not living and they do not respond to antibiotics.
[3:50:17.300 --> 3:50:22.900]  So when someone says that you can beat coronavirus with antibiotics, I'm sorry, that's very dangerous
[3:50:22.900 --> 3:50:28.380]  misinformation and it's not true. It's not true. Even the CDC would tell you that even
[3:50:28.380 --> 3:50:34.660]  a doctor, a mainstream doctor would tell you that this has to be beat through antivirals
[3:50:34.660 --> 3:50:38.420]  and they come from the world of natural medicine and also from pharmaceutical medicine. There
[3:50:38.420 --> 3:50:42.940]  are antivirals. Many of them are based on natural medicine, but also through quarantine
[3:50:42.940 --> 3:50:49.140]  and isolation. Isolation is the key to beating this pandemic, and that's why China has 56
[3:50:49.140 --> 3:50:53.180]  million people under quarantine. That's why flights are being canceled now by countries
[3:50:53.180 --> 3:50:59.380]  all over the world. To stop bringing it in, isolation is the only way to beat this. Now,
[3:50:59.380 --> 3:51:05.660]  let's talk about lethality versus transmissivity. A bioweapon that would be, quote, ideal for
[3:51:05.660 --> 3:51:12.140]  depopulation would have relatively low lethality and very high transmissivity. Why is that?
[3:51:12.140 --> 3:51:16.980]  Because they want people to be able to carry it and spread it to others. High transmissivity
[3:51:16.980 --> 3:51:23.300]  is the key to a successful biological weapon. And the lethality of this coronavirus at 15%
[3:51:23.300 --> 3:51:29.660]  is not low. Everybody who's been saying that that's low doesn't know anything about microbiology.
[3:51:29.660 --> 3:51:36.500]  Low would be 1%. Coronavirus strains of bacterial, I'm sorry, viral infections and other even
[3:51:36.500 --> 3:51:40.380]  bacterial infections such as bacterial pneumonia and so on. The lethality rates are typically
[3:51:40.380 --> 3:51:49.020]  less than 1%. So for the land set to publish a 15% fatality rate is red alert alarm bells
[3:51:49.020 --> 3:51:52.780]  ringing in the minds of all epidemiologists who know what they're talking about in this
[3:51:52.780 --> 3:51:59.060]  area. It's a very high rate of lethality for this class of virus, very high rate. And with
[3:51:59.060 --> 3:52:04.340]  the high transmission rate, it's the perfect bioweapon. It can spread combined with the
[3:52:04.340 --> 3:52:10.140]  very long incubation period during which no symptoms are shown by many people. So it is
[3:52:10.140 --> 3:52:16.940]  what's called an asymptomatic but infectious carrier classification of a viral strain.
[3:52:16.940 --> 3:52:21.340]  That is actually the perfect design for a biological weapon that can wreak havoc around
[3:52:21.340 --> 3:52:27.900]  the world. So this is not going to blow over with no effects and to state that the stock
[3:52:27.900 --> 3:52:33.980]  market is up today and therefore there will be no economic impacts is simply misinformed.
[3:52:33.980 --> 3:52:39.460]  We've already had confirmed stories from CNBC and mainstream media that Apple's supply chains
[3:52:39.460 --> 3:52:43.820]  are now breaking down in China. As people are told to go home, don't come to the factory,
[3:52:43.820 --> 3:52:48.300]  stop working. The tech industry over the next few months is going to face major economic
[3:52:48.300 --> 3:52:53.780]  consequences from this coronavirus outbreak in China alone, even if it never multiplies
[3:52:53.780 --> 3:53:00.260]  in the United States of America. The tech industry will face major consequences. Furthermore,
[3:53:00.260 --> 3:53:04.380]  researchers from Hong Kong University, based on their software modeling, have already told
[3:53:04.380 --> 3:53:09.620]  us this won't peak in China until late April or early May. At which point, according to
[3:53:09.620 --> 3:53:16.140]  their models, there will be 150,000 new patients per day who are infected with this virus,
[3:53:16.140 --> 3:53:21.460]  after which it will start to dwindle. So yes, this will peak and it will wane. That is for
[3:53:21.460 --> 3:53:26.860]  sure. The question is how many people will be dead during that time and how much economic
[3:53:26.860 --> 3:53:34.100]  impact will it have during that time? And when you've got 150,000 people a day based
[3:53:34.100 --> 3:53:40.140]  on the current models in May in China as a possibility, if they don't contain it, the
[3:53:40.140 --> 3:53:44.540]  economic impacts are going to be devastating on a global scale. And that's what Alex has
[3:53:44.540 --> 3:53:49.100]  been warning about. What are the long-term economic impacts? You can't look at the stock
[3:53:49.100 --> 3:53:54.860]  market today and say everything's going to be fine in May. This is not contained yet.
[3:53:54.860 --> 3:54:00.820]  It's not contained in China. It's not contained in America. It's already overtaken SARS in
[3:54:00.820 --> 3:54:06.260]  terms of the number of infections and number of fatalities. And today, breaking news is
[3:54:06.260 --> 3:54:11.020]  the World Health Organization is now meeting in order to reportedly declare this to be
[3:54:11.020 --> 3:54:18.620]  a global pandemic. So if the WHO declares it to be a global pandemic, what's that based
[3:54:18.620 --> 3:54:21.700]  on? Well, it's based on the fact that it's spreading from person to person in multiple
[3:54:21.700 --> 3:54:26.980]  countries outside of China. That's the criteria. They should have declared it yesterday or
[3:54:26.980 --> 3:54:31.620]  the day before, but they will likely declare it very, very soon. And China just declared
[3:54:31.620 --> 3:54:36.620]  that you will serve seven years in prison if you report on the coronavirus from an independent
[3:54:36.620 --> 3:54:42.020]  point of view that is not in alignment with official sources. They will throw you in prison
[3:54:42.020 --> 3:54:48.260]  for seven years. You want to tell me that's not serious? You want to tell me that China
[3:54:48.260 --> 3:54:54.140]  isn't desperately trying to control the information about this? You want to tell me that this
[3:54:54.140 --> 3:54:59.500]  isn't spreading? How did it get into Japan? How did it get into China? I mean, I mean,
[3:54:59.500 --> 3:55:04.900]  Taiwan, excuse me, how did it get to America if the screening programs work? How is it
[3:55:04.900 --> 3:55:10.220]  already being reported from the callers to this very show? Very likely in New York, very
[3:55:10.220 --> 3:55:14.620]  likely in Miami, very likely in Seattle and Los Angeles and all over the country. How
[3:55:14.620 --> 3:55:20.500]  was that happening if the screening works? The truth is, the screening doesn't work.
[3:55:20.500 --> 3:55:26.540]  Why was a flight secretly diverted by the CDC yesterday to a military base in California?
[3:55:26.540 --> 3:55:32.300]  The March Air Reserve Base in California received a flight of hundreds of Americans who were
[3:55:32.300 --> 3:55:38.100]  evacuated from Wuhan, China. Last night, it was supposed to land in the Ontario International
[3:55:38.100 --> 3:55:43.700]  Airport in California, but it was diverted at the last minute so that the military could
[3:55:43.700 --> 3:55:47.580]  have control over this and now there are statements issued from the Department of Defense and
[3:55:47.580 --> 3:55:54.420]  the Pentagon and so on. Why is China announcing an expansion of 100,000 new hospital beds
[3:55:54.420 --> 3:56:00.040]  in the Wuhan area if this is only affecting a few thousand people? Why is the CDC not treating
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:05.660]  secondary infections in the United States? Why do we know that China probably stole this
[3:56:05.660 --> 3:56:12.420]  from laboratories in Canada using Chinese spies? And these labs in China have a history,
[3:56:12.420 --> 3:56:18.940]  a documented history, of four previous accidental releases of SARS. Four previous accidental
[3:56:18.940 --> 3:56:23.740]  releases is documented in the Lancet and Nature Science journals, so we know that they are
[3:56:23.740 --> 3:56:30.380]  not good at containing the bioweapons that they are working on. You put all these facts
[3:56:30.380 --> 3:56:36.620]  together and you have on your hands a very lethal bioweapon that I believe was accidentally
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:41.540]  released, but it's being deliberately engineered to be a weapon against humankind. And that's
[3:56:41.540 --> 3:56:47.460]  why it has this targeted transmission rate and targeted lethality rate, the quote, perfect
[3:56:47.460 --> 3:56:55.380]  combination to spread undetected as a stealth virus. And yes, it is a very big deal and
[3:56:55.380 --> 3:57:00.500]  it's going to get worse. Mark my words, the number of infections and deaths over the next
[3:57:00.500 --> 3:57:06.860]  week will be larger than they are today. I'll bet anybody a million dollars on that fact.
[3:57:06.860 --> 3:57:12.940]  If I had a million dollars, I would bet that. So this is going to get worse. Info wars is
[3:57:12.940 --> 3:57:17.740]  the cutting edge of bringing you accurate scientific based information, well sourced
[3:57:17.740 --> 3:57:26.300]  information on this. Do not be, do not be lulled into a sense that this is no big deal.
[3:57:26.300 --> 3:57:30.660]  Now it will blow over eventually, but what happens between now and then is up to you.
[3:57:30.660 --> 3:57:35.340]  Stay informed, keep watching Info Wars or Rooms Up Next with Alex Jones. Thank you for watching.
[3:57:35.340 --> 3:57:39.540]  This is Mike Adams.
