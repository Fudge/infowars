[00:00.000 --> 00:30.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to another hour of this live Monday edition of the Alex Jones show already the 25th of November.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.960]  2002 we're joined by Rahul Ruhalva and he is a congressman-elect. Here's the headline Arizona
[00:38.960 --> 00:45.360]  leaders at the state and federal level are calling for investigators. Investigations into armed
[00:45.360 --> 00:49.840]  civilian patrols along the state's border with Mexico at issue is the safety of the people on
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.800]  the border and the legality of the so-called militia groups formed out of frustration
[00:54.800 --> 00:59.280]  at the inability of the US border agents to slow illegal immigration from Mexico.
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.800]  Millions a year just right there in Cochise county we've had the newspaper editor on who called for
[01:04.800 --> 01:12.400]  the militia to be formed. Last week we covered the Arizona Republic news reports and we're now
[01:12.400 --> 01:17.440]  joined by Congressman Ruhalva. Congressman thank you for coming on the show today to
[01:17.440 --> 01:24.320]  talk about your concerns. Welcome. Welcome and thank you for inviting me. You bet. So exactly
[01:24.320 --> 01:28.400]  what's happening and you're quoted here saying you're very concerned about this. I think the
[01:28.400 --> 01:32.320]  rhetoric you're hearing from some of the leaders of these groups is very dangerous the overall
[01:32.320 --> 01:36.640]  security of the region. You said the potential for violence is escalating and I think the whole
[01:36.640 --> 01:44.640]  situation has to be investigated. Yeah those were the comments and I think it's you know
[01:44.640 --> 01:54.000]  the whole border region is a national problem and you know that there is an agreement that the
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.880]  policy in place has failed from whatever perspective you take it. It has failed and
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.920]  and the consequence of that failure is either people dying in the desert or the other
[02:04.560 --> 02:09.120]  consequence that we're seeing now is a called armed and a call to militia to patrol
[02:10.160 --> 02:16.800]  and to have civilian groups doing that and I think that is a dangerous turn in the long run
[02:16.800 --> 02:24.880]  and just aggravate the crisis in the short term. Well Congressman look we know that a
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.640]  forestry officer just got shot and killed. We know Mexican troops are routinely firing and shooting
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.320]  up border patrol vehicles. We know that drugs are being brought across. We know that homes are being
[02:38.320 --> 02:44.400]  broken into. Water systems are being broken. We know that if you or I try to sneak across the
[02:44.400 --> 02:51.040]  Mexican border we'll get shot or if we're lucky end up six months in a dirt floor jail. So you
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.200]  know to hear that oh you know the Americans are being abusive. I mean I'm a Texan. I've been
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.480]  across the border many times with Mexico and I'm very familiar with the federales and the Mexican
[03:02.480 --> 03:08.480]  troops and the rest of it. I mean Bush just called more border patrol off that area your area
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.600]  of of Arizona. That's been all over the news. What are the people supposed to do there? Just just
[03:13.600 --> 03:21.520]  accept? No it's not a question of accepting sir. It's a question of the issue of people
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.640]  arming themselves and having civilian militias patrolling the border when that is a legitimate
[03:26.640 --> 03:33.440]  law enforcement issue and it's a legitimate issue and a result of federal policy. That's
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.480]  a federal intervention. That's a federal role that needs to be played out there and I think
[03:38.960 --> 03:45.520]  you know my disagreement is it with the whole thing is to having armed militias or vigilantes
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.960]  whatever the name might be appropriate at the time to be taking the law into their own hands
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.400]  and this is a federal law and and the jurisdiction and the due process and the
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.920]  civil rights are all federal issues and the call for the investigation is is this aggravating the
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.560]  situation worse than it already is? You know at a national level we're not dealing with the issue
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.640]  of immigration. It's been put on the back burner. There's discussions by national discussions
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.800]  occurring today between the Bush administration and the Fox administration on the issue
[04:14.800 --> 04:21.360]  but we have a we have a complex problem that a simplistic attitude of calling of picking up
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.680]  arms is not going to solve and and all it does is aggravate it. But that's what the Mexican troops
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.120]  do. They pick up arms all the time and people try to interfere with drug shipments and they're
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.760]  they're they're shooting people running around shooting at vehicles. They've been captured
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.440]  coming across the border 10 miles. I mean Mexico everybody whines about what the U.S. is doing. What
[04:41.440 --> 04:46.240]  about Mexico? Well there's there's a joint responsibility here that's why the discussions
[04:46.240 --> 04:55.600]  have to be bi-national and if those behaviors that you're illustrating to me and are
[04:55.600 --> 05:02.000]  indeed true that does not that still begs the question should we should then our civilian side
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  and the American side take up the same kind of behavior and my response to that is no.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.880]  All right. One bad deed does not reward another bad deed. We're talking to congressman Raul
[05:11.760 --> 05:18.400]  Grijalva and he was just been elected there as a new congressman from that area of of Arizona.
[05:19.760 --> 05:27.280]  Look you say it's an obvious problem but here's the headline Bush to push for amnesty blanket
[05:27.280 --> 05:32.960]  amnesty we know the corporations want the cheap labor we know the democrats want the constituency
[05:32.960 --> 05:38.720]  and they've tried in the media to make this a racial issue I don't care what color you are
[05:38.720 --> 05:44.240]  we got 400 million people in Latin America another 10 to 20 million births a year they're all coming
[05:44.240 --> 05:50.800]  this way and we've got six plus billion people outside the western world they're all coming this
[05:50.800 --> 05:59.440]  way and we got to do something now I mean I don't want to live in Calcutta or something and I live
[05:59.440 --> 06:06.640]  in Texas and I know it's as bad as Arizona I mean it's like the Tower of Babel I can't talk to half
[06:06.640 --> 06:11.120]  the people on the street they can't talk to me the cops are out pushing all the illegals around
[06:11.120 --> 06:15.760]  good training for them for the police state this is bad all the way around I mean I mean how many
[06:15.760 --> 06:21.120]  illegals do we have to take here I don't think I don't think that's the issue the issue is that
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.400]  the issue that you're specifically asking about the whole policy of migration and immigration
[06:26.400 --> 06:31.280]  and what we're doing about it has been a neglected issue in the southwest and all over this country
[06:31.280 --> 06:35.360]  it's not just happening here it happens but it's not neglected it's a policy to leave the border
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.240]  wide open how can they say give up your right homeland security let's examine for a second
[06:40.240 --> 06:46.720]  the policy that's in place now the policy of containment the policy of sealing the border
[06:46.720 --> 06:54.880]  the policy of gatekeeper the policy of putting up walls now is that deterrent that was seen as
[06:54.880 --> 07:00.880]  the way to do it and if we follow your logic to seal that border is that work no it has not worked
[07:00.880 --> 07:05.200]  it's exasperated the problem people are dying in the desert and you have a call for arms on the
[07:05.200 --> 07:11.440]  parts of american civilians that is not solving the issue the issue is much more complex and needs
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.480]  a much broader comprehensive approach to it and we're not doing that we the ball has been dropped
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.120]  at many levels and and one of the levels that's been dropped it is at the national level with
[07:21.120 --> 07:27.120]  this congress and now relatedly this administration is beginning to understand that if we don't deal
[07:27.120 --> 07:31.680]  with this problem this problem is just going to get yeah but the way that you and mesentia fox
[07:31.680 --> 07:36.080]  because i'm reading some of your other quotes or another story is to give more amnesty which will
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.280]  only take another 20 million people up here and our infrastructure is just legalizing the reality
[07:41.280 --> 07:47.120]  you're legalizing the reality there you go just capitulate to it let the whole 400 million just
[07:47.120 --> 07:52.720]  come right on up here with all the police state and the way of life down there and i've been to
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.840]  mexico many times and that is not the type of government i want for this country now i'll agree
[07:57.840 --> 08:02.640]  with you it's a reality that our government is becoming as tyrannical as the mexican government
[08:02.640 --> 08:08.160]  uh or the or the venezuelan government or the chilean government and i'm really freaked out
[08:08.160 --> 08:12.560]  about it i have to tell you i mean i'm so worried about america i might move down to costa rica it's
[08:12.560 --> 08:17.040]  not that i don't want to be around latin people said i don't want to be around a government that
[08:17.840 --> 08:24.240]  that has two tiers in society and i mean it's going to destroy our wages destroy our infrastructure
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.360]  to have this 400 million coming this way well i i think the numbers exaggerated sir with all
[08:29.360 --> 08:35.920]  due respect there's not 400 million coming this way the issue is yeah 20 million every year no
[08:35.920 --> 08:41.040]  i think i don't think that number is correct i think the issue of legalization the issue of
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.760]  unification of families the issue for guest worker program and temporary workers are all
[08:45.760 --> 08:51.840]  issues that are on the table because there is no other way to deal with this issue other than to
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.640]  accept the reality congressman isn't this really about a pan-american union i mean bush has got the
[08:56.640 --> 09:00.880]  colored money coming out next year they're talking about the amaro and the mainstream news this is
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.160]  talking about just getting rid of sovereignty of all these countries i don't think i i think that
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.960]  that's uh have you heard about bush's deal to use multinational troops here domestically including
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.560]  mexican and canadian no i have not well that's the army or college are you for mexican and canadian
[09:16.560 --> 09:22.240]  troops patrolling america no i'm not there's the issue of sovereignty is not lost and we talk about
[09:22.240 --> 09:26.080]  the issue of immigration well at least you're more conservative than bush then well i thought
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.120]  sovereignty isn't well i wouldn't go that far either oh there you go well i mean barbara
[09:31.120 --> 09:37.120]  bockers for arming the pilots bush isn't uh dick gephardt's for banning partial birth abortion
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.400]  bush isn't so i i like to illustrate things like that okay so i'm just showing how ultra out of
[09:44.400 --> 09:48.640]  control uh well you know bush just got one of the most frittonian gun control bills ever seen
[09:48.640 --> 09:52.640]  passed through the house i mean you'll probably agree with that legislation do you agree with
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.640]  that legislation i i just agree with i agree with the brady bill and i would agree with background
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.560]  checks and i agree that public gun shows should require the same public background absolutely
[10:04.560 --> 10:10.240]  well so yeah um but we've got a caller in tucson arizona larry wants to talk to you larry you're
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.720]  on the air with our guest who doesn't want the citizens i guess down there trying to protect
[10:14.720 --> 10:18.560]  their property go ahead larry you're on the air with the congressman all right well you know one
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.520]  of the things that came up that i'd like to see is i'd like to see the uh assets of the mexican
[10:23.520 --> 10:29.120]  government in the united states frozen and then distributed to all the uh uh victims criminal
[10:29.120 --> 10:34.320]  victims by the mexican government uh you know it's so that uh we see our hospitals funded you know we
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.720]  see all the people have been hurt and all the damage that these illegals are causing uh you know
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.720]  paid for by the uh the mexican government i wonder if you could do that in congress and see through
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.920]  that it gets done uh the other thing what american people here in tucson they know about la raza and
[10:47.920 --> 10:52.720]  they have the land and they know that the mexican government is encouraging the illegals to
[10:52.720 --> 10:59.200]  basically push out the americans so that uh that's a good question that's a good question i've been
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.400]  to some of these meetings and aired some of the tapes and uh the the president beforehand said
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.240]  this is all one big region one country and oslan and and and you know this symmetric thing they
[11:10.240 --> 11:14.560]  call for do you believe texas and california and all this are part of a mythical kingdom of
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.800]  crystal pyramids controlled by the aztecs no i don't but the issue the issue here is that you
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.840]  know that uh you know we don't want to you know it i don't think this issue is is needs to be
[11:25.840 --> 11:33.760]  dominated by uh uh a kind of uh stereotyping and prejudices that that the one caller did and and
[11:33.760 --> 11:37.840]  some of the comments that you've made wait a minute wait a minute i've been to matches website
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.000]  it says push the white people out with pictures of m-16s i got them on video chanting anti-white
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.160]  stuff i i'll tell you what congressman just one more segment quick break because let's bring this
[11:50.160 --> 11:54.080]  up let's talk about it because i know a lot of hispanics that agree with me to listen to this
[11:54.080 --> 12:00.640]  show okay so maybe they'll call in i i'm trying to understand this this communications radio
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.120]  network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your line
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.240]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm alex jones your host we're talking to a congressman right
[12:16.240 --> 12:24.320]  now rahul rahalva from there in arizona and rahul look you you try to play that race car my
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.440]  and i appreciate you joining us you've got you know courage to do that a lot of congressman
[12:29.440 --> 12:37.040]  don't like doing talk shows and i'm sitting here my wife speaks spanish so and she speaks french
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.720]  as well as uh several other languages but she lived in spain for four years so i can hear what
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.560]  uh what mexicans are saying and i don't know it seems to be here in texas at least like a racial
[12:49.680 --> 12:56.080]  blitzkrieg or lebenskrau or something and i i see the the uh and downtown on the mexican food
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.200]  restaurant a picture of an aztec priest cutting a white person's heart out i can send you links
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.680]  to metro websites where it's got m16s and flyers that have been handed out it's been the national
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.000]  news you know push out the gringos i got video of it so i think a lot of people are are getting
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.640]  involved in this ratio people who were never thought of thought of themselves racially are
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.120]  are i mean certainly there are white supremacists there are black supremacists there are hispanic
[13:21.120 --> 13:28.320]  supremacists are you saying there isn't a movement in mecha that calls for that no my familiarity
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.320]  with what mecha is doing and has done is they talk about political empowerment they talk about
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.760]  educational achievement they talk about history they talk about identity they talk about diversity
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.360]  and i mean i i consider all those things to be legitimate points yeah their history is that
[13:46.080 --> 13:53.040]  a god race ran texas colorado new mexico arizona nevada california i mean do you believe that that
[13:53.040 --> 14:00.080]  history i believe that yeah i think there's a link between mexico and the southwest there always has
[14:00.080 --> 14:06.080]  been and always will continue to be i thought it was uh the indians of this country are completely
[14:06.080 --> 14:11.440]  deficient from the aztecs that were horrible bloodthirsty indians that sacrificed people and
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.160]  grabbed up and killed other indian populations i don't think they were grabbed up by the indians
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.880]  so you were you a member of mecha in college here yeah when i was at the university of arizona i was
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.760]  well look uh i know that when tony sanchez ran for governor there was a lot of racial
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.440]  politicking and i think that's what lost him the election uh i i'm really concerned about this so
[14:35.440 --> 14:40.560]  so you think it's bad to have citizens what about the patrols on their own ranches you think it's
[14:40.560 --> 14:45.440]  bad for folks to to arrest people on their own property i'm not going to do that in my own home
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.840]  or in my backyard at night they should be able to do it on their own ranches yeah the issue of
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.240]  protecting your private property but i think the issue has gone way beyond there when you are having
[14:54.240 --> 15:00.480]  a national call to arms and inviting people from throughout the country to come into the region
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.800]  and patrol and to be armed and to serve as a as a civilian patrol in a civilian militia that's
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.760]  done way beyond uh the categorization of simply protecting one's property
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.680]  why do you think bush called the border patrol uh two of the teens out of cochise
[15:17.600 --> 15:23.120]  i i don't know i don't know i would assume that uh uh for deployment reasons somewhere else but
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.040]  i have i don't have a good answer for that no well certainly you know cochise is one of the
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.600]  biggest areas in the country where they're pouring across it it's not it the whole region along the
[15:33.600 --> 15:39.440]  southwest is is an area in which you know we have a region here in the part of my district
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.640]  where 170 people have died in the desert well now the government's putting water stations up so
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.200]  that's right you know would would and i believe that's totally appropriate appropriate that's a
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.320]  humanitarian act it has nothing to do with encouragement it has nothing to do with uh
[15:54.320 --> 15:59.360]  why not just put buses in there then to ferry them so nobody dies well and if somebody's
[15:59.360 --> 16:06.640]  committing a crime then why should we i mean should we uh you know make it safer for for
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.120]  people to break into businesses i mean i don't understand if you look i i've grown up on the
[16:11.120 --> 16:19.680]  border i know but one can take exaggerations and conspiracy theories to their uh illogical
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.360]  point wait a minute mexican troops have been shooting at border patrol vehicles and
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.040]  a uh a uh bar that one can take exaggerations and conspiracy that's not a conspiracy theory
[16:29.040 --> 16:35.600]  it's been all over the news and i and i think this discussion does not require uh uh the tone
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.880]  of this discussion can't be one of uh uh pointing fingers and stereotypes the point of this
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.280]  discussion has to be to solve the problem are you saying it's a conspiracy theory it's just
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.680]  one question are you saying it's a conspiracy theory to say mexican troops are routinely
[16:49.680 --> 16:54.640]  shooting at border patrol and shooting at vehicles individual incidents as i said earlier
[16:54.640 --> 17:01.600]  does not take the question of if that individual incident then what's the conspiracy theory then
[17:01.600 --> 17:07.360]  that does not give anyone the right to commit those things where's the where's the conspiracy
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.360]  theory what have i said it's a conspiracy theory i'm just saying the conspiracy theories can be
[17:11.360 --> 17:16.080]  taken to the absurd no you just throw that word out that's a conspiracy theory i'm not talking
