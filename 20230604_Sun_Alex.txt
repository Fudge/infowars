[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]  Thanks for watching!
[00:00:00.655 --> 00:00:26.135]  This
[00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:31.335]  strategy includes over 100 bold and unprecedented actions that government agencies are going
[00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:36.495]  to take to counter anti-Semitism. And that includes calls for action for Congress, state
[00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:41.295]  and local governments, companies, technology platforms, civil society, and faith leaders,
[00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:50.015]  all of them to act. Act. Silence is complicity.
[00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:55.815]  America sits quietly as the tyrannical New World Order injustice system throws patriots
[00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:01.135]  behind prison walls for merely expressing their natural-born rights.
[00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:05.695]  Stuart Rhoades learns his fate finally. In the longest sentence yet related to the Capitol
[00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:10.375]  riot, Rhoades has been ordered to spend 18 years in a federal prison.
[00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:16.175]  Take a good hard look at where we are, at what's been done to not just us but other
[00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:22.335]  people, what's going to continue to be done in the name of stopping the insurrection against
[00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:29.175]  Joe Biden.
[00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:35.055]  To be radicalized in Joe Biden's America is to demand an end to his corruption and
[00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.055]  fraud.
[00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:39.535]  There have been many developments in the House investigations into the First Family's international
[00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:44.335]  business dealings recently. There's one committee trying to get an FBI file alleging that President
[00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:49.415]  Biden took bribes. There's another IRS whistleblower who's alleging there's a cover-up in the investigation.
[00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:54.295]  There was a Harvard-Harris poll this month that found that 53% of the public, including
[00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:59.775]  a fourth of Democrats, believe, quote, Joe Biden was involved with his son in an illegal
[00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:04.335]  influence-peddling scheme. So what do you say to the majority of Americans who believe
[00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:07.255]  that the president is himself corrupt?
[00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:11.495]  All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:17.455]  So the flames are fanned by propagandists like Michael Jensen, senior researcher at the
[00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:22.535]  National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University
[00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:28.375]  of Maryland, and the leader of the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the U.S. project
[00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:34.935]  known as PURIS, a database tracking how U.S. extremists can be radicalized. Jensen claims
[00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:41.855]  that according to his data, 90% of the cases of U.S. terrorists are classed as domestic.
[00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:49.815]  Of those domestic extremists, 95% are far-right. Jensen lists them as white supremacists, proud
[00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:56.575]  boys, anti-immigrant groups, and anti-government groups. It's as if the multimillion-dollar
[00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:03.575]  countrywide Antifa and BLM carnage resulting from the George Floyd PSYOP never happened.
[00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:11.295]  We saw federal agents force them to the west, but they soon returned around 11.30 p.m. That's
[00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:18.655]  when agents again tried to push back the crowd with tear gas and pepper bullets. About an
[00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:24.615]  hour later, around 12.30, protesters again showed up on the west side of the federal
[00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:29.855]  courthouse, this time trying to set a fire to the outside of the building.
[00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:33.555]  Investigators want to talk to them about the murder of retired police captain David Dorn.
[00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:36.995]  This man will never speak a lie today. Cannon was convicted of six charges, including
[00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:41.355]  first-degree murder. Dorn was shot and killed while responding to a burglar alarm at a friend's
[00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:46.075]  business in North St. Louis. Dorn confronted looters who had broken into the store during
[00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:51.875]  a protest at George Floyd's death in Minneapolis. But of course, it is actually Biden's Marxist
[00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:57.795]  minions that are radicalized, protected by Democrat extremists, and continuing to openly
[00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:04.635]  wage domestic terrorism. As Jamie White reports, a Utah Target was evacuated after multiple
[00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:11.635]  store locations received bomb threats from LGBTQ advocates, according to reports. The
[00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:17.435]  threats appear to have been made by trans extremists triggered over Target's decision
[00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:24.435]  to pull LGBTQ merchandise and sever ties with a satanic trans artist following massive public
[00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:31.915]  backlash. I started noticing that there was an influx of videos being made by members
[00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:38.355]  of the Christian right in the United States who were taking pictures from my Instagram
[00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:44.575]  and from my web store and claiming that that was being launched in Target. They were taking
[00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:49.595]  work like Satan Respects Pronouns. The person who sent us this threat said that Target turned
[00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:56.635]  its back on the LGBT community. A little before 1230 Friday afternoon. We'll be right back,
[00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:03.795]  ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us. Sold out for more than a year. We now have back in

[00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:19.915]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:40.915]  It's Sunday, June 4th, 2023. I'm your host, Alex Jones, very honored and blessed to be sitting here in the Austin
[00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:47.915]  studios of InfoWars on this live Sunday broadcast. All right, Kent Heckin-Lively, an incredible
[00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:53.915]  author and scientist, researcher, will be joining us in studio coming up in about 30
[00:06:53.915 --> 00:07:01.915]  minutes. We're then going to have, riding shotgun with him, Dr. Judy Majkiewicz in studio
[00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:08.915]  as well. And they were both here in town, along with a lot of other amazing individuals
[00:07:08.915 --> 00:07:17.915]  for the premiere of The Great Awakening, film by Mickey Willis that is excellent. He's
[00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:20.915]  already made some incredible films that helped break the back of the globalists. But this
[00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:26.915]  one is even more powerful, exposing their authoritarian endgame goal and how we can,
[00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:31.915]  must and will stop them. I have a book coming out on the same title, The Great Awakening.
[00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:35.915]  A lot of people have asked me why I've been talking about The Great Awakening for 20 plus
[00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:39.915]  years on air. Well, that's because I've been talking about the new Renaissance for 20 plus
[00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:43.915]  years. And there have been hundreds of what they call great awakenings. But in the Renaissance
[00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:47.915]  tradition, it started right after the invention of the Gutenberg press so that we could have
[00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:52.915]  actual dissemination of the Bible to a larger population. And that caused the entire Protestant
[00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:57.915]  movement out of that. But The Great Awakening is bigger than just the Christian awakening,
[00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:01.915]  though that's the heart of it. It was about the awakening in science and the awakening
[00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:05.915]  in literature and the awakening in art and the awakening of free speech and not being
[00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:11.915]  put in jail for what you said. That started in Europe about 500 years ago, not in the
[00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:16.915]  United States. We were the latter flower of the Renaissance and the industrial revolution
[00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:22.915]  that the free and open society created. So we've said for years, the counter to The Great
[00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:29.915]  Reset is The Great Awakening. And you, my friends, are that great awakening. So we'll
[00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:34.915]  talk about what The Great Awakening means versus The Globalist's Great Reset with Kent
[00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:39.915]  Heckenliebly coming up in studio here now in about 25 minutes. Then Dr. Mikovitz will
[00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:45.915]  be joining us throughout the second hour. And then in the third and fourth hour tonight,
[00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:54.915]  I'll introduce it. We're going to air this new film, The Great Awakening, Plandemic 3.
[00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:58.915]  We're going to be airing what I think is the best of the films he's made on the subject.
[00:08:58.915 --> 00:09:03.915]  They're excellent. Tonight. Tonight here. Now, we also have links to it where you can
[00:09:03.915 --> 00:09:08.915]  get it at Infowars.com for free on the HiWire site, on Mickey Willis' site. But we're going
[00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.915]  to be streaming it out here tonight to a lot of TV stations and a lot of radio stations
[00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:16.915]  and, of course, to our audience. But right at the top of the page, we have big links
[00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:21.915]  to go over to the HiWire and find it there. And the amazing work of Dale Bigtree, who
[00:09:21.915 --> 00:09:26.915]  helped get this done and who was doing a fabulous job as well, because it's not just the scientists
[00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:29.915]  and doctors, the general public that have broken the back of the New World Order's
[00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:36.915]  biggest attack plan. It's been people like Mickey Willis and Kent Heckin-Lively and
[00:09:36.915 --> 00:09:41.915]  Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and just so many others, folks like Dale Bigtree. And make
[00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:47.915]  no mistake, this next pandemic is coming. And if we don't get on the offense, exposing
[00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:53.915]  the globalists, they may be able to completely take over and put us under permanent lockdown.
[00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:58.915]  So find the entire Great Awakening film for free and share it and spread it right now
[00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:03.915]  on InfoWars.com. But we'll be streaming it coming up tonight with some of my commentary
[00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:08.915]  and more. So definitely look forward to that. But the coordinates of Liberty are InfoWars.com
[00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:17.915]  and Band.Video. Also, I must have been hiding under a rock. I didn't know that back in,
[00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:25.915]  I guess it was April, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the so-called scientist, the guy's very funny,
[00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:29.915]  fun to listen to, a likable guy, but he's a total cult leader of the globalists. You
[00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:34.915]  couldn't be worse. He says science is doing what the consensus says and following what
[00:10:34.915 --> 00:10:39.915]  the big corporations say, when science is about always questioning. And he went on to
[00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:47.915]  say that in a debate with Bill Bigtree that I didn't even know it happened months ago,
[00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:52.915]  even though it went viral, I missed that one until I saw the film. And it's part of
[00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:58.915]  the film and part of the intro as well. And he says, no, no, we don't listen to all these
[00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:03.915]  procedure scientists. We listen to the consensus. No, science is about challenging and not having
[00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:08.915]  a consensus of two men can have a baby and X and Y chromosomes don't exist. That's what
[00:11:08.915 --> 00:11:14.915]  they teach now in U.S. and European colleges that X and Y chromosomes do not exist.
[00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:20.915]  So in the age of science, they're telling you that chromosomes don't exist. This is
[00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:25.915]  absolutely savage brainwashing. And if you understand the tactic he used, he kept saying
[00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:30.915]  science, science, science, science, science. I don't look at your facts. I only go with
[00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:34.915]  the consensus. Well, there is no consensus. There was a corporate force feeding operation.
[00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:39.915]  So I'm going to play. It's a long debate, but I'm going to play five key minutes of
[00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:47.915]  it. Dr. Judy Michael, it's coming up in the second hour today and get her take on that.
[00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:53.915]  Just absolutely, absolutely brutal. Obviously, we have a lot of big news here. Oh, boy, do
[00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:56.915]  we. And each one of these stacks is absolutely key. I'm going to bring these up with our
[00:11:56.915 --> 00:12:00.915]  guests as well. It's going to focus on the poison shots and on the next rollout of the
[00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:04.915]  next plague they're preparing to release. I've said they're preparing to release. We're
[00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:09.915]  spent a lot of time on that. We're also spent a lot of time on the other angles and arms
[00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:15.915]  of this. We're going to be looking at the Biden administration is officially asking
[00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:22.915]  the U.N. to come in and sanction the United States for reparation, saying that America
[00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:26.915]  was founded on slavery and is inherently evil and that the U.N. should come in and help
[00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:32.915]  administer five million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to every black person. Now, obviously,
[00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:36.915]  it's about a U.N. takeover. How would you ever have a U.N. takeover? We'll have them
[00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:41.915]  take over the medical system and have a U.N. treaty and be your savior. And oh, we're going
[00:12:41.915 --> 00:12:44.915]  to give all the brown people free money. Are they going to go to China and get reparations
[00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:51.915]  for the three million Muslim Uyghur slaves in Western China? No. And if you bring it
[00:12:51.915 --> 00:12:56.915]  up on a basketball court, they'll kick you off like you see in the NBA. No, no, no, no.
[00:12:56.915 --> 00:13:01.915]  It's all about America being mad and this carrot being dangled to go along with the U.N.,
[00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:04.915]  go along with the world government and it's going to get reparations. It's the U.N. building
[00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:08.915]  the refugee centers after they ran the lockdowns worldwide that starved over 50 million people
[00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:15.915]  in the last three and a half years to death. They're murdering people in mass.
[00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:19.915]  Paramilitary U.N. troops are slaughtering people all over the world. You know, you watch
[00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:23.915]  a movie like Black Adam with The Rock and most of those movies are unwatchable. They're
[00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:27.915]  super cheesy. I can't stand the whole Marvel comic universe. But I was on an airplane
[00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:33.915]  flying back to the United States from the United States from Hawaii Friday. And I said,
[00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:38.915]  let me just watch this show because I want to see the propaganda in it. And it was all
[00:13:38.915 --> 00:13:45.915]  about evil British white mercenaries enslaving a mythical African country that has this magical
[00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:52.915]  element in it similar to Black Panther and Wakanda. And I'm sitting there watching the
[00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:57.915]  mercenaries. You know who the mercenaries work for. They work for really one of four
[00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:02.915]  or five groups. But it's the U.N.'s the main group that has mercenaries slaughtering and
[00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:08.915]  enslaving just like the movie, literally. And then there's China is the next biggest.
[00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:14.915]  And then there's an Anglo-American Dutch contingent that's kind of in this movie that's real.
[00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:19.915]  And then there's the United States comes in with mercenaries and kills people in mass
[00:14:19.915 --> 00:14:23.915]  and takes their land. I mean, it's been in the U.N. articles. They admit it. I read a
[00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:28.915]  New York Times article like 10 years ago where it was talking about, well, to create carbon
[00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:34.915]  offsets for carbon for mining in this area of Central Africa. The U.N. came in with tanks
[00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:40.915]  and helicopters and the locals resisted being pushed off their land. So the U.N.-backed
[00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:46.915]  mercenaries killed 10,000 of them last month. Number was probably higher. And I'm just from
[00:14:46.915 --> 00:14:50.915]  New York Times. I'm sitting there reading coffee, reading and drinking coffee. And it's
[00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:53.915]  just right there. Yep. And of course, you can go read about the foreign press, too.
[00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:58.915]  But just, yeah, the U.N. came in, just killed 10,000 people. So you see these movies and
[00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:02.915]  the U.N.'s the savior. And there's this U.N. group of superheroes that come to create stability
[00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:06.915]  and battle Black Adam because he's too violent. And they're the U.N. and they're going to save
[00:15:06.915 --> 00:15:12.915]  the world when it's the U.N. that is the biggest group running those lithium mines
[00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:17.915]  and those slave camps. They run it. They control it. They get a big cut of the money from the
[00:15:17.915 --> 00:15:22.915]  multinational corporations. And who gets 98 percent of rare earth minerals out of the
[00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:27.915]  ground in the world? The Ch-Ch-Ch-Chicoms. So in most cases, the Chicoms don't run the
[00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:32.915]  enslavement. They run the civilian side of it, extracting it and controlling the slaves.
[00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:37.915]  But the paramilitary camps are run by the U.N. on record. But when you watch a movie
[00:15:37.915 --> 00:15:45.915]  from Hollywood, it's the U.N. saving everyone from the mercenaries. A lie, a lie, a lie.
[00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:50.915]  All of it, a big, giant damn lie. We don't hear about the U.N. pair reparations for all
[00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:54.915]  the African slaves they got right now or for cutting the damn food off. They're alive right
[00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:56.915]  now. The U.N. did this. They should be executed.
[00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.915]  All I want is your word of mouth and to tell people to tune in to the show and to share
[00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:05.915]  the clips. And you're doing it. It's having a bigger effect than ever. And please keep

[00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:03.915]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:17:03.915 --> 00:17:07.915]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:11.915]  There is a bulletin from CBS News. President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:15.915]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:17:15.915 --> 00:17:19.915]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:23.915]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:27.915]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:31.915]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion. It just happened.
[00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:35.915]  We need to go into the capitol. Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:17:35.915 --> 00:17:39.915]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions.
[00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:43.915]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:47.915]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:54.915]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, as soon as these globalists start going to prison.
[00:17:58.915 --> 00:18:06.915]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:09.915]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:17.915]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:20.915]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:23.915]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:26.915]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.915 --> 00:18:31.915]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:34.915]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:40.915]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:18:40.915 --> 00:18:43.915]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:48.915]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:52.915]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[00:18:52.915 --> 00:18:54.915]  And a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.915 --> 00:18:58.915]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com
[00:18:58.915 --> 00:19:00.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
[00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:04.915]  The solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:07.915]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:11.915]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website,
[00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:17.915]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:25.915]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body,
[00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:31.915]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:38.915]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:41.915]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:43.915]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:49.915]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together, that supercharges your body.
[00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:52.915]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:07.915]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:21.540]  Welcome back, my friends, to the Alex Jones Show, live Sunday edition.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:28.020]  We're going to be back in Central Texas with a great crew and all of you watching and listening.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.860]  All right, so here's the bottom line.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.260]  The New World Order is out in the open now.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.620]  They're making their move.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.180]  And folks are really starting to wake up to how serious it is.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:45.220]  And one of the biggest takeaways that's now unfolding is that people really understand
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:56.220]  now that domestic operations of Western intelligence agencies are taking place in our countries
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.220]  and are totally illegal.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.440]  Now, I told you this decades ago because it came on congressional hearings here and there.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.380]  But now, with the hearings a few months ago in Congress and others coming out in the UK
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.620]  and Canada and Australia, it is being confirmed that the military's main mission and the
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.420]  CIA and MI6 and MI5 and the FBI and all the other intelligence agencies across the Western
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:23.940]  world was unified to go after populists, to go after Christians, to go after conservatives,
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.020]  to go after people that didn't want their borders open, to go after people that didn't
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.620]  want forced injections or lockdowns.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.340]  And now more documents have been released.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:38.260]  A secret UK government unit worked with social media to, quote, shut down lockdown critics,
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.260]  calling them terrorists.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.300]  Same thing in the US.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.700]  Same thing in Canada.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.860]  Same thing in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, everywhere that's, quote,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.940]  in the Western alliance.
[00:21:52.170 --> 00:22:02.250]  And that's New Zealand, that's Australia, that's Western Europe, that's the UK, that's
[00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.530]  a lot of Latin American countries are on board, a lot of African countries, not a lot, they've
[00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:11.530]  kind of gotten out of it, they used to be, and some Middle Eastern countries, a lot of
[00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:17.450]  Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, they are on board.
[00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:26.890]  BBC, leaked messages, the plan to frighten the public, that's from back in March.
[00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.610]  So we told you all of this, exclusive ministers had chilling secret unit to curb lockdown
[00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:39.490]  dissent, and they were going to keep you locked down forever, the plan is to collapse civilization
[00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.610]  and society.
[00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.890]  And now it's all confirmed, exactly what we told you, so let me show you a little bit
[00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.570]  of this and explain what they're doing.
[00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:55.250]  Have you noticed whether in Detroit, or Chicago, or LA, or San Francisco, or New York City,
[00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.970]  or any other leftist run jurisdiction, that crime is completely out of hand, and the worst
[00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.450]  it's ever been in US history, and the only people being prosecuted are people that shoot
[00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.610]  armed robbers in their businesses or their houses, or if a man's trying to kill people
[00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.570]  on a subway, and a black man, a white man, a Hispanic man, fight him for more than 10
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:19.090]  minutes, and he dies in a choke hold, and now the white guy gets arrested, and charged
[00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.130]  with murder, manslaughter.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.360]  What's this really about?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.360]  Well, they know if you go in and tell everybody,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.360]  go home for several years and don't go to work,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.360]  that's going to kill all the real estate.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360]  And they know if you let crime run rampant,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.360]  let them rob all the stores, all the criminals,
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.360]  it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.360]  With Black Lives Matter, Soros, UN, State Department funded,
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.360]  burning down billions of dollars of, in many cases,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.360]  even government project buildings.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.360]  This is meant to bring down society
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.360]  and then the globalists will bring in tyranny later
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.360]  and then they will absolutely enslave all of us.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.360]  And they even admit in the San Francisco Chronicle,
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.360]  oh, they're 40% empty, their business, real estate,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.360]  all those big high-rises,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.360]  and especially the stuff on the street,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.360]  it's all empty in many areas.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.360]  It's more like 50% in Chicago.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.360]  What's their answer?
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360]  60% in Detroit.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.360]  What's their answer?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.360]  Oh, everybody will get universal basic income
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.360]  and part of the welfare will go in the government check
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.360]  to pay to convert these business buildings,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360]  these business high-rise, business centers,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.360]  into, quote, affordable housing.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360]  And then there'll be all the crime in control,
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360]  so now you've got to have your digital passport
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]  and your face scan and drones,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.360]  and now you're in your prison city.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360]  And they admit that's the plan.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.360]  That's why, whether you're in France
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.360]  or whether you're in the Netherlands
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360]  or whether you're in London, England,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.360]  it's the same plan.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.360]  Collapse society.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360]  Defund the police.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.360]  Prosecute people that defend themselves.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.360]  Allstate drops California.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.360]  Will not write new insurance policies over wildfires,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.360]  joining more than 50 other insurance companies
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]  saying it's uninsurable.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.360]  That's when you're in a failed society.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.360]  Allstate will insure you in Mexico, in Guatemala,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.360]  but they will not insure you in Venezuela
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.360]  or North Korea or Somalia.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.639]  And you look at them and go, oh, they're mismanaging.
[00:25:28.639 --> 00:25:31.360]  No, they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]  Command destruction.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.000]  Here's another one.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.280]  America Today, a Starbucks where you can't sit, a Walgreens where you can't shop.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.920]  You have to come in, you can't sit down, you have to go to the window where everything
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.440]  is locked up in the store, and you go to a kiosk, and then a robot goes, and it goes
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.399]  on conveyor belts, is what they're building in many places, on the ceiling and comes to
[00:25:52.399 --> 00:25:53.399]  you.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.440]  They're putting these in all over the place that go down into these locked up cases.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:05.560]  It goes down and gets what you want, an apple, a pack of razors, aspirin, tampons, whatever
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.680]  it is you want.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.480]  And then the robot either goes and gets in on the ground or it goes and there's a conveyor
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.159]  belt that's on the ceiling that then takes it and drops it into your basket.
[00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:17.159]  No more checkers.
[00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:22.800]  And again, no one would have put up with this unless it's too dangerous to be there or to
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]  have a business.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.080]  It'll be so dangerous you can't leave your house, so then a robot again has to deliver
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:35.360]  it to your door, and it's all planned, and it's all right here in articles I've got.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.200]  They're making it a dystopia so you'll accept their so-called fix.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.920]  Oh, we locked everything down.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920]  Take the shot.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.920]  Oh, we locked everything down.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.399]  The third world collapsed from starvation.
[00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:45.399]  Now they're coming here.
[00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:47.080]  John Kerry says it's global warming.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]  That's why they're starving.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]  No one's on record.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.680]  The lockdowns are why they're starving.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.240]  All planned, all designed, and we sit here and we take it like fools.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240]  Look at this.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.800]  Exposed, how banks' investors make millions from police brutality bonds.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.360]  Did you know governments per major city invest hundreds of millions instead of schools or
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.720]  hospitals or libraries or jogging paths or bike paths?
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]  No.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.920]  In some cities up to 10 percent, now it's higher, of their budget is for police brutality
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.280]  bonds, and it turns out city officials are actually invested in the police brutality
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.920]  bonds, and they make money off these huge payouts of $50 million if somebody commits
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.879]  suicide in the jail cell.
[00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:33.600]  I've got more articles right here where they're proposing in San Francisco and in Chicago
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.520]  turning all these empty office buildings into government-assisted housing, but it'll be
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.080]  run by corporations and it'll be part of your universal basic income.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.159]  But to get you to accept it, you've got to have all your jobs taken.
[00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:47.920]  But then who's going to supply you with the food?
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.320]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.800]  From the U.S. to Canada to the Netherlands to Australia, they're shutting off a large
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]  part of the farms.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.000]  And John Kerry said last week, because farms are killing the earth, we've got to shut down
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.040]  farms to stop starvation, close quote.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]  That's right.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.400]  You've got to chop your head off so you don't bleed to death.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:12.000]  And they're just doing it, total assault, because we are a lost people.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.960]  We've been born into the technology, into running water, electricity, our houses, food abundance.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.159]  We just think it's always going to be there, and it's all being incrementally taken away
[00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:24.720]  from you and replaced with things that don't work, that aren't designed to fulfill.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.840]  But they make you think you're going to be fulfilled.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.320]  They make you think you're a leader.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.879]  They make you think you've got the answers.
[00:28:30.879 --> 00:28:35.520]  But you've been led into the deeper level of control as the noose gets tighter each
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]  time.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:45.200]  All right, our special guest, bestselling author, researcher, will be joining us, Kit
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.679]  Akin-Lively, and then Judy Michovitz, as well, the doctor, in the second hour.
[00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.200]  We've got so much to hit.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.639]  I've only scratched the surface of what we're hitting.
[00:28:53.639 --> 00:28:56.159]  It turns out Hillary Clinton's funding all these environmentalist terror groups.
[00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:57.159]  We've got that news as well.
[00:28:57.159 --> 00:28:58.159]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:05.159]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:11.440]  popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste, full of essential oils, back in stock and

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.360]  oil toothpaste, as well.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.440]  These are both incredible for your gums, polish your teeth, amazing to counter gingivitis,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.600]  and they fund the InfoWar.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.200]  There are no fillers in these products.

[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.400]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.800]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.159]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.679]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:12.080]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.200]  And it says, Political Prisoner, with an image of President Trump.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.679]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:21.760]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:28.440]  Political Prisoner, with Trump on the front there in a mug shot jail background.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.560]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.960]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.240]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.800]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.800]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.800]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800]  2024.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.040]  It's a fun, conversational piece, and a limited edition shirt.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.840]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:54.040]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mug shot shirts at infowarestore.com or by
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.480]  calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:06.440]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our children
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.679]  drinking that.
[00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:13.440]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.440]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.720]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.080]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.280]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.520]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.080]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.840]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.040]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.720]  leading competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]  filter your water.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.240]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.280]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.720]  The point is, you can get the filters at infowarestore.com.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.560]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.840]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.520]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]  The world said, no way.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]  He's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.920]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.879]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:16.080]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.040]  It's the same thing with InfoWars, but InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.440]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.159]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners, and when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:34.800]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.679]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:32:38.679 --> 00:32:42.080]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.440]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.720]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.560]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.520]  at the same time at infowarestore.com.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.520]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.480]  Go to infowarestore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.320]  these tyrants.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:07.360]  Reporting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:23.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:39.800]  Well, a lot of people come up to me, especially at this massive movie premiere last night,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.000]  and say, thank you for being persecuted for the truth, thank you for all you've done.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.440]  And every time they do it, I look at them and I say, listen, what I've been through
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:56.720]  is nothing compared to people like Julian Assange and so many others that have been
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.440]  locked up in solitary confinement, in some cases even killed for telling the truth.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.440]  And things are going to get a lot worse for everybody if we at some point don't begin
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:12.759]  to understand we've got a real case of tyranny coming down against humanity right now.
[00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:17.279]  And talking about Dr. Judy Michalich that's going to be joining us in studio with Kent
[00:34:17.279 --> 00:34:20.080]  Hechenleible in the next hour, Kent's here right now.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:26.240]  She was put in jail by Fauci for exposing him and has been totally vindicated.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.640]  And I didn't even know or I'd forgotten that Mickey Willis, who's a really good friend
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.640]  of mine now, I really respect him, he's got a great soul, a smart guy, that his brother
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:41.000]  got HIV and they gave him AZT and it killed him, which we know Fauci knew was killing people,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.120]  just like Rendezvous does with COVID.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.320]  So man, talk about skin in the game, all the persecution I've gone through, it's not
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.120]  as bad as what happened to Mickey Willis and his family.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:00.600]  Now my grandmother was told, back in the mid-1950s, my mother was four years old, she got the
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.400]  first round of the polio shot, then they gave her the live polio shot that you take
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400]  in your mouth.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.440]  And her doctor, when she got polio a week later and got paralyzed and almost died, she
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.000]  lived to 92 though, but was in a wheelchair most of the time, tough lady, she'd get up
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.800]  in crutches and do a lot of work, but usually get in a wheelchair if she was going somewhere
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.680]  because she couldn't walk more than a hundred yards with crutches because it ate up half
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.240]  the nerves in her body.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.120]  And the point is, is that her doctor told her, sorry, Benny, I think it was Benny Grace
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:35.560]  Hammond, sorry, Benny Grace, you got this from the vaccine, which they now admit.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.000]  And now they admit the number one cause of polio worldwide is Bill Gates's vaccine.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.880]  That's Reuters, that's AP.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.040]  So what's crazy is this stuff is hidden in plain view.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.680]  So we know that great evil, that great depopulation, that great reset is happening, it's been
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.960]  going on a long time, shocked the inventor, joked about his vaccine, gave him a bunch
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.680]  of people polio, said, oh, it's okay, there's too many people.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.680]  Look up the quote.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.240]  It's even on Boston PBS, his deputy admitting he did say that and made jokes about it.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.720]  Those are quotes in magazines.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.520]  You got to read Prince Charles saying he wants to kill the majority of us or Prince Philip.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.120]  You got to look this stuff up.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.320]  Yeah, there's AP, more polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.920]  Okay, so this isn't a game, all right?
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.800]  Mickey Willis' brother got killed by these people.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.279]  My grandmother got maimed for much of her beautiful life by it.
[00:36:20.279 --> 00:36:22.040]  This is big, this is serious.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.560]  So we know about their great tyranny.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.120]  So why have I been calling it for many, many years, the great awakening?
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.680]  And I'm getting a lot of people asking me, what does that mean?
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.400]  Well, there've been a lot of great awakenings throughout history.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.560]  And they called the Greeks and the Egyptians a great awakening of civilization.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.800]  And then you have the Protestant Reformation, they call, you know, as the first great awakening,
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800]  the second, the third.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.080]  Then you had blacks and white abolitionists after that great awakening, the 1700s, the
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.560]  1800s saying, we're not going to have human slavery anymore and leading the fight against
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.160]  slavery starting in England against the slave trade worldwide, and then against slavery
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.440]  here in the United States in the Civil War.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.320]  And so that was the third great awakening.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320]  But there've been others.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.120]  And depending on how you look at it, even before the quote, first, the 1730s, the big
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.759]  Protestant awakening, you have the great awakening of the beginning of the Renaissance,
[00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:11.360]  the Gutenberg Press, and the printing press.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.640]  And so I'm not saying this is an anti-Catholic movement, because seeing it as a great awakening,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.600]  that was against the power and the stagnation of that time.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.279]  The great awakening today is about fighting the new world order and the entire globalist
[00:37:22.279 --> 00:37:24.320]  program and bringing in a new Renaissance.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.400]  So Kent Hecken-Lively's here, I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he is a prolific
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.759]  writer, a top writer, kenthecken-livelybooks.com, he's written so many, I won't even try to
[00:37:33.759 --> 00:37:34.759]  go over them all.
[00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:36.960]  And he helped me write The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.600]  We're working together right now intently every day on the new book that we're going to announce
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.880]  here today, and that is The Great Awakening.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.000]  And he's here to give you the full breakdown on that.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.120]  It's up on infowars.com, live show feed.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.880]  The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.080]  He's got a bunch of other points he wants to go over as well.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.759]  But for anybody wondering where the great awakening came from, that is a term used in
[00:38:00.759 --> 00:38:03.640]  association for over 500 years with the Renaissance.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.440]  It is not a Q thing.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.680]  I notice the Qtards are out there attacking Mickey Willis in his movie saying, you know,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.720]  oh, that's something JFK Jr. invented and all this cuckoo land stuff.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.279]  Great Awakening means the fight against tyranny, humanity waking up, the Renaissance.
[00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:26.200]  I don't own it, you don't own it, no one owns it, it's about us waking up and saying no
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200]  to the system.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.440]  That's why I just gave you some background on what The Great Awakening means, and that's
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.759]  why without even thinking, six months ago, five months ago, we had the idea for The
[00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:34.759]  Great Awakening.
[00:38:34.759 --> 00:38:37.480]  Mickey Willis was in it a few months ago saying, please help me promote a new film, The Great
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480]  Awakening.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480]  We're not in competition.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.800]  We're all in The Great Awakening.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.160]  It's our movement, ladies and gentlemen, the human movement, a quest for a pro-human future.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.319]  So Kent, congratulations on all your great work, incredible premiere last night.
[00:38:50.319 --> 00:38:56.160]  We should probably talk some about that and then get into just what this Renaissance book
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.560]  means to you, and we're going to talk about your book, The Plague of Corruption, that
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.920]  helped lead to Mickey Willis' first pandemic film, and just so much of this Renaissance
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]  we've seen.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.400]  Yeah, so it's really great to be here, Alex, and I think we've got to take a moment and
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:19.400]  celebrate Chuck Todd's resignation from Meet the Press, because Chuck Todd has been my
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:27.040]  nemesis, because on May 17th, 2020, when this book, Plague of Corruption, and Mickey
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:34.120]  Willis' 26-minute pandemic video that I wrote the opening narrative for was screaming up
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:41.880]  the charts, Chuck Todd did an unconscionable five-minute segment where he never mentioned
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.279]  the name of the book, but he talked about conspiracy theories, and he talked about this
[00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:53.560]  book and this video, and he had somebody on from the Stanford Research Institute talking
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.800]  about the kindling of conspiracy theories.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:03.759]  So I think Chuck Todd is one of the most reprehensible people in all of broadcasting, and I celebrate
[00:40:03.759 --> 00:40:05.080]  his resignation.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.319]  I hope he goes and spends time with his family and never shows his face again in public.
[00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:13.520]  So we've got to celebrate the victories when they come, Alex.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.040]  Well, they're all dropping like flies.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.600]  Populist pro-human media is exploding despite censorship, and then everything they do turns
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600]  to pure crap.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.080]  I mean, CNN has 100,000 viewers on average now, and they have headlines about, can it
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]  be revived?
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080]  No way.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080]  It's over.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080]  They've lost.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:35.520]  Yeah, and you know, one of the books that I wrote was called This Was CNN with Project
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:44.279]  Veritas whistleblower Cary Porch, and Cary Porch entered CNN as a Bernie Sanders supporter,
[00:40:44.279 --> 00:40:49.080]  and the first job that he went and worked, the first job that he went and worked was
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.040]  the Charlottesville riots.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:58.840]  And so he saw what President Trump had said, and then he saw how CNN just completely changed
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.440]  the meaning, cut it up, edited it, and he went from a Bernie Sanders supporter to working
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:12.840]  for Project Veritas, showing all of the bias at CNN, and what we did in our book was we
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:21.600]  also found that more than 21 top employees at CNN had intelligence experience.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:26.880]  So when you wonder why the news that you're getting doesn't seem to reflect reality, I
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.440]  always say, you know, you're getting the intelligence news network.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.200]  That's what's happening with our media.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.880]  We confirmed that when they started it in the early 1980s, it was CIA funded, run, and
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.200]  used military satellites from the beginning.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.440]  So that's how they were able to do it.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.279]  There were not TV satellites for that type of thing for cable then.
[00:41:44.279 --> 00:41:45.600]  They used Pentagon satellites.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.480]  Yeah, and you know, another thing that we found out was that they have this incredible
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.640]  digital intelligence group of more than 220 employees, and when I talked to top experts
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.960]  in the digital world, they said they should only have like 20 or 30 of these people.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:07.920]  Why do they have this digital intelligence group, which is led by people who have military
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.880]  experience, you know, computer cyber warfare experience?
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.760]  You know, what is going on with the news media?
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.840]  The news media, so much of it can only be seen as an extension of the intelligence state.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.880]  And again, Obama legalized two years in his office through congressional legislation,
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.640]  lying to the American people using domestic propaganda.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.640]  We're going to skip this break, guys.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]  Yeah.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640]  Yeah.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.640]  So, yeah.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.440]  Alex is called the Global Engagement Center.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.560]  Now, this is what the government does when they want to pass something which is, you
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:49.240]  know, inconceivable, fun little name, like who doesn't want a global engagement center?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.640]  But you go and you look at the the details behind it and you find out that it allows
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.680]  them to lie to the people of the United States.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.440]  The first iteration of it had all of these protections, it was just supposed to be against
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]  the Islamic State.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.000]  It was just going to be against China and Russia.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.960]  And then, you know, a year or two later, they come out with an amendment and it allows
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.400]  them to go against any foreign, any.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.400]  Anybody they claim that's echoing foreign propaganda.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]  Yeah.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.520]  So if you wonder with no proof why they would say I'm a Russian agent or Trump is, which
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.000]  I know all of it was a fraud.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]  Yep.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.400]  And the CIA even covered its ass with internal reports saying it was a lie they won.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.600]  But they allowed it all to happen against us because we were actually the loyal Americans.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.920]  So again, China is the big anti-American player.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.200]  But if you look at the globalists, they're more in control of America and allied with
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.200]  China.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]  Yeah.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.760]  And, you know, one of the things that I think is that I've run across in our new book, The
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.760]  Great Awakening, is the fact that it used to be in America.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.080]  When you criticize the government, you were a patriot.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.760]  Harry Truman, during the midst of World War Two, had the Truman Commission, which looked
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.400]  at waste, fraud and abuse in the military budget.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.800]  And he was a hero.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.200]  And that is the reason that FDR put him on the ticket in 1944.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.760]  And so I say to myself, how can it be that in the midst of World War Two, nobody called
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:19.880]  Harry Truman pro-Hitler or pro-Mussolini or pro-Japanese?
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:26.840]  And so, you know, why is it that true patriots who are trying to fix this country are labeled
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.160]  with the traitor label?
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.520]  Let's expand on that.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.840]  Look at what's happening with Pfizer and Moderna and the hundred plus billion dollars
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.000]  last time I checked that Pfizer made, Moderna, I think it was like $25 billion.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.440]  That crew, look up the latest numbers.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.480]  What's the current number on what Pfizer and then Moderna made?
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.960]  It's over $100 billion on Pfizer and something like, I think, $20 billion last time I checked
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]  on Moderna.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.200]  But it's the exact same shot developed by the Pentagon.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.279]  They had them then manufacture it.
[00:44:55.279 --> 00:44:57.319]  All this started under Obama.
[00:44:57.319 --> 00:45:00.720]  And then if you questioned them, they would send out the CIA and Justice Department behind
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.319]  the scenes to silence you.
[00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:06.600]  Since when do we not want watchdogs, right or wrong, asking questions about something
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.640]  they're trying to mandate and make us take?
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.640]  That's just crazy.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.560]  And then Niels deGrasse Tyson, we'll play the clip next hour, gets up and says, science
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.080]  is not questioning the consensus.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:20.460]  Well, the consensus is some corporate board and censorship telling you it's a consensus.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.640]  You should question it.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.040]  But even if even if somebody says the moon is made of cheese, they don't get censored.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]  They have a right.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.400]  The consensus is not made of cheese.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.000]  We know it's not made of cheese, but still let the crazies have their rights or we lose
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]  ours.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.200]  But we weren't the crazies on the shots.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.480]  We had the top scientists from places like Pfizer that went public saying it will make
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.120]  you have a heart attack and die.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.120]  We tested this before.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:44.279]  Dr. Michael Yeenon, the inventor of MRNA, Robert Malone.
[00:45:44.279 --> 00:45:45.279]  So we had the experts.
[00:45:45.279 --> 00:45:48.600]  And Tyson goes, I don't listen to prestigious individuals.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600]  Really?
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.200]  Well, do you not listen to Rosa Parks that refuses to sit at the back of the bus?
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.680]  I mean, this idea that we don't have individuals, most of our major scientific achievement and
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.520]  development comes from challenging the orthodoxy as we learn more.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520]  You're a science teacher.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.760]  Can you explain this to them?
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.760]  Yeah.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.760]  Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.200]  So, you know, I've written four books with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who's really one of the
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.080]  most brilliant individuals I've ever come across.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.200]  But, you know, I can see how people could say she's outside the establishment, OK?
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.200]  She's a renegade.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.200]  OK.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.520]  So I wrote a book called Presidential Takedown with Dr. Paul Alexander, who was the senior
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:31.520]  pandemic advisor during COVID from approximately May of 2020 to September of 2020.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.520]  And the story he told was terrifying.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.800]  So, you know, for those of us who are on the outside of government, you know, and we think
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.800]  all of these things.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.180]  Well, in talking to him, who is an insider, it was terrifying because he was one floor
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.240]  below Project Warp Speed.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.500]  And so he was often interacting with those scientists and they would tell him how scared
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.400]  they were of the shots.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.859]  He would say and in looking who was in charge, he said, OK, there were government scientists
[00:47:01.859 --> 00:47:02.859]  there.
[00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:03.940]  There were corporate scientists.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.220]  There were intelligence people there.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.740]  And he said, you know, as I was trying to figure out who is really in charge of Warp
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:18.300]  Speed, it really seemed like the big pharma representatives were telling the intelligence
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.420]  agencies and the government scientists what to do.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.779]  So, I mean, that's an insider.
[00:47:22.779 --> 00:47:26.580]  And, you know, I asked him a lot of tough questions about, you know, what do you think
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.700]  was going on?
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.740]  You know, why did Trump not do this?
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.580]  And he said, you know, even in the inside, they were saying, you know, that he they they
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:40.460]  speculated that they there were threats against Trump's children, against Trump himself.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:47.859]  Well, in December of 2019, they had the emergency UN meeting in Switzerland of the UN body over
[00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:50.260]  vaccines and the deputy head of the WHO.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.400]  And she said, hey, our doctors are faltering.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.900]  The shots worldwide are killing people.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.700]  The polio shots are killing people.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.700]  We showed AP earlier.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.600]  And she said, we've got to do something.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.940]  We're not testing any of this.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.700]  Big Pharma tells us what to do.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.240]  We're not in charge.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.760]  As she was speaking, they'd already released covid to create such a new big story.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.319]  It would cover up the fact that the UN itself and I made a big deal about this in December
[00:48:11.319 --> 00:48:14.960]  19, 2019, three and a half, four years ago.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.720]  And we made a huge deal here, but no one paid attention to it.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.000]  It's two day conference with the head of the vaccine program saying we don't know what's
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000]  in it.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.160]  This is before before the MRNA.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.359]  So they were collapsing at that point.
[00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:32.100]  They had to have a bigger crisis to cover up the last crisis.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.100]  That's my concern.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.960]  Now they're seeing a new virus is coming.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]  They're getting ready for the next one.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.380]  That's why.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.100]  This war against tyranny is so important.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:44.020]  And so pre-sales of a book are critical to how many stores pick it up, how big it goes.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.900]  The last book that we co-wrote together, you knocked it out of the park with a lot of research.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.300]  This was going to be even more powerful, thicker, longer.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.779]  The information, but then how to stop them.
[00:48:53.779 --> 00:48:58.140]  OK, that's why it's the great awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.140]  renaissance.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.580]  I'd say 60 percent of the book is the history, the enemy, what they did, what they're doing,
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060]  what they're going to do.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.420]  And the rest is solutions and the power we have to counter them.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:11.220]  But I'm telling you, the end of the last pandemic, as I predicted, I said within a month they'll
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.819]  announce they ended it to declare victory so they can tell you another one's coming.
[00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:19.460]  Exactly as I said, Tedros and the W.H.O. one month later came out and announced victory.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.460]  Did a great job.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.140]  Let us be in charge of the next one.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.100]  And the next one's going to be much bigger and target children.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.140]  They talk to you like you're an idiot, like you've been hypnotized so that when it happens,
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.640]  you think, oh, they're so smart.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.060]  They know exactly what's happening.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.900]  They tell you what's happening in Operation Lockstep and the rest of it because they're
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.900]  executing it and they get caught.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.420]  They say, oh, it's just a drill.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.420]  It's just a tabletop.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:44.180]  No, it's a manual, an attack profile on how they're executing an operation like a bombing
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.180]  run.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.180]  That's what an attack profile is.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:52.180]  So we're sitting here looking at this and it is, again, beyond critical to understand
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.020]  that we're in an information war and that we've had major victories, we've got major beachheads,
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.020]  but now is the time.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:02.500]  So go to InfoWars.com, under the live show feed, there's a link to Amazon.com.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.660]  Get The Great Awakening, my new book.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.420]  The book, I would say, is what, 80% done?
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.420]  Yep.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.859]  And we're going to be working to more today, tomorrow.
[00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:09.859]  We're working over the phone.
[00:50:09.859 --> 00:50:15.580]  We talk all the time and it's been so collaborative and he takes what I say to him, he records
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.580]  interviews.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.580]  He goes and vets it and checks it.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:23.220]  And I'm not bragging, but I think you said like 95%, 98% of what I've told you, you found
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.779]  word for word's been accurate.
[00:50:24.779 --> 00:50:28.300]  Sometimes I kind of conflate things, but you're helping me get it right.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.300]  Yeah.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.500]  I call myself the Alex Jones bird dog.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.980]  You shoot the thing and I run into the tall grass to see if I can find it and 95, 98%
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.100]  of the time it's there.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.300]  What are some of the things you couldn't find and I'll guarantee I can dig them out?
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.300]  The flea story.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:49.940]  Well, that one I said to you, no one's sure if this is accurate, but it's a good allegory.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.940]  It's a great allegory.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.940]  Yeah.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.300]  That was it.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:51:03.220]  When you're talking about chickens and hawks flying over and never having seen a hawk before
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:09.740]  and they get scared, I was able to find research about that on ducks, but not on chickens.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.580]  Very minor differences.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.500]  And I forget the rat study.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.500]  What's the famous rat study?
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.500]  The mouse utopia.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.500]  The mouse utopia is awesome.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.500]  And that's in there?
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.500]  Oh yeah.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.500]  100%.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.460]  Because the globalists, that's their model for us.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.460]  That is terrifying.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.460]  Explain it.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.460]  They create the artificial utopia.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.460]  No, and then what?
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.020]  Four or five generations, we all extinct each other.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:34.700]  In the mouse utopia, what they do is they basically remove any stresses from the mice.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:42.060]  There's no predation going on, but there's overcrowding and the overcrowding seems to
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:48.020]  drive some of the mice to become hermits.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:54.899]  What will happen is usually in a regular rat colony, there are alpha males.
[00:51:54.899 --> 00:51:58.980]  And so the alpha males then have access to their breeding harem.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:07.420]  But because everybody's together, what happens is those who fail to mate keep fighting with
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.420]  the alphas.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.260]  Because in a usual colony, those who lose will leave.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.980]  So the alpha males are too stressed out.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.100]  They don't breed with the females.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.640]  So the colony starts to die.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.460]  You have some of these really strange, and I'm trying to think of exactly the expression
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.460]  they use.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.859]  Pedophilia, transgenderism, it all happens.
[00:52:27.859 --> 00:52:33.899]  They've got these mice who are constantly preening themselves and looking beautiful.
[00:52:33.899 --> 00:52:38.100]  And then the females come up to them, but these males don't want to breed.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.620]  So you find yourself saying, well, what the hell is going on?
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.420]  So much of what we see in society, I mean, with the transgenderism and so many of these
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.460]  other things, and the young people not getting married, not having kids.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.779]  Not wanting to learn how to drive a car.
[00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:53.779]  That's just sitting there.
[00:52:53.779 --> 00:52:54.779]  Not having sex.
[00:52:54.779 --> 00:52:58.460]  You know, I'm sorry.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:04.620]  Something's going on, and it's questionable whether our society is actually heading towards
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.620]  species collapse.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:12.260]  And for folks who don't know, you say you're a big science writer and a bestselling author
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.180]  and a science teacher, and I call that a scientific mind.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.180]  You say I'm not a scientist.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.700]  But looking at this, from the science I've read, and I'm not a scientist either, but
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.420]  I've read a lot about it, rats medically, if they give us drugs, give them, are more
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.620]  accurate to give them drugs to see the effect than, say, a chimpanzee that they claim we're
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.740]  closer to.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.740]  We're also very close to pigs.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.220]  That's why we can get pig hearts that are rejected.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.220]  So we know in behavior and everything, we're very close to rats.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:41.020]  And now real society is marrying these 1960s, 70s, and 80s rat studies and mice studies
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.020]  that were duplicated.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.020]  Yeah.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.020]  Yeah.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.020]  A hundred percent.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:49.700]  Well, that's just some of what's in the new book, The Great Awakening.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:54.700]  You can find it at Amazon.com and normally, you know, whatever, Jeff Bezos doesn't matter.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.140]  The point is, it's the real New York Times bestseller list.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.020]  So yes, the book that I co-wrote with Kent Heckin Lively, The Great Reset and the War
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.779]  for the World did go to number one for about two weeks on the New York Times.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.340]  So they said, we choose not even listed.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.740]  If they would have listed, it would have got picked up more places and sold more, but that's
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.740]  okay.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.300]  It was still a bestseller and it was in the top of the charts for six months.
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.899]  You can still get a copy of it or sign copy of it at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:16.899 --> 00:54:21.380]  But the only place to get this in pre-order right now is Amazon.com.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.380]  We'll put it back on screen.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.700]  It is The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.700]  You need to get it.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.859]  The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:54:29.859 --> 00:54:33.300]  And you better believe once this goes to number one again, there'll be 20 other titles of
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.700]  the same name, which I want.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.100]  Because The Great Awakening belongs to everyone that wants to have a free, open, powerful,
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.100]  pro-human society.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.300]  But Kent, you were excited about the last book.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.140]  You are really excited about this one.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.660]  We were already past 300 pages weeks ago and we've decided, how long is this baby going
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.660]  to be?
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.540]  Because we're adding pages every day.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.540]  Yeah.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.980]  So I think it's going to be 275, 300 pages.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.980]  We're already at 300.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.980]  You're going to cut some out?
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:02.300]  Is the publisher giving us trouble?
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.300]  The publisher is not giving us trouble.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.859]  I don't think we'll have any trouble with that.
[00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:05.859]  I think we should.
[00:55:05.859 --> 00:55:09.980]  We were at 300 a few days, a week or so ago.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:10.980]  240, probably.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.140]  Well, I thought, well, you were, I guess you're telling on the phone it's going to be longer
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.300]  because I'm giving you so many recordings.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.300]  Yeah.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.100]  So the first book was 55,000 words.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.940]  I'm at 75,000 right now.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.700]  I'm expecting it to go probably 80,000.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.700]  Okay.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.700]  So that's, so it is bigger.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:28.700]  I just got to, okay.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:29.700]  So I just want to.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:30.700]  Yeah.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.700]  Yeah.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.540]  Well, you know, it, what is so amazing about this book is it feels like it's writing itself,
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:42.540]  you know, in going to see, uh, the great awakening, Mickey Willis's film, you know,
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:49.380]  here I have been in this world for 15 years and I'm learning things that I did not learn.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:55.180]  And so every day as I'm working on this book, I am learning new things and I think it's
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.340]  just going to be great for people to read.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.140]  And, you know, I, I think reading a different experience than a show or a video.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:08.140]  And so I'm really hoping that, uh, you know, I, I heard this joke the other day that, uh,
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:12.380]  you know, people saying, don't do your own research.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.819]  And this comedian said, didn't that used to be called reading?
[00:56:16.819 --> 00:56:20.540]  That was the New York times and a bunch of the publications said, do not.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.460]  That was, uh, what's that guy's name, Charlie Worzel.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.300]  He wrote an article saying, do not do your own research.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]  It's bad and dangerous.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.460]  You're in a cult when somebody says, don't question, don't go outside the building and
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.460]  don't look up at the stars.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.580]  You know, don't read a book.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.340]  I mean, you're in a fricking cult, man.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.340]  Yeah.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.580]  And so, so the comedian was saying something like, so if you go to buy a car, are you going
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:44.620]  to do some research on it or is your buddy going to say, Hey, don't do research on the
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:45.620]  car.
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.980]  And then you'll go, well, how do I find out about the car?
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.980]  And he says, well, ask the salesman cause he's the expert.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.700]  And that's what, that's what, that's what Neil deGrasse Tyson said.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.819]  And so what I'm really hoping with, with, you know, listen, we're going to go into
[00:57:00.819 --> 00:57:01.819]  the next hour.
[00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:03.980]  Judy, Michael, that's your favorite person is going to be in here.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:04.980]  One of my favorite.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.220]  We're going to talk about everything.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.140]  We'll talk about that coming up, but I'm going to get in trouble if I don't fund info wars,
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.140]  info war store.com.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.180]  I got chewed out just a few days ago.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.180]  I was not bringing enough money in.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.180]  Plus he's a great product.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.180]  You need, you wanted to plug Rainforest.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.180]  Do you like Rainforest?
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.180]  Yeah.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.180]  Yeah.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.140]  So how do I, my name is Ken Hickenlovely.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.660]  How do I write all the books that I do for books with Dr. Judy, Mike of it's four books
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:30.779]  with project Veritas, whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones.
[00:57:30.779 --> 00:57:34.140]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:38.980]  I take this and I'm good to go for the next five or six hours fighting the deep state.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]  All right.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]  We love you.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.620]  Get your brain force plus brain force, ultra and turbo force at info war store.com.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.620]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.620]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.620]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.620]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.620]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.620]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.620]  five, six, seven days a week.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:55.620]  It's just amazing.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.620]  It's amazing.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.620]  It's amazing.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.620]  It's amazing.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:59.620]  It's amazing.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:01.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:09.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:14.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.620]  It's amazing.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.620]  So from myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:25.620]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.620]  support us.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]  I know you spread the word.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.620]  I know you pray for us.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620]  That's wonderful.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]  Keep doing it.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.660]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:37.819]  You never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping
[00:58:37.819 --> 00:58:38.819]  us on air.
[00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:42.620]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:47.380]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.380]  will be over.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.380]  Please take action now.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.940]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.020]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.060]  It will change your life.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.740]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.779]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:10.260]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:16.020]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:20.319]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:26.420]  And InfoWarsStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.420]  effect.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.420]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[00:59:33.819 --> 00:59:36.420]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.620]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.940]  You and your family need it.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.140]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.140]  X3.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.460]  Try iodine exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.460]  Take action now.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.460]  But regardless, research is info.
[00:59:49.460 --> 01:00:02.460]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.220]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.580]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:16.899]  Best-selling author Kent Heckin-Lively and a really smart guy is here in studio.
[01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:21.540]  I'm trying to convince him to change his flight from tomorrow morning to tomorrow evening back
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.460]  to the beautiful place he lives there in California wine country, but I have been unable to get
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.460]  him to do that.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460]  We'll see.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.460]  He's told me an incredible story behind the scenes.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.180]  I understand why he probably has to go, but you're welcome to stay and come on for an
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.340]  hour tomorrow, and I'm sure you can get on Owen's show and on Harrison Smith's show,
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:41.740]  but you did a great plug for Brain Force Plus, but you got cut off by the break, so we'll
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.500]  actually run it as an ad, but maybe spend a minute, two minutes, your experience with
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500]  this nootropic.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:52.380]  Yeah, so I've published 12 books.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:58.740]  I've got four in press now coming out in the next year, and what I always need is I always
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:05.340]  need some sort of boost in the morning, so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins,
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:10.740]  but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:15.740]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:22.220]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff, so it really is true that brain
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.660]  force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.980]  Well, it's just a good, stable base for energy that won't conflict with coffee or tea or
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980]  other things.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.740]  It won't conflict with people's medications in most cases.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.160]  It's a good, safe, natural nootropic with other key vitamins and minerals and amino acids
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.540]  that are known to boost thought.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:47.060]  Then we've got brain force ultra that is super fast-acting within 15 minutes, and it only
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.220]  lasts about two, three hours.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.500]  I said, I want some super fast-acting, clean thing, but I've got to stay up late.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.340]  I'm tired, say at eight o'clock, take it to an interview, be done at midnight, and go
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020]  right to sleep.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.500]  That's what ultra does, and then there's turbo force that's 10 hours of clean energy, five
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.660]  different natural stimulants that time release and a bunch of amino acids and other compounds,
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.899]  so it's like the flame-breathing dragon crazy time deal.
[01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:13.500]  If you've got to put on, say, a five-hour rock concert, you've got to get ready for
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:19.460]  five hours before, but then brain force plus is just the base, and then brain force ultra
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:26.140]  is that literal, special thing that has ... I mean, I see it as almost like a psychotropic.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:32.060]  It doesn't make you get high or anything, but it's amazing, so get them all at infowarestore.com
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.899]  or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:37.420]  People say, why do you have three nootropics?
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.819]  Well, because there's different genres, there's different areas.
[01:02:41.819 --> 01:02:46.859]  There's the hydrogen bomb, there's the sniper rifle, and then there's the sword, but there
[01:02:46.859 --> 01:02:48.980]  are a lot of different things, different ways.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:55.580]  We take them together, look out, available infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:59.700]  Now, Kent, we're in this little no-man's land before we go to break and bring in Judy
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.220]  Michalowicz, who's just such a patriot and such a hero.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.740]  Spend a minute and a half or so, because we're going to run this as well, explain to people
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.899]  what this new book that I'm writing with you is going to break down.
[01:03:11.899 --> 01:03:16.700]  The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:21.819]  You know, Alex, I think that what people really need is some hope.
[01:03:21.819 --> 01:03:26.580]  They need to understand what's going on with the world, but then they want to read something
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.580]  positive.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:36.580]  Time and time again, in every chapter that I'm working on, I find the hand of God moving
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.380]  our world in a positive direction.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.620]  I look at what's happening in the political world.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:49.899]  You have Trump staying strong against the other rhinos, you have RFK Jr. rescuing the
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:57.100]  Democratic Party and returning it to the honor of people like Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy,
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:02.460]  and then you've got the new generation, Vivek Ramaswamy, showing that the American dream
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.700]  is still alive.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.740]  In every aspect of when I think I'm going into a chapter and I'm wondering if it's going
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.859]  to be dark, I find this incredible light.
[01:04:12.859 --> 01:04:21.020]  When I was going into the fact that you all know that Harari talks about useless eaters,
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:25.100]  and I hear the dog whistle of genocide when he says it.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.779]  That's a Hitler statement.
[01:04:27.779 --> 01:04:34.340]  The useless eaters, and the way he's selling it is he's selling it as, well, what we're
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.340]  going to have to do with people is we're going to have to give them drugs and computer games.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.420]  So Mark Zuckerberg comes around with meta.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]  What does he do?
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.779]  He loses billions on it.
[01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:45.779]  People totally reject it.
[01:04:45.779 --> 01:04:50.859]  If you go back to Why the Future Didn't Need Us, a big article in Wired magazine by the
[01:04:50.859 --> 01:04:55.580]  head of some microsystems 23 years ago, they met at a big computer meeting and decided
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:05.020]  to give us computer games and drugs instead of killing us.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.500]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.460]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.460]  It is.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.940]  If you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.180]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.819]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:26.420]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.420]  You want something like this?
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.420]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.420]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.420]  It's so good, in my view.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.540]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.420]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.940]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:47.460]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.899]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[01:05:50.899 --> 01:05:53.260]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.260]  I just can't do it.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.260]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:22.060]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.060]  Breaking news.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.060]  The president declaring a national emergency.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.300]  A new stay-at-home order.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.580]  We will shut you down.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.020]  Don't think you can get on a plane or a train.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.819]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:06:33.819 --> 01:06:35.340]  And we will take you to jail.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.779]  We've got to get them vaccinated.
[01:06:37.779 --> 01:06:41.899]  Or we will keep you in a facility longer.
[01:06:41.899 --> 01:06:48.020]  As the world was descending into synchronized tyranny, I began to ask myself, how did they
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.100]  get everyone to go along with this?
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.100]  Oh, it feels so good.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100]  I know.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.500]  And just with finding the answer, I began studying every moment in recorded history where
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:03.460]  masses of people acted against their own self-interest.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:11.100]  The only mechanism that could explain what was happening in society was what is usually
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.580]  referred to as mass formation.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:19.460]  We are now in an economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity for a reset.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:24.300]  Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished heads of state and government, the future is built
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.300]  by us.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.220]  We need a great reset.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:35.420]  When they say, you'll be happy, what they mean is, you'll be enslaved.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:40.580]  Today we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:46.180]  Who masters those technologies will be the master of the world.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:55.580]  Those who control the data control the future, not just of humanity, but the future of life itself.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:00.019]  Every aspect of our life has been infiltrated by people that do not have our best interests
[01:08:00.019 --> 01:08:01.019]  at heart.
[01:08:01.019 --> 01:08:05.100]  There are forces using fear and isolation to induce mass psychosis.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.460]  I don't want you to be hopeful.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.740]  Environmental bill fires.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740]  I want you to panic.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:09.740]  Storms.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.740]  It will kill your children.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.740]  I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:12.740]  People are starting to wake up.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740]  They're starting to wake up.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:14.740]  Across the world.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:24.940]  I'm seeing people come together from all walks of life, finally saying enough is enough.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.300]  We didn't come here for no reason.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.300]  We have a voice.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.300]  We're here to share it.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.300]  We have to be the solution.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.019]  We cannot rely on the media, the president or whoever to fix these problems.
[01:08:33.019 --> 01:08:37.700]  I would rather pick up cans on the side of the highway than to live out of alignment
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.700]  with my truth.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:41.820]  We're all being driven back to the dream.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:47.260]  As you see in the audience, Democrats, Republicans, white, black, everyone all in between.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:51.940]  This is the example that they do not want to see, but they have no choice.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:56.820]  The masses of humanity have been slapped awake.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:57.820]  Open your eyes.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:04.580]  It's time to wake up.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:09.260]  This is the great awakening.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.100]  People cannot go back into the matrix now.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.780]  A lot of people are trying to.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780]  They can't.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780]  Psst.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780]  Pass it on.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:43.700]  Well, we're now into our number two of this live Sunday worldwide broadcast, the establishment's
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.260]  battle to keep off the air.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.540]  But evil's not the only force in the universe.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.540]  Good is there because of you.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.540]  Viewers and listeners, because of your support, your word about the prayers.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:56.580]  We're still here in many ways, stronger than ever, though scarred, but certainly stronger
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:57.580]  than ever.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.019]  Dr. Judy Megavitz is here with us.
[01:10:00.019 --> 01:10:01.980]  She's got an incredible bio.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:07.540]  She's a former political prisoner put in prison by Fauci for exposing his plans.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.000]  The real Dr. Judy dot com.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.260]  And it was Kent who's here and was her co-author, heckin lively, that helped get the first what
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.820]  became bestselling book out.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:23.500]  And there have now been several he's written with her that then inspired Mickey Willis,
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.460]  who was already a very successful Hollywood director, but who'd woken up to make the first
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.620]  plan to make now the second.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.620]  Now the third.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.620]  They've all been powerful.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.700]  But the third one is incredible.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.380]  So Dr. Judy Megavitz, I really appreciate you.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.620]  It was amazing last night.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.840]  You feel like we're winning and we've turned the corner, even though the enemy's planning
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.840]  new attacks.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.740]  Give us your take on the film and why it's so important.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.140]  The last film's been seen by hundreds of millions of people.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:52.300]  This one is destined to reach tens of millions, bare minimum, probably more.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:56.220]  You seem very, very upbeat right now that the enemy's in a lot of trouble and we see
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.380]  evidence of this all over the news.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:03.700]  Even MSNBC and CNBC reporting that, OK, Jamie Foxx took the shot and might kill him.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.780]  I mean, the dam has broken.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.780]  Where do you see this going?
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.100]  Where are we in history?
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.780]  Well, we are at that renaissance.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.660]  We are at that great awakening.
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.260]  And I did just buy the book, by the way, while I was sitting in the green room.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:21.860]  We are at that renaissance and at that great awakening that we have won this.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.519]  It's not we're winning.
[01:11:23.519 --> 01:11:26.300]  It's when we can talk to each other and see the perspective.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:31.460]  And what was really interesting, why I am so upbeat about the film last night was how
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.860]  Mickey did it in the rough cut formats and then listened to the audience and looked
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.780]  at the audience perspective.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.700]  So he was panning the audience as they were watching real time, what G. Edward Griffin
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.300]  was telling us in the 1960s, 70s, 80s.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:54.580]  So it goes back to HIV AIDS and it shows you COVID and it shows you same playbook.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.940]  And they killed the director's brother.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.700]  I mean, you start getting it starts coming home how bad they've hurt us.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.700]  Yeah.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.700]  My grandmother paralyzed.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.860]  Her daughter told her from the polio oral.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:10.540]  But what we showed was even through the injury, even through the sensor, if we keep talking
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.940]  to each other and we keep looking at the perspective, you said right there and then, Mickey Willis,
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:20.980]  you know, his brother died of AIDS, but that was AZT.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:26.100]  But when Mickey and I sat down and talked about our story, our this this whole story
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.340]  through plague of corruption, it was supposed to be a promotional video and we sat for weeks
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.860]  and I talked about my arrest and my jailing and nothing hit him.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.300]  And then one day he said, you know, my brother died of AZT.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.460]  And I said without missing a beat, I said, don't you mean AIDS?
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:46.660]  And we looked up at each other and we looked up at each other and we both just.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.860]  And then I stopped myself and I said, oh, no, he was an antibody positive.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.260]  He wasn't immune.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.700]  He wasn't injected when he was already infected.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.100]  And we both just and Mickey's just slowly shaking his head.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.180]  So here here he was hired to make a promotional video for the book.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.180]  That's what he does.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.180]  He makes movies.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.380]  And all of a sudden he knows you're telling the truth.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.380]  This happened to his brother.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.300]  And then he starts sharing with you.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.700]  And then it becomes films.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.700]  It becomes all this.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.980]  It's reached hundreds of millions of people.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.540]  Boy, I bet I bet Fauci isn't feeling too good right now, knowing that his name is destroyed.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.540]  He may never be convicted.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.220]  I hope he is put in prison.
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:24.260]  But regardless, he's been convicted in the court of global public opinion as a mass murdering
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.140]  Joseph Mingala 2.0.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.140]  Yeah.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:31.660]  And what's important about that is showing the perspective brilliantly in the show last
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.660]  night.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:38.660]  Watch it when you show it again in an hour, because Fauci is only portrayed is what he
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:46.940]  did in AIDS and then compared to 1986 to 2000 and 20, the same playbook.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.060]  Any criminologist will tell you, particularly the higher functioning psychopaths, follow
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.660]  exact crimes and do them over and over again, exactly the same.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.740]  And nowhere could you say this is an anti-vaxxer meeting.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:04.460]  You don't he doesn't show any of the doctors, not Dr. Tenpenny, not Paul Thomas, not Andy
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.960]  Wakefield, not Judy Mankiewicz.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.900]  He doesn't show any of that.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:16.060]  And the Robert Malone's or the Frank Rossetti's, our book, Ending Plague, the staunch NCI,
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.780]  all of a sudden are coming through and saying, yeah, when they can hear us, when they can
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.780]  listen.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:23.620]  So it wasn't that they could see us.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.260]  It's that they could hear us.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.140]  We have been silent so long, censored so long.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:36.400]  You know, what has been so exciting for me in this journey with Judy is Judy was the
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.580]  original gangster, OK?
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:44.140]  She was the first one out there, 2014, when our book came out and we went after Fauci
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.140]  in it.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.820]  Nobody was hearing us about Fauci.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.360]  Now the whole world knows about Fauci.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.740]  With our second book together, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. writes the foreword for it.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:01.900]  And he's running for president and he is tied against Biden and he's tied against Biden.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:10.720]  So how much do I see the hand of God working in our world that brave people are like Judy
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.460]  are standing up like you, Alex?
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:20.460]  I mean, I am so incredibly proud to have my name on the book with you, because I feel
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:27.740]  like I am making the decision to get in that plane with you, fly through the flack and
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.980]  get destroyed the target of the deep state.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.500]  And I appreciate you going next level, getting into Judy and you, because I mean, it's not
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.580]  about praise here, but it's about victory.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.620]  You write the book with her.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.860]  It gets turned into films.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.019]  I mean, there's five or 10 things that really helped devastate the globalist operation and
[01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:47.260]  their whole new world order rollout.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.780]  It's been Judy and you.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.420]  So how good does that feel?
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.960]  Just from not a pride position, but a satisfaction of knowing that you guys have really torn
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.320]  up the new world order and saved hundreds of millions of lives because they would have
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  kept this rolling forever.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]  They're planning it again.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.180]  I think they're going to strike again, but still, at least we're going to know it's them
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.180]  the next time.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.780]  And I think that will sign their death warrant.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.780]  But you see, all we did was trust in God and true science and not a cult called scientism.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.620]  And when we speak that truth in love and find a way to talk to each other and see their
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:29.340]  perspective that I, as a 25 year old in 1983, didn't see when I got angry at Fauci and anger
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:36.700]  and arrogance took the day and fear of a, you know, a big boss telling a 25 year old
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.700]  what to do.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.900]  So I swore at him and almost lost another job when you, when you look at, and then it
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:49.780]  took until 2019 sitting in a chair with Mickey and my gut scientific response was still, don't
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780]  you need AIDS?
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780]  And it was my work.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:52.780]  That's right.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.019]  You were working on a book when she came out, exposing Fauci and pandemics and control
[01:16:56.019 --> 01:16:59.460]  of them and drugs that kill you, not the, not the virus, right.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.540]  As they were getting ready to release it and roll all this out.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.540]  Yeah.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:03.540]  Correct.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.540]  Yeah.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]  That's the perfect timing of God though.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540]  Yeah.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.260]  God was loading her into the chamber to be fired at the new world order right before
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.260]  they launched.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.260]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:18.220]  And so, you know, the story I always tell is that plague of corruption was meant to
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.540]  release in November of 2019.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.740]  And because Robert F. Kennedy jr.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.420]  Was taken time with the forward.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.260]  The publisher decided to kick it to April for two hours.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.260]  Judy knows this.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.420]  I was like mad as hell about this.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:36.860]  And I, then I felt like there was this voice that said to me, just relax.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:42.960]  And then it came out April 4th, 15th, 2020.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.060]  Everybody saw how we had looked at what happened with chronic fatigue syndrome, what had happened
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.900]  with autism, the lies told about HIV.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:58.840]  And suddenly everybody saw the game plan of this medical model that had come out in November.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]  That wouldn't have happened.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.320]  It came out right during the hysteria.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320]  Yeah.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320]  It just went.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.519]  But there's even more God in it than that.
[01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:11.440]  Because the reason Bobby didn't understand was when the forward was drafted.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.360]  We didn't add the last chapter.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.480]  And one day I asked Bobby in the fall, because I'm worried about it because I know what the
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.840]  last chapter is.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.320]  I know the day I saw them take it off the internet and that is the NIH and it was the
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.480]  middle of August.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.640]  It's told in our book ending plague.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.200]  And so I'm getting worried that we're both going to get killed because it didn't have
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.800]  a dead man's trigger.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.200]  So I just so quickly, somebody, Mickey explained to me what that was.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.600]  And I just called Kent and said, okay, maybe there's one last story we should tell you.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.519]  But that one last story was, well, I'll tell you then.
[01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:49.240]  So Bobby, I said, Bobby, how can I help?
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.720]  And he said, Judy, there's something missing.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.560]  I said, Bobby, I know you're busy.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.980]  Read the last chapter.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.260]  And he called me about a week later and he said, oh, congratulation, because he saw the
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.620]  last chapter.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.820]  He saw that we had every sample.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.500]  We saved every piece of data.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.660]  We had it in freezers.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.980]  Godly men had the courage not to throw out the evidence.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:11.980]  We've got them all.
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.519]  And they saw that in the summer of 19.
[01:19:14.519 --> 01:19:16.500]  So they had to cover it up.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.980]  And in that six months we needed to set the stage for Mickey Willis.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.380]  And of course, right at the time this is happening, the UN had an emergency meeting saying everything
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.380]  was about to come out.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.380]  Yeah.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.380]  I was scared to death.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.860]  And Bobby called me.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.600]  I'm driving in L.A. with my husband.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.260]  And Bobby called me and said, congratulations.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.820]  And I said, don't congratulate me.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.820]  Kent wrote it.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.740]  And he instantly hung up.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.540]  So folks are getting the major inside baseball right now, obviously, with the top, quote,
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:48.300]  anti-vaxxer, really just the truth teller, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., working with Judy
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.100]  Megavitz and Kent on this incredible information.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:56.140]  And that's why you saw the panic at the UN saying we're about to all be brought down.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.540]  They said, B.S., release the virus.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:19:59.540]  It'll get rid of Trump.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.300]  And then you but now it's backfired on them.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.300]  Desperation leads to desperation.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.300]  They're going to try something else.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.260]  We're going to talk about it all on the other side.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.260]  Stay with us.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.260]  But what?
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.420]  Yeah, we just skipped a break.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.420]  We just skipped a break.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.580]  So we are now back.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:16.700]  Some stations jumped away from us for minutes.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.220]  I wanted to come back for the few stations that cover that up.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:20.220]  Most of them don't.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.220]  Most of them skip the break.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.220]  Go with us.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.140]  That's a network break that I was just skipping.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:28.060]  Please continue with what I want to tell you the next thing, because there's another piece
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.060]  of God.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:34.820]  And it was so brilliant in the film last night, because nowhere in that film is there an anti-vaxxer
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:37.700]  scientist of any kind, especially not me.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.220]  And all you have to do.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.860]  So you can't say Bobby Kennedy's anti-vaxxer.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.740]  He's environmental safety.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:48.180]  He's true wellness and health and keeping water, air and soil.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.180]  No, no.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.180]  I know they call everybody anti-vaxxers.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:56.140]  It's vaccines have just become a way to put something secret in our bodies.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.420]  It has nothing to do with even the original science of, quote, inoculation.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:05.660]  Why not as a scientist, a vaccine expert, explain to them what this cult of scientism
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.380]  is, which is a real term, folks, the cult of people claiming they're scientists saying
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.980]  don't question them versus the real scientific method.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.100]  Well, it's the whole, you know, you believe us.
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.980]  You believe the consensus.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.180]  It's we decide science isn't democratic.
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.540]  Science is data.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.580]  And so they put statistics to data.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:28.260]  And if it doesn't match a certain power or when they review the journals, everything
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.900]  about it is fraud.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:35.220]  Because if you have an idea that that is that jump, they have a consensus that you're then
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.980]  supposed to then agree and always have your research agree with the consensus put up by
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:39.980]  the corporations.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.060]  So then they keep promoting you and giving you money because you've given them control.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.540]  Or it's not funded.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:49.820]  So if your idea isn't among the consensus, no matter how much data you have or the papers
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.820]  aren't published.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.980]  And if you don't publish, you perish.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:22:00.900]  It's just in and Fauci set up that whole system in the 90s, right after 1993 with with the
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:01.900]  peer review.
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.140]  Here's an example.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:09.019]  Take zero point energy, which thousands of universities and tens of thousands of regular
[01:22:09.019 --> 01:22:16.220]  people have done with magnets on a low scale and proved you can do it now wide scale.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:17.220]  Will it work?
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.980]  Well, I'm sure we can develop a way, but certainly it's real.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.360]  The physics show it's real.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.940]  But because they put out a story 30 years ago saying it wasn't true.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.380]  The consensus is you can't have that energy and then it just totally suppresses that whole
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.380]  area.
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.460]  And in medicine, it's take a drug, use it in the wrong person, at the wrong dose, in
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.740]  the wrong time, in the wrong formulation.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.540]  As Frank Rossetti writes in Ending Plague, run a big, expensive trial.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.380]  If you're a company, it becomes dog shit and they never use it again.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380]  Right.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.380]  That was sermon.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.180]  That was a hundred year old essential medicine.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.580]  They use it at such high a dose.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:52.700]  They didn't appreciate the mechanism of it.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.740]  And maybe we couldn't have because our technology was advanced.
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:00.900]  But Bob Navio did a double blind placebo controlled study 2015.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.540]  And I consented the kids into it.
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:06.500]  25 kids and we found the needle in a haystack.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:11.460]  When we see the biology and you have true biology, we can teach this and we can heal
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.060]  everybody from nothing.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.060]  That's why I'm so optimistic.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.019]  What they're doing is suppressing all the real treatments, right?
[01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:19.260]  And now people know they've suppressed.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.620]  We just saw it on.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.840]  They were rating doctors are giving people vitamin C IVs, how vitamin C is bad during
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.840]  the pandemic.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.800]  Well, but vitamin C IVs are loaded with glyphosate and you can't and you can't infuse things
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.320]  because that's not how God presents it.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.200]  So you actually have feedback loops.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:39.080]  It's a scientific term to turn down the sensors.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:44.840]  So you hurt yourself just like giving a black person liquid vitamin D. His sensors act like
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:47.960]  resistors and will turn right down and they get sicker fast.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.360]  So what do black people need to do because they're low on vitamin D.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.880]  Amazing what God provides to us, right?
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]  Yeah.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:02.280]  You know, and when the pandemic was starting, I was saying this is crazy from what I understand
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.960]  with stood with my work with Dr. Judy is, you know, what you need to do is you need
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:11.040]  to go out in the sun, you need to exercise, you need to be healthy, you need to have good
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.320]  social relations.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:19.120]  And every single thing they did to us in the pandemic was designed to affect our immune
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.600]  system and suppress our immune system.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.280]  So whatever this virus is going to do to you, it was going to do it in space.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.280]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.880]  We've talked about the past and what's currently happening.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.120]  I want to play the Niels deGrasse Tyson clip where he says, I am science.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.960]  I don't care how many prestigious people you have.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.960]  I am science.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.120]  I'm the consensus, meaning the big corporations, the intelligence agencies we now know worldwide
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.480]  that actually suppress the truth.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.480]  We've been vindicated.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480]  They've been proven totally wrong.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.040]  I want to talk some about that with you guys next segment, but while we still have time
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.360]  on the other subject, Judy, Dr. Mikovits, what is coming next?
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.519]  We know the shots, lower immunity.
[01:24:54.519 --> 01:24:55.720]  We know they're full of spike protein.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.320]  We know they're causing infertility, massive increases in cancer, massive blood clots.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.760]  That was warned about before they ever gave the shot by Dr. Michael Giedon and others
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.000]  and you.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.920]  So what was their endgame?
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.040]  What were they really planning with this?
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.240]  How do they think they would cover up the fact that it erases your immune system the
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.920]  more of the shots you take?
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.840]  And I even saw Pfizer takes Brad, go after three shots.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]  You have no immune system.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.040]  You'll need our shots forever.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.360]  I mean, why are they giving interviews saying this?
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.360]  You've been around these people.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.360]  What's wrong with them?
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.160]  Well, that was the goal.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:36.480]  Covid was premeditated murder of, you know, 35 years of unchecked, untested, unsafe weaponization,
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:41.960]  bioweapons, monkey, mouse, kidney, aborted fetal, you know, all of those viruses.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.720]  The what's next is never another shot.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.280]  None of them were ever tested.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.840]  They're fermented products.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.600]  Never another shot.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.840]  And go back to God given immunity.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.840]  We have the patents.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.620]  We have the drugs developed.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:58.040]  You know, we know how to use things like natokinase, natural products.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.160]  We know nitric oxide, cardiomiracle.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.160]  We've got formula.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.680]  But I'm asking, what are they going to do next?
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.880]  What was their plan for the people that took two, three, four of the shots?
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.160]  Because you got Borla wearing masks saying they had a Pfizer.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  Science will win.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.519]  They're saying, I am science.
[01:26:12.519 --> 01:26:13.880]  I am the Senate.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.880]  Like Emperor Palpatine.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.720]  I mean, these guys are ridiculous.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.080]  And the plan was to kill you.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.080]  But we've told you with a couple of nutrients, with a couple of nutrients and things, we can
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.560]  absolutely put back down the foundation to detox.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.120]  It's we don't count calories.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.640]  We count chemicals.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.640]  We're being poisoned.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.680]  But we can't.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.280]  We have no nutrition because our food is poison.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.400]  Our food is GMO.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.240]  We have to end the food.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.600]  We know what comes next.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600]  Now they're doing their nitrogen game.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.960]  Our soil is dead.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960]  It doesn't.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960]  They're announcing they want to ban nitrogen.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  Yeah, of course.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.160]  So everything God created, they want to ban and put us in a place.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.320]  All we have to do is walk away from their system.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.720]  And we have the solutions right now.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.560]  And so stop complying.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.560]  Stop complying.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.920]  I mean, I put the clip twice last week.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.800]  Kerry actually says we've got to cut off the farms or people will starve to death.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.880]  He says we've got to shut these farms down or there'll be mass starvation.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.560]  So they run the lockdowns, shut down the farms and ranches in the third world.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.240]  Ninety five percent in a Gallup poll of illegals come here saying they shut down my business,
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.240]  my farm.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240]  I can't feed myself.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.120]  And then the U.N. brings them here and says global warming caused the refugees.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.360]  And now the answer is shutting down farms in the West.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.760]  I mean, can't the public put two and two together?
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.120]  We're going to shut farms down to stop starvation.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.160]  But that's what Mickey did last night.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.400]  The Great Awakening.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.800]  It's up to us.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.000]  Stand up together.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.180]  Truth in love.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.180]  That's what he showed.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.519]  We end up happy.
[01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:38.720]  That's what he showed you right now.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.000]  We already won because we survived this one.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.120]  And now we know the game plan and we'll know.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]  I agree.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.320]  It's going to be very hard for them to launch another one now that people, a large minority
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.640]  becoming a majority, has their number.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.360]  But do you think the psychos are going to quit?
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.120]  I mean, Fauci says, I am a science, which, again, is a science cult.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.600]  Well, I'm never going to quit obeying God and and just moving forward according to my
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.600]  purpose.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.720]  That means right now, Ephesians 511 shouting from the rooftops in one sense.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.240]  But the Great Awakening with Mickey Willis, speaking the truth in love, forgiving people,
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:18.000]  bringing them back, moving that middle, showing that emotion like that film that people didn't
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  know.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  They did not know.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.880]  Yeah, folks, Mickey Willis has made a lot of great movies and was a big Hollywood producer
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.960]  for ads and movies, documentaries before he was already awake a lot.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.680]  But then meeting Judy and Kent really, really woke up, I guess, about three, four years ago,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.680]  four years ago.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.400]  And now these films are just devastating the new world order.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.640]  You can find it for free at Infowars.com with the links to it right now.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:48.080]  The Great Awakening, part three of the pandemic series free at Infowars.com.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.360]  We're going to air it coming up at 6 p.m. Central in about 33 minutes.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.360]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:54.880]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.720]  This is their big move.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.480]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.280]  He doesn't care.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.519]  That's not his job.
[01:29:11.519 --> 01:29:13.260]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:16.920]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.560]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.320]  They must be opposed.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320]  And that's who he works with.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.320]  I only understand one word, no, no, no.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.400]  Exactly.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.920]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.040]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.560]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.040]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.660]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.240]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.240]  You're right.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.840]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.640]  And we say no.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:58.760]  And we say no to your war.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.360]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360]  Please write this down.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.400]  And please go look this up.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.440]  It will change your life.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.920]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.160]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:19.680]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.400]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.720]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:35.800]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]  effect.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.200]  It's very hard to produce.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.880]  And it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.800]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.000]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.280]  You and your family need it.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.519]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:52.519]  X3.
[01:30:52.519 --> 01:30:55.840]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.840]  Take action now.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.880]  But regardless, research is info.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.160]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.840]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.840]  People said, no way.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.840]  He's the most powerful.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]  It never happened.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.200]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.200]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.400]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.160]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:22.880]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.880]  Joe Rogan.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.519]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:31:27.519 --> 01:31:29.440]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.080]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.000]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.080]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.720]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.000]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.440]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.800]  products at the same time at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:56.680]  Go to InfowarsStore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.400]  to these tyrants.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.240]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.240]  Reiss Report.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:06.920]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfowarsStore.com.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.519]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[01:32:09.519 --> 01:32:15.360]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.720]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.040]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.760]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.160]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.800]  Absolutely.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.840]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.519]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:32:42.519 --> 01:32:45.600]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600]  Take out your phone.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600]  Click that QR code.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.760]  It'll take you directly to InfowarsStore.com.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:50.880]  Buy something.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.880]  Support the Infowar.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.440]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us on
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440]  air.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440]  Do it today.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440]  Do it now.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.440]  Support the Infowar.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:06.519]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:26.179]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, you're listening to Alex
[01:33:26.179 --> 01:33:27.179]  Jones.
[01:33:27.179 --> 01:33:35.299]  They were calling it a conspiracy theory when Alex Jones many years ago said that they want
[01:33:35.299 --> 01:33:38.740]  the U.S. to be like China with a social credit score.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.780]  Not for nothing, he got demonized in the media.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:45.099]  I remember being a kid, everything he said that was going to go down, it's all going
[01:33:45.099 --> 01:33:46.099]  down.
[01:33:46.099 --> 01:33:51.459]  The model for Internet censorship is going to be phased in Chinese-style net censorship.
[01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:55.900]  Net IDs, net taxes, three strikes and you're out, net rules.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.940]  But before they get to that, they're going to phase in, it started, starts this next
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:06.219]  year in China and they're already lining up with Facebook, Google, all of them agreeing
[01:34:06.219 --> 01:34:13.059]  with China, Microsoft, to implement these systems where China already does it and then
[01:34:13.059 --> 01:34:16.099]  they beta test there and then bring it here.
[01:34:16.099 --> 01:34:21.339]  Everything you do in China from your credit score to what you buy, to discount cards,
[01:34:21.339 --> 01:34:27.219]  to your Internet records, to what you say on social networks is integrated into an algorithm
[01:34:27.339 --> 01:34:31.900]  And if you criticize the government basically once, you can't even buy or sell, you can't
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.860]  get a hotel, you can't travel.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:40.080]  Now I see it actually happen, it's so bold, it's so over the top that I get why people
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.339]  just can't believe it.
[01:34:41.339 --> 01:34:43.620]  This ESG is a social credit score.
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.219]  If you don't play ball, they're not going to bail you out.
[01:34:46.219 --> 01:34:50.500]  So of course, they want to push this electric so they could turn your bike off whenever
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.500]  they want.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:56.139]  So if there's another situation where there's a medical reason why everybody needs to stay
[01:34:56.139 --> 01:34:59.259]  home, they could just turn everything off.
[01:34:59.259 --> 01:35:00.700]  That's why they want the electric.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:04.540]  Could you imagine living in a world where they just turn your bike off, turn your car
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:05.540]  off?
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:11.820]  And it's happening now, electric bikes, people rent, when the rental's over, it just locks
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.860]  the gears up, incredibly dangerous.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.099]  That is the whole system.
[01:35:16.099 --> 01:35:17.099]  All right.
[01:35:17.099 --> 01:35:22.179]  The Great Awakening, part three in the pandemic series, Mickey Willis knocked out of the park,
[01:35:22.179 --> 01:35:28.700]  all basically inspired by the great lady we've got here with us today, Dr. Judy Mikovits,
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:33.780]  and of course, Mikovits, and of course, her website is TheRealDrJudy.com, TheRealDrJudy.com.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:37.980]  And of course, Kent Hecken-Lively is also working with me on my last book and on the
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.580]  latest book, also called The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.580]  next great renaissance.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.059]  But today, it's all about Mickey Willis's film.
[01:35:46.059 --> 01:35:51.940]  Dr. Judy, you got cut off by the break, you were making some really key points, and listen,
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:55.019]  like Jerry Maguire movie, talk to me like I'm in the fifth grade, because you're really
[01:35:55.019 --> 01:35:58.820]  smart, you move quick, and I know all this stuff, and I can barely follow it, and then
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.780]  I realize you're saying some really crazy, important stuff.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:07.860]  Slow down and explain what you're saying about Dr. Malone and all these people, which they
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.660]  admit this now, being inspired by your research, because they're scientists too, but they weren't
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.860]  in the middle of it.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.740]  You've helped decompartmentalize people and helped them have epiphanies, basically.
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:17.900]  Well, exactly.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:23.860]  And that's because, in fact, Kent Hechen-Lively said nobody would understand it, he's a sixth
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:29.339]  grade science teacher, so he was able to show the perspective of how doctors and students
[01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:31.780]  are supposed to be taught.
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:40.299]  But for at least the last decade, medical students, college students, they haven't been taught
[01:36:40.299 --> 01:36:41.299]  biology.
[01:36:41.299 --> 01:36:46.400]  They haven't been taught the biology according to God, according to nature, the base pairs
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:53.879]  that make up your DNA, A, C, T, and G, and A and G are purines, caffeine is a purine.
[01:36:53.879 --> 01:36:58.360]  Oh, that's something, a chemical in nature, well, they increase heart rates, and things
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]  like that.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.440]  Well, ivermectin is a purinergic modulator.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:13.120]  Oh, that means it's an in nature, an antiparasitic, because of how it changes the sensors to poison
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  on the cell.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.639]  Cancer is a parasite of your own body, and so that's why all the science now shows, like
[01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:21.519]  you said years ago on the show, it literally blocks cancer.
[01:37:21.519 --> 01:37:26.759]  Yeah, because oxygen kills cancer because it turns on the immune system.
[01:37:26.759 --> 01:37:32.639]  And the viruses of your own God-given viruses say that's the type of poison, that's the
[01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:35.200]  parasite that has me turning on.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.799]  That's what's robbing oxygen.
[01:37:36.799 --> 01:37:40.440]  ATP, energy, goes outside the cell and kills it.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:47.480]  And our book on the case against masks was banned by Amazon, because we dared to say
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.440]  that what's going to happen when you're wearing a mask is you're going to get less oxygen,
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.440]  and you're going to get more carbon dioxide.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.160]  And all the studies showed that, you're vintage.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.959]  And you're going to cause cancer, and it's called hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha.
[01:37:59.959 --> 01:38:04.000]  So when I say that, Robert Malone says, of course.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.679]  And then when you start talking about microRNAs and long-chain non-coding RNAs, our own God-given
[01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:11.919]  immune defenses that turn on antimicrobials.
[01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:12.919]  Just explain.
[01:38:12.919 --> 01:38:16.559]  The entire protocol they gave us was designed to grow cancer and turn off immune systems.
[01:38:16.559 --> 01:38:17.559]  Correct.
[01:38:17.559 --> 01:38:22.440]  But God gave us the knowledge, and that was my research, to turn back on.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.759]  And what is happening now that doctors are seeing all over the country and all over the
[01:38:27.759 --> 01:38:28.759]  world?
[01:38:28.759 --> 01:38:30.360]  They're seeing turbo-cancers.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.959]  They're seeing these people whose cancer...
[01:38:32.959 --> 01:38:37.400]  That's the main pathologist society in Germany, first, a year and a half ago, said we're seeing
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.400]  an increase.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.400]  They published a new paper.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:43.879]  They're saying there's no doubt that these shots make cancer come back in cancer patients.
[01:38:43.879 --> 01:38:44.879]  Okay.
[01:38:44.879 --> 01:38:45.879]  Yeah.
[01:38:45.879 --> 01:38:46.879]  Can I just say, turbo.
[01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:47.879]  Blow on a fire.
[01:38:47.879 --> 01:38:48.879]  What does it do?
[01:38:48.879 --> 01:38:49.879]  It goes turbo.
[01:38:49.879 --> 01:38:50.879]  It goes turbo.
[01:38:50.879 --> 01:38:51.879]  That's turbo.
[01:38:51.879 --> 01:38:52.879]  Yeah.
[01:38:52.879 --> 01:38:53.879]  You took a mask away from them.
[01:38:53.879 --> 01:38:54.879]  Yeah.
[01:38:54.879 --> 01:38:55.879]  You starved oxygen.
[01:38:55.879 --> 01:38:56.879]  You know, you starved oxygen.
[01:38:56.879 --> 01:38:57.879]  Hold on.
[01:38:57.879 --> 01:39:01.679]  So when she uses terms, or Kent does, they're not just using terms.
[01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:07.440]  That's a turbo is when they inject oxygen into the gasoline to make it explode higher
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  and better.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.480]  So you got turbo.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480]  You got superchargers.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480]  Turbocharge.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.240]  So this is literally turbocharging cancer.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.240]  Start over and explain how it works.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.320]  So doctors use that term because you rob oxygen.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.759]  So the mask wasn't just inconvenient.
[01:39:19.759 --> 01:39:26.160]  It turned on viruses because you were trying to send immune cells to the fire.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.599]  You were being hypoxia is lack of oxygen.
[01:39:30.599 --> 01:39:35.719]  There are God-given factors that when hypoxia goes on, you get cancer.
[01:39:35.719 --> 01:39:37.000]  So this is the opposite of turbo.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  It's blocking the oxygen.
[01:39:38.559 --> 01:39:39.559]  Correct.
[01:39:39.559 --> 01:39:40.559]  And it's a it's a cancer.
[01:39:40.559 --> 01:39:41.559]  It's a drug target.
[01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:42.559]  And we know those drug targets.
[01:39:42.559 --> 01:39:43.559]  That's what we did.
[01:39:43.559 --> 01:39:44.759]  That's what Robert Malone did.
[01:39:44.759 --> 01:39:49.879]  Oh, and then we patent a drug because you can't patent God and just making sure you don't
[01:39:49.879 --> 01:39:56.599]  put a mask on and take oxygen away and induce the expression of higher medical system is
[01:39:56.599 --> 01:39:59.799]  not designed for people's health.
[01:39:59.799 --> 01:40:07.320]  Our entire medical system is designed to create drugs to return money to the shareholders.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:13.599]  That is something that every person in this world needs to stand up and understand.
[01:40:13.599 --> 01:40:14.599]  And that's the money.
[01:40:14.599 --> 01:40:15.599]  Instead of one level.
[01:40:15.599 --> 01:40:16.599]  I agree.
[01:40:16.599 --> 01:40:17.599]  Like at the at the 50th floor.
[01:40:17.599 --> 01:40:18.599]  That's it.
[01:40:18.599 --> 01:40:20.639]  But up at the 60th floor or the top of this building, whatever number you want to give
[01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:22.679]  it is the population agenda.
[01:40:22.679 --> 01:40:24.240]  They know how to incentivize it through money.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.280]  But I mean, here's Bill Gates giving speeches at TED Talk.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.519]  We've got to reduce the population by 90 percent.
[01:40:28.519 --> 01:40:30.080]  He means it.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.459]  But but it was always the Darwin.
[01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.799]  That was Darwin's thesis.
[01:40:33.799 --> 01:40:40.559]  We think it's natural immunity by natural immunity or the subtitle like our books.
[01:40:40.559 --> 01:40:46.360]  The subtitle is preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.519]  Well, there's no struggle for life in God's world in the Bible.
[01:40:50.519 --> 01:40:52.160]  There's no struggle for life.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.280]  That's racist.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.280]  That's genocide.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.679]  For those who don't know, Hitler got everything from Darwin and Galton and then the liberals
[01:40:57.679 --> 01:41:02.839]  worship this because when I call them Nazis, the left makes jokes and says Nazis didn't
[01:41:02.839 --> 01:41:06.679]  exist till the 1930s or whatever.
[01:41:06.679 --> 01:41:08.120]  The National Socialist Workers Party.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.919]  No, the eugenics that was developed in the U.K. that went worldwide was cited by Kaiser
[01:41:12.919 --> 01:41:16.240]  Wilhelm, the Institute and the Nuremberg trials.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.240]  So this is proto-Nazi.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]  Yeah.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.280]  And and also the Cold Springs Harbor, the Cold Springs Harbor, Rockefeller Institute
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:29.759]  from 1910 to 1945 was the center of the eugenics movement in the United States.
[01:41:29.759 --> 01:41:31.519]  That's in The New York Times.
[01:41:31.519 --> 01:41:35.879]  That's something that people are going to find out in The Great Awakening book because
[01:41:35.879 --> 01:41:42.000]  hey, you know, most of the times I'm quoting mainline sources because what I've learned
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.219]  about the mainstream media is that they will tell the truth.
[01:41:45.219 --> 01:41:49.480]  But you have to wait a couple of years, sometimes 50 years for them to tell the truth.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.320]  But you can get it from the mainstream sources.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:57.440]  So for all of those people who have criticized you for, you know, your sources and everything,
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:03.120]  all I can say is 80, 90 percent of the sources in our book are going to be from mainline sources
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.200]  that nobody can doubt.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200]  That's right.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.599]  Once the fight's already over, they'll tell the truth later.
[01:42:07.599 --> 01:42:08.599]  Yeah.
[01:42:08.599 --> 01:42:09.599]  They like try to.
[01:42:09.599 --> 01:42:10.599]  So let's get to this.
[01:42:10.599 --> 01:42:12.200]  And I don't want to subject the listeners and viewers.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.200]  That's what we got to do it.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.820]  I normally know everything that's going on, basically.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.320]  But I was sitting there watching the movie last night and I didn't know that the great
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:25.280]  Dale Bigtree, who I just admire, what a great researcher and journalist.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.700]  I didn't know that he had Neil deGrasse Tyson in studio three or four months ago and that
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:33.519]  Tyson did the scientism cult of I am science, do what I say.
[01:42:33.519 --> 01:42:37.400]  That's the opposite of the scientific method and, you know, Newtonian physics and the rest
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.400]  of it.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.080]  And literally says, do not question me.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.639]  I represent the consensus.
[01:42:41.639 --> 01:42:45.879]  I don't want to hear what anybody else's study or any individual says unless we decide the
[01:42:45.879 --> 01:42:48.920]  corporate consensus, the corporate board.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.000]  We don't look at that.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.120]  Meanwhile, everything the corporate consensus told you, the censorship, the surveillance,
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:00.799]  the mask are great, you know, vitamin C is bad, ivermectin is bad, you know, this shot
[01:43:00.799 --> 01:43:01.799]  will 100 percent.
[01:43:01.799 --> 01:43:04.719]  Then they all the shot actually doesn't help you at all.
[01:43:04.719 --> 01:43:05.879]  Everything they said was a lie.
[01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.559]  That was their consensus.
[01:43:07.559 --> 01:43:11.519]  And they've wrecked any cachet they have with the public anymore.
[01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:16.980]  But I want to play this incredible clip and Dr. Judy, Mike, if it's any time you want
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:22.080]  to stop it, say stop the tape and then we'll back it up five seconds and play it again.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.360]  So you're going to be in charge right now.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.360]  You're going to be hosting us.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]  I'll say stop it over and over again.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.000]  But I want to it'll take us to this or write notes and do it after whatever you want to
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  do.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.879]  But let's start with Niels deGrasse Tyson, who does this tactic everywhere.
[01:43:33.879 --> 01:43:37.599]  And I mean, he's just everything he says is a fraud, folks.
[01:43:37.599 --> 01:43:38.599]  It's incredible.
[01:43:38.599 --> 01:43:41.759]  So let's start rolling this, because this is this is the mouthpiece of these people.
[01:43:41.759 --> 01:43:43.320]  He's following a script right here.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.879]  Here it is.
[01:43:44.879 --> 01:43:47.400]  There's a list of top ranking medical professionals.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.400]  Let's take a look.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400]  I'm talking about excuse me.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400]  No, no, no.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.920]  I'm talking about what happens is this is I need the consensus.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.240]  OK, I just want a professional.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.879]  I want you because the medical is so huge.
[01:43:58.879 --> 01:44:04.480]  I can find you an astrophysicist who is sure we've been visited by a problem was the problem
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.360]  was the scientific method died here.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.519]  And this is the point I want to make.
[01:44:07.519 --> 01:44:10.080]  My point died a death here.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.599]  And I need you to help me save it, because Dr. Peter McCullough is the leading cardiologist.
[01:44:15.599 --> 01:44:17.259]  Titles don't matter here.
[01:44:17.259 --> 01:44:23.099]  But what should matter, what should matter, what should matter was that the consensus
[01:44:23.099 --> 01:44:27.900]  was not allowing to the table that you bring that person here and have this conversation.
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:28.900]  I have.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:31.580]  OK, so you don't have to have the conversation with me.
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.299]  But I want I want science.
[01:44:34.299 --> 01:44:37.500]  And I'm going to start here back in 10 seconds.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.940]  Don't have a conversation with me because I don't want to debate you.
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:42.539]  That's the opposite of science.
[01:44:42.539 --> 01:44:43.539]  Right.
[01:44:43.539 --> 01:44:47.299]  And that's what we were stopped from doing, is having a conversation because our work
[01:44:47.299 --> 01:44:48.299]  was censored.
[01:44:48.299 --> 01:44:50.420]  Tony Fauci didn't publish it.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:53.780]  The consensus is your peer review.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.700]  If you discover something of nature, you have no peers.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:02.420]  I've been told over and over again, you didn't use the right method to isolate the virus.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:07.139]  I said to isolate the virus, I developed the method and the detection test.
[01:45:07.139 --> 01:45:08.339]  The history of science.
[01:45:08.339 --> 01:45:09.339]  I have no.
[01:45:09.339 --> 01:45:15.780]  The history of science, the history of progress has been responsible, has been brought to
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.299]  us by those who fought the consensus.
[01:45:19.299 --> 01:45:26.940]  I am astonished that Neil deGrasse Tyson doesn't know that Nobel Prizes are awarded to scientists
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:31.700]  who fought the consensus, who created new understandings.
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:38.099]  Does Neil deGrasse Tyson need to go back into my middle school science class and all tell
[01:45:38.179 --> 01:45:39.820]  him how science works?
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:44.379]  Our next book should be the history of real science, something like just show how it's
[01:45:44.379 --> 01:45:45.860]  all about bugging the system.
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.459]  So expanding on that, here's an analogy.
[01:45:49.459 --> 01:45:56.539]  Let's say I am a graduate in physics and I also took astronomy.
[01:45:56.539 --> 01:46:02.379]  And then I'm at the beach with my wife, hypothetically, I'm not these things.
[01:46:02.379 --> 01:46:07.179]  And a meteorite comes and breaks up in the atmosphere and a big chunk of it hits in the
[01:46:07.259 --> 01:46:11.259]  sand dunes and I go dig it out and I look at it and I go, this is really weird.
[01:46:11.259 --> 01:46:12.259]  It's like blue and green.
[01:46:12.259 --> 01:46:13.259]  It's the only thing I ever saw.
[01:46:13.259 --> 01:46:16.780]  I take it in to get it looked at with a spectrometer.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.860]  They say we've never seen this element.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:23.299]  Now would the scientific system say because it's never been seen before and there's no
[01:46:23.299 --> 01:46:26.179]  consensus this exists, this doesn't exist?
[01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:33.299]  Or would they then have experts look at it, declare a new compound or a new alloy or a
[01:46:33.299 --> 01:46:34.299]  new element?
[01:46:34.299 --> 01:46:35.500]  I mean, that's how we have new elements.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.500]  They find them.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:40.820]  Or they say there's no consensus that exists, so you wouldn't look at it.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.900]  Here's a great story from science for you, Alex.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:49.179]  So the consensus of science in the 17th century was that there were no such thing as meteors.
[01:46:49.179 --> 01:46:53.980]  And then there was this incredible meteor shower in France, and France was littered
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:54.980]  with meteors.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:57.620]  So they said, oh, I guess there are meteors.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.580]  So what happened?
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:04.820]  Did meteors suddenly come into existence with that meteor shower in 1789?
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.820]  No.
[01:47:06.139 --> 01:47:08.179]  But the consensus was wrong.
[01:47:08.179 --> 01:47:13.940]  The consensus was, back to meteors, until the Shoemaker-Levy comet hit the gas giant,
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:18.059]  was that we get hit every 50 million years by a giant comet or asteroid.
[01:47:18.059 --> 01:47:21.780]  Now they know from satellites there's giant impact points everywhere.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:23.820]  We get hit every couple hundred years.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.820]  Yeah.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.820]  Yeah.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.860]  It's, you know, people are talking about what caused the Younger Dryas period 11,000 years
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:37.500]  ago when the mammoths and the saber-toothed tires disappeared, and why there's the scablands
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:42.099]  in Washington, which show that probably meteors hit the ice.
[01:47:42.099 --> 01:47:45.940]  Every 10,000, 20,000 years a big one hits, but big ones are hitting all the time.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:46.940]  Yeah.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:47.940]  Incredible.
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:53.820]  Well, you know, it's important that, you know, science is based on technology, data and measurements.
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:56.780]  Science isn't a belief system, you know, and it is.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:59.820]  It's a cult until you can measure it and prove it.
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:04.780]  So our technologies, we didn't know there was an endocannabinoid, endogenous, God-given
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:11.420]  cannabis system, a dimmer switch on inflammation that is the plants, an entire family of them
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:16.179]  with hemp, and they make rope and fibrosis, oronitis, stop those processes.
[01:48:16.179 --> 01:48:18.459]  We didn't know about that until 94.
[01:48:18.459 --> 01:48:27.379]  But we knew that hemp and cannabis in elixirs, as in the 1930s, were wonderful.
[01:48:27.379 --> 01:48:32.620]  I see the videos on the study, takes full spectrum CBD, and all of a sudden his hands
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:33.620]  aren't shaking.
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:34.620]  Correct.
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:35.620]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:37.339]  Let's go ahead and roll more of Niels deGrasse Tyson.
[01:48:37.339 --> 01:48:38.339]  We got to get the rest of this.
[01:48:38.339 --> 01:48:41.620]  It's hard to listen to, but this is a guy saying, I can't debate you.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.620]  Please be quiet.
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.620]  Here it is.
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.740]  So you don't have to have the conversation with me.
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:50.179]  But I want science, and so here's what we have.
[01:48:50.179 --> 01:48:57.099]  We have Peter McCullough, world-renowned heart doctor saying, I am seeing a rise in myocarditis
[01:48:57.099 --> 01:48:58.420]  because of this vaccine.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:03.459]  We have the leading ICU, second most published science, Paul Merrick.
[01:49:03.459 --> 01:49:04.459]  Hear me out here.
[01:49:04.459 --> 01:49:05.459]  Hear me out.
[01:49:05.459 --> 01:49:06.459]  No.
[01:49:06.459 --> 01:49:07.459]  All right.
[01:49:07.459 --> 01:49:08.459]  These have all been on my show.
[01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.900]  Dr. Robert Malone, part of the inventing factor behind the mRNA vaccine.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.259]  All these people have been censored.
[01:49:12.259 --> 01:49:13.259]  They were shut down.
[01:49:13.259 --> 01:49:15.339]  They were kept from talking to the people in Washington.
[01:49:15.339 --> 01:49:17.700]  Johnny was putting out the data.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.700]  How are they censored?
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.700]  I'll show you.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.219]  Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Dr. Sinetra Gupta, Dr. Martin Koldorf, Oxford University, Harvard
[01:49:24.219 --> 01:49:26.740]  School of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:49:27.379 --> 01:49:31.179]  They put together the Great Barrington Declaration, which was an approach towards this to say,
[01:49:31.179 --> 01:49:33.179]  let's do protect that surface wall.
[01:49:33.179 --> 01:49:34.179]  936,000.
[01:49:34.179 --> 01:49:35.179]  That's not a consensus.
[01:49:35.179 --> 01:49:39.539]  That we know needs to be protected and figure out a way the rest of us can establish a herd
[01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:40.860]  immunity around them.
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:45.019]  And the NIH, who's supposed to be objective on this, we now have internal email, because
[01:49:45.019 --> 01:49:46.019]  this is what I do.
[01:49:46.019 --> 01:49:47.820]  I actually put in FOIA requests.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.780]  We know that this is what Francis Collins said about those people before even talking
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:51.780]  to them.
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:55.660]  There needs to be a quick and devastating published takedown of the premise being brought
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.219]  by these scientists.
[01:49:57.219 --> 01:49:58.500]  That was the approach to science.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.259]  No other science can be allowed in here.
[01:50:00.259 --> 01:50:04.420]  You started this out by saying every challenge should come in.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.500]  Every way to say that we don't agree with the hypothesis.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.620]  Maybe these people say, you don't need the vaccine, there's a way through this.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.259]  Or we should be tactical with the vaccine.
[01:50:13.259 --> 01:50:17.179]  All of these people were kept out of the conversation, and you were wanting me to sign
[01:50:17.179 --> 01:50:22.740]  onto a social contract where the scientific method isn't being used.
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:30.420]  That list of highly pedigreed medical professionals that you are citing, I'm not interested in
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.420]  medical pedigree.
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.500]  I'm interested in medical consensus, in scientific consensus.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:40.780]  The moment someone says, well, I'm of this highfalutin school or this, that's like,
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:44.700]  OK, that means they're going to say something that goes against the consensus, and they
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.700]  want to use that.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.059]  Oh, we don't want that.
[01:50:47.059 --> 01:50:48.059]  Follow what it is they say.
[01:50:48.059 --> 01:50:49.059]  That's insane.
[01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:52.420]  I'm just saying you need someone who represents a medical consensus.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.820]  Well, the consensus is two men can have a baby, doctor.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:01.740]  And the X and Y aren't, you know, major universities teach now, there are no chromosomes.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.620]  Major U.S. universities know X, Y.
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:04.620]  Right.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:05.620]  But see, we have the data.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:06.620]  Here, hit pause real quick.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:07.620]  Back in 20 seconds.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:08.620]  Go ahead.
[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.500]  So, you see, we have the data, and we knew it all along.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.500]  Plus, I know you're a woman, I'm a man.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.059]  We don't need to be a science nerd.
[01:51:15.059 --> 01:51:18.299]  But more important, in the book, Ending Plague.
[01:51:18.299 --> 01:51:24.980]  First time ever, Frank Ricetti and Luc Montagnier ever spoke about what really happened with
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:30.500]  gain of function, HIV, you know, and because they were outcasts.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:34.379]  Luc Montagnier won the Nobel Prize in 2008.
[01:51:34.379 --> 01:51:39.139]  And what it was used for then was to silence him, because he was telling the truth.
[01:51:39.139 --> 01:51:44.740]  You know, and Alex, to your point, 98 percent of drunk college freshmen can identify a
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.740]  female.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.740]  Exactly.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:47.740]  Exactly.
[01:51:48.179 --> 01:51:54.780]  But they tell us, I've got articles here, major universities today are saying, no, anybody
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]  can be a woman.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.780]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:57.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a woman.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.780]  I'm not.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:06.539]  It's easy, because it's all about X, the X chromosome, and the Y is the problem, and
[01:52:06.539 --> 01:52:11.539]  we know we can help the problem that these men can't think with both brains at the same
[01:52:11.539 --> 01:52:13.179]  time with your nitric boost.
[01:52:13.179 --> 01:52:14.940]  And I'm a six-foot-four NBA player.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:17.059]  Nitric oxide works to make one of the other.
[01:52:17.059 --> 01:52:20.179]  You did a plug for nitric boost because you love the ingredients, and it sold a lot of
[01:52:20.179 --> 01:52:21.179]  it.
[01:52:21.179 --> 01:52:24.459]  What does something like nitric boost product do for your blood?
[01:52:24.459 --> 01:52:26.700]  It allows it to flow regularly.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:32.740]  It allows this guy to use both brains that he has that Y chromosome problem.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:38.099]  It doesn't exist, if you want to use that certain target bathing suit.
[01:52:38.099 --> 01:52:39.099]  Sorry.
[01:52:39.099 --> 01:52:41.139]  We're getting off here.
[01:52:41.139 --> 01:52:48.139]  But the point is, again, he's saying consensus, highfalutin school, Harvard, that takes these
[01:52:48.139 --> 01:52:49.139]  outliers.
[01:52:49.139 --> 01:52:54.099]  No, Harvard is creating the consensus.
[01:52:54.099 --> 01:52:57.500]  That's where all the corruption came from, Ian Lipkin, John Coffey.
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:00.980]  We should talk about Harvard on a whole interview sometime, but it seems like, people say, who
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:01.980]  runs the world?
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:04.179]  It seems like Harvard mafia runs it.
[01:53:04.179 --> 01:53:05.179]  Columbia.
[01:53:05.179 --> 01:53:06.179]  But that's what we show.
[01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.179]  Harvard, Columbia, Yale.
[01:53:07.179 --> 01:53:08.179]  Who's the top?
[01:53:08.179 --> 01:53:09.179]  Harvard, Columbia?
[01:53:09.179 --> 01:53:10.179]  Columbia, Yale.
[01:53:10.219 --> 01:53:15.459]  And all the places, Tony Fauci, Georgetown, GW, where he's going and giving consensus
[01:53:15.459 --> 01:53:18.379]  speech because that's a cult.
[01:53:18.379 --> 01:53:24.339]  When you see how the cult is run in presidential takedown, what I uncovered is that every year
[01:53:24.339 --> 01:53:31.700]  the NIH gives out $30 billion in grants to scientists.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.700]  That was direct.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.539]  And Eisenhower warned about the control of consensus.
[01:53:34.539 --> 01:53:35.539]  That was.
[01:53:35.539 --> 01:53:37.299]  His military industrial complex warned of that.
[01:53:37.299 --> 01:53:40.019]  And that was that that money was this.
[01:53:40.019 --> 01:53:42.539]  They decided who to send it to.
[01:53:42.539 --> 01:53:46.099]  Basically Francis Collins and Tony Fauci were in charge of it.
[01:53:46.099 --> 01:53:53.059]  For a comparison, the 2020 election to elect a president of the United States was $5.6
[01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:54.740]  billion spent.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:54:01.379]  So every year this medical mafia is basically spending six times the amount of money to
[01:54:01.379 --> 01:54:04.620]  buy the consensus of the scientists.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:09.700]  So how does this house of cards, how does this medical mafia work?
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:12.660]  It works because they're stealing our money.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:15.719]  But the good news is they've doubled down and now they're failing.
[01:54:15.719 --> 01:54:18.940]  So despite everything they've done, they can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:24.219]  Let's play the last few minutes of Tyson because Dale Bigtree really gets his face.
[01:54:24.219 --> 01:54:29.660]  That list of highly pedigreed medical professionals that you are citing.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.660]  Yeah.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:32.900]  I'm not interested in medical pedigree.
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:36.980]  I'm interested in medical consensus, in scientific consensus.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:42.299]  The moment someone says, well, I'm of this high saluting school or this, that's like,
[01:54:42.299 --> 01:54:46.379]  OK, that means they're going to say something that goes against the consensus and they want
[01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:50.139]  to use that to help other people follow what it is they say.
[01:54:50.139 --> 01:54:56.820]  I'm just saying you need someone who represents a medical consensus here to have that conversation
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:57.820]  with.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:02.459]  We had a medical consensus around a product that we knew nothing about and a medical consensus
[01:55:02.459 --> 01:55:05.420]  around a virus that told us that exactly nothing about that.
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.940]  They kept telling us we know very little about it.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:13.339]  So why was there a medical consensus that was keeping out renowned scientists from the
[01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:17.379]  conversation when they were telling us on television, we don't know a lot about this
[01:55:17.379 --> 01:55:18.379]  virus.
[01:55:18.379 --> 01:55:19.379]  We're trying to figure it out.
[01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:22.980]  Scientists that were on the ground that were dealing with patients were being censored,
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:23.980]  being shut down.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.459]  Their YouTube channels are being shut down.
[01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:30.019]  Their LinkedIn's are being shut down because the individual scientist does not matter.
[01:55:30.019 --> 01:55:35.780]  We started this conversation on that very fact, but the scientific method does.
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.780]  Yes.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:37.780]  Of course it does.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:43.539]  And the scientific method producing a consensus and whatever is that consensus, kind of the
[01:55:43.539 --> 01:55:50.059]  best you can look when I can look now in the rearview mirror and said it while it was happening,
[01:55:50.059 --> 01:55:51.059]  that there is a.
[01:55:51.059 --> 01:55:54.059]  And by the way, all the scientists I just showed proved to be right.
[01:55:54.059 --> 01:55:58.860]  They told you that this virus, that the vaccine would not end this and would actually cause
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:03.339]  an epidemic because you've now made people that cannot clear this virus and kill it.
[01:56:03.339 --> 01:56:04.740]  They're all asymptomatic carriers.
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:06.179]  That's all this vaccine keeps doing.
[01:56:06.179 --> 01:56:07.820]  So now we're stuck with this virus.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:13.179]  We didn't follow the same path we always have with every other illness like former coronaviruses
[01:56:13.179 --> 01:56:14.179]  and most of the time.
[01:56:14.179 --> 01:56:15.179]  Flu's are low.
[01:56:15.179 --> 01:56:16.179]  The hospital is low.
[01:56:16.179 --> 01:56:20.700]  I mean, things are for now, for now.
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:25.620]  But as you and I both know, these various continue to be out there and we are all worried
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:28.099]  that there could be a variant in the future that could be dangerous.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:32.500]  All that being said, why don't we come back in the end?
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:38.059]  What I am standing for is that there is no challenge being allowed, that the NIH, when
[01:56:38.059 --> 01:56:41.339]  it's telling us is objectively looking at a virus, they're telling us they don't know
[01:56:41.339 --> 01:56:47.860]  much about is pushing out top people in their field who are trying to get to the table.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:51.740]  They're trying to say there's something you're not looking at and this.
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:56.580]  And when you want to talk about a problem, how about not funding to do that study again?
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:01.740]  How about not allowing into the room, let me people with great perspective.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.820]  And I sent them that clip of the full clip.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.379]  He says, I need you to back up science.
[01:57:06.379 --> 01:57:07.379]  I need you to stop this.
[01:57:07.379 --> 01:57:12.860]  I mean, you will post a full interview to infowars.com or to come back with Judy Mikevich.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:16.820]  And of course, our kid heck and lively here to talk about this.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:19.059]  But we're going to break right now.
