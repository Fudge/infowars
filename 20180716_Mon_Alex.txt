[00:38.200 --> 00:42.160]  unbelievable ongoing press conference that's been happening for over an hour
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.360]  with the Russian president Vladimir Putin and the US president Donald J
[00:46.360 --> 00:53.440]  Trump unbelievable bombshell after bombshell we've already got some of the
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.960]  clips grabbed one of them was five minutes ago and it was Putin going
[00:58.960 --> 01:02.500]  listen our intelligence services aren't involved these are private Russian
[01:02.500 --> 01:07.320]  companies that all sorts of companies hire which 80% of the bots bought were
[01:07.320 --> 01:10.660]  for Hillary out of Russia that's what happens during elections people go
[01:10.660 --> 01:14.600]  overseas and go around campaign finance law because listen you've got George
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.080]  Soros inside the United States trying to steal elections for Hillary Clinton and
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.840]  then right before that a few minutes before Trump comes out and says hey
[01:23.840 --> 01:30.360]  what about Hillary and her 30,000 emails we're changing the subject to whoever
[01:30.360 --> 01:34.120]  hacked those she shouldn't have illegally had those on her private server
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.520]  see how they changed the subject and of course Putin's come out and denied that
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.720]  they were involved in election manipulation says they're insulted if
[01:44.720 --> 01:52.960]  anything RT is leftist in fact RT's horrible now it's unwatchable the the
[01:52.960 --> 02:00.360]  the sycophantic worship of anti-Trump stuff the and it's always been leftist
[02:00.360 --> 02:05.600]  I mean the claim that it's this anti-Hillary machine that CIA report they
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.080]  put out a year and a half ago that showed 20 something examples of them
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.840]  having negative coverage of Hillary yeah they had probably thousands of Trump I
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.120]  mean RT if anything it's like our mainstream media it's it's it's very
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.600]  very leftist that's a side issue though this is a huge broadcast we have a bunch
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.360]  of these clips for you the live press conference is ongoing and then we've
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.320]  done something very very special with Mike Adams and Paul Watson and the rest
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.200]  the team that has a real chance of blunting internet censorship and the
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.200]  whole globalist plan to silence nationalist Christians patriots you name
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.400]  it and that's coming up as well there is a detailed 50 plus page PDF on info
[02:49.400 --> 02:59.080]  wars dot com right now the censorship master plan decoded the Adams report
[02:59.080 --> 03:04.040]  and then Paul Watson has another detailed report that details this this is for
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.240]  Congress and the president I can tell you right now it is being sent to the
[03:07.240 --> 03:12.600]  president as we speak to their horror and this is how they're doing it how
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.640]  they admit they're doing it and how they think we're stupid and how they can be
[03:15.640 --> 03:20.080]  easily stopped so you want to put a stop to this make this go viral send it to
[03:20.080 --> 03:24.400]  every congressperson they're having hearings on this tomorrow no one has put
[03:24.400 --> 03:27.840]  together a blueprint well with info wars Mike Adams has done it of natural news
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.120]  dot com you'll be joining us the second hour but right now let's go out to break
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.480]  with Vladimir Putin just minutes ago we have more of these clips coming up from
[03:35.480 --> 03:40.920]  the Helsinki Finland here is Putin throwing down the gauntlet about
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.320]  manipulation this company does not constitute the Russian state it does not
[03:45.320 --> 03:52.200]  represent the Russian state I brought several examples before well you have a
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.160]  lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros for instance with
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.240]  multi-billion capitals but it does that make him his position his posture the
[04:03.240 --> 04:09.960]  posture of the United States no it does not but it's the same case there is the
[04:09.960 --> 04:17.200]  issue of trying a case in the court and the final the final say is for the court
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.640]  to deliver we are now talking about the private in the individuals and not about
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.800]  particular states and as far as the most recent allegation is concerned about
[04:28.800 --> 04:35.040]  the Russian intelligence officers we do have an intergovernmental treaty please
[04:35.040 --> 04:41.280]  do send us the request we will analyze it properly we're gonna come back more
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.000]  of this where Trump calls out Hillary but just understand this Putin just gave

[04:49.560 --> 04:53.360]  world that for PR anybody can hire there are a bunch of them Russia and even the

[07:07.200 --> 07:13.800]  out Michael Moore you better watch out globalist because we're fighting back
[07:13.800 --> 07:22.480]  50,000 unstoppable watts all right let's get into it right now the historic
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.600]  Trump Putin summit is taking place that took over a year and a half of him being
[07:27.600 --> 07:30.600]  president to happen when it should have been the third or fourth meeting yet
[07:30.600 --> 07:35.240]  should have met with the UK should have met with the EU should have met with the
[07:35.240 --> 07:37.920]  Chinese should have met with the Russians should have met with the Japanese
[07:37.920 --> 07:42.240]  should have met with the Mexican president and Trump did all those meetings
[07:42.240 --> 07:54.880]  in the right order but Russia and then I was just thinking today about how Trump
[07:54.880 --> 07:59.560]  has been kicking the Russians in the ribs breaking their nose smashing their
[07:59.560 --> 08:04.480]  head in the ground and then how the media Brian Stelter and others we're gonna
[08:04.480 --> 08:07.920]  play this clip coming up the next segment said everything Trump's telling you is a
[08:07.920 --> 08:11.960]  lie you can't trust him he's your enemy and of course what you're hearing is the
[08:11.960 --> 08:17.560]  inverse 100% about Stelter who just reeks of being disingenuous and has a
[08:17.560 --> 08:22.720]  known fraud but that's the unified thing they're putting out the truth is Trump
[08:22.720 --> 08:27.680]  sees everybody as a competitor to the US and if anything one of his only
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.280]  failings is letting the military industrial complex stampede him into
[08:32.280 --> 08:37.560]  showing folks how tough he is on Russia when in the aggregate they are not one
[08:37.560 --> 08:42.440]  one-hundredth as expansionist as communist China or not one-tenth as big a
[08:42.440 --> 08:47.440]  threat our relationship has never been worse with Russia probably even during
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.760]  the Cold War Trump's correct he said the EU's our adversary they are our foe
[08:52.760 --> 08:55.680]  financially they are trying to bankrupt us Yunker said that a year and a half
[08:55.680 --> 08:59.440]  ago he said I'll bankrupt America they're out live with the chai comms
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.680]  Russia is not out live with the EU the EU is an authoritarian unelected
[09:05.680 --> 09:14.360]  monstrosity Trump would not have done this I think if he didn't have to quote
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.680]  show the world that he's not really a Russian agent and I think that is one
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.720]  of the only failings of the president is that he let them bully him into not
[09:23.720 --> 09:26.960]  having an earlier meeting but this has happened now and it's a good thing but
[09:26.960 --> 09:31.600]  if you look at everything that's happened the the massive energy production
[09:31.600 --> 09:38.560]  increases in the US that crushes Russia the moving tow missiles into Ukraine
[09:38.560 --> 09:42.240]  something Obama wouldn't do giving him anti-tank missiles to attack the Russian
[09:42.240 --> 09:46.520]  forces in the east of Ukraine that's always been Russia that's where Russia
[09:46.520 --> 09:52.920]  was founded backing really Soros's operation that he bragged he launched
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.040]  four years ago on Fareed Zarkaria and CNN that they overthrew the elected
[09:57.040 --> 10:02.800]  government of Ukraine and spent five billion US tax dollars to do it and then
[10:02.800 --> 10:09.600]  all Russia did was come into the eastern area of Crimea that's 99%
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.720]  basically Russian speaking and has always been part of Russia except during
[10:14.720 --> 10:20.200]  World War two when Hitler took it over and the Russians have no other choice
[10:20.200 --> 10:23.960]  they weren't attacked they were invaded people call me a roosa file now I'm a
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.280]  truth-a-file ladies and gentlemen I like to tell the truth makes my job a lot
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.440]  easier just to research the facts know what the facts are and then go with
[10:32.440 --> 10:40.040]  those doesn't mean I lionized Russia or Putin or any of this but as Putin pointed
[10:40.040 --> 10:46.640]  out just minutes ago we're gonna play the clip you're accusing 12 Russian
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.600]  intelligence operatives of being behind box these are private companies that
[10:52.600 --> 10:59.240]  anybody can hire to do PR and Russia is not even in the top 10 of being hired
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.280]  for PR the US is number one China is number two and the different EU
[11:04.280 --> 11:07.920]  companies are number three the UK is very dominant in it for the size of their
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.040]  population 80 million people in fact we said per capita the UK probably does
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.480]  more PR than anybody and you can hire them for anything and 80% roughly of all
[11:18.480 --> 11:22.240]  bots were for Hillary and they came from New Zealand they came from Russia they
[11:22.240 --> 11:29.240]  came you could go hijack somebody's computer in Russia zombie computer happens
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.240]  to millions computers a day and then attack the US with it and they could
[11:33.240 --> 11:37.880]  say oh look Russia attacked us and that's in the vault seven documents that
[11:37.880 --> 11:42.480]  came out last year where the CIA would go play stuff on Russian computers to
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.880]  attack the US that's the oldest trick in the book Russia just cut defense
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.320]  spending Russia says they want an economic posture of development they want
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.520]  championships they want world fairs they want industrial building they want
[11:58.520 --> 12:05.040]  shopping malls they want organic farms they've decided not to play
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.520]  China is absolutely saying they're gonna take us over and are in a state of
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.000]  war against us and their official newspapers and I 100% support the
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.600]  president getting in China's face hitting him with massive tariffs and
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.520]  beefing up our military in those areas space command you name it to deal with
[12:22.520 --> 12:27.320]  them because they are threatening us and expanding that 97% of rare earth
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.000]  minerals and admit they're strangling the US and they bought up Hollywood China
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.200]  is buying up with several Islamic groups the UFC I mean we are being bought up
[12:38.200 --> 12:45.080]  there are biggest debt holders it's the chai comms the chai comms the chai comms
[12:45.080 --> 12:52.520]  the chai comms the chai comms the Russia is a diversion Russia is just seen as
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.960]  weak economically so the globalists are in there trying to destabilize it and
[12:56.960 --> 13:06.280]  take it just like the EU took over the UK and now they voted two years ago to get
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.800]  out of it and now Theresa May says sorry we're not even gonna do Brexit now she
[13:10.800 --> 13:21.040]  announced that today so it's on ladies and gentlemen it's on in every way
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.360]  Trump goes the EU and says we pay for half of it we pay for half a NATO you
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.120]  have to pay for it they go okay we'll increase our spending they already did
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.440]  once that's a victory Trump goes over it says the EU is our economic foe it's
[13:35.440 --> 13:39.520]  true he sits in Churchill's chair they call him a trader saying you didn't
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.920]  beat the Nazis don't sit in his chair when he was invited to sit in the famous
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.920]  chair at the museum but it is Trump fighting the EU that was a Nazi project
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.080]  it is Trump fighting for sovereignty it is Trump standing up for the nation
[13:53.080 --> 13:58.160]  state so if anybody he should be sitting in Winston Churchill's chair but it
[13:58.160 --> 14:04.160]  shows how they create these false narratives constantly so we're gonna go
[14:04.160 --> 14:07.600]  over all of this got a bunch of the clips coming up Trump called out Hillary
[14:07.600 --> 14:10.840]  for her server said this whole thing about Russians is a diversion she had
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.960]  any legal server that a bunch of countries got into but here's Putin on
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.440]  George Soros is involved he's the one spending tens of billions per election
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.200]  publicly he's the one trying to overthrow Russia here it is but this
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.360]  company does not constitute the Russian state it does not represent the Russian
[14:29.360 --> 14:36.080]  state I brought several examples before well you have a lot of individuals in
[14:36.080 --> 14:42.000]  the United States take George Soros for instance with multi-billion capitals
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.200]  but it does that make him his position his posture the posture of the United
[14:47.200 --> 14:54.320]  States no it does not but it's the same case there is the issue of trying a case
[14:54.320 --> 15:00.380]  in the court and the final the final say there's Putin saying oh go ahead and
[15:00.380 --> 15:04.720]  try it in your court see if my agents were involved because he knows they
[15:04.720 --> 15:11.640]  already filed that fake lawsuit six months ago shank 13 Russian bots and
[15:11.640 --> 15:17.800]  now the court has demanded proof and now the Russian companies have shown up and
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.240]  shown the proof that they were actually being paid by Hillary they're like
[15:21.240 --> 15:25.120]  almost all our orders were for Hillary we got Michael Moore to go to an
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.600]  anti-prompt protest we're just mercenaries we'll take anybody's money
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.720]  what do you mean we're Russian agents and the judge is like I'm gonna throw

[20:56.960 --> 21:01.960]  coming in studio with the highlights of the hour-and-a-half long press conference
[21:01.960 --> 21:05.880]  with the president Trump and president Putin unbelievably important things were
[21:05.880 --> 21:11.520]  said and done I've said all the facts what Putin said is true from the best
[21:11.520 --> 21:16.360]  research we've got that Hillary had three billion dollars Trump had 500
[21:16.360 --> 21:22.360]  million Trump bought almost no bots some private companies bought bots and
[21:22.360 --> 21:25.520]  there's a bunch of companies in Russia that you can buy bots for and
[21:25.520 --> 21:30.120]  congressional studies have shown right at 80% funny Hillary at 80% of the money
[21:30.120 --> 21:38.120]  and 80% of the bots just surprise surprise that's how math works and then
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.080]  it came out that it was for Hillary and that's why the Russian companies have
[21:42.080 --> 21:47.560]  gladly shown up in court and said here's our files here's who paid us D&C
[21:47.560 --> 21:54.400]  George Soros Soros spends billions a year of his own money in Russia running
[21:54.400 --> 22:00.160]  anti-Putin anti-Russia operations he bragged on TV that he gave a billion to
[22:00.160 --> 22:03.640]  the five billion that the State Department we have the State Department
[22:03.640 --> 22:08.160]  head at the time saying they did it on C-SPAN set six billion dollars to
[22:08.160 --> 22:15.640]  overthrow Ukraine an elected government Putin did not invade the Ukraine
[22:15.640 --> 22:22.520]  eastern Ukraine has always been part of Russia it's where it was founded like
[22:22.520 --> 22:29.160]  like like like like New York and Pennsylvania that's where Russia was
[22:29.160 --> 22:36.960]  founded his in an encyclopedia it says that go to the history of Russia the
[22:36.960 --> 22:47.760]  founding of Russia in any encyclopedia it'll tell you that it was founded in
[22:47.760 --> 22:51.880]  Crimea and Russia's had eight major wars over it the last time Hitler took
[22:51.880 --> 22:56.160]  it from them and so they never got all of Ukraine back because yes Western
[22:56.160 --> 23:01.720]  Ukraine was Catholic and more aligned with the Germans and the Poles and did
[23:01.720 --> 23:06.120]  the Russians abuse East Western Ukraine a lot you bet your bottom dollar the
[23:06.120 --> 23:15.080]  Zars did and you bet your bottom dollar at the same time so did the communist the
[23:15.080 --> 23:17.760]  Russians did horrible things to the Ukrainians that's not debated even by
[23:17.760 --> 23:22.040]  the Russians but that's a whole nother world back then ladies and gentlemen and
[23:22.040 --> 23:28.360]  they think people are so stupid now let me see yeah there's there's associated
[23:28.360 --> 23:37.560]  press George Soros the puppet master behind the new Ukrainian regime unbelievable
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.200]  show Putin brought that up but I'm gonna shift years now and get back into that
[23:41.200 --> 23:44.680]  the next segment and all this other incredible world news a couple big
[23:44.680 --> 23:49.400]  tidbits here because I don't have time to toot my horn but if you list in the
[23:49.400 --> 23:53.360]  thousands of articles I've seen the last week saying ban info wars ban Alex
[23:53.360 --> 23:58.960]  Jones from the internet USA Today New York Times Washington Post they used the
[23:58.960 --> 24:04.160]  example of Alex Jones says Anthony Bourdain was murdered and that's fake
[24:04.160 --> 24:10.000]  news and Alex Jones says that there would be a giant civil war on July 4th
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.080]  now I said the Democrats are calling for a civil war professors and USA Today say
[24:14.080 --> 24:19.280]  we're in one and I see this is the mark of when they're gonna intensify their
[24:19.280 --> 24:25.400]  attacks and their behavior which has happened so they misrepresented let's
[24:25.400 --> 24:29.280]  get back to this real quick I'm gonna play more of this later there were
[24:29.280 --> 24:35.280]  thousands of articles saying how dare Alex Jones say Anthony Bourdain was gonna
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.040]  come out and call Bill Clinton a rapist and say that he hoped that Harvey
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.280]  Weinstein would die deserve the death penalty and that he was aware of giant
[24:46.280 --> 24:50.400]  sex trafficking going on because his fiance the word is they're basically
[24:50.400 --> 24:56.320]  married his Italian fiance at least when she was there with him on the set
[24:56.320 --> 24:59.960]  that's what they were calling her that she was aware as her dad's a famous
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.320]  director who reportedly was involved in some of this and that because he learned
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.560]  about all this he was going to go public and was doing interviews with Elon
[25:09.560 --> 25:21.720]  Musk and others word for word it's all in the Daily Mail today in a nine page
[25:21.720 --> 25:28.440]  article the girlfriend how she was abused sex cults Harvey Weinstein needs
[25:28.440 --> 25:35.000]  to die Bill Clinton's a rapist word for word please pull up YouTube just type in

[25:44.040 --> 25:48.240]  morning saw that info wars had the headline oh the Daily Mail's breaking
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.960]  that he was about to do a Kanye West our own people who I loved to death think
[25:52.960 --> 26:02.600]  so let's just say calmly about ourselves we're so shy that none of us would
[26:02.600 --> 26:10.800]  even say I was right here's the video learn what Anthony Bourdain was planning
[26:10.800 --> 26:18.560]  to say before he died and then you watch the 34 minute live video I did and I
[26:18.560 --> 26:27.640]  say everything you just read in the Daily Mail word for word he gave an
[26:27.640 --> 26:35.400]  interview that has been unpublished in February he was then interviewed by
[26:35.400 --> 26:41.440]  multiple filmmaking crews in March and April he owned his own production
[26:41.440 --> 26:47.920]  company and he got more informed as the months went on and the whole Kanye
[26:47.920 --> 26:54.360]  West thing happened and he went from hating Trump to being neutral on Trump
[26:54.360 --> 27:05.720]  and then suddenly became pro-trump and they killed him within 24 hours I've
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.120]  talked to the people that were in the meetings and you notice I warned him at
[27:10.120 --> 27:13.680]  the time I said you come out and say I'm a liar or the rest of the media will we
[27:13.680 --> 27:24.600]  got access to the Elon Musk Bourdain tape and I told everybody this is not what

[27:37.640 --> 27:41.560]  source then I contacted another source and I know other individuals that were
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.200]  good friends with Bourdain and they said yeah he's been really freaked out he's
[27:45.200 --> 27:48.280]  learned all about the Illuminati all about the sex traffic all about the
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.480]  little kids being grabbed he's learned it all from his fiancee whose dad's a

[32:06.300 --> 32:10.680]  estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to
[32:10.680 --> 32:15.840]  be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[32:15.840 --> 32:21.080]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to
[32:21.080 --> 32:27.580]  find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what
[32:27.580 --> 32:31.120]  we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[32:31.120 --> 32:36.160]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity
[32:36.160 --> 32:41.320]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
[32:41.320 --> 32:46.920]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa
[32:46.920 --> 32:51.760]  pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
[32:51.760 --> 32:56.880]  acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[32:56.880 --> 33:01.040]  water filtration system will purify it
[33:01.040 --> 33:07.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[36:15.200 --> 36:23.200]  it and they said we're gonna start by banning WikiLeaks and Alex Jones when
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.000]  we're done we're gonna ban everybody off the web and control everything and only
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.480]  let you see messages we want you to see from a few dozen companies they said
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.160]  maybe a hundred sources and they're doing it and it's here they've gone from
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.200]  30 40% of conservatives post being censored just automatically during the
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.240]  campaign to 90 percent now Facebook came out last week and admitted the exact
[36:49.240 --> 36:53.280]  number I've given you of 80% because we can see the algorithm we have access to
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.880]  the Facebook login to the Google login we can see it in a lifetime two days
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.960]  after Hillary was defeated our graph went like from straight up to straight
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.400]  down and they admitted they just blocked it we have to go to the page to find it
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.080]  and now they're all in the news calling for us to totally be banned from the web
[37:11.080 --> 37:16.080]  from any other platform and admitting that they'd already been strangling us
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.160]  but that's all in this report now imagine you're the president imagine your
[37:20.160 --> 37:23.560]  Congress you're busy there's a hearing about internet censorship of
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.600]  conservatives diamonds and silk come in diamond and silk they get yelled at the
[37:27.600 --> 37:30.760]  whole time of the Democrats nothing happens the Republicans seem ignorant
[37:30.760 --> 37:34.960]  they don't know what's going on this is how Republican congressmen and women
[37:34.960 --> 37:38.680]  who try to put their own campaign announcements on Facebook or Twitter get
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.560]  banned but the Democrats are allowed to this is how Facebook and Twitter are
[37:43.560 --> 37:46.880]  already dialing back the president and admitting that they shadow banned the
[37:46.880 --> 37:51.920]  president so you have to be on his page to get his Twitter alerts I point that
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.080]  out everybody goes yeah I don't get them I've got to go to his site I've got to go
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.960]  to his page it's the company brads they're doing it they said six months
[38:00.960 --> 38:07.840]  ago and a statement don't worry about us banning him we already blocking and I
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.280]  talked to high-level people in the campaign you name it they're not even
[38:12.280 --> 38:20.440]  aware of this so they say listen give us a report I talked to people at the
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.280]  Capitol they said I was aware where a lot of this give us the report because
[38:24.280 --> 38:28.400]  thinking people know we're light years ahead the media tries to ridicule
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.560]  info wars and say we're fake news and misrepresent we say all day because they
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.920]  tune in and go my god this guy's got the blueprint to the Death Star take him out
[38:35.920 --> 38:46.000]  now good lord if people pay attention to this we're done so I started asking Paul
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.360]  Watson last week I said they want a big email list of all the news articles and
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.400]  all the quotes and statements and how they're shadow banning and how they're
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.800]  doing it and what we think we should do to counter them I'm like anti-trust
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.680]  investigations will get them to stop doing it real quick that right there
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.240]  will make them back off but they need to be busted up and we need to expose the
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.000]  rack of tearing we need to expose how Google Facebook Twitter brag that we're
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.840]  owned by the Democrats and we're delivering all the votes to Hillary and
[39:12.840 --> 39:18.040]  no one can stop us that was in the news during the campaign so you talk about
[39:18.040 --> 39:23.600]  collusion what about big tech collusion just like mainstream media against
[39:23.600 --> 39:33.120]  Trump so that's all in a 50 plus page PDF that's on info wars.com linked in the
[39:33.120 --> 39:39.200]  articles emergency report the censorship master plan decoded it's linked to the
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.000]  article on info wars.com there's also a Paul Watson report that's an excellent
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.200]  boil down of the report for people that don't want to read 50 something pages with
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.120]  all the exhibits now Mike started writing this last Wednesday and he said
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.840]  engineer best-selling author all-around scientist very successful as everyone
[39:59.840 --> 40:04.880]  knows and Mike did an excellent job putting the report out working with Paul
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.240]  and myself but it was a collaborative effort but I would say 80% of the work
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.320]  goes to Mike but this isn't about credit it's about defeating these monsters so
[40:14.320 --> 40:24.240]  we have Paul's boil down report that's six pages we have Mike's that is 60 plus
[40:24.240 --> 40:31.360]  pages all right there for you on info wars.com you're like well I already
[40:31.360 --> 40:34.040]  know about all this I mean I've already been banned I've already experienced it
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.000]  if you're a listener you've already seen it happens yourself you sit out of
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.920]  four of those who lie things saying God bless America and you get you know banned
[40:39.920 --> 40:42.920]  for two days you've seen the veritas videos behind the scenes where they
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.720]  brag about all this it doesn't matter Congress doesn't understand it half of
[40:47.720 --> 40:53.640]  them are like that famous senator from but Rogers Richards was his name he's
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.880]  dead now he thought the internet was tubes or you know Governor Perry talks
[40:57.880 --> 41:02.440]  about his tweeters they don't understand this and the electronic frontier
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.400]  foundation and the ACLU are admittedly paid off by Soros and the Democrats now
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.240]  so they're out of the game they support censorship the journalism schools are
[41:10.240 --> 41:17.880]  anti-free speech engines all of this and so they're coming for everybody info
[41:17.880 --> 41:22.440]  wars is the sacrificial lamb where they demonize us they lie about us and they
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.680]  set the precedent to de-platform us don't let companies publish our books
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.960]  don't let us have venues to have speeches this is like China and their
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.400]  social score where you then get put in an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge
[41:35.400 --> 41:41.840]  coined the term of and warned us in studio two and a half years ago so we're
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.240]  here Hillary was gonna carry all this out it's like Merkel has in Europe but
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.360]  Trump got in so we've bought some time but it doesn't mean we're winning we're
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.080]  now in sudden death over time with these people and they know it and they are
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.680]  everywhere saying ban us take us down and lying about us and lying about what

[48:32.960 --> 48:39.880]  you up my god there's articles out where mainline Christian bands can't have
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.880]  videos on Facebook about everyone coming together and loving each other that was
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.280]  banned by Facebook this weekend world met daily reported saying it's political
[48:49.280 --> 48:56.680]  they don't like Christians they've taken Christianity off the Apple and off the
[48:56.680 --> 49:04.760]  Google calendars this year they mean business folks they mean business
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.960]  they're coming for you so they want to go oh I don't want to be censored I better
[49:08.960 --> 49:13.000]  comply with the censorship and then I watch all all these all these fake
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.960]  conservatives that they bring in their little darlings with Brian Stelter and
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.640]  you know darlings when they go on Bill Maher I'm a big fan you know says says
[49:20.640 --> 49:27.320]  our anointed leader Ben Shapiro and others when they're just there to control
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.720]  us there to be the last conservatives the only ones that are allowed to have a
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.000]  voice and we all bow down to them oh you don't get censored you get force fed to
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.120]  the front page of YouTube just like Sasha Baron Cohen or just like Michael
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.680]  Moore it's force fed whatever's on the front page remember they're making you
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.840]  look at is the enemy historic times though I want Royer well I think considering
[49:50.840 --> 49:55.840]  what you just talked about and the censorship you know it's not necessarily
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.880]  take what you just said about Christian channels on YouTube being shut down well
[50:00.880 --> 50:04.800]  you know you can Facebook and Facebook and Twitter and everywhere you know it
[50:04.800 --> 50:07.560]  was it was much a white black and Hispanic people hugging each other saying we
[50:07.560 --> 50:10.800]  love each other we're not racist we love God but here's what I think the
[50:10.800 --> 50:16.200]  audience that doubts what's really going on needs to to ask themselves why do
[50:16.200 --> 50:21.040]  you see this type of behavior against Christians whereas if this type of
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.480]  censorship was happening to Muslim individuals it would be the number one
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.680]  story in the world how dare you censor Muslims how dare you be anti-Islamic so
[50:29.680 --> 50:36.840]  if you don't think it's going on fine but how do you explain the contrast in
[50:36.840 --> 50:40.840]  the way that Christians are treated on social media but they admit they are
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.600]  now here's here's the world net daily article they called it a political ad it
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.480]  was a music video Zion's Joy pull it up and it's a multiracial group of
[50:49.480 --> 50:52.680]  Christians loving each other that's what they don't like is people coming
[50:52.680 --> 50:57.800]  together that's what they hate is unity and you can see that they hate that
[50:57.800 --> 51:02.760]  because they love to stand up for women and minorities that is until those women
[51:02.760 --> 51:06.360]  or minorities have conservative values and they toss you to the curb they think
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.720]  they own you so I don't think but here's the problem Alex people can you know
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.680]  this people can see the facts and that's not going to change them I can't
[51:15.680 --> 51:22.440]  explain it I see the fact I respond the the 20 to 30% of the sheeple in this
[51:22.440 --> 51:26.360]  country that go out in the streets refuse the facts and they're not going to
[51:26.360 --> 51:29.520]  fight for free speech because they don't see it's under attack that's why it's so
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.120]  important for our audience to take this battlefield and to fight for free speech
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.480]  because so many Americans don't see it as it's the whole you know I forget how
[51:37.480 --> 51:41.240]  the saying goes but you know they came for the Jews I said nothing because I'm
[51:41.240 --> 51:43.800]  not Jewish they came with the Catholics and finally they came for me and there
[51:43.800 --> 51:47.440]  was nobody to stand up that's how this works and they admit in thousands of
[51:47.440 --> 51:51.680]  articles last week we're banning Jones and once he's banned everyone else will
[51:51.680 --> 51:57.040]  be banned but why would they want to ban you Alex why is it info wars that is so
[51:57.040 --> 52:02.560]  dangerous oh is that because your exclusive on Anthony Bourdain came out
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.240]  to be true oh is that because you were right when you told them that Saudi
[52:07.240 --> 52:11.240]  Arabians were involved in 9-11 see they want control over information Alex
[52:11.240 --> 52:16.000]  that's what this really comes down to they could care less whether Joe Schmo
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.840]  out there has a Twitter account and can say whatever he wants it's about
[52:18.840 --> 52:24.160]  controlling information and if Alex Jones doesn't exist to put the
[52:24.160 --> 52:29.540]  exclusives out there like Anthony Bourdain's he said he was afraid of Bill
[52:29.540 --> 52:33.200]  Clinton but he was still going to go public calling him a rapist and hope
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.080]  that Weinstein would die and then he now was about to go public and then that
[52:37.080 --> 52:40.880]  was that I know people that were in the interviews a month after he'd really
[52:40.880 --> 52:45.200]  woken up see this interview was from February just now released and isn't
[52:45.200 --> 52:48.320]  this a personification of everything we're dealing with Alex if you don't
[52:48.320 --> 52:52.760]  fight you're going to die and I'm not saying that Anthony Bourdain did or
[52:52.760 --> 52:57.280]  didn't fight I'm saying he's now dead he was he was he was he was a he had a
[52:57.280 --> 53:01.640]  fiance who had been abused and he was exposed who'd been raped by Weinstein
[53:01.640 --> 53:05.080]  he had found out from her about her dad a big director and about the whole
[53:05.080 --> 53:10.520]  underworld and the sex rituals this is this is public I talked to people that
[53:10.520 --> 53:14.760]  were there at the meetings with him out in the countryside of Morocco for two
[53:14.760 --> 53:17.920]  days while they were drinking sangria and then I talked to other people they
[53:17.920 --> 53:21.680]  go no that's true he was really pissed and about to go public he was a real
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.520]  liberal he was upset about the wrong things and he saw Kanye and everything
[53:25.520 --> 53:29.960]  else even in this interview he goes to being neutral on Trump from hating but
[53:29.960 --> 53:33.560]  see a few months later he was now got it and they go we're not letting Anthony
[53:33.560 --> 53:36.260]  Bourdain the hero to the left come out against us because he was going to come
[53:36.260 --> 53:40.160]  out because he wasn't a wimp he was going to come out and attack the left he
[53:40.160 --> 53:43.640]  was going to attack the establishment and they said we're not no no if they
[53:43.640 --> 53:47.960]  get this guy one of our own people to turn against us we're done and the
[53:47.960 --> 53:52.080]  Clintons looked at the calculation and said getter than a hammer and then you
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.120]  saw thousands of articles say that I was wrong and I was a liar you just think
[53:56.120 --> 54:02.640]  I go on air and say he owned his own production company he owned starting in
[54:02.640 --> 54:07.440]  February according to my sources which now word for word is confirmed months
[54:07.440 --> 54:13.160]  later a month plus later word for word ladies and gentlemen word for word word
[54:13.160 --> 54:18.360]  for word then he got progressively more awake and they he owned the final cut
[54:18.360 --> 54:22.040]  just like eyes wide shut I was Stanley Kubrick they cut 24 minutes out of it
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.000]  I know is in 24 minutes his daughter told me his protege the only person his
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.360]  family he liked and help direct his last films I mean I've been sworn to
[54:30.360 --> 54:33.120]  secrecy what I was told there I almost don't even want to know this stuff but
[54:33.120 --> 54:35.400]  if I'd have been better known before I was told I wouldn't want to know it I
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.680]  know about the NASA stuff I know about Dr. Strangelove I know about full metal
[54:41.680 --> 54:45.640]  jacket I know about I know about all of it for two days I was briefed on it let
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.760]  me take something all hell broke loose after I was given that information well
[54:49.760 --> 54:52.600]  let me tell you before Trump even showed up on the scene that's when hell
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.560]  broke loose four and a half years ago against me was when Vivian Kubrick told
[54:56.560 --> 55:01.160]  me all this stuff about the whole thing and it was stuff already knew and that
[55:01.160 --> 55:03.920]  was what was so crazy and I'm just stopping right there we got to come back
[55:03.920 --> 55:07.640]  and Mike Adams is waiting but we've got to get to these few clips and I'm sure
[55:07.640 --> 55:10.640]  he'll be fine with it he's a awesome guy I've joined us via Skype but I know I'm
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.960]  ranting your own it's just people understand I didn't just get up here and
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.000]  say he was gonna come out and say Weinstein's a rapist and right my my
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.160]  fiance and Bill Clinton's a rapist and Jerry Epstein's a rapist and they used
[55:21.160 --> 55:26.640]  child kidnapping to control people I was on the phone with people that had video
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.120]  of it they have the video you know to CNN kept their fat mouth shut because I
[55:31.120 --> 55:35.120]  told him I said CNN you say I'm a liar on this I'm gonna release it they kept
[55:35.120 --> 55:39.000]  their fat mouth shut but all their surrogates attacked this and said we
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.120]  were liars so again we're right again it's all in the Daily Mail how he was
[55:43.120 --> 55:46.240]  scared of the Clintons how they were a bunch of rapists how they were and that
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.200]  was in February this interview people were so scared in February they never
[55:50.200 --> 55:53.760]  published this they had to check with Weinstein and people we have all their
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.120]  spies in New York she was okay and see what happened they got enough pings back
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.800]  down their spider web that Bourdain was getting loose from the web that they
[56:01.800 --> 56:05.720]  ran in and went ahead and ate him before his soul got away from him they think
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.880]  well and again where are the apologies to Alex Jones for reporting the facts
[56:10.880 --> 56:15.160]  just for having the chutzpah to come out here and report this which other
[56:15.160 --> 56:18.520]  people may or may not have known the point is that you said it Alex and they
[56:18.520 --> 56:22.560]  came out and they attacked you for it you got vindicated once again so so you
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.800]  know I know that you're not you don't want apologies you do this because this
[56:26.800 --> 56:29.920]  is just getting the truth out there and that's your mission but it's just like
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.040]  it's gonna happen again and then Salon will attack and media matters will
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.880]  attack and David Brock and they'll all attack you and it's just like whoa you
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.560]  know a month later it all comes up true where's the apology oh I'm sorry I
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.280]  shouldn't expect an apology from Salon that endorses pedophilia and notice
[56:47.280 --> 56:51.000]  thousands thousands came out the taping for the Bourdain thing Jones claims he
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.080]  was killed by the Clintons I said I was told by smart people he was getting
[56:55.080 --> 56:58.160]  ready to go public against him and that he was scared and that he was basically
[56:58.160 --> 57:01.800]  hiding out but see that he had this whole crisis of contrasts because of his
[57:01.800 --> 57:05.960]  fiance who told him everything I was told by people that were at the meetings
[57:05.960 --> 57:11.040]  about him telling him about rituals and everything yeah he she needs to go
[57:11.040 --> 57:14.640]  public yeah he's in danger his wife put it all on social media I mean she she

[59:45.000 --> 59:53.560]  forward slash news letter we are the renaissance and we are winning. You're
[59:53.560 --> 01:00:06.880]  listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:16.960]  it's Alex Jones. Alright Mike Adams is coming up in 15 minutes with a mission
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.840]  that if you choose to accept it in fact when we intro Mike we play mission
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.680]  impossible I think it's in the computer the old original one or maybe the
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.880]  modern one but this is a mission very easy to win we have them
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.880]  arrogantly bragging that they're censoring conservatives Christians and
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.640]  plan a total takeover of the web the next few months and we have a blueprint
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.320]  stop it so that's coming up but next segment this is a short time we're
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.480]  gonna get to the Putin-Trump press conference the media freaking out Ryan
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.120]  Stelter all of it but just you came in at 4 a.m. with Rob doing the rest of
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.000]  crew you covered it all give people a briefing before we play these clips of
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.520]  what you witnessed. Well I think first off the fact that Putin and Trump were
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.880]  able to finally sit down in private and have the one-on-one meeting it's really
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.280]  probably immeasurable as to how important that is because Alex as you
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.760]  know they the globalists and the deep state of America they want their eyes
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.000]  they want their ears they want their fingertips they want their noses all
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.840]  over any so they can misquote it and so that they can manipulate it too well
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.960]  they don't control Putin that's why they hate him say whatever you want about
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.000]  Putin it's true he's not controlled by the globalist and they don't control
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.520]  Trump he's not part of their secret societies not in their sex cults so now
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.560]  you have not an admin sexual little boys now you have the two most I mean you
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.560]  could I guess debate this but my opinion the two most powerful men in the
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.040]  world Donald Trump and Vladimir don't like to have sexual kids and who aren't
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:47.240]  in sex cults meeting one-on-one and the globalist have no clue what's going on
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.280]  Kissinger has no idea what's going on Clinton has no idea what's going on
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.000]  Obama has no idea what's going on Erdogan has no idea what's going on then
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.680]  you go down the list right so they're panicked Alex because they don't know
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.400]  what they're saying they know they're running a Psyop right now claiming that
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.040]  Russia is hacking the election so what does Putin do Putin says okay well I'll
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.920]  tell you what why don't you enlist our ministry our agencies and let's dig into
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.520]  this together let's find out who actually hacks them so now and this is just I
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.520]  mean there were so many now Putin says we're gonna send our people to your
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.280]  court they're gonna land on planes you're not gonna be we're gonna come and
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.640]  show you that Hillary buying bots in Russia but but you think about it Alex
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.800]  and the honestly the whole thing was bombshell but but how can this is how
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:39.760]  empty it really is Robert Mueller how can he possibly indict 12 Russians for
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.960]  hacking the servers that he's never investigated that no one's ever
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.400]  investigated Trump brought it up Putin brought it up so it's gonna be the
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.160]  second time Russia is gonna have legal representation in the FBI try to get in
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.160]  the DMC servers we're gonna place clip 22 times they're like hiding the servers
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  going the Russians are in it but you can't look at them if you like if I said
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.640]  if you like if I said my wife ran off into the night hypothetically and is
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.000]  missing but let me see but then I don't call the cops when it happens I just
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.360]  tell him later oh she just ran away no your wife runs off crazy middle of the
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.480]  night you call the police it's like oh I have the servers but no yeah oh your
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.880]  wife ran off all right we're gonna come investigate your house no don't come in
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.320]  my house but she's not here but don't come in and so so they already demanded
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.440]  discovery for the original indictments Mueller balked didn't show up made some
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.160]  bogus claim he didn't have enough evidence that was just a bot and you
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.600]  never indict someone until you have all the evidence so that's a lie so here's
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.360]  what's gonna happen Alex they're gonna show up in court they're gonna demand
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.360]  discovery and Mueller's gonna get caught with his tail between his legs and
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.760]  they're either gonna be forced to turn over the servers or they're gonna have
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.480]  egg on their face when they're like well we're not gonna turn over the servers
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.640]  you eat servers you want evidence to go screw you well that's why they drop the
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.720]  Roger Stone Trump suits saying they're Russian agencies okay we want to access
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.480]  those servers it's all made up we're Russian agents like we're again
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.240]  Martians from Pluto man we're Americans well let's not look at the country
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.520]  coming back but now they see now it's the whole thing attack Putin demonize
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.000]  Putin indict the Russians you know oh this vindicates things now that they
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.280]  indicted another fake group of indictments by the crooks that have been
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.640]  caught in their emails and text messages saying we're gonna keep him from
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.040]  getting elected we're gonna kick him out of office we've got a manufacturer stuff
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.240]  we're frauds it's all food of the poison tree they're so the whole thing should be
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.720]  dropped I mean if listen if they caught detectives in a in a in a murder trial
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.400]  in emails or text messages saying we got to set these people up we got to make
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.040]  sure they go to jail it's over they're guilty the investigation the trials over
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.440]  because it's BS you mean like OJ Simpson case hmm it's exactly what happened they
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:59.520]  manipulated evidence and he got off even though he did I want to plow into all
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.640]  of this but I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:17.120]  or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com you are funding
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.840]  the revolution I mean I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that

[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.520]  that's my dad the colloidal silver and iodine as well infowarslife.com or
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.760]  AAA2533139 and your purchase of the products stands with us stands with
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.080]  America stands with Trump stands against the globalists and their satanic
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.720]  pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:06:10.160]  they're coming back against us so we need your support if you are receiving
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:26.400]  this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:51.920]  when they cut one of our heads off home we just grow two more because you see
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.360]  the globalists think that we're Satanist like them and that we just want to
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.040]  dominate only according to our own personal gain but we're connected to
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.360]  everything it's the gain of everybody for justice in the future and fighting
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.000]  evil and so we don't mind being demonized or attacked or even sacrificing
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.440]  ourselves not even from a historic perspective but from a spiritual
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.120]  perspective knowing it's those decisions that govern who we are well and I
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.560]  always like to use sports analogies it's like you know a ball hog where okay
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.120]  maybe you have the best player on the floor but he's a ball hog nobody else
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.160]  is getting involved you never win a championship so so you want to be on the
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.280]  winning team that's what this is all about it's not about Alex Jones getting
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.960]  all the credit because he was right about Anthony Bourdain or all the other
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.800]  tomorrow's news today it's about we want Americans to be informed so they can
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.720]  make informed decisions that's really what this comes down to they on the left
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.360]  and even in the Republicans in historical perspectives but it's changing
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.280]  out because of Trump they don't want informed voters they don't want you to
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.680]  know it they enjoy the total control and thinking of us as a bunch of idiots but
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.400]  we're not idiots that's why they try to keep the info from us and here's the
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.560]  perfect example because we got we got to go to these clips they don't want people
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.760]  to know that the DNC and the DCCC have still never turned their servers over
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.360]  if anyone is guilty of obstruction of justice it's the damn Democrats it's an
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.080]  open shut case and I love how they changed the subject from her illegal
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.360]  server that all these countries were accessing she was using as a drop box
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.560]  like the old spy would put in a trash can or under the bench she just oh my
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.480]  server added up all his classified info on that another five million goes into
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.280]  her bank account yeah where made three plus billion dollars I mean Mike yeah
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.520]  yeah all these foreign governments are putting money in her bank account oh it's
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:38.680]  a foundation Russians are hacking while Obama's president not Trump Obama but
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.880]  that narrative doesn't seem to exist you know see they had to they had to say
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.080]  Trump's the Russian to open the fake investigation and then cover up their
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.640]  their their illegal spying and it's all falling down around them and they're all
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.680]  betting that you're an idiot the first one I want to play as Brian Stelter then
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.240]  we'll play the three clips that are most important and then Mike Adams is coming
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:01.480]  up but this is so incredible Brian Stelter put this out last night saying
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.600]  you know he he's gonna be meeting soon the next few hours with Putin he is a
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.440]  liar you can't trust him everything he says is a fraud actually you guys say
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.560]  everything he says is a lie Trump's only gone sideways on three things he said
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:24.360]  vaccines and the situation in Afghanistan and then you could argue he's
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.560]  been too strong on Russia it's actually incredible how he's crushing them for no
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.960]  reason but again they're not screwing us over like like the EU is but fine
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.560]  whatever the point is he's certainly in our interest I mean there's no doubt and
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.240]  then here's this little anti-American globalist at CNN known to hate flyover
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.120]  country known to hate this country their own admissions listen to this
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.720]  projection where everything he's saying is him he's a fraud he's dishonorable
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.880]  he's just dropping from the New York Times everything he's saying is him and
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.560]  it's so disingenuous and so wimpy this is just epic here it is Putin and Trump
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.880]  plan to meet for a private one-on-one conversation before official talks
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.360]  begin ooh no aides no notetakers so we'll never really know what is said
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.840]  because that's going back to Malta and going back to presidents always meet
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.240]  with foreign leaders privately but again he thinks you're dumb he's
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.080]  stelter you're dumb he doesn't know he thinks you don't know this is standard
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:36.920]  continue said because really can we trust either man no we can't in the past the
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.240]  US president's words have projected power and shaped global decision plus
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.320]  again Trump is seen all over the world is one of those powerful presidents ever
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.680]  everyone's at all everything he's doing has been successful so far but again oh
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.040]  we don't have power anymore we're a joke the economy's coming back all the
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.120]  positivity people believe in the future but again stelters demoralizing you
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.640]  like Tokyo rose oh as we're about to invade the Japanese homeland 1945 you've
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.040]  lost America's been conquered everybody it's like Baghdad Bob this guy's like
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.760]  Baghdad Bob continue what the president said meant something it meant a lot but
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.240]  not now not anymore what president Trump says is so frequently false or
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.440]  nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning the same power the same
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:31.720]  impact as past presidents it's a shame back it up 10 seconds the president
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.680]  doesn't have power his words don't have power anymore we don't have any power
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.280]  no you don't have any power anymore see it it's all what you are this is
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.440]  incredible one minute continue just look at that so frequently false or
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.640]  nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning the same power the same
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:56.240]  impact as past presidents but this big failure is defeating you continue it's
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.840]  a shame but it's true it possible it's a shame but it's true just because you
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.200]  say a pile of dog crap as chocolate Dutch chocolate ice cream doesn't make
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.040]  it so you know I mean would you let Brian Stelter babysit your kids just look
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.520]  at that face let's continue Trump simply cannot be trusted he has proven this
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.280]  himself time and time again it's his own lies and his own contradictions that
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:26.600]  have proven it and that is why this is a profound test for journalists a profound
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.520]  test will you really attack him more he's up there buggy whipping like he's the
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  boss ban info wars info wars is a disease take Jones off the air so he can't
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.880]  respond so I can lie about him and he can't respond to me this is the cult of
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.560]  this little son of a bitch well it's a perfect that he actually looks and acts
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.800]  like George Costanza you know Costanza kind of a cheap skate but he's a
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.400]  lovable guy don't compare George Costanza to this you know what I'm saying
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.960]  it's the boy for the point is he's a joker he's a con man you can't trust him
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.800]  but that's the spokesman for lock up your kids man pennywise Stelter but you
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.880]  know what Alex here's the thing you'll float to you know he's floating alright
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.720]  here's the thing I would love to wind up and punch Brian Stelter right in the
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.920]  face but here's the problem he's not even there he's not really there he's an
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.080]  aberration he's let's be clear we don't wish any harm on him a Democrat shooting
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.280]  members of Congress and breaking Ron Paul's ribs and calling for violence
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.840]  we're peaceful no I'm just I'm just saying he's not see that's what it is we
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.040]  won't know what Trump and Putin doesn't he look like the subway spokesperson
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:35.680]  well don't I think he looks more like great comedian get don't compare Jason
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.960]  Alexander's a great comedian we love George Costanza put him next to pennywise
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.920]  but but he said it all in the opening he says we're not gonna know what Trump
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.780]  and Putin say oh my gosh Brian you mean you're gonna be crapping your little
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.480]  adult diaper because Trump and Putin might be conspiring to make the world
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.680]  a better place oh no Stelter what will you do he's an aberration he's fake look
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.320]  it really is Delta lost some weight right there oh my gosh that's actually
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.320]  Jared from Subway I thought that was Brian Stelter they must be separated and
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.240]  I want to be clear I'm not saying Brian Stelter's a pedophile I don't think I
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.360]  just think he looks like I'm just saying he fluts with the rest of them I'm
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.160]  just saying he scares the hell out of me he's one scary looking big well
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.400]  anybody who's willing to look he's got the look he's got the look yeah he's got
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.000]  the look anybody who's willing to go on whoa
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:39.520]  that's Hillary Clinton's daughter her beer mr. Ed that is that is Webster Hubble's daughter hello Wilbur
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.880]  hello Wilbur a horse is a horse of course of course that is of course
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.120]  unless the horse is a famous mr. Ed so what is it what I mean we have a
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.560]  lot of these big historic clips we're gonna get to a man and here's the thing
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.480]  Alex I think that the reason why Brian Stelter is desperately lying like he is
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.400]  to his audience is because he knows that he's dying he knows CNN is dying he
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.600]  knows they're an aberration you can't even and the fact that they've got to put
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.520]  a turd like that in the game I'm saying I'm not calling for bounce I'm just
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.520]  saying if you swing it Stelter you miss there's nothing there it's like swinging
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.480]  it seeing it swinging it they're dead it's like slimer from Ghostbusters exactly
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.560]  they're not actually there they're just an aberration they're just projecting

[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.480]  fire Paul Watson wrote a six-page boil down report that also links to his
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:46.680]  report that's on infowars.com but the 50 plus page report the censorship master
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.640]  plan decoded is from the enemy's own arrogant statements but no one had
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.760]  collated this together or produced a battle plan just like Congress doesn't
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:02.040]  read the bills if folks read the articles on infowars.com and retweet
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.800]  them and Facebook them and hand share them and get them to Congress for the
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.760]  hearings they're having tomorrow this will change the world because no one did
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.360]  this people said well why don't we have airplanes earlier although we're right
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.080]  brothers didn't come along why don't we have radio earlier well Marconi didn't
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.480]  come along this is their own arrogant admissions they think we're stupid they've
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.560]  bought off the so-called free speech watchdogs ACLU electronic frontier
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.600]  foundation so we're having to do it and Mike Adams an engineer software
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.600]  designer that's selling author he knows what's going on he writes all these great
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:42.160]  articles I said why don't you put together the whole decode of this of
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.520]  what's happening and how to strike back against it so that a lot of big news
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.000]  obviously John Brennan is a total trader of this country converted to a
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.280]  hobbyism and caught line to Congress since Trump press conference an
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.440]  impeachable offense treasonous to even meet with the Russians and talk about
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.040]  working together even though Trump's squeezing Russia incredible that's all
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.040]  coming up we've got highlights of it the Awan brothers it's all coming out
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.760]  Hillary server but right now emergency report the censorship master plan
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.360]  emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed if you we all know as
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.440]  libertarians as nationalists as conservatives as natural health
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:22.840]  advocates are real anti-war liberals we all know free thinkers organizations
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.040]  groups the globalists don't like that challenge their system we all know of
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.560]  all the diverse groups out there that we've been censored we've been blocked
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.560]  and it's gotten exponentially worse well now they've come out and jump the
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.480]  shark last week and in big public symposiums admitted we're gonna shut
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.920]  down info wars and everybody else so it's all there and Mike Adams has
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.400]  collated it into this report that you can forward that you can send a talk show
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:50.520]  host that you can ring the alarm this is it we have their Death Star plans Mike
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.880]  Adams congratulations on your great work Paul Watson want to thank him as well
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.040]  and the whole crew here I don't normally hype things up you know we broke the
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:01.320]  Bourdain thing as I had sources inside that said he had a Kanye West moment
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.080]  was saying he wanted to basically kill Harvey Weinstein was going to expose
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.400]  Bill Clinton as a rapist and now that's come out mainstream news today and I'm
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.360]  told even more is about to come out including video so people better watch
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:19.640]  out but I tell you this is so huge try to encapsulate for people why this is so
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.520]  important because again no one understands the attack plan it's so
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.360]  complex people throw their hands up you have in there from their own admissions
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.480]  diagrammed at all well primarily Alex and thanks for having me on the tech
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.760]  Giants thought that they could censor and de-platform and shadow ban all of us
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.360]  and that no one would notice because they do it using covert algorithms and
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.080]  they're doing it for a purpose that I outline in the report which turned out
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.240]  to balloon to 59 pages by the way but you know you're free to print it and
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.320]  share it and post it and Paul Joseph Watson did a really great story covering
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.560]  it as well but they're doing this because number one they want to create an
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.040]  internet where there's only one allowable opinion on any given topic and
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:09.480]  that that official opinion is determined by radical left-wing ideology which is
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.240]  always a moving target no one can possibly keep up with it they redefine
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.080]  it daily and so it's it's basically insanity it's a call for online
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:23.360]  insanity echo chambers where no one is allowed to dissent on any top whatsoever
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.880]  from climate change to politics to gender to finance to history all of these
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:33.840]  topics and much more we're looking at a nuclear apocalypse of censorship if we
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.360]  don't stop this right now and that's why we have to have these legislative and
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.400]  regulatory actions I've outlined 13 of them in the report that the legislators
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.600]  and regulators could use as a starting point to brainstorm action to take action
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:54.920]  you've either got to indict these CEOs of Facebook for racketeering or you've
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:01.000]  got to you gotta reel in the censorship you've got to make them expose their
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.320]  algorithms for example you have to have appeals methods a due process system in
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.640]  place for people who have been banned or maybe you write a law that says that
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.880]  people who have been banned can sue Google and sue YouTube and sue Facebook
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.760]  for punitive damages as well as actual damages this is a blueprint this this
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.360]  document destroys the entire justification the hate speech nonsense the
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.040]  fake news nonsense it destroys it with an academic language approach I don't
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.880]  know if you've had a chance to read even a few paragraphs it's excellent it's
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.480]  designed for Congress and the lawyers to show them that they're creating prior
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.680]  restraint shelling effect a giant reeducation camp online where if you
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.640]  promote whatever their latest garbage is you get promoted which is a form of
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.680]  digital payoff digital currency everyone else is shunted and controlled this is
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:59.280]  just unprecedented this technotronic takeover it actually it is the
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:05.240]  crushing of the human soul and they've lost control of the narrative Alex CNN
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.480]  is panicked panic because they know that if you were allowed to compete in the
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.440]  marketplace the free ideas you would crush CNN I mean you're crushing them
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.320]  anyway in terms of audience but CNN would be obsolete overnight they are
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.200]  panicked they have to call for destroying you and your network because they
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.560]  can't compete with your ideas they can't compete with your news reporting staff
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.280]  and I outline all this in the report fact by fact paragraph by paragraph with
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.440]  citations with examples irrefutable logic on many levels this is a blueprint
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.640]  for how we fight back and stop the techno dictatorship that's tried to
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.400]  destroy our country and listen we don't want to be the only ones doing this it
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.800]  actually scares us when I talked to Mike last week I said you're an engineer
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.080]  you're a well-known tech writer you've got hundreds of websites this is
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.720]  successful as info wars just under the radar I said I don't know how to try to
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:02.240]  put this together how little folks need it and I was so upset that they say no
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.320]  one's done a report no one's collated their own admissions well we've done it
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.800]  now this is this is quotes and admissions and exhibits of the crimes they've
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.680]  committed against our republic and our free speech and a public conspiracy
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.200]  against free will and free association this is the true civil rights human
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.240]  rights fight of the century I can't believe we're right in the middle of it
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:28.160]  Mike yeah and and you know what you look at the writing of Paul Joseph Watson or
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.040]  even this report I know we're going to break but we know what we're talking
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.040]  about because we have been attacked we have had to defend ourselves we have had
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:40.120]  to build systems to defend against these assaults so we intimately know how the
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.160]  sense right it's going on forever it's just now it what it's a hundred times
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.360]  worse exactly we are experts because we have experienced it we do exactly Mike

[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:28.480]  info wars comm and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:34.880]  which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.040]  later transdimensionally over the space time continuum through full space where
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:44.560]  people are extremely lazy the social engineers are there laughing what we
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.800]  envisioned a hundred years ago 20 years ago is now reality while the society
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.200]  unravels men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men and women run
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.800]  around frantic not only women and they don't understand that it's an
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:03.120]  animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed it's fulfilling
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:09.800]  to be involved it's fulfilling info wars tomorrow's news today
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:16.600]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:23.840]  lines of the info war there's so much entertainment so much news out there but
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.560]  what you're hearing is the only detailed scientific report from their own
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.480]  admissions for the plan to in free speech not just here but worldwide now
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:39.560]  being executed against anybody who's nationalist or capitalist I had the
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.760]  2018 election and beyond Mike Adams natural news comm is an engineer an
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.440]  expert he and Paul Watson both have reports out today Paul has a boil down
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:54.000]  report on his report they're at natural news comm info wars comm and I know all
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.360]  you already know this our listeners like Alex we know there's since for
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:01.800]  everybody we don't expand Congress doesn't understand it the president
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.200]  understands it's going on but doesn't even know his Twitter pushes most of
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.520]  Twitter users don't even get it sent to him so Facebook said last week look we
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.840]  already ban Alex Jones from sharing info we kick his page off he ensues just
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.520]  don't look we already banned them CNN stop New York Times Washington Post
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.960]  thousands of publications but they're making their big push there's this big
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.320]  fight Mike Adams want to get back in your report it's on info wars comm the
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.680]  censorship master plan decoded again I like it to a Star Wars analogy episode
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.360]  four these are Death Star plans these are valuable see the globalists just
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.560]  think you're idiots and then just oh that's just no big deal you know you
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.120]  think it's a little piece of gold foil sitting there on the side of the road
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.680]  it's a big old gold coin this is critical this is their battle plan this is
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.000]  how to show what they're doing and then expose them and defeat them it's on
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  info wars comm right now get it get it tweet it Facebook it share it print off
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.400]  copies call Congress email it to Congress everyone hammer them that they
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.760]  got hearings tomorrow legitimizing this Mike what do you think's going on in
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.520]  the intramural battles of the big corporate dying dinosaur media that's
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.240]  very jealous of Facebook YouTube and Google because they still get force fed
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.920]  to everybody but they don't want that's not enough they want us completely banned
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.520]  because they admit these reports that will other people create subsites they
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.640]  still share it it goes viral other places they want that desire of
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.360]  legitimizing the complete ban first in cyberspace and then physically but but
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.760]  what do you think your smart guys going on in the public debate is it about
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.680]  legitimizing censorship or or is it just panicking where are they going well
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:43.680]  they they are panicked I call them media monopolist and they've come to the
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.280]  realization that without the artificial algorithmic boosting of their visibility
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.880]  by Facebook Google and others they would already be obsolete the independent
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.080]  media is really the decentralization of information and news analysis it's
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.240]  giving power back to the people decentralization is good for society
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:08.440]  centralized news or monopolize news is New York Times Washington Post CNN and
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.840]  you know they're handed scripts every day of what to say what to report and
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.600]  what to avoid reporting that model is obsolete the people don't want to be
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:23.400]  spoon-fed false narratives every day by different faces spouting the exact same
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.560]  words over and over again people want a diversity of ideas a diversity of
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.120]  analysis people understand in fact that there are different points of view in
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.360]  the world and they'd like to actually eat from that ideological and they're
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.800]  trying to define different points of view as fake news that's right and then
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:47.080]  the platform and you're right they are hanging on and they're absolutely
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:51.080]  panicked and remember that the the central assertion of these media
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:57.400]  monopolists is that they alone have a unique divine right or a divine ability
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.240]  to discern reality without bias or distortion and that no one in the
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.720]  independent media they claim has any such capability and can't even obtain
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.160]  such a capability in other words they think they are gods or that they are in
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.640]  touch with actual gods even though they hate religion and they hate Christians
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.520]  their mythology their dogma is that they are the gods of truth and that anyone
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.720]  who disagrees with them is by default fake news so that's that's the the dark
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.800]  corner of the media that we have now crept into and we're exposing it
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.440]  every day that's what this report is about and that's why info wars not just
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.760]  survival but thriving and expanding and so crucial to the freedom to think in
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.800]  our society remember they're they're trying to crush your freedom to think
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.440]  not just your freedom to share a link or your freedom to express your voice but
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.200]  your very freedom to think for yourself that is what is under assault because the
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.560]  media monopolist in order for them to maintain control over society and
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.360]  influence the outcomes of elections they must be able to inject and insert
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.800]  thoughts ideas cultural narratives and belief systems into the minds of the
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.960]  masses Alex and let's bring this up to your in your smart businessman not
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.880]  just an engineer and all the things you've done the Streisand effect the
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.000]  arrogance of stelter saying ban info wars Cuomo saying ban info wars them
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.640]  having conferences they are so crazy that historically you say something's
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:29.680]  banned you push it right to the avant-garde and so it's it's why do you
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:36.320]  think they've chosen info wars and then let's go into the section how would you
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.120]  talk about the way to counter this because the chosen that's the most
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.480]  important part we needed we need Congress to know hey read the report now
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.520]  here's what you do we have all the cards as President Trump says this is one of
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.200]  the few areas where he fights with them instead of understanding they've hijacked
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.760]  utilities they have engaged in classical racketeering they must be I mean to have
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.520]  CNN calling because when you read the reports out of the New York Times they
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:05.040]  want everyone banned all quote conspiracy theories when CNN says the fact
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.440]  checkers we don't like what they're saying that Hillary you know has bad
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:11.840]  health problems or whatever or the Federal Reserve's private they want the
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.280]  power to ban that that is so draconian they're clearly villains so how are they
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.720]  risking jumping the shark like this well they specifically target you and I
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:25.520]  outlined some of this in the report because your delivery style which is
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.080]  aggressive which is asking big questions kind of shaking people awake out of a
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.600]  slumber almost like a people are in almost a hypnotic type of slumber where
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.560]  they're subjected to this this IV drip info war is the opposite of NPR it's
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.360]  more like an annoying alarm clock exactly an NPR I'm glad you mentioned that
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.080]  because it is lulling people to sleep you got to understand that that controlling
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:55.480]  people's thoughts and ideas requires a continuous CNN fake news dis info stream
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.960]  it has to be uninterrupted and you Alex Jones are the interrupter of that toxic
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.800]  stream of disinformation that CNN is trying to drip into the minds of people
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.960]  you are the primary interrupter I actually call you that in the report
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.120]  you're the interrupter of the false paradigm that's being shoved into the
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.880]  minds of the masses and that is key because they don't go after independent
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.880]  media outlets that are you know more subdued or more stylistically like the
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.320]  mainstream media they're going after you because you're the guy who walks into
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.560]  the room of people being you know lulled to sleep and you know you rip off the
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:36.240]  covers and you throw ice on them and you say wake up look what's happening here
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.280]  welcome to reality that's what you do and you're the best at it and that's why
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.880]  they're trying to take you down well all I know is you're easy they do want
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.760]  people hypnotically into a lull be lazy be dumb and I'm running around raising
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.440]  an alarm bell I'm just like Paul Revere you and they've also censored you
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.920]  massively as well and it's a real badge of honor that's happened it's not about
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:59.480]  shooting horns folks it's about what are they most afraid of that lets you know
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.120]  what is most effective and the turn is into warriors Alex I mean think about
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.320]  this we are stronger and more determined and more passionate and even really more
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.160]  informed today because of all the attacks on us I mean think about how you
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:17.200]  and I and Paul Watson attacks totally motivated absolutely they've turned us
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.080]  into warriors they've given us the spirit of the founding fathers the
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:27.000]  revolutionary spirit to take back our nation and our freedom of speech we are
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.120]  stronger today because of it and that's why we will win stay there my friend
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.080]  your analysis of the whole Trump-Putin meeting with Owen shroyer coming in and

[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.280]  and we're glad because it means we're effective but it's just so critical
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.160]  realized without you spreading the word or sharing the links we're nothing the

[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:08.520]  worldwide awakening to their tyranny and America yet again is at the heart of the
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.360]  resistance the globalist that's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:16.080]  supporters to think about info wars now more than ever and what would the world
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.320]  be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist what would have
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.360]  happened if you hadn't supported info wars we would not be having the victories
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.720]  we have today so yes a lot of good things are happening but the enemy is
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.000]  tracking back so please think about info wars and funding our operation while

[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.080]  that this 4th of July special and our sales are special to match it info or
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.720]  store.com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.000]  drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.360]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.840]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.880]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.440]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.560]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.880]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:41.120]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.360]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:58.120]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.880]  fueling your body is hard work that's why we've introduced the info wars life

[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:05.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:27.160]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.240]  all right we got a long way to go in a short time to get there but I was
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:33.560]  literally during the four-minute break thinking and then I came back and sat
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:39.560]  down and Mike Adams the Skype the health ranger started saying the exact
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.160]  thing thing I was thinking when I was in the bathroom combing my hair and
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.560]  flossing my teeth because I just had a hamburger and it was like when I was on
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.160]  the plane years ago flying to the view of New York and one of the heads of one
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.280]  of the big banks was on board he said alex you don't get it you think people
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.320]  adapt and overcome tyranny they will submit deterrent and I was gonna come
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.600]  back and say that and Mike said they don't during the break he goes they
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.200]  don't think we're fighters they think we're gonna lay down they're just in
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.160]  control of things because people have handed over responsibility and aren't
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.160]  conscious and just submit and that's exactly what I was about to say when you
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.240]  understand that fighting back and being involved is animating and makes you
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.360]  stronger and it's the only hope you've got plus you always have victory if you
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.480]  take action not at first but down the road because it creates these wavelengths
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.880]  these ripples in the pond culturally spiritually economically that are
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.440]  unstoppable with the whole human momentum of our ancestors that were such
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.480]  winners they've just diverted off a softness of a loser area we're winners
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.880]  we're an incredible species with unlimited potential and if you get
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.720]  animated and get upset and then take action with the information you're
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.040]  unstoppable say Mike said they turn us into warriors I don't sit here when I
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.600]  get attacked or get blocked or whatever and go oh my god poor me but see the
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.240]  globalists they all sell out to power for whatever is easiest they're a
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.720]  collection of weenies and sellouts and weaklings but we as trailblazers rugged
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.760]  individuals only get stronger in the animating contest of liberty Mike well
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.040]  think about it if you if your parents and you have two kids and one kid you
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.800]  just give them everything bonus points they don't have to earn anything there's
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.120]  no merit to their behavior they get everything but then the other kid you
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.040]  have you make them earn everything which kid is going to be stronger and the same
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.720]  thing is happening in media we in the independent media we have to not just
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:32.320]  earn everything that we're getting we have to work twice as hard three times
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.720]  as hard as the media Monopolis because we are being artificially penalized so
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:43.120]  we have become in essence just from a pragmatic point of view the modern the
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.760]  modern Spartans maybe right right I mean guerrilla information marketing you
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.960]  know things like that I mean we we know how to get the word out and we don't
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.200]  depend on these mainstream systems because those systems have been
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.160]  penalizing us for so long we've had to find workarounds now if they would stop
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:04.520]  censoring us we would be a hundred times bigger you know almost immediately
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.640]  because there is an effect and by the way I know your numbers I don't mind
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:13.120]  that's actually true I know I know it is true you know millions of followers I
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.120]  have on Facebook you have you know tens of millions across they won't even let
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.160]  you hit any of them that's exactly right you built them you go there you
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.720]  advertise with your huge platform and built it and then they steal it and then
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.440]  won't even let you have access to it but then let the left be force-fed I want to
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.360]  get to some of these clips oh and you want to comment well yeah I just to talk
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.000]  about real quick what you're saying about the animating contest of liberty
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.880]  just to kind of give a physical representation or manifestation of that
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:47.160]  imagine a land whatever you choose all historically just a bunch of slaves
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.120]  working in the fields or on the pyramids or whatever you want to say and
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.120]  they all know their slaves no press but they just kind of do it that's all they
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.800]  know and even though they think they need to rebel they don't see it so they
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.760]  just kind of go along but then as soon as they see one person attacking the
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.520]  slave master two people three or four people boom all of a sudden everyone's
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.760]  attacking and it's like bam kicking the gear fight take them down get your
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.120]  freedom back that's the engagement that's the clicking that's what you're
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.440]  doing and think about it most your mainline conservatives and people know
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:20.560]  their censorship so they all pay their pound of flesh and attack me or say
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:24.480]  whatever and then get promoted and go oh look I got promoted but you're
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.520]  promoting crap it's empty so you just parroted what they wanted that wasn't
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.880]  you you just lost your soul one person we reach through their barricade of lies
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:39.800]  is worth more than a million zombies we're not trying to win in their paradigm just
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.000]  like China has a social scoring system there is a de facto system in place in
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.280]  America today where if you if you attack Alex Jones you're gonna get moved up in
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:53.400]  the media but if you go along with anything that info wars says then
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.520]  you're going to be penalized it's not it's not an official scoring system but
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:00.000]  it's an unofficial covert scoring system and it is in place and it is modeled
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.640]  after China and that's the most key things been said today you get into
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:09.240]  how they're outsourcing in your report on page 46 the censorship foreign
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:12.120]  countries the Chinese government just banned I mean I know your wife's
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:17.520]  Taiwanese the emoji of Taiwan for all Apple users globally was banned and it
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.920]  would crash your phone if you used it I mean the level of control is
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:26.440]  unbelievable yes and they claim they have no responsibility because they're
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:29.980]  outsourcing the censorship to these radical left-wing groups like at the
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:33.680]  SPLC which has been widely so where are the civil rights lawsuits where are the
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:38.680]  racketeering suits where are the Human Rights Commission meetings where are the
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.360]  censorship hearings where are the monopoly hearings this is cut and dry
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:46.480]  Tim Cook and Apple don't just have slave factories now they officially moved
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:52.040]  five months ago to China and now let them control in America what emoji you
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.480]  can send my god America what are you gonna put up with next and if if this
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:02.000]  censorship had been targeting leftists the ACLU would be screaming bloody
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.600]  murder right now the EFF would be all over it there would be protests
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.840]  nationwide there will be mobs of people protesting the Facebook buildings and
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.680]  camp I and headquarters all across the country if leftists were being censored
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.440]  but because it's conservatives being censored the left is perfectly okay
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:20.920]  with it because what they want an authoritarian society where they
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:26.440]  control the only allowable opinion that can be spoken or shared in any online
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:32.320]  forum that is an Orwellian authoritarian tyrannical dictatorship and that's
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.600]  what they want so they can open the borders without dissent so they can
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:38.600]  take your guns without anybody being able to complain online or share a
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:42.080]  complaint so they can get rid of Trump and bring in whoever they want without
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.080]  anyone being able to and that you know even more Mike Adams is everything he
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.400]  said I keep saying that's the most important that's the most important
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.840]  until he trumps or something more important they're launching the super
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:56.840]  risky mass censorship program that was in beta to now maximum you know 90 plus
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:01.040]  percent of conservatives being banned it was 80% last week because they're
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.760]  getting ready to make their move civil war they already call the civil war I
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:07.960]  go hey look they say we're in a civil war oh Jones playing for the civil war
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:13.680]  they're the one saying it Rob Reiner Bill Maher Michael Moore I want to play
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.600]  some of these clips but again they think their audience is so dumb they go we're
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.840]  in a civil war time to start overthrowing I go well look they say we're in a civil
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.880]  war Jones is crazy ban him he says they're a civil war well the civil war
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.960]  is already begun in the online realm and it's the left and now Uber has a list of
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.400]  conservatives that won't give you rides just like China won't let you fly if you
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.320]  have a bad social score remember the first chapter of every kinetic war is
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.120]  the info war as as you well know that's the name of your operation the
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.200]  information war is happening online it is the opening chapter of the civil war
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.360]  and they want to take it kinetic this is like enemy armies this is like enemy
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:56.760]  armies building up on your border that's right I mean they're here it's on
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:04.040]  Owen well and again what do they do to the slave that steps out and shows the
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.640]  rest of the slaves hey you don't have to be a slave stand up for yourself what
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.720]  do they do that they flogging exactly that's what they're doing to you Alex
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.240]  that's what they're doing info wars we're the ones awakening the mind slaves
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.400]  I'm sorry it's true and I'm glad to do it I'm not bitching I'm not a victim but
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:21.520]  they got us strapped up with cat or nine tails then I don't care they don't
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.240]  care what they do they've they've they've attacked Mike and we're not bitching
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.120]  we're saying we are over the target we are bombers are getting the main flag we
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.880]  are dropping bombs on the enemy if you want to be part of the war join us

[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.200]  a drill it's not a game it's not a joke behind the scenes they've got
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.160]  intelligence ops they've got PIs they've got stuff folks if I told you you
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.120]  wouldn't believe it but I'm not gonna give them the time of day talking about
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:55.000]  it it has been for four years total war and the last year it's intensified
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.280]  massively and I'm not complaining I asked for this but I'm just telling you
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.680]  this is total war this isn't entertainment this isn't Netflix Mike
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.880]  Adams they've driven us they've driven us Alex to the point where in terms of
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.800]  online presence we have nothing left to lose think about that it's not like we
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:17.000]  want to appease Google or appease Facebook they practically censored us to
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.880]  the point of oblivion anyway with with down raking algorithms you know
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.120]  punishment a shadow banning all these things we have nothing left to lose in
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.960]  the online world you either stand up and fight or you become completely obsolete
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.480]  and a lot of folks they think our listeners will go well I better not
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.840]  promote natural news or info or says I'll get restricted or ban you're gonna
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:38.800]  lose it all anyways again let's exactly on the internet we're as big as ever

[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.400]  banned not just on big platforms but they're physically suing us they're
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.840]  trying to sabotage us they're trying to infiltrate us we've got Hillary's law
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.520]  firms contacting anybody that ever worked here offering the money to lie
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.640]  about us this is total war people a lot of folks go well you're dumb to fight
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.000]  them no you're dumb to roll over you're not Americans I'm talking to the
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  minority of folks that listen if you don't understand how critical this is
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.840]  shame on you and really got to ask people did you want to wake up in a
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:13.040]  society where you can't even share a link or utter a sentence online unless you
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.040]  first check to see is that the officially allowed sentence for today and
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.160]  is it different from yesterday's opinion and then you're alerted for being a
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.440]  parent that's right that's right because they want the internet to be an
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:29.160]  authoritarian echo chamber of bad ideas liberal ideas are bad ideas they don't
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.080]  work and that's why we must defeat them we'll be back in two minutes I got to

[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:24.840]  the resistance well here's putans as the cold war is over we carefully
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:29.120]  analyze the current status the present and the future of the Russia the United
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.440]  States relationship key issues of the global agenda it's quite clear to
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.160]  everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:43.480]  complicated stage and yet those impediments the current tension the tense
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:49.400]  atmosphere essentially have no solid reason behind it the cold war is a
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.200]  thing of past the era of acute ideological confrontation of the two
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:58.960]  countries the thing of a remote past is a very vestige of the past the era of
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:03.560]  human expansion and renaissance is here if we can defeat the globalist Mike
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.280]  Adams your take on that powerful club well part of the reason the globalist
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.160]  need to dominate the media is because they can't allow humanity to explore the
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.960]  innovation the entrepreneurship and the individual creativity that leads to
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:19.000]  abundance and prosperity prosperity makes the globalist obsolete that's
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.080]  really the bottom line to all of this I know you've covered this in various ways
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.680]  many times but setting humanity free the greatest fear of the globalist and
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.720]  controlling the media narrative is the mental enslavement system by which they
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.120]  keep people controlled and keep and keep people down and so this is why
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.680]  ultimately this translates into the attacks on you and me and others because
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:45.080]  we literally I mean we want a free humanity we want a free humanity on
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.920]  medicine and technology science economic abundance spiritual awakening all of
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.800]  these issues we love humanity CNN hates America CNN hates civilization if you
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.920]  think about it they want to keep it down that's my take hey guys what's one of
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:05.280]  the amen to that which one of these clips is the Juan brothers clip let's go
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:09.040]  ahead and play that it's a longer clip we don't let's just get into that now
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:12.360]  because you've got to go and mark dice is coming up a Juan brothers being brought
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:16.720]  up the fact that the Soros has been uploading our elections not Russia
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:20.400]  Trump going hey who cares who hacked the server there's no proof Russia did it
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.400]  what about the crimes Hillary committed with the server and all this oh and
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:29.120]  Mike and then Putin mentions Bill Browder and and the potential crimes he's
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.160]  committed to Bill Browder's been going on mainstream media for the last seven
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:38.080]  days trying to build up his own little fake faux personality that that's gonna
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.040]  be totally destroyed so they're all out I mean they're all in right now to try to
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.360]  save what they've created and just to echo what what Mike said earlier you
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.720]  know and what it comes down to is individual independence the average
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.360]  human has been so beaten down by the media so beaten down by the chemicals
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:02.080]  they ingest they don't even know how to empower themselves and the individual
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:07.000]  human being is capable of everything that's what they don't want you to and
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.280]  that's key I mean you watch CNN it's total demoralization Mike let me ask
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.920]  that last question because you they are desperate you're right let's not be too
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:16.680]  confident here though they are now going to pull out all the stops I think
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.600]  terror attacks false flags to make themselves the victims gut level Mike
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.720]  Adams what do you think they're gonna do well you're right they are gonna pull
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.600]  out all the stops but we should also I think think about the Berlin wall as a
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:32.760]  historical metaphor the wall fell suddenly and unexpectedly and the media
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.720]  monopolist today are like a Berlin wall around your mind but that wall can be
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:40.960]  shattered in in an instant when we wake up and decide to take back our freedom
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.920]  and our human dignity which is what independent media is all about so really
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:51.600]  I can imagine a world where suddenly the entire media monopoly regime collapses
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.600]  that can happen but we're gonna have to push and press the fight we're gonna
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.880]  have to take action and not just sit on your couch being spoon-fed false ideas
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.880]  from MSNBC you're gonna have to take action you're gonna have to get with the
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:09.080]  program yeah and I want to be clear I think it's already collapsed this is
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.640]  their counter-strike time to convince us we're not free and that we're about to
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.520]  go to break but I think that's the moment we've gotten to we've already blown
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:19.760]  giant holes in this wall Owen yeah like Brian Stelter goes on CNN and tries to
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:25.160]  act like the authority of reality and news that Trump is a liar Trump is done
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  nothing good they they want you to feel like a second-class citizen they want
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.800]  you to feel like someone has to tell you what to do no you're a sovereign
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:38.000]  citizen remember Como saying I can read WikiLeaks you can't oh no Cuomo no we're
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.760]  all independent sovereign citizens here Mike Adams great job with your report on
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:46.400]  censorship everybody get it out that's your mission folks all right thank you
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.960]  Alex good to join you thank you amazing job God bless you get the report the
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.000]  censorship master plan natural news dot-com
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:00.520]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:04.800]  drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:09.120]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:14.640]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:19.680]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:25.240]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:30.360]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:34.680]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.960]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:45.920]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.160]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:59.800]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it a lot
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:03.880]  of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:08.640]  is a really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the American
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:12.280]  people we love the American people
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:25.360]  but we are not the enemy of the American people we love the American people we
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:46.320]  love the American people we love the American people we are not the enemy of
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:07:12.080]  the American people we love you know it's something the dying corporate media
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:15.440]  does now in the thousands of articles a week that I can't even keep track of
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:20.720]  hundreds of day that I try to scan over they go Jones is an internet talk show
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:27.240]  host with over five billion views on YouTube and that was years ago when
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:29.840]  YouTube told me I had that many views not just the billions on our own channel
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.480]  but no we're on over 200 radio affiliates over 400 TV stations over 80
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:38.640]  cable stations now some huge some small they're all very special you're watching
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.960]  please spread the word that's how we get around the sensors but isn't it
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:45.440]  something better if I was internet like Mark Dice with his media relations
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:50.200]  degree his best-selling books with over a billion views on YouTube all by
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:54.600]  himself I mean we always heard like the rugged individualist the prospector went
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:59.080]  out to Alaska for 10 years and he found the big mother load and you know became
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:03.000]  a billionaire I mean is it what isn't it cool that like nobody really helped
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.600]  Mark Dice or me and then meanwhile the president's son Donald Trump Jr. came out
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:13.480]  last week retweeting Paul Watson's article and what Mark Dice had said
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:19.440]  that seeing in the kings of fake news say I'm fake news and then every time they
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:23.920]  misrepresent what I said they go he needs to be banned he says Anthony
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:29.080]  Bourdain was killed no I said he said Bill Clinton was a rapist and that Harvey
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.280]  Weinstein should die and that his wife was raped by Weinstein or his fiance and
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:36.400]  that he she was also abused and in Illuminati rituals and he was gonna go
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:42.160]  public that came out then in the in the Daily Mail today I told you a month ago
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.880]  because I talked to not one but two people that were at different shoots
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:51.040]  where he was flipping out about Kanye West and everything and finally became
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:55.000]  pro-Trump the interview out now is from a month before that when he was saying
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.520]  well I'm neutral on Trump but I don't like Democrats and it goes through all
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:05.120]  of it now how did I just make that up and then but no I have real sources one of
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.280]  which can't even come on air now because of what they told me and I'm not at
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:11.000]  liberty to tell you I've asked them to tell you what happened with law
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.040]  enforcement when they came on but I'm just pointing out to you this is a war
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.080]  this is not a game it's not a joke when Mark Dice doesn't play games they
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.280]  censor him from 10 million views of video to a half million views of video
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.200]  when we do that's the same thing and now they admit it last week in this big push
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.560]  to ban info wars and then Facebook goes hey don't worry we they're already
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.080]  basically banned conservatives are libertarians are Christians don't totally
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:40.880]  ban them they'll have lawsuits show mark I was trying to get him on for a couple
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.800]  weeks he's a busy guy he finally said last like Monday I'll come on next Monday
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:49.120]  before this whole controversy happened he wanted to come on to talk about the
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:52.360]  censorship he's tracking and what's unfolding so he's with us for the
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:55.920]  balance of the hour mark dice.com remember that we used to have our own
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:59.120]  websites you need to go back to info wars back to mark dice.com because more
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.760]  more info wars has its own streams its own posts and back during Parkland they
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.280]  said that I said nobody died they removed our videos froze our channel I
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.320]  uploaded them I didn't say that I said there was a stand down people reported
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.000]  that the police stood down they said that it was something else about 14
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.760]  million views because people wanted to know what was really going on but see
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:24.400]  once they're done kicking us off YouTube Facebook Twitter they're gonna get our
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.680]  own websites so this is the big fight mark dice couldn't be a better time for
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.800]  you to come on right in the zeitgeist here my friend I've laid a lot of stuff
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.080]  out here but whoa where would you historically say we are right now we're
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:42.960]  pushing against the possible Orwellian nightmare scenario where people in
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.560]  their websites their businesses disappeared down the memory hole and for
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.880]  over a decade the mainstream media has been downplaying the social media
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.880]  aspect of businesses social media stars youtubers you're an internet radio host
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:02.800]  I'm just a youtuber but now today Facebook is launching their own exclusive CNN
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.680]  and other mainstream media shows not streaming the CNN and cable news and
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:13.360]  other outlets on Facebook Anderson Cooper today is launching his own Facebook
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.840]  exclusive show called Anderson Cooper full circle where he's gonna be answering
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.960]  questions from the Facebook audience so they have embraced social media because
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.320]  they were late to the game they didn't innovate they had their establishment
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:32.760]  system set up they had their cable channels they had their FCC licenses
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.760]  their printing presses their magazines distributed at all the grocery stores the
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:43.200]  bookstores and then we came along and using this basic and what's now basic
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.880]  technology which at the time 12 years ago is cutting edge we built huge
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.800]  audiences that completely dominate them my youtube channel has more subscribers
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:12:00.400]  than MSNBC's channel than CBS news than MTV news than NBC news I mean CNN's
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.440]  YouTube channels pretty much the only one out of the big mainstream media
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:08.960]  channels that's bigger than mine and I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen or
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:15.520]  now in my in my family room and they're so scared because we've dominated them
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.680]  we've snuck up behind them they were asleep at the wheel and so now they're
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.880]  suppressing us they're teaming up with the very infrastructure that we've been
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:29.840]  using and are getting paid to do it 90 million dollars Facebook is paying CNN and
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:33.400]  all these other unbelievable so so they're ending the you and YouTube they're
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.880]  ending your face in Facebook they are going to this this model and they want
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.320]  to use info wars as a case point they admit they're so arrogant once we are
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  accepted to be banned trying to get conservatives to go along with that then
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.240]  everybody else and so how do we organize to fight this mark guys because this is
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:55.040]  clearly they got caught flat-footed in 2016 they're not getting caught flat-footed
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.280]  now the president needs to act the White House needs to take action we need
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:03.120]  more people to get involved we need to do things the old-fashioned way like you
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:06.560]  were mentioning we need to go to websites we need to bookmark websites on the
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.520]  browsers we can't rely on just scrolling through a social media feed and expect
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.400]  to see the articles and the pages and the people that we're following to
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.320]  actually show up we've been seeing this continuing to expand over the last 10
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.480]  years and now it's so obvious that they're literally admitting it we've
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.680]  we've suspected a lot of these things were happening we've noticed that some
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.040]  weird things were happening with our subscribers with our views and with our
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:35.720]  videos and posts sort of disappearing and the views is stalling out tremendous
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:41.160]  growth over years all of a sudden vanishing and reversing people don't
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.400]  say that they're not getting the notification so they've been tweaking
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:47.760]  the system and they're going to continue to tweak it we need more people to get
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.560]  involved we need to keep sending out old-fashioned emails texting videos
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.120]  bookmarking the websites and they're not only trying to censor our message but
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:02.120]  they're also trying to cripple us financially so that people can't do
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.640]  this full time and they also misrepresent what we've said and what we do
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:10.280]  while not letting us respond to what's happening so understand folks you see a
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.800]  Mark Dice video a Paul Watson video an Alex Jones video whichever one you think
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:18.160]  is most important hand share it tell people it's forbidden it's verboten

[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.320]  think this because Trump got in we're going to win this they are making their
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:29.560]  move and what's crazy is mark most members of Congress and folks aren't
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.120]  even aware of this I've sent the report to the president he's now gotten it I'm
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:36.720]  talking to folks as we were just speaking they're all asking you know
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.120]  what what should we do I say it's in the report so imagine just like we
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:45.120]  innovated internet and and and dominated by with more subscribers and CNN you
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.320]  would more than other big channels think about how panicked they are so so again
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.720]  we are we don't think of ourselves as big shots what I'm saying is we're the
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.440]  trailblazers man we are we have to we have to act like that we saw this new
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.520]  technology emerge started using it started dominating it they were asleep at
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:07.680]  the wheel and now they're regretfully trying to stomp us now because we've
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:11.880]  won Wimbledon 15 times in a row they're just saying Mark Dyson Alex Jones and
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:14.600]  all you other guys you're not allowed on the field we're like but we're the

[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:33.200]  think there's probably part of pop culture now the YouTube adpocalypse
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:37.320]  that happened last April when all of a sudden the mass demonetization hit they
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:42.080]  rolled out their new demonetization features to scroll through the audio
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:46.200]  transcripts looking for keywords and videos that people say and then demonetize
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:52.080]  them so then one year later in April of this year CNN did their own expose a just

[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:03.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:17.720]  you got it waging war on corruption
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:26.320]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:31.880]  look I played a disgusting Bryant's culture clip earlier I'm gonna play it
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:37.080]  get Mark Dice's tape on it. It's one minute long. Him saying, I control reality. I'm God.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:40.600]  I say Trump can't be trusted. I say you're a Russian agent if you meet with Putin.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:45.320]  I say Trump should be able to meet alone with the Russian president, which all presidents have done.
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:50.200]  Again, and it's just a little pathetic nobody doing it. But
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:56.520]  just as he got to the break, we'll play it in a minute. They launched their new attack in April
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:00.920]  this year and CNN said ban info wars, ban everybody else. And now they're in the news.
[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:06.680]  I think they've miscalculated Mark to brazenly demand we be completely de-platformed shows what
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:11.080]  incredible authoritarians they are. Or have they been slowly censoring everybody so long?
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:15.560]  Everybody just kind of hears, okay, censorship of conservatives. Yeah, we know, but
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:20.200]  we're conservatives. We'll take it. No, we're being robbed. We're being attacked. This is
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:25.480]  how they intend to take over. Mark, what do you think? They've lost half their audience permanently
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:31.480]  for generations. Nobody's going to ever trust CNN, MSNBC, most of these mainstream media outlets.
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:36.680]  So every time that they try to censor us or call for censorship, all that's doing is proving our
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:42.360]  point of why we don't watch them. Half of the country has permanently abandoned watching those
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:47.240]  platforms. So all they're doing is speaking to the choir. They're singing to the choir. It's an
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:54.200]  echo chamber. And CNN, many of us remember, used to actually cover some news. They used to focus
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:22:01.400]  on a few stories for weeks on end to draw out the dramatic effect or some celebrity murder or
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:08.360]  some interesting event or a natural disaster. Now it's all Trump bashing 24-7. So even people who,
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:12.440]  you know, used to watch CNN, who aren't even really conservatives or into alternative media,
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:17.320]  are tuning out and coming into outlets like us, which is why we've been dominating,
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.600]  which is why they're also trying to not only just censor us but cripple financially. CNN
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:29.640]  in April literally targeted YouTube and said that their funding, the advertisers are still playing
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:35.080]  ads on offensive content and racist content and all this. They're CNN's literally trying to
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:41.000]  financially cripple YouTubers. I was stunned when I saw them literally, this is a second time now,
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.800]  that they've just overtly tried to shut down infowars. One, when you had a strike on your channel
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:50.200]  and it's, okay, well, two strikes away from being shut down. That's not a news story. I mean,
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.120]  maybe if you were, you know, shut down or the one strike away, that's-
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:59.880]  But it was CNN filed the fake complaints saying, I said no one died at Parkland. So
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:04.920]  they admitted they were the ones complaining. And now they're literally admitting that they're the
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:11.160]  ones that are pressuring Facebook to ban you. I mean, to have one news organization, which is
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:17.240]  probably the most accurate, inaccurate fake news outlets, CNN claiming that another news
[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:22.680]  outlet should be shut down is preposterous. And so, again, today, Facebook started their $90
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:29.720]  million campaign to stream not just cable news shows on Facebook, original series,
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:33.240]  and they're including Fox News in the lineup so that they can pretend to be like, well,
[02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:37.640]  it's not just a bunch of liberal news, it's, we got a Fox News show. Well, guess which Fox News
[02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:43.400]  show it is? It's Shepard Smith, the biggest never Trump nitwit on that network.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:48.440]  So their answer is force feed us more of their crap, censor whatever's really popular,
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:52.360]  and they've all got these weird, you know what, eating grins. They're so delusional.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:59.160]  Well, they're making $15,000 a day. I mean, just imagine, they're making in a week what,
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:04.120]  you know, more than an average America makes all year to sit in the studio and talk for an hour
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:09.480]  a day with a couple hours of prep. I mean, Anderson Cooper literally makes 15 to 20 grand
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:15.160]  every single show. And so he pretends to connect with the average American, which is absurd. These
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:20.600]  people are actors. And they're trying to shut down, of course, any alternative emerging social
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:26.280]  media networks you've had Andrew Torba on founder and CEO of gab, which is been prevented from having
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.960]  their app in the app store. And meanwhile, they're censoring gab from having an app in the app store
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:37.800]  saying that it's offensive content on the platform. Meanwhile, in the Apple app store right now,
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:43.880]  and this has been the case for well over a year, there are slap Donald Trump video games. So there
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:50.040]  are literally games in the app store for Apple that encourage violence against the price. So
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:55.720]  there's total censorship, total draconian control. They're arrogant monsters. Congress needs to act.
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:59.960]  The problem is they're not informed. That's why Mike Adams and I and others put together this
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:05.000]  report with Paul Watson. That's on info wars.com that we need to get to Congress and have them
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  take action for antitrust, civil rights violations, racketeering, you name it.
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.000]  Thankfully, we have Donald Trump Jr. on our team who is, you know, a generation X or is
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.800]  familiar with the power of social media. And so he has the ear, obviously, of his dad. And so he
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:26.040]  can get some information to him, because YouTube was sort of left on the sideburner forgotten
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:31.880]  about in this whole fake war against fake news. It was Facebook and Twitter and the Russian bots
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:37.720]  on Twitter. And now they've set their sights on YouTube. The New York Times said that YouTube
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:46.600]  is the new talk radio for the far right. And so it must be shut down. It's how brazen they are.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.880]  Let's play this Brian Stelter clip. You may have seen it hours before Trump met with Putin.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.520]  This is the dribble where he sits there and says, I control reality like Como saying,
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:01.240]  you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks. Only I am the arrogance of these people is only
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.280]  matched by their low ratings. Here it is. Putin and Trump plan to meet for a private
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:13.320]  one-on-one conversation before official talks begin. No aides, no notetakers. So we'll never
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:24.920]  really know what is said. Because really, can we trust either man? No, we can't. In the past,
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:31.400]  the US president's words had projected power and shaped global decisions. What the president said
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:38.440]  meant something, it meant a lot. But not now, not anymore. What President Trump says is so
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:43.320]  frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power,
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:52.040]  the same impact as past presidents. It's a shame, but it's true. Trump simply cannot be trusted.
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:57.480]  He has proven this himself time and time again. It's his own lies and his own contradictions
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:02.840]  that have proven it. And that is why this is a profound test for journalists.
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.680]  It's a shame, but it's true from one of the biggest liars on the planet.
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:12.360]  It's just profound the projection, Mark Dice.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:18.280]  It sounded like Brian Stelter's inhaling helium before that segment. And everything that they
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.440]  say is projection. Everything that they accuse others of their guilty of. Brian Stelter recently
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:28.200]  was at a forum for journalists at the Aspen Institute to think tank. And he was asked a question
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:33.640]  by one of the audience members who said, I'm old enough to remember when CNN actually covered news.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:39.160]  Now it's all Trump 24 seven. And he said, well, we're in an emergency. This is an emergency. The
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:44.920]  president Trump is in the White House. So I guess it's an emergency that the black unemployment
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:49.800]  set an all time low, but the economy is booming that the streets are getting safer.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.560]  It's it's an emergency to the globalist because he's the biggest obstacle to their plan to destroy
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:00.200]  the United States, which is why for the last year and a half now they've just been going overboard
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.040]  and completely freaking out. Oh, one thing I want to mention about the censorship on YouTube.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:10.360]  It's so funny. They're burying so much content that if you search for my number one most viewed
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:16.040]  video, which has about 9 million views, President Trump's or Donald Trump's funniest insults and
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:22.440]  comebacks, it would or used to be the number one search result. But now it's literally buried
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:29.160]  under 50 other videos. And all of the videos on top of it are all mainstream news sources,
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:35.320]  because now they've realized that YouTube is a search engine as opposed in conjunction with
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.000]  a distribution. That's right. Stay there though. Let's explain that because you should even our
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.120]  own fees will be our videos. Now it's not Sasha Barrett Cohen engaged in fraud is on the front
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.680]  couple hundred thousand views in our videos that millions are on the front page. Again,
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:57.320]  total fraud, total control that we have the truth. Want revenge on the common housefly?

[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:04.440]  they can feel it. The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny,
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:09.320]  and America yet again is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist. That's why this
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.960]  4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about info wars now more than ever,
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:17.800]  and what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist?

[02:32:53.560 --> 02:33:01.320]  to match it, infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:18.680]  The year is 1995, and info wars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes.
[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:25.800]  In a freak mishap, info wars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:32.520]  which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years later.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:39.240]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum, where people are extremely lazy,
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:44.520]  the social engineers are there laughing. What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago,
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:50.840]  is now real. While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men,
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:55.080]  and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:01.480]  animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved,
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:07.960]  it's fulfilling info wars, tomorrow's news today. All right, I've done two and a half hours live
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.480]  broadcasts that have not plugged yet, and quite frankly, it's just because I'm so focused on the
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:16.920]  news, but that's how we finance things. I want to thank you all that buy products
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:20.520]  at infowarstore.com. You see mainstream media obsessed with it. They want to shut down
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:29.560]  them. Supplements, books, videos, great t-shirts, you name it. We've got Vox Day has come out with
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:35.080]  the only libertarian conservative comic books out there. They've already gone to number one
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:41.800]  on Amazon. We got a couple thousand of these in. They're $5 apiece. Want to be politically incorrect
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:49.000]  buy these, give them to your 10th grade students or 6th grade students, whatever, or donate them
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.920]  to the library, alt hero, crackdown, volume one, talking about how they're shutting down the free
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:35:04.200]  speech. It's available at infowarstore.com. So get the nice color comic book. It's a revolutionary
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:10.120]  act to go into these areas. You see Christian films now dominating Hollywood. This, what's
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:15.480]  happening, we're getting on the playing field. Also, I'm not going to spend time on it because
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:21.720]  it's so complex and so cool that I don't want to take the time up from Mark Dice, but we have
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:30.920]  super silver wound gel now available that has the strongest silver you can get without a prescription.
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.080]  Remember talking about how great silver was when the other antibiotics and things aren't working
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:38.840]  20 years ago in the media saying, oh, that's a conspiracy theory. Now you go to the Walgreens
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.000]  and they're selling it or you get a prescription for, you know, a hundred bucks and the hospitals
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  are using it, you know, spray bottles everywhere. But super silver wound gel use silver salt technology
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:55.320]  that's an advanced patented technology that has forever changed the colloidal nano silver market.
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:59.800]  This has been extensive research on silver salt technology. This research includes 20 plus safety
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:06.600]  reports and test series, as well as a first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:13.880]  study done on any silver product, but it's for topical use. The formula is 24 ppm, 32 ppm version
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:18.600]  is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device. But what you can sell over the counter, this is
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:24.280]  an over the counter product, which had to be clear to the FDA is 24 ppm. Similar products
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:31.320]  sell for $40 or more. It's $29.95. It is one of the only OTC products with, you can make direct
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:37.800]  claims against MRSA, VRE, and many other deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:45.400]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn. Super silver wound gel is
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:50.680]  essentially armor for your wounds. This protective barrier that guards the wounds and helps keep
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.840]  them from getting infected. The barrier of protection can last up to three days
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:58.520]  on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection. It is perfect for athletes,
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:03.480]  particularly of all ages in all sports areas. That's how it originally got developed. It's
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.040]  sold under a brand name for $40. And I'm going to just leave it at that, but they're patrons who
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.600]  let us private label it. We're selling for $29.95. It costs us a lot to secure it because it said
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:18.680]  to get FDA approval. So can you imagine how much it costs to get this FDA cleared? Even though
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.080]  it's been approved by the FDA for over the counter sale, we can't even say we say cleared. That's
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:28.360]  what a police state this country is. This is cleared by the FDA, but this is the strongest
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:36.120]  over the counter silver in existence. Super silver in fours, life.com in four store.com
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:40.360]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We got another big, huge defeat,
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:43.880]  the Democrat censorship sale. One of the biggest ever running. I haven't even plugged it yet.
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:46.520]  I'm going to leave it at that. Mark dice going back to you.
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:54.120]  This is the dastardliness of mainstream media being arrogant while you had a billion views
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:58.360]  and I had five billion views and you had all these best selling books and they would all just laugh
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:04.200]  at us when we would do a video and, you know, get a million views during the, and then, and then
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.800]  Anderson Cooper do one and had 5,000 on their channel. So now Facebook 90 million investment
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:15.720]  to act like CNN's this God to buy the content. It's like buying dog turds to then force feed it
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:21.160]  to everybody. It just shows what a joke it is. And even if they try to censor and ban everybody,
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:26.520]  I don't see people going back on the plantation. I don't think Humpty Dumpty can be put back together
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:31.640]  again. What do you think? No, they've completely ruined their brand name recognition, which is why
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:38.040]  now we're seeing newer media companies like Vox, which actually owns a whole dozen or so
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:44.200]  of media companies to then try to fill the internet with all these various different brands.
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:52.920]  Oh, it's Axios news. It's the verge. It's Vox media, all these new brands so that people sort of
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.960]  think that it's a newer emerging company when really it's part of the same umbrella. It's
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:03.880]  going to be interesting to see if CNN or if Facebook shows the view count of their new
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:09.800]  shows on their watch pages because what if only 50,000 people, 100,000 people are watching these
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:16.760]  shows. MTV News can put out a video of an interview with a major celebrity on their YouTube channel
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:24.280]  and it barely gets a thousand views. Nobody cares. And the power of the individual
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:30.440]  and the individual YouTuber, the individual Facebook user, so important because Mitt Romney,
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.680]  they say lost, potentially lost. I mean, let's just say there was no voter fraud manipulation.
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:42.680]  It feels a fair system. Many analysts credit Mitt Romney with losing the 2012 election because
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:49.160]  of that YouTube video of him at an event, at a fundraiser where he was talking trash about
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.320]  the 47% of Americans who are never going to vote for him. He was at a fundraiser,
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:58.760]  the bartender propped up his cell phone on the table, took a video of it, just posted it on
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:04.600]  YouTube and it organically spread. And that upset so many people that they literally,
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:10.200]  the analysts, Republican analysts credit that as diminishing his credibility beyond repair.
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:16.920]  So that's the power of one individual with a cell phone posting on YouTube and now obviously
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.880]  Twitter and Facebook and Instagram all have these video. And so we now know their answer
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:28.440]  is to govern everybody back. That's their answer. But people see, people know Axios
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:32.520]  is a clone of Politico. So as fast as they get discredited, they create new bodies.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.160]  I think they're admitting defeat here, Mark.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.400]  I don't know how they're gonna hold on. They're gonna get more and more desperate
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:44.600]  as the midterms approach. And then as the 2020 election approaches, I think they're gonna just
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:50.040]  keep on stumbling over their own, what they're hoping are gonna be stepping stones. Because
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:56.680]  the Trump train is so engaged that we didn't just relax after the election. We didn't fall asleep
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:01.560]  at the wheel and think we'll vote again in four years. This movement is so energized that we're
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:08.120]  constantly watching. And even if you and I have pretty big audiences, pretty big channels, but
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:13.880]  everybody who has a small YouTube channel of 1000 subscribers. All of it together. And that's
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.560]  the key. Our listeners, our viewers, no matter who you are, it's like whack-a-mole. I see female,
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:25.480]  black, you name it, YouTubers that are just as smart as you and I, emerging Facebookers with
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.240]  millions of views because they haven't censored them yet. Then they censor them. They start a
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.400]  new channel. It's big. Then they censor them, but it doesn't matter. People now get it so they know
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.880]  to follow whatever they're not allowed to have. So again, how do the globalists get around this
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:43.800]  dry hand effect? I don't know. I don't think that they know how. I think that they're in uncharted
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.320]  territory. They're just throwing a bunch of stuff against the wall hoping that it sticks,
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:51.400]  which is why we have to counter them on every move. I know some other YouTubers, if they get a
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:56.440]  video demonetized or a strike, they're afraid to kind of call YouTube out. They don't want to
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:42:02.200]  make any waves. Every time they do it to me, I just call them out. I make another video pointing
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:07.480]  it out. I'll start tweeting to the YouTube CEO, to Susan Wojcicki, who says that just
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:13.960]  interrupting her is a sexual microaggression. So we have to just continue to counter every move
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:19.960]  that they make because they're so desperate. They've been failing. We're winning and we just have
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:23.720]  to keep it up. I don't think we're in uncharted territory. I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.160]  I don't think they know what's going to happen. No, I agree. But we'll come back to the final
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:31.160]  segment, but with maximum effort, here's the good news. We don't just have Trump in our awakening
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:36.280]  here. All over the world, nationalism, capitalism is the hottest thing, especially with Generation
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:41.240]  Z. I'm telling you, the worm is turning to the exciting time to be alive, but the enemy
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:45.800]  counter strikes straight ahead. MarkDice.com. Remember websites? Got to go there if you want

[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:20.360]  the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural

[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:01.240]  You realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:08.200]  you are changing the world. It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glovelist. It is you,
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:12.920]  the InfoWars, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure,
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:16.840]  that stood against the threats that have now changed the world. And that's why you've been
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:21.960]  on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word. You are the InfoWars.
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:26.840]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:32.600]  to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:38.760]  between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it. And so now I ask you
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:44.200]  more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:48.600]  stations you're listening to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:55.400]  at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:47:02.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:30.120]  I don't make Tokyo Rose-type announcements or Baghdad bobbin announcements like,
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.480]  loveless you've been defeated, come out with your hands up. But here's the deal,
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:37.080]  they thought they'd use the web to dumb us down to force feed their garbage. They were arrogant.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.920]  Now they're going to try to block innovation. They're going to try to block free ideas. It's
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.480]  not going to work. They can try to pick InfoWars as a lead pony to take out as a precedent. It's
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:51.320]  important to fight for that, but they're going to lose in the end. And I was thinking about,
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:57.880]  I forget to put the tweet out. I'd have been Donald Trump Jr. a few months ago when it came out
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.000]  that CNN, we already knew this, but I guess it's a proverbial evergreen story, has to pay in bars
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.360]  and pay in hotels and pay at bus terminals and train stations and airports to have their crap force
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:12.520]  fit. And it's in all the high schools in the country. They pay for the TVs and the cable in
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:17.560]  the school. When they've got to pay to make you watch it and listen to it, what does that tell
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:23.800]  you? The question was, how much would you have to be paid to watch CNN? I mean, a year ago that
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.560]  they were less popular than reruns of Yogi Bear. Now they're a shadow of that. So of course,
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:35.080]  they're, we are the authority. We are the only ones that can read WikiLeaks. Shut down Trump.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:40.120]  Trump is a liar. InfoWars is a liar. But I'm actually surprised we still have massive traffic
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:47.080]  at InfoWars and our core audience is great. But this isn't a bigger deal that they're all over
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.080]  the news saying, oh, don't worry, we've already shadow banned conservatives and we're already
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:58.280]  blocking push notifications of Trump's tweets. That's antitrust violations. So Mark, separate
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:04.360]  from what we do on air, talking about this, we need to get Congress, we need to get the president,
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.800]  we need everyone informed because this attempted takeover of the internet is outrageous.
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:15.880]  It just shows how arrogant they are. So how do you see all this unfolding?
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:21.480]  Yeah, we need to talk to our congressman, congressperson, and get them to be educated about
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.880]  these issues because we saw during the Mark Zuckerberg hearing several hours, there were
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:31.160]  literally only about three decent questions. Ted Cruz asked, you know, Ted Cruz obviously knows
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.320]  what's going on, but there were three decent questions asked of Mark Zuckerberg. These congressmen
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.000]  don't know the power of this. They don't know about the algorithms and the push notifications and
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.960]  the censorship. And of course, there's no transparency from Facebook. They don't tell you
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:48.120]  which pages have been censored. They don't show you, oh, well, you violated our policies.
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:54.840]  There's no transparency. There's no option to appeal. It's they say what they want to do
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:00.520]  and they do it. There's no way around it. And Facebook responded to the CNN reporter when he
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.160]  called for your complete censorship. And they said, well, we're not going to remove info wars.
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:08.920]  But, you know, we've, we've censored them by 80 percent that we, we censor and punish
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:15.480]  restrict pages, but they don't show which posts, which pages show me where on a page you can go
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:21.720]  and say, yeah, you have a strike. We're throttling you because give me the reason why. And if that's
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:26.360]  the case, why is CNN allowed to have a platform? I don't think there's been a news outlet that's
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:32.360]  been more incorrect about more issues than CNN. So why is it that they're even allowed on there?
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:37.000]  And of course they should be allowed. I'm not for censorship. No, I agree. But how are they the
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:42.200]  policemen that decides it's like having Hitler shed over the Nuremberg trials? Because they're
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.360]  all friends of the Sun Valley conference just happened in Idaho, which is an annual Builderberg
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:51.960]  of tech media. So Mark Zuckerberg, Tim, Tim Cook, all these heads of all the media and social media
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:57.000]  companies were there, this small little resort town they meet every year to talk about the new
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.360]  policies, the new censorship. So this, we're obviously not in the good old boy club, whereas you
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:07.800]  have the executives, Jeff Zucker from CNN's over there, all these guys. So they're sitting around
[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:12.440]  in a room having lunch talking about what they're going to do and who's not going to get censored.
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:20.200]  So that's why we're just not part of the club, as George Carlin said. And even Google is censoring
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:25.480]  their own Google custom news feed. You may have seen a few months ago, you used to be able to
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:31.080]  filter your Google news feed to custom search results. But now they just show you what's
[02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:38.440]  recommended for you. And I guess you can go to your favorites page on Google news. And now it's,
[02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:42.840]  you have to click each individual topic that you have favored it. It's a whole mess.
[02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:47.320]  They're killing their own algorithm. I mean, I go to Bing now, you know, it's Microsoft for a big
[02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:52.040]  search. It works like Google used to. It's more fair. It's totally one sided. You can't even get
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:57.240]  real medical news. You can't get anything about Hillary. It's all controlled. They've gone pure
[02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:02.360]  authoritarian in their desperateness. And I think they've jumped the shark. But Mark, I think you've
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:09.720]  hit the heart of this though. You can't force people to watch stuff. And I think they have gone
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:13.960]  too far. I think as long as we make a big deal about it, as long as we inform Congress, as long
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:16.760]  as our listeners understand it, and as long as our listeners understand this, and viewers,
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:22.840]  you've got to hand go to mark dice.com. You've got to hand go to m4.com. You've got to hand share
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:28.600]  that go, Hey, this is the verboten. This is the forbidden learn why this is where they don't want
[02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:35.000]  you to go. You've got to go to info or store.com. You've got to get a reelect Trump 45 shirt. You've
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:41.080]  got to get a mean like a Wolverine shirt. You've got to get our defeat Democrat censorship sale
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:44.920]  50% off on all our best selling items free shipping. We brought the supercell back. You've
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:49.880]  got to get the new official app that works really great with live streaming podcast, everything
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:54.120]  in full wars.com port slash app. You already are awake. So you're like, Hey, we already know all
[02:52:54.120 --> 02:52:59.560]  this. The public doesn't they are now ripe to be told what's happening. People are so ready to wake
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:03.000]  up. Mark dice. Let's move on to this. People go to mark dice.com and also get some of your great
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:07.240]  t shirts as well to fund you because it's a war folks. These are war bonds. If you don't buy it,
[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:11.880]  the enemy wins. Mark and I have already paid monetarily massively, you know, for telling
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:18.520]  the truth. We don't care. We just want to win the bullying on the street, the attacks, the
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:22.840]  Uber drivers, not driving conservatives, the harassment of conservatives. They clearly are
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:27.480]  hitting the streets. We need to hit the streets as well. When they try to censor us in cyberspace,
[02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:31.400]  more and more, we need to do stuff on the streets as well. Can you can you speak to this whole
[02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:37.960]  attempt for them to start a civil war? You know, the Democrat Party is embracing violence as a
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:43.800]  whole. The fact that Maxine waters hasn't been widely denounced by every Democrat in Congress
[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:50.120]  is completely absurd. Their silence is acceptance and they could shut us down online and then
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:54.920]  we're going to have people start popping up and peacefully confronting some of these people.
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:58.920]  Like back, you know, 10 years ago, really before YouTube, we would see people peacefully
[02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:05.240]  confronting or shouting down from a distance. The live cable news feeds, some of your contests,
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:10.440]  I think are fantastic. Maybe it's time for another jam CNN contest where people can get on the air
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:17.320]  and jam them because holding signs up at sporting events, they're not going to stop us and we're
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:21.640]  not going to get violent like the Democrats. We're just going to be peacefully innovating
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:27.160]  and continuing to come up with new ideas. We need to start filling their Twitter feeds and
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:31.960]  Facebook pages with more messages. Every time Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter tweets,
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:38.440]  he should have hundreds of responses in that thread about the double standards about them
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:43.480]  censoring and banning Roger Stone, but allowing other Democrats to be on there.
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.920]  Censoring Roger Stone for just criticizing CNN anchors or swearing at a CNN anchor.
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:56.280]  It's completely absurd, but allowing someone who's calling for the abuse of Donald Trump's children
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:01.560]  to still be allowed on that platform. It's absurd. So we need to just get engaged every
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.080]  thread. I want every time Jack Dorsey tweets something to be filled with hundreds of tweets
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:11.160]  responding, pointing out their hypocrisy, linking to certain videos.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:17.480]  Same with Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of Twitter, of YouTube. These people, we're going to show them
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:21.160]  who they are. We're going to show their own followers who they are in case they're in their
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.640]  little echo chamber. And it's critical to just keep pressing forward. And that's why I appreciate
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.120]  you saying to just go directly to websites. You have to come right to youtube.com slash
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:37.240]  mark dice or scroll down to go directly to my channel. You can no longer go to your youtube
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.240]  homepage and see a variety of videos. That's the point you were making. It doesn't matter if you
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:45.320]  have views, you know, tens of millions of views on the video. And it was number one, they downvoted
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:51.080]  and will take the same name and put something pro-Hillary on top of it. Again, in fact, you give
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:55.720]  a few examples of that because this happens to all our videos now. People have to go directly to it
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:00.120]  and realize it's not work. It's a victory. They're censoring us because we're winning. It's so
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:05.560]  cowardly. It's so pathetic. They totally make us the underdogs because we're Americana. We're
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:10.280]  promoting freedom. In the past, when you would search for a certain title in youtube, it would
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:17.320]  show you not the most viewed video, but the most watched video, meaning the most watched time.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:21.800]  So if somebody clicks on a video and clicks off of it, you know, gets a few seconds of watch time.
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:27.320]  So if somebody clicks on a video and they stay watching it for two, three, four minutes, that's
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:32.680]  rallying. That's tacking up the watch. And they broke their algorithm about what the humans really
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:38.680]  voting, crowd sourcing ideas, the knowledge of the crowd, they broke it for this.
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:45.960]  Yeah. So again, having most, most watched views can be deceptive. So they changed that model a
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:52.040]  decade ago to the most watch time. So my video about Donald Trump's funniest insults and comebacks
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:59.080]  has 9 million views, a high amount of watch time. But if you type it in that exact title into youtube,
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:05.800]  it's the 51st result. There are 50 other videos, half of which aren't even, aren't even, don't
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:10.120]  even have anything to do with it, but maybe have, you know, oh, Trump funny or something about Trump
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:15.000]  insults, so and so, and every single one of them is from a mainstream source. Even the Huffington
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:22.040]  compost or Huffington Huff Post, I guess they renamed their, their channel has under 2000 views.
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:28.280]  And their video is one of the top results NBC, CBS, all these mainstream outlets, which have
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:33.640]  just shows what pathetic losers they are. We'll be right back with five more minutes with Mark
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:46.040]  Dys right after this quick break in full wars.com. Stay with us.

[02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:36.040]  we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering info wars store.com and remembering that it's
[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:40.520]  not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential
[02:59:40.520 --> 02:59:55.240]  to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American revolution.
[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:16.520]  War Room. We have the clip coming up to start the next segment on our news. Alexander Schumer
[03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:21.400]  just called for more sanctions on Russia. Trump is sending toe missiles to the rebels for a year.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:26.280]  Huge economic operations crushing Russia. I don't think Russia even deserves, but
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:31.480]  everything else I agree with Trump on. I see communist China as a threat.
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:34.920]  Mark Dice, I really appreciate you and Mark Dice.com all the work you're doing.
[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:39.720]  You're being blocked and censored. You know, so your average video had a million views.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:44.600]  Now your average has a half million, but it's a real testament that your fans come to the actual
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:48.680]  Mark Dice side on YouTube. They got to do the same thing for info wars, the same thing for
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:53.720]  everything. And you know, I saw the censorship intensifying a few years ago. So we have our
[03:00:53.720 --> 03:00:57.960]  own streams and info wars.com forward slash show. We have our own videos. We're posting now. It's
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:04.200]  very expensive, but we're doing it. So Mark, you know, people said, well, you just get off
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:08.840]  YouTube. Well, it's already half the video views in the world. They advertise for us to come there.
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:12.920]  We follow the rules, then they cheat us. No, this is fraud. We need to stand up against it.
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:17.720]  Yeah, I see so many people want us to put our legs between our tail between our legs and leave
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:22.760]  to another platform, but no, we need to fill it with more conservative content. And I think there
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:28.920]  was a quote, I think it's from inside manual movie from a decade ago that the greatest currency
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:35.880]  is respect. And that's why my fans do the best that I can to earn and gain their respect. And
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:41.880]  that's why I've been able to develop such a large channel. Same with you, because nobody respects
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:46.360]  CNN. Nobody. Anderson Cooper doesn't respect his audience. He despises them. He's a parasite
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:53.880]  praise on him off of them. And these people, their time has come their time. They've missed the boat.
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:59.720]  Now they're astroturfing to try to keep up with this modern technology. And we keep crushing them.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:04.680]  And we need the midterms coming in three and a half months. The time flies. We need to schedule
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:09.800]  the vote. You need to look at voting in the midterm and in the 2020 election as like paying your taxes.
[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:14.360]  If you don't do it, the government's going to screw you. And it's a little bit of a hassle. You
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:18.200]  got to schedule. And I agree. Let's say we have the red wave that even with fraud looks like we're
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:24.440]  going to have. Do they capitulate then or they just get crazier? That I'm not sure. We're in
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:29.400]  uncharted territory, but I know that we have to get in touch with our congressperson and educate
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:35.560]  them about the censorship on social media. And so we can have more legitimate questions when
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.840]  these people are testifying. And so we can get new bills perhaps introduced so that we can't
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:45.720]  be shut down. No, I agree. That's the key. And please help us with this.
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.600]  Mike Adams report and Paul Watson report that are on info wars.com. These are scholarly.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:55.560]  These detail it all. And I mean, Mark, we need your help. We need to get this report,
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:00.040]  the censorship master plan decoded to the president, which we've done into Congress. Please help us.
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:04.920]  I definitely will. I'll be retweeting that as soon as I get off the show. Always great to be with
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:08.600]  you, Alex. It's incredible what you guys are doing. And it's incredible to see the attacks
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:13.640]  against us. I mean, it's you can't even imagine the things that they that they're doing. And then
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:18.360]  they pull them out of their out of their sleeves, literally calling for you to be banned. The
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:26.440]  manipulation of the social media YouTube now literally paying $25 million to astroturf YouTubers
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:33.480]  embracing, you know, Hollywood celebrities as the new YouTuber, giving them consultants.
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:37.480]  I had to figure out how to do this, how what camera, how to do the lighting,
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:41.720]  what time to post the videos, how to do, you know, how to make a thumbnail.
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:45.320]  All of these people now, the mainstream media, which missed the boat,
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:50.520]  they're getting the consultants and the cash YouTube and they're invading and they're propping
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:54.600]  them up and they're force feeding and it's still failing. And that's what's so crazy about this is
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:59.640]  this is really epic, my friend. And I just have a gut level feeling we're going to win as long as
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:04.920]  we just keep pressing the attack. But like you said, we need our own platforms, which you're
[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:09.080]  building I built, we have to do it. The listeners have to understand they're the only reason
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:13.560]  we're still standing. We do respect them because they are, you know, Mark dice, they are Alex Jones,
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:18.360]  our listeners, our viewers, our supporters, they're the reason CNN and so many people are upset.
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:21.080]  What an incredible time to be alive and thank God for Donald Trump, huh?
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:28.040]  He is a godsend. He has delayed the, you know, the bankruptcy, moral and financial of this country,
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:33.480]  perhaps decades into the future. And that's why they keep on pressing against him. And
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:38.040]  when I can sit in my apartment and make a video and get a quarter million views,
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:44.840]  quarter of the audience of CNN, when I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen, that is dangerous to
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:49.640]  the mainstream establishment when they're spending. And that's your lowball video. Exactly. It's
[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:53.000]  amazing. People want choice. God bless you, Mark. Great job. Good to be with you, Alex.

[03:05:47.640 --> 03:05:53.160]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:05:58.600 --> 03:06:02.680]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[03:06:02.680 --> 03:06:09.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:16.760 --> 03:06:25.320]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:30.200]  And we are the real American free market resistance for the globalists. They claim
[03:06:30.200 --> 03:06:34.280]  the other resistance, yeah, to us. Ali Alexander is about to take over. Put a
[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:38.760]  consultive loss for activists. All the great work he's done with the Trump campaign, you name it.
[03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:43.960]  Patreon.com, Ali Alexander, Twitter at Ali, OrganizerAmericanPriority.com.
[03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:48.920]  But I wanted to play Chuck E. Schumer's response, and I never got to all these clips
[03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:51.560]  today. If Alexander wants to play him, I've always got a guest coming on about
[03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:56.040]  the globalists trying to crash the economy. Will they be successful? Talk about treason.
[03:06:56.040 --> 03:06:59.480]  You've got Brennan calling Trump treasonous for meeting with Putin when every other president
[03:06:59.480 --> 03:07:05.560]  meets with Russian leaders. They just think you have no memory. But I've got Trump on Hillary's
[03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:11.000]  server, Putin on intelligence and Soros, Putin on compromising info on Trump and Moscow. I may
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:14.200]  play that before I go to Alexander. I've got so many of these clips, the warrants coming up
[03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:20.040]  in about 53 minutes. But here's Chuck E. Schumer, when he's this Democrat, globalist,
[03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:25.400]  anti-American guy that sold us out to China. Here he is saying more sanctions on Russia
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:29.320]  when Trump, quite frankly, one of the few things he's done bad is beat the hell out of Russia
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:34.920]  for no reason. Here it is. Our allies will consider abandoning us, possibly for China and others,
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:40.440]  and Putin's Russia will emerge stronger for it. That's what he wants, and that's what President
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:49.160]  Trump inexplicably is helping him do. Our Republican colleagues can take steps right now to push back
[03:07:49.160 --> 03:07:55.320]  against this slippery slope the president has put us on. Speaker Ryan today said nice things,
[03:07:55.320 --> 03:08:03.160]  but talk is not enough. We need action, bipartisan strong action, and we need our Republican
[03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:10.440]  colleagues to stand up for the good of this country. I am asking our Republican colleagues
[03:08:10.440 --> 03:08:22.200]  to do four things. First, they can start by refusing to water down and instead decide to ratchet up
[03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:31.640]  sanctions against Russia. This is the globalist trader, this is the globalist who's shelling
[03:08:31.640 --> 03:08:36.040]  America out trying to point at some foreign country and going that's the enemy when Russia can hardly
[03:08:36.040 --> 03:08:42.040]  get its streetlights working nationwide. When they've sold out to China, Hollywood's owned by China
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:47.240]  now, and he's just up there like he's the patriot and all of us, red-blooded Americans that believe
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:53.320]  the Second Amendment, private property, all of it, we're the enemy. I mean just how are we ruled by
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:09:02.440]  this piece of crap? Let's go back to it. Sanctions against Russia. In the house there is right now
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:10.440]  an effort to ratchet these sanctions down. Given what Mr. Putin said today, given the indictments,
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:16.920]  given what Mr. Trump said. The indictments, they already had 13 bots indicted, the people
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:23.480]  showed up, it's all fake. Ali Alexander is going to take over right now. War rooms coming up,
[03:09:23.480 --> 03:09:28.680]  they'll have coverage of the big historic press conference. It's the left trying to take my free
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:32.760]  speech, the left trying to take my guns, the left on TV saying let's bankrupt this recovery.
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:38.600]  I mean the Russians were in my business, I'd say they're the enemy, but I don't see them in my
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:45.320]  life. I don't see the Russian fingerprints or footprints on anything I'm doing. God, I wish it
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:49.240]  was that easy. No, it's the left, it's the globalists, it's the universities, it's the
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:55.160]  anti-free speech groups. They're the ones constantly, it's the Antifa, it's these bullies and they
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:59.960]  want to imprison Anastasia Sousa, they want to put me in prison and they want to shut me up and
[03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:04.440]  shut you up and they want to kidnap and rape the president's son and they're just, they're a group
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:09.880]  of crazy people. So Ali Alexander, thanks for taking over. God bless you and I know you got a
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:15.640]  special guest coming on, an economist about, we could probably play the clip of him even defending
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:19.640]  it. Bill Maher saying, yeah, I want to bankrupt people and get them under my control. I mean,
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:24.280]  that's called feudalism. Ali Alexander, thanks for joining us. Yeah, thank you, Alex. And you
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:30.600]  know, America, I can agree with Alex Morris. How are we ruled by these idiots? I mean, you have
[03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:37.400]  these reporters in Finland asking the president of these two countries that occupy 90% of the
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:42.440]  nuclear weapons in the world. These stupid dumb questions. I actually liked it when President
[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:49.640]  Putin described the intelligence gathering process and how impossible it would be to have the foresight
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:55.080]  that Donald Trump would run for president, be elected president, or memorize all the businessmen
[03:10:55.080 --> 03:11:02.600]  that are coming to Moscow or St. Petersburg. It was, we're absolutely ruled by idiots. And
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:07.800]  you know, I'll tell you, I've got this theory, it's called the Avatar culture. We're all living
[03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:13.000]  in signals. And this isn't just the left, right? The left has virtue signaling. They want to say,
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:17.480]  well, we care about the gays, we care about the blacks, we care about the poor, and none of their
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:23.640]  policies actually address any of these issues. But the right has much of the same thing. And what
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:29.400]  you see from the right now is I was going through my Twitter this morning, and I was like, oh my gosh,
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:33.000]  this is a disaster of a press conference. Everyone I know and I respect it
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:39.480]  was saying, Trump is selling out the United States. And I even texted the infowars producer and I was
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:43.400]  like, I'm going to have some choice words for the president. But I want to make sure that before I
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:48.920]  got on the air, before I talked to millions of patriots across the nation, that I listened to
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:54.360]  the press conference myself. And I'll tell you, it wasn't night and day, but there was a huge
[03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:59.800]  stark difference from the isolated quotes. And this is what I want to encourage everyone to do.
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:04.600]  For the first time ever, I'm going to say, don't listen to me. Don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:14.680]  listen to mainstream media. Go watch 35 minutes of reporters, Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:20.600]  talking about these issues and decide for yourself because it was night and day when I read those
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:25.080]  quotes and I said, oh my gosh, Donald Trump's throwing America under the bus a little bit.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:29.160]  You know, I get what he's doing, right? He's fighting. There's a whole lot of context,
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:33.560]  and that's what they do. Trump is sending tow missiles to Ukraine. Trump is crushing them
[03:12:33.560 --> 03:12:40.840]  on energy. Trump is it's too much. And then he's conciliatory, you know, I guess lubing up Russia
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:46.840]  while he does it. I think it's too much actually. Yeah, well, Alex, it's a part of the negotiation
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:51.160]  technique, right? So he understands now, this is something that Reagan probably couldn't have
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:56.440]  even understood, that the negotiations have to happen in public. So to disrespect Putin is going
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:13:02.840]  to invite retaliation. But if he can retaliate, I think against Russia and the media is not going
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:08.200]  to cover that. Well, then he forces Putin at the table. I think that this is strategically brilliant,
[03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:13.640]  even though yeah, he's hitting he says attacking Russia emboldens him with the Russian population.
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:18.920]  This is actually the most diabolical anti Russian plan to tell Putin how much he loves him and loves
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:23.960]  Russia while we're stabbing him in the stomach, which I want to work with Russia and get their
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:29.080]  resources and come together. They're not the chai comms. I see America's destiny as real trade,
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:33.960]  like Ron Paul says. I think Trump's over aggression towards Russia is one of his only bad spots.
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:39.800]  Yeah, yeah, I think I'm a little bit more hawkish than you. And so we might might diverge a little
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:43.880]  bit on it. But you know, he is a hawk. I mean, he's a super hawk. I'm fine with being hawkish.
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.280]  And I get the Russians respect strength. The Russians don't own Hollywood. The Russians aren't
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:54.600]  taking up the chai comms are the problem. Oh, entirely. Entirely. It's our number one geopolitical
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:59.880]  foe right now. Exactly. So making it about Russia is a strategic distraction by the globalist
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:05.240]  that have sold us out to China. That's the real threat. That's why it's treason to obsess on Russia
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:12.440]  all day. A Russian alliance with Russian raw minerals and an infrastructure and their raw
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:18.280]  material would take America into the next century with Russia with us. We won't defeat China with
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:23.480]  their aggressive stance into the next century if we don't make a deal with China. Bingo. I mean,
[03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:27.880]  make a deal with Russia. Bingo. And this is what Ronald Reagan understood. You know, Ronald Reagan
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:33.240]  went from a hawk to a guy who broke her peace. And if we don't take Russia with us into this next
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:38.920]  age, it makes us harder to negotiate with these rogue states. It makes it, you know, it destabilizes
[03:14:38.920 --> 03:14:43.720]  North Korea. Exactly. We make a deal with Russia. We have that entire arc through Eastern Europe,
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:50.280]  Asia, Central Asia, the whole the whole Crescent. That's the you win the whole game with that.
[03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:55.320]  It's a no brainer. But see, the globalist won't continue crisis politics. And I'd love to be
[03:14:55.320 --> 03:14:59.160]  friends with China, but our own elites put the chai comms in power and are using them for global
[03:14:59.160 --> 03:15:04.520]  domination. Total global domination. You know, I in fact, when I when I have my guests on here
[03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:08.600]  in a couple of minutes, we're going to even talk about that America's elites are eyeing China and
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:13.720]  Singapore as their plan B's as they rape and pillage America, they're going to try to force
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:17.720]  a recession down our throat here in the next 12 months. And we can only hope and pray that it
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:22.280]  doesn't happen before the midterms because they want to take Trump out of power. They ask what's
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:26.920]  the headline coming up? Globalist attempting to crash US economy out of midterms. Yep.
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:32.360]  Economist globalist attempting to crash US economy out of midterms and held their old TV
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:38.600]  saying it. Ali Alexander takes over right now. Really smart guy having an open free debate here.

[03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:59.880]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:05.320]  in Leilani Estates but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[03:18:05.320 --> 03:18:12.440]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:19.160]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
[03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:24.600]  alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:31.080]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:36.920]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to
[03:18:36.920 --> 03:18:43.800]  optimal levels. As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[03:18:43.800 --> 03:18:49.640]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[03:18:49.640 --> 03:18:55.880]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it. We all know that the outside toxins
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:19:00.840]  in the water is a serious health issue. InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:05.880]  almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home. That's why we're

[03:20:06.760 --> 03:20:18.920]  the information war it's Alex Jones. Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is Ali Alexander. I'm
[03:20:18.920 --> 03:20:25.480]  hosting the last hour of Alex's show here on infowars, infowars.com. Go ahead if you're online
[03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:30.520]  and click that share button you're not going to want to miss the next 40 minutes where we're going
[03:20:30.520 --> 03:20:35.640]  to talk about the agenda of the globalists. You know Bill Marr said this earlier they want to crash
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:40.440]  the economy to hurt the Republican majority really it's a Trump majority right. We've seen the
[03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:47.080]  Republicans act more conservative, more Trumpian since Donald Trump has called his own party to
[03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:51.080]  the mat and so I'm going to introduce a friend of mine. This is a guy I actually talked to pretty
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:56.840]  frequently. I manage my own portfolio. I keep track of the news. I don't follow the you know the
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:02.120]  fake news instead I make money on the real news but I always have a couple of people that I put
[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:07.800]  around me to keep me sane and one of those is my friend Edward Dowd. Edward Dowd is a former
[03:21:07.800 --> 03:21:13.400]  BlackRock guy. BlackRock is making some news today because they're pushing for a Bitcoin ETF
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:18.360]  but Ed's no longer associated with them. Instead he's a whoa. He's a red-pilled
[03:21:19.160 --> 03:21:23.640]  Wall Street analyst who agreed to come on today and talk about the possibility of a coming recession
[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:28.360]  within the next 12 to 18 months. I think frankly it could be sooner but we're going to talk about
[03:21:28.360 --> 03:21:33.320]  this all with Ed. We're going to have a fruitful discussion. Right now he's raising funds for
[03:21:34.440 --> 03:21:39.640]  one of his funds that really indexes and models what the economy is doing. His performance has
[03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:44.600]  been remarkable. It's why I've come to rely on him and he's calling from Hawaii. How are you my
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:50.840]  friend? I'm good Ali. Thanks for having me on today. I appreciate it. Yeah I just we just
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:55.800]  with my partners we were launching a new firm Ocean Square Asset Management at the Global
[03:21:55.800 --> 03:22:00.120]  MacroHedge Fund. We're pre-launched so we don't have any assets yet. We've been running a model
[03:22:00.120 --> 03:22:06.040]  portfolio since Labor Day of last year so we are in the process of trying to find someone to go in
[03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:11.160]  the business with us and partner with us and give us a seed investor spot. So that's what we're
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:17.720]  trying to do but I can share with you what we're seeing now and what I think is going to happen.
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:22.600]  I mean obviously I don't know exactly what's going to happen but you know what we're seeing
[03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:29.160]  is starting to concern me from an economic recession standpoint.
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:34.440]  Yeah and just to give a little background on some of our private conversations you know
[03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:40.600]  I'm not one you know I love my friends but I'm not one to brag but you know you and I were talking
[03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:47.000]  you know February 5th, 6th, 7th and then boom 8th the market drops we see that massive correction
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:53.320]  February you and I were talking towards the end of March I think it was March 25th or 24th
[03:22:53.320 --> 03:22:58.920]  and boom you called that one and I said okay well this guy is seeing something on a macro level
[03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:05.080]  that I'm also seeing at the political level and and you know you told me something that was really
[03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:10.280]  salient you said you know a lot of these recessions are triggered by the Federal Reserve.
[03:23:12.360 --> 03:23:17.240]  Yeah absolutely so it's you know this is not something that's advertised but we talk about
[03:23:17.240 --> 03:23:23.480]  it all the time on Wall Street and typically speaking more often than not a recession is
[03:23:23.480 --> 03:23:29.640]  due to Fed policy error they over tighten financial conditions worsen liquidities was drawn from the
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:37.160]  system some sort of excess that had been building in the system is exposed and then they furiously
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:43.160]  then play catch up and start to loosen monetary policy but by then it's usually too late and
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:47.560]  a recession has taken hold and they're usually always behind the eight ball and I think
[03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:51.160]  given what I'm seeing in the asset classes that we follow and how we're positioned
[03:23:51.160 --> 03:23:55.800]  and we're starting to see you know we're of the opinion that we're in the early stages
[03:23:55.800 --> 03:24:01.080]  of the Fed probably has already made a policy error and it's starting to affect the asset
[03:24:01.080 --> 03:24:07.160]  markets which sends signals to us. So what are some of these signals that you guys over at Ocean
[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:14.280]  Squared are seeing and that you've modeled your so far successful you know portfolio after?
[03:24:14.280 --> 03:24:22.760]  So we play in bonds so my partners are fixed income I'm equity we're playing bonds currencies
[03:24:22.760 --> 03:24:30.680]  and equities and we started to see technically that the dollar was putting in a you know we follow
[03:24:30.680 --> 03:24:36.440]  cycles was putting in a major four-year cycle low in February we also saw that bonds the US 30-year
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:42.680]  Treasury bond was putting in a three-year cycle low or we thought it was so we made some we made
[03:24:42.680 --> 03:24:48.920]  some bets in the model portfolio and we are currently expressing our dollar bullishness by
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:54.600]  being short the euro the South African ran the Chilean peso and the Australian dollar
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.240]  we're still bullish on the on the dollar and I think if there's something needs to be understood
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:05.400]  is Trump is very bullish his policies are very bullish and pro-dollar and and so I'm going to
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:10.440]  say something that's going to sound pretty crazy but you know it's you know if you look at the
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:18.040]  long-term down downtrend of the dollar that downtrend has been broken in the last couple years
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:25.160]  and the dollar it's a very long downtrend since going back to the 70s and the dollar you know
[03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:28.680]  had a little correction here the last two years that weakened a little bit but we think the dollar
[03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:34.280]  put in its four-year cycle it could go by the end of this four-year cycle we could we could see it
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:43.160]  going back to 121 on the Dixie DXY and that would be the prior top in 2000 and you know I can tell
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:47.240]  you I can give you the I think is that technically what we see I can tell you what the fundamental
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:51.880]  reasons are if you want to hear those yeah well before we get into that I'll tell you when Donald
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:57.720]  Trump won which you know I mean I do this for a living and yet still two three hours into the
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:03.240]  night said there's no way there's no way that we're gonna win in fact I was so I was so bearish
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:08.840]  on Donald Trump winning that night even though I wanted him to win right I supported him is I
[03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:13.960]  bet my younger friends a hundred bucks a piece saying well we're not gonna win Florida you know
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:18.280]  I knew that I could put my money on that and so I lost about four hundred five hundred dollars that
[03:26:18.280 --> 03:26:23.480]  night to to the guys who were you know we were all wearing our MAGA hats we were celebrating
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:29.560]  and you know but the next day I got up and I wiped myself off of politics instead I said you know what
[03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:34.920]  I need to readjust my portfolio now that Hillary is not gonna rig the economy for solar get us
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:42.440]  into war with Russia via Syria can capitulate to China etc etc and I started investing in some
[03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:48.840]  biotech because what I realized is Donald Trump was a nationalist and a populist but he had
[03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:54.120]  conservative policies that you know have been coming from Cato heritage foundation and they
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:58.680]  were all gonna be swooped into the White House these are ideas that hadn't been tested in 30 or 40
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:04.600]  years and I was excited to test some of these theories and my stock portfolio has been booming
[03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:09.080]  ever since but I will say you know you hit something that that I thought too I said okay well this
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:13.480]  is going to be interesting I don't want anyone to think that we're talking down the economy
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:19.000]  you know Trump and the Republicans have been wildly successful at the economy but the market has
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:24.280]  grown at such a fast rate that I have some concerns especially when you have the Federal Reserve
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:29.320]  especially when you have the globalist especially when you have George Soros especially when you
[03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:34.760]  have China trying to match even with the petrodollar so this is really interesting that you brought up
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:39.400]  you know we're a minute away from the break but you brought up something that stuck out to me and
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:44.760]  I was betting on a strong dollar whereas everyone was really bullish on gold because they were saying
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:50.440]  oh well Donald Trump is unpredictable will buy gold I said no no no no if this guy implements
[03:27:50.440 --> 03:27:56.040]  Republican conservative policies we are going to be American again baby and I'm glad that you
[03:27:56.040 --> 03:28:01.320]  touched that but China seems threatened by this don't they oh absolutely and China's had a very
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:06.840]  difficult time of it their stock market has depreciated over 20 it's officially in a fair
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:14.360]  market their economy as you and I know they produce you know quarter in and quarter out
[03:28:14.360 --> 03:28:19.240]  seven percent GDP growth rates which if you know anything about if you know anything about fraud
[03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:25.640]  that's a goal seek Excel spreadsheet kind of thing so you know in many ways the Chinese economy
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:29.320]  is a little bit like Bernie Madoff on a national scale but you know Bernie Madoff didn't have a
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:33.400]  printing press in other countries that would you know help feed him you know help him out if you
[03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:39.320]  get into trouble so China's waiting to blow up China right now is slowing down precipitously
[03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:43.960]  we're playing that but we're short semiconductors I started picking up and very
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:47.880]  hold that thought on China we're going to come back after the break you guys are listening to the

[03:33:21.960 --> 03:33:34.600]  let's say china china china china china china china china china china china
[03:33:40.600 --> 03:33:43.800]  you go over to china china china china and we're warning again
[03:33:45.080 --> 03:33:48.840]  recession folks you guys need to know this you can't just trust
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:53.800]  people managing your money you also have to be aware which is why i have one of the smartest
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:58.760]  guys in the business my friend edward dow we had to cut him off to go to a hard break
[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:04.840]  but ed you were telling us that china who you know on their balance sheet governing a billion
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:10.600]  people said that they've been you know growing at seven percent but you don't think that's the case
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:14.200]  and you think that there's other fundamentals that are gonna that you know they're officially in the
[03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:19.720]  bear market you told us so what else are you seeing in regards to china and how that relates to us
[03:34:19.720 --> 03:34:25.320]  and what we need to be on the lookout for right so so i'll get back to my fundamental reasons for
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:30.520]  why the dollar is going up as well but let me start with china so china um look it's been
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:36.040]  it's been a well-known publicized joke on wall street that the chinese economy numbers that they
[03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:40.440]  present to us are fraudulent but that's been you know we've been okay with that we're gonna not
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:46.920]  haha but here we are and china's you know the amount of debt that they've they've accrued since
[03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:54.760]  um you know the early 2000s is eye-popping um there uh you know donald trump is um his policies
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:35:01.080]  are really having an impact on their stock market the trade deficit uh as obviously it's a joke i mean
[03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:06.280]  the amount of um you know they can't hurt us but we can definitely hurt them and trump knows that
[03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:13.000]  not that's the leverage he's using so china stock market has rolled quite significantly and the data
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:17.960]  points i was picking up in june with that semiconductors were rolling hard and semiconductors are the
[03:35:17.960 --> 03:35:24.200]  tip of the spear from an economic standpoint they're global um and china consumes a lot of them as
[03:35:24.200 --> 03:35:29.720]  well as you know everybody else so i was hearing that literally orders were just falling out of the
[03:35:29.720 --> 03:35:35.240]  bed uh and things were getting pulled factories that we heard were going to get built those plans
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:40.440]  were put on hold these are coming from high level exact executives that i know so you know and then
[03:35:40.440 --> 03:35:45.080]  if you look at the price action of the semiconductors let's let's put in that's mary what i heard with
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:51.160]  price action um the semiconductor stocks have um relatively underperformed the general market
[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:56.920]  they did not make a new high and this last high and they are they are they're looking quite awful
[03:35:56.920 --> 03:36:04.120]  right now so we're we're short you know uh some semiconductor stocks um to reflect our our you know
[03:36:04.120 --> 03:36:10.360]  bearishness on china and and and the global economy and um you know look when the fed the
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:16.040]  fed is basically the interest rate of the world and they're raising rates the other central banks
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:21.640]  are starting to have to follow even though they don't they don't want to and a stronger dollar
[03:36:22.280 --> 03:36:28.760]  um has caused a liquidity situation in the emerging economies and what the problem the problem is
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:35.480]  is that over the last 10 years 15 years since the early 2000s the emerging markets have been issuing
[03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:45.320]  uh debt in dollar denominated um issuance so this is india this is india china turkey united
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:51.480]  all of brazil you know all of them and so the amount of the the it's estimated that the dollar
[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:57.000]  the dollar amount of emerging market debt in dollars is seven to nine trillion so as interest
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:03.720]  rates go up um and our currency appreciates the dollar appreciate that's very bad for them they
[03:37:03.720 --> 03:37:08.040]  have to start paying but it becomes it becomes a it becomes a debt crisis eventually if you
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:13.560]  look at what's going on in turkey that's exactly what's happening and again as ish yeah so so
[03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:18.200]  what's going on is globally we're seeing the slowing first because of the rising dollar
[03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:23.880]  and eventually i think it makes its way back to the us for you know a potential um you know
[03:37:23.880 --> 03:37:29.080]  slowing of our economy or or recession and the timing of it's unclear but we're seeing
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:34.680]  we're seeing that in the asset markets that the yield curve is flattening um we're long we're
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:39.160]  long 30 year treasuries because we believe that you know that's you know that yields like i said
[03:37:39.160 --> 03:37:43.960]  bonds are bottomed and we think that the yield curve will invert at some point here over the next
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:50.760]  you know three to six months uh the the 1030 curve is down to about 10 basis point
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:57.880]  um and that's at levels we haven't seen since 2007 so you know even though things are going great
[03:37:57.880 --> 03:38:03.080]  and by the way um when markets and economies um roll over they usually roll over when things
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:07.560]  are very very good and things are very very good but what's going on is the second derivative
[03:38:07.560 --> 03:38:12.520]  is starting to change and the dollar the dollar i believe and the and the fed raising interest
[03:38:12.520 --> 03:38:18.840]  rates are the two causes of this and you know quickly quickly um you know trump is really pro
[03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:24.120]  dollar uh his apologies the corporate tax rates have now brought investment back to this country
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:31.000]  thank god thank god yes yeah on the long term that's a good thing short because otherwise we had all
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:35.400]  this foreign investment coming in and you know and i'm not opposed to it right we have this foxconn
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:40.920]  plant in wisconsin that's going to help governor walker that might help republicans at the end
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:44.840]  of the day it's going to help americans and that's important but you know if you go to places like
[03:38:44.840 --> 03:38:51.800]  irvine california i mean i you know i i i'm obviously not a racist i'm not a racist i'm half black
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:59.480]  half arab my best friend is vietnamese but when i flew into la and i went around irvine i was like
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:05.720]  okay well is this entire town owned by chinese nationals and i was hearing from the locals
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:10.200]  there who had been there for decades that yeah basically they go in and they buy these homes
[03:39:10.200 --> 03:39:15.240]  for cash and then when they go back to china they'll leave these louis Vuitton or Gucci bags like
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:22.120]  they're buying so much with cash and we were suffering the obama non-recovery so what would you
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:27.160]  say to someone who's listening to this and they're saying well this is technical mumbo jumbo
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:32.840]  you know obama and his friends and jenny ellen held down the economy trump is bringing it back
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:40.680]  how can we possibly reach how can we possibly go into a recession even in the next 10 years well
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:46.680]  it just it looks cycles occur and interest rates and liquidity have a powerful impact on the asset
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:51.320]  markets and the asset markets lead the real economy so you know again i don't believe there's
[03:39:51.320 --> 03:39:56.200]  going to be a financial crisis i believe this will be a bump in the road and be much like
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:40:01.560]  potentially what happened to ronald reagan uh you know in his uh second uh second year he had a
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:07.800]  recession and then things really took off so i don't fear the recession uh and you'll have an
[03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:13.560]  opportunity you'll have an opportunity to buy assets on the cheap and i like that and you know
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:19.000]  what that's the great thing that conservatives populist nationalist and republicans are doing
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:24.840]  they're strengthening our country right and i i told my friends this in dc they said all lee
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:29.560]  you know you used to be with us why are you so much more trumpian you know you're an ideological
[03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:35.080]  conservative why are you kind of getting wishy washy with trump when it comes to naft or tariffs
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:41.400]  and i told them simply i'm done watching the obliteration of the culture in pennsylvania
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:47.400]  in west virginia in ohio and if i have to go to the dollar store and pay two dollars more for a
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:55.400]  product and generations can grow up and date in ohio in and in falling waters west virginia
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:01.000]  in scranton uh pennsylvania well then that's good for the country that's good for people and
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:05.400]  fundamentally i think it's also a national security issue donald trump believes that we
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:10.760]  ought to have some manufacturing base here we ought to have things here and what i find interesting
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:15.880]  and i i'd warn people this would happen donald trump is restoring order he's making sovereignty
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:21.560]  great again you alluded to it with turkey's doing this china's doing this they're all trying to get
[03:41:21.560 --> 03:41:28.520]  it their currency to be more liquid on the international stage but donald trump is gobbling
[03:41:28.520 --> 03:41:33.720]  it all up with the us dollar it's a very exciting time to be alive and and i agree with you you
[03:41:33.720 --> 03:41:38.600]  know in a recession i'm gonna lean in on these fundamentals that have made people like warren
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:45.000]  buffett rich you know i'm gonna bet big on the american people i mean think of it this way always
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:52.920]  so the last at least 10 15 years has been a weak dollar policy since the top in 2000 and selling us
[03:41:52.920 --> 03:41:57.880]  out to the globalists and well you know however however you want to categorize it's been a weak
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:01.720]  dollar policy well if you look at the long-term charts you look at donald trump's policies are
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:05.560]  the dollar's going to be strengthening so what does that mean that means more investment here in
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:10.680]  the u.s dollars coming home and of course because the the system in the world globally has been
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:15.880]  geared towards a weak dollar there is going to be pain as that regime shift happens and we're
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:22.840]  going to see that pain in the form of a economic slowdown but our slowdown will be um way less
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:27.720]  than it will be in the emerging economies in china because of their reliance on a weak dollar
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:33.160]  and in fact go ahead and that's what it's all about that's what it's all about it's a competition
[03:42:33.160 --> 03:42:42.680]  everyone but on the world stage it's a competition and donald trump wants america to be first after
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:49.640]  the break we're going to talk about more strategies we're going to pick edge brain fear not america
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:58.840]  first living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:03.880]  in leilania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[03:43:03.880 --> 03:43:10.920]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
[03:43:10.920 --> 03:43:16.920]  could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:23.320]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[03:43:23.320 --> 03:43:29.240]  heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:35.720]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[03:43:35.720 --> 03:43:42.840]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:48.600]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[03:43:48.600 --> 03:43:54.840]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it i want to plow into all of this
[03:43:55.720 --> 03:44:00.680]  that i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that

[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:30.040]  y'all we are talking about the market we're talking about the market this is sometimes
[03:47:30.040 --> 03:47:36.120]  sometimes it's very hard to talk about the market because people think about the economy
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:41.800]  you know the economy is not the market the market's not the economy the market is a part of the
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:49.640]  economy and helping us guide us through this in our last segment is edward dowd he is a partner at
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:55.480]  ocean squared he's running a model portfolio they're raising funds for their fund and it's been
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:48:00.200]  really remarkable and i've really actually enjoyed our friendship my mother says this she says ollie
[03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:04.520]  sometimes you're too transactional but what i like about our friendship is you share your
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:10.120]  expertise with me i share my expertise with you and boy we've called a lot of things right
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:16.200]  together and you know i love i love you know if let's throw ed's twitter account up on the screen
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:21.080]  but you know i love retweeting you and one of the things that you know you encouraged me to
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:26.120]  take a second look at is i'm a technologist you know they call it the thing stocks right but
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:31.880]  these things have been growing at such an alarming rate without increasing their their revenues at
[03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:37.400]  the same rate that there's got to be some type of retracement right i mean there was with bitcoin
[03:48:37.400 --> 03:48:42.600]  why wouldn't there be with netflix or facebook especially when they're busy pissing off half
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:47.560]  their base the conservatives in america the people who have the money you know are you concerned at
[03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:56.280]  all about these what has been dubbed the fang stocks facebook apple netflix google absolutely so
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:49:02.440]  you know look you know we the way we're positioned we're not short the stock market we're we're
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.520]  shorting some stocks and we're long some stocks so we're kind of neutral the stock market but
[03:49:06.520 --> 03:49:11.880]  making bets on what we think might go up and might might go down and i told you we're short
[03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:18.280]  semiconductor stocks but we're also short three of the fang stocks one of them has been working
[03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:22.280]  the short term force the other two have been a little problematic for us but we think we're
[03:49:22.280 --> 03:49:29.000]  close we think the stock market is in the process of topping out here short term the fangs i have
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:34.760]  some real issues with the fangs a they've been a phenomenal performers their revenue growth has
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:40.280]  been great but i think the second derivative on their revenue growth is about to turn i also think
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:46.920]  that the regulatory issues that you and i talked about in february and dc are coming at the forefront
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:54.760]  and you know i'm watching alex and others being censored by facebook and google and you know
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:50:01.640]  that's not going to sit well with a lot of republican congressmen and today alex talked about
[03:50:01.640 --> 03:50:06.360]  they're going to get some reports to these congressmen to show them what's going on so
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:12.120]  it's you know if i'm a betting man technically i see them topping and then i see i see regulatory
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:17.880]  action coming down the pike and i think um what's behind the curtain is going to be very very
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:23.880]  problematic for them and very very unsettling for lots and lots of people the amount of control
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:30.840]  that they have uh over our dialogue in this country and you know i'm i'm not i'm not bullish on these
[03:50:30.840 --> 03:50:35.560]  stocks i think they have a tremendous amount of downside once they turn well what's really
[03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:40.760]  interesting uh which was struck me as interesting is when mark zuckerberg and facebook's been
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:45.800]  tremendously kind to me you know not conservatives in general but to me they've sponsored my parties
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:50.920]  in dc you know the facebook government team has been absolutely wonderful to me full disclosure
[03:50:50.920 --> 03:50:57.800]  but when mark zuckerberg the ceo and founder of facebook said that well we are willing to accept
[03:50:57.800 --> 03:51:03.720]  regulations on advertisements i thought well that's your moneymaker and i thought well wow he's
[03:51:03.720 --> 03:51:09.880]  really acting like a media institution because he doesn't want to be regulated right in the areas of
[03:51:09.880 --> 03:51:16.440]  speech he doesn't want to be uh regulated in the areas of fairness or censorship they're entirely
[03:51:16.440 --> 03:51:21.480]  willing to take regulation on the advertising front and i have to believe well you're willing to let
[03:51:21.480 --> 03:51:26.760]  your stock price take a hit theoretically because come on more regulation inside of the advertising
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:33.800]  space makes the ads convert less right more text more gobbledy gloop more disclosure is going to
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:40.120]  lead to fewer people fewer marketing departments and fewer advertisers placing these buys and i
[03:51:40.120 --> 03:51:47.480]  thought wow we really live in such an aurelian system where these companies aren't after money
[03:51:47.480 --> 03:51:53.000]  they're after influence they're after power they're after control and we know once you control thought
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:57.000]  you control speech and this is why it's so important for us to you know declare this or
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:52:02.280]  declare that but you know i it's you know it's so salient when you told me that i mean if you look
[03:52:02.280 --> 03:52:08.360]  at the technical case we've got to see some type of retracement and if you look at what some of you
[03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:13.080]  know i you know i don't make it too public but you know it um you know i've talked to a number
[03:52:13.080 --> 03:52:18.600]  of members of congress in fact the house judiciary chairman bob goodlatt is a friend of mine
[03:52:18.600 --> 03:52:23.560]  uh you know i lived in lynchburg for a number of years uh and the congressman out of ronoke
[03:52:23.560 --> 03:52:29.160]  and um you know a number of these other senators and congressmen are very very concerned about
[03:52:29.160 --> 03:52:34.680]  this issue ted cruiser and paul mike lee uh a number of them and i you know i told one major
[03:52:34.680 --> 03:52:40.760]  ceo uh everyone you know on twitter knows i have a relationship with a couple of ceos and um
[03:52:40.760 --> 03:52:45.320]  silicon valley some major ones and i told him i said if y'all don't get your crap together
[03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:50.520]  by january you know you're going to see the ire of the republican party
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:54.600]  so long as we are still in the majority and i think that we are going to be in the majority
[03:52:54.600 --> 03:53:01.400]  are other analysts in wall in wall street recognizing that republicans are willing
[03:53:01.400 --> 03:53:06.360]  to put aside some of their conservative ideology and regulate a lot of these spaces
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:11.880]  if they're going to continue to come down on consumers in our speech so it's actually the
[03:53:11.880 --> 03:53:17.880]  opposite so let me tell you why the stocks have worked well after um zuckerberg's congressional
[03:53:17.880 --> 03:53:23.560]  testimony last i think was april um so here's the reason why these stocks are hitting slight new
[03:53:23.560 --> 03:53:31.000]  highs is that um it's the belief on wall street that march zuckerberg is now willing to be regulated
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:34.600]  but he's going to run he's going to help write most of the regulations and it's going to be
[03:53:34.600 --> 03:53:38.040]  look over here don't look over here and in the net effect is going to actually
[03:53:38.040 --> 03:53:43.960]  um destroy the competition and it's going to be more power to the monopolist so that's that's why
[03:53:43.960 --> 03:53:50.200]  these stocks are going up wall street is betting that it's going to be business as usual and that
[03:53:50.200 --> 03:53:56.760]  the crony capitalism is going to continue that's the bet so so the if you want to and i'm taking
[03:53:56.760 --> 03:54:04.280]  the opposite bet that the populism uh worm is here globalism is over the crony capitalism is
[03:54:04.280 --> 03:54:08.360]  i think it's almost too untenable to get away with it there's too many eyeballs on it
[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:12.840]  they're trying to censor they're trying to censor and de-platform other people so
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:17.640]  my bet is technically we were we were on we were getting exhaustion cell signals on these stocks
[03:54:18.280 --> 03:54:22.760]  and i think i think fundamentally we're going to start to hear some bad news for them on the
[03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:26.440]  regulatory front and also i think i think more and more i think we're going to start to see
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:29.320]  whistleblowers come forward i think we're going to we're going to there's going to be more
[03:54:29.320 --> 03:54:35.400]  discovery of of things in the various things that they've been up to so you know this is i'm
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:38.760]  actually so the wall street i think has it wrong that's the opportunity that's why i'm betting
[03:54:38.760 --> 03:54:43.880]  against them i think wall street's off on this what is that buy the rumors sell the news or
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:48.920]  which what's that quote and would you tell our audience what that means buy the rumor sell the
[03:54:48.920 --> 03:54:56.280]  new yeah well so stocks are a discounting mechanism and um what that means is by the time
[03:54:56.280 --> 03:55:01.080]  you're reading the headline on a stock the news all of it's already been discounted and smart
[03:55:01.080 --> 03:55:06.200]  investors have already figured it out and the stock has already either gone right gone down to
[03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:11.640]  that point or up to the point so so by the time you hear the news it's it's too late yeah mom and
[03:55:11.640 --> 03:55:18.120]  pops are kind of screwed these other guys they're playing with inside information or legally obtained
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:24.280]  information and they're playing pre-market you know uh it's not it's not it's not it's not it's
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:29.320]  it's not inside information it's they it's it's it's uh call it like um they're putting together
[03:55:29.320 --> 03:55:35.240]  the analyst mosaic they're more informed than the general person uh and they start to become
[03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:41.160]  cautious on a stock and slowly the stock starts to relatively underperform and by the time a stock
[03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:45.560]  you know has to wash out events you know that the news has been revealed for the most part
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:50.840]  so so get us back to the dollar so we talked about the fangs we talked about china get us back to
[03:55:50.840 --> 03:55:56.680]  the dollar the final the final case the final case you want to make in 60 seconds on the dollar
[03:55:57.320 --> 03:56:02.200]  okay so we're i believe we're at a four-year cycle low i'm a cycle believer and the dollar on average
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:07.720]  has from major low to low is four years and we had it in february interest rate differentials
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.960]  between us and the rest of the world the fed's been leading so that's going to cause people to
[03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:17.960]  become more attracted to our bonds and our treasuries which will then create a bid for dollars again
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:23.320]  trump's policies are very dollar bullish corporate tax rates being lower repatriation of offshore
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:31.720]  funds also he's going to have um a budget deficit which is going to crowd out other um countries
