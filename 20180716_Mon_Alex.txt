[00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:12.499]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:47.558]  Okay, we've got live feeds out of the other studio with Owen Schroyer giving you live analysis and coverage and then he's collating all the highlights of the unbelievable ongoing press conference that's been happening for over an hour with the Russian President Vladimir Putin and the US President Donald J. Trump.
[00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:52.479]  Unbelievable bombshell after bombshell.
[00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.240]  We've already got some of the clips grabbed.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.480]  One of them was five minutes ago.
[00:00:56.616 --> 00:01:01.440]  And it was Putin going, listen, our intelligence services aren't involved.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.286]  These are private Russian companies that all sorts of companies hire, which 80% of the bots bought were for Hillary out of Russia.
[00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:10.306]  That's what happens during elections.
[00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:13.489]  People go overseas and get around campaign finance law.
[00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:19.653]  But he goes, listen, you've got George Soros inside the United States trying to steal elections for Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:23.857]  And then right before that, a few minutes before, Trump comes out and says, hey,
[00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:27.776]  What about Hillary and her 30,000 emails?
[00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:31.618]  We're changing the subject to whoever hacked those.
[00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:34.419]  She shouldn't have illegally had those on her private server.
[00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.500]  See how they changed the subject?
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.744]  And of course, Putin's come out and denied that they were involved in election manipulation, says they're insulted.
[00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:47.685]  If anything, RT is leftist.
[00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:50.306]  In fact, RT's horrible now.
[00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:52.447]  It's unwatchable.
[00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:54.148]  The sycophantic,
[00:01:56.487 --> 00:02:00.470]  Worship of anti-Trump stuff, and it's always been leftist.
[00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:11.319]  I mean, the claim that it's this anti-Hillary machine, that CIA report they put out a year and a half ago that showed 20-something examples of them having negative coverage of Hillary?
[00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.522]  Yeah, they had probably thousands of Trump!
[00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:18.485]  I mean, RT, if anything, is like our mainstream media.
[00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:19.726]  It's very, very leftist.
[00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:21.778]  That's a side issue.
[00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:23.040]  This is a huge broadcast.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.564]  We're going to have a bunch of these clips for you.
[00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:26.628]  The live press conference is ongoing.
[00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:43.950]  And then we've done something very, very special with Mike Adams and Paul Watson and the rest of the team that has a real chance of blunting internet censorship and the whole globalist plan to silence nationalists, Christians, patriots, you name it.
[00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.111]  And that's coming up as well.
[00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:52.756]  There is a detailed 50 plus page PDF on Infowars.com right now.
[00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:56.259]  The censorship master plan decoded.
[00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:03.687]  The Adams Report, and then Paul Watson has another detailed report that details this.
[00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:05.610]  This is for Congress and the President.
[00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.836]  I can tell you right now, it is being sent to the President as we speak.
[00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:17.227]  To their horror, and this is how they're doing it, how they admit they're doing it, and how they think we're stupid, and how they can be easily stopped.
[00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:21.950]  So you want to put a stop to this, make this go viral, send it to every congressperson.
[00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.752]  They're having hearings on this tomorrow.
[00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.313]  No one has put together a blueprint.
[00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:28.636]  Well, with InfoWars, Mike Adams has done it at naturalnews.com.
[00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:29.957]  He'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:33.780]  But right now, let's go out to break with Vladimir Putin just minutes ago.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.463]  We have more of these clips coming up from Helsinki, Finland.
[00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:37.783]  Here is
[00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:41.985]  Putin throwing down the gauntlet about manipulation.
[00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.966]  This company does not constitute the Russian state.
[00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.187]  It does not represent the Russian state.
[00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:49.768]  And I brought several examples before.
[00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:54.269]  Well, you have a lot of individuals in the United States.
[00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.331]  Take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion capitals.
[00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:04.733]  But does it make him, his position, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:05.393]  No, it does not.
[00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.094]  Well, it's the same case.
[00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:12.788]  There is the issue of trying a case in the court.
[00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:19.871]  And the final say is for the court to deliver.
[00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:25.153]  We are now talking about the individuals and not about particular states.
[00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:33.477]  And as far as the most recent allegation is concerned about the Russian intelligence officers, we do have an intergovernmental
[00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.741]  Please do send us the request.
[00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.922]  We will analyze it properly.
[00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:43.386]  We're going to come back to more of this where Trump calls out Hillary.
[00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:45.447]  But just understand this.
[00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:47.890]  Putin just gave you the truthful answer.
[00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.393]  That there are all these bot companies all over the world that for PR anybody can hire.
[00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:53.054]  There are a bunch of them in Russia.
[00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:58.119]  And even the congressional reports say Michael Moore went to a Russian bot protest of Trump.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.861]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:15.830]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:56.563]  You better look out, Globalist, because we're fighting back and we're winning.
[00:06:56.563 --> 00:07:03.549]  You better watch out, Hillary.
[00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:06.672]  You better watch out, Sacha Baron Cohen.
[00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.334]  You better watch out, Michael Moore.
[00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:10.856]  You better watch out, Globalist, because we're fighting back.
[00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:14.419]  50,000 unstoppable watts.
[00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:21.184]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[00:07:21.184 --> 00:07:31.210]  The historic Trump-Futin summit is taking place that took over a year and a half of him being president to happen when it should have been the third or fourth meeting he had.
[00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:40.996]  Should have met with the UK, should have met with the EU, should have met with the Chinese, should have met with the Russians, should have met with the Japanese, should have met with the Mexican president.
[00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:45.519]  And Trump did all those meetings in the right order, but
[00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:50.589]  Russia.
[00:07:50.589 --> 00:08:10.724]  And then I was just thinking today about how Trump has been kicking the Russians in the ribs, breaking their nose, smashing their head in the ground, and then how the media, Brian Stelter and others, we're going to play this clip coming up in the next segment, said everything Trump's telling you is a lie, you can't trust him, he's your enemy.
[00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:18.230]  And of course what you're hearing is the inverse 100% about Stelter, who just reeks of being disingenuous and is a known fraud.
[00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.731]  But that's the unified thing they're putting out.
[00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:26.374]  The truth is, Trump sees everybody as a competitor to the U.S.
[00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:42.803]  And if anything, one of his only failings is letting the military-industrial complex stampede him into showing folks how tough he is on Russia, when in the aggregate they are not one one-hundredth as expansionist as Communist China, or not one-tenth as big a threat.
[00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:48.238]  Our relationship has never been worse with Russia, probably even during the Cold War.
[00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:49.638]  Trump's correct.
[00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:51.399]  He said, the EU's our adversary.
[00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.840]  They are our foe.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.701]  Financially, they are trying to bankrupt us.
[00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.941]  Juncker said that a year and a half ago.
[00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:58.262]  He said, I'll bankrupt America.
[00:08:58.262 --> 00:08:59.723]  They're allied with the CHICOMS.
[00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:03.825]  Russia is not allied with the EU.
[00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:09.268]  The EU is an authoritarian, unelected monstrosity.
[00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:09.948]  Trump would not
[00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.770]  I don't think so.
[00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:36.195]  That crushes Russia.
[00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:46.079]  The moving TOW missiles into Ukraine, something Obama wouldn't do, giving them anti-tank missiles to attack the Russian forces in the east of Ukraine that's always been Russia.
[00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:49.301]  That's where Russia was founded.
[00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:59.325]  Backing, really, Soros' operation that he bragged he launched four years ago on Fareed Zarkaria on CNN, that they overthrew the elected government of Ukraine and spent five million U.S.
[00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:00.366]  tax dollars to do it.
[00:10:02.554 --> 00:10:17.057]  And then all Russia did was come into the eastern area of Crimea that's 99% basically Russian-speaking and has always been part of Russia except during World War II when Hitler took it over and
[00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.340]  The Russians have no other choice.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.201]  They were attacked.
[00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.202]  They were invaded.
[00:10:22.202 --> 00:10:23.523]  People call me a Russophile.
[00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:26.085]  No, I'm a truthophile, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:28.386]  I like to tell the truth.
[00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:34.311]  Makes my job a lot easier just to research the facts, know what the facts are, and then go with those.
[00:10:34.311 --> 00:10:43.699]  That doesn't mean I lionize Russia or Putin or any of this, but as Putin pointed out just minutes ago, we're going to play the clip,
[00:10:44.738 --> 00:10:50.320]  You're accusing 12 Russian intelligence operatives of being behind bots.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.062]  These are private companies that anybody can hire to do PR.
[00:10:56.062 --> 00:11:00.304]  And Russia is not even in the top 10 of being hired for PR.
[00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:05.706]  The US is number one, China is number two, and the different EU companies are number three.
[00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:11.128]  The UK is very dominant in it for the size of their population, 80 million people.
[00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:14.009]  In fact, if you said per capita, the UK probably does more PR than anybody.
[00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:16.337]  And you can hire them for anything.
[00:11:16.337 --> 00:11:20.042]  And 80% roughly of all bots were for Hillary.
[00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:26.451]  And they came from New Zealand, they came from Russia, they came... You could go hijack somebody's computer in Russia.
[00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:27.172]  Zombie computer.
[00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:32.595]  Happens to millions of computers a day, and then attack the U.S.
[00:11:32.595 --> 00:11:34.696]  with it, and they can say, oh look, Russia attacked us.
[00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:43.462]  And that's in the Vault 7 documents that came out last year, where the CIA would go place stuff on Russian computers to attack the U.S.
[00:11:43.462 --> 00:11:45.283]  That's the oldest trick in the book!
[00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.471]  Russia just cut defense spending.
[00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:51.174]  Russia says they want an economic posture of development.
[00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:54.036]  They want soccer championships.
[00:11:54.036 --> 00:11:56.398]  They want world fairs.
[00:11:56.398 --> 00:11:58.219]  They want industrial building.
[00:11:58.219 --> 00:11:59.640]  They want shopping malls.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.862]  They want organic farms.
[00:12:01.862 --> 00:12:06.085]  They've decided not to play.
[00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:11.810]  China is absolutely saying they're going to take us over and are in a state of war against us in their official newspapers.
[00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:24.036]  And I 100% support the President getting in China's face, hitting them with massive tariffs, and beefing up our military in those areas, Space Command, you name it, to deal with them.
[00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:31.740]  Because they are threatening us and expanding, have 97% of rare earth minerals, and admit they're strangling the U.S., and they've bought up Hollywood.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.782]  China is buying up with several Islamic groups, the UFC.
[00:12:36.782 --> 00:12:38.282]  I mean, we are being bought up.
[00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:39.563]  They're our biggest debt holders.
[00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:43.498]  It's the CHICOMS!
[00:12:43.498 --> 00:12:44.438]  The CHICOMS!
[00:12:44.438 --> 00:12:45.378]  The CHICOMS!
[00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:46.179]  The CHICOMS!
[00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:47.119]  The CHICOMS!
[00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:51.301]  The Russia is a diversion!
[00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:59.844]  Russia is just seen as weak, economically, so the globalists are in there trying to destabilize it and take it!
[00:12:59.844 --> 00:13:10.669]  Just like the EU took over the UK, and now they voted two years ago to get out of it, and now Theresa May says, sorry, we're not even going to do Brexit now.
[00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:11.549]  She announced that today.
[00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:19.379]  So, it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:21.760]  It's on in every way.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.241]  Trump goes to the EU and says, we pay for half of it.
[00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:29.142]  We pay for half of NATO, you have to pay for it.
[00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.762]  They go, okay, we'll increase our spending.
[00:13:30.762 --> 00:13:31.623]  They already did once.
[00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:33.263]  That's a victory.
[00:13:33.263 --> 00:13:35.344]  Trump goes over and says the EU's our economic foe.
[00:13:35.344 --> 00:13:35.944]  It's true.
[00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:37.524]  He sits in Churchill's chair.
[00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:40.405]  They call him a traitor saying, you didn't beat the Nazis.
[00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:44.006]  Don't sit in his chair when he was invited to sit in the famous chair at the museum.
[00:13:47.142 --> 00:13:49.983]  But it is Trump fighting the EU that was a Nazi project.
[00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:51.663]  It is Trump fighting for sovereignty.
[00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.323]  It is Trump standing up for the nation-state.
[00:13:53.323 --> 00:13:57.964]  So if anybody, he should be sitting in Winston Churchill's chair.
[00:13:57.964 --> 00:14:01.425]  But it shows how they create these false narratives constantly.
[00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:04.905]  So we're gonna go over all of this.
[00:14:04.905 --> 00:14:06.565]  Got a bunch of the clips coming up.
[00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:08.586]  Trump called out Hillary for her server.
[00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.566]  Said this whole thing about Russians is a diversion.
[00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:13.487]  She had an illegal server that a bunch of countries got into.
[00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:14.567]  But here's Putin on
[00:14:15.598 --> 00:14:16.982]  George Soros is involved.
[00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:20.330]  He's the one spending tens of billions per election publicly.
[00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:23.493]  He's the one trying to overthrow Russia?
[00:14:23.493 --> 00:14:24.874]  Here it is.
[00:14:24.874 --> 00:14:28.076]  But this company does not constitute the Russian state.
[00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.258]  It does not represent the Russian state.
[00:14:30.258 --> 00:14:32.840]  And I brought several examples before.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.343]  Well, you have a lot of individuals in the United States.
[00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:42.406]  Take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion capitals.
[00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:47.810]  But does it make him, his position, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.551]  No, it does not.
[00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:50.152]  Well, it's the same case.
[00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:55.855]  There is the instance, the issue of trying a case in the court.
[00:14:55.855 --> 00:15:02.937]  And the final... Notice Putin saying, oh, go ahead and try it in your court, see if my agents were involved.
[00:15:02.937 --> 00:15:12.200]  Because he knows they already filed that fake lawsuit six months ago, saying 13 Russian bots.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.840]  And now the court
[00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:20.596]  has demanded proof and now the Russian companies have shown up and shown the proof that they were actually being paid by Hillary.
[00:15:20.596 --> 00:15:23.799]  And they're like, almost all our orders were for Hillary.
[00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:27.482]  We got Michael Moore to go to an anti-Trump protest.
[00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:28.663]  We're just mercenaries.
[00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:29.804]  We'll take anybody's money.
[00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.545]  What do you mean we're Russian agents?
[00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:33.907]  And the judge is like, I'm going to throw this out.
[00:15:33.907 --> 00:15:42.434]  So Mueller files a new thing on 12 men and women to try to keep the whole ball rolling of fraud.
[00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:42.814]  Stay with us.
[00:15:42.814 --> 00:15:43.355]  We'll be right back.

[00:18:03.793 --> 00:18:05.573]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.573 --> 00:18:17.619]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:22.641]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:26.805]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:32.770]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.875]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:40.498]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.219]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.219 --> 00:18:47.024]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:18:47.244 --> 00:18:52.187]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.187 --> 00:18:54.829]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:59.552]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.863 --> 00:20:13.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.065 --> 00:20:17.085]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:22.266]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:25.627]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[00:20:25.627 --> 00:20:30.048]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:31.388]  I wouldn't support that group.
[00:20:31.388 --> 00:20:31.688]  Would you?
[00:20:33.513 --> 00:20:38.157]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[00:20:38.157 --> 00:20:44.442]  Antifa!
[00:20:44.442 --> 00:20:53.290]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:20:54.534 --> 00:21:04.199]  Okay, coming up, Owen Schroyer is coming in studio with the highlights of the hour and a half long press conference with President Trump and President Putin.
[00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:07.841]  Unbelievably important things were said and done.
[00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:09.221]  I've studied all the facts.
[00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:11.102]  What Putin said is true.
[00:21:11.102 --> 00:21:16.185]  From the best research we've got, that Hillary had $3 billion, Trump had $500 million.
[00:21:18.561 --> 00:21:20.722]  Trump bought almost no bots.
[00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:28.668]  Some private companies bought bots, and there's a bunch of companies in Russia that you can buy bots for, and congressional studies have shown right at 80%.
[00:21:28.668 --> 00:21:33.251]  Funny, Hillary had 80% of the money and 80% of the bots.
[00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:34.412]  Just surprise, surprise.
[00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:37.954]  That's how math works.
[00:21:37.954 --> 00:21:40.856]  And then it came out that it was for Hillary.
[00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:46.060]  And that's why the Russian companies have gladly shown up in court and said, here's our files, here's who paid us.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.420]  DNC.
[00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:50.018]  George Soros.
[00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:57.063]  Soros spends billions a year of his own money in Russia running anti-Putin, anti-Russia operations.
[00:21:57.063 --> 00:22:11.633]  He bragged on TV that he gave a billion to the five billion that the State Department, we have the State Department head at the time saying they did it, on C-SPAN, sent six billion dollars to overthrow Ukraine, an elected government.
[00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:14.475]  Putin did not invade the Ukraine.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.702]  Eastern Ukraine has always been part of Russia.
[00:22:19.702 --> 00:22:22.423]  It's where it was founded.
[00:22:22.423 --> 00:22:28.146]  Like, like, like, like New York and Pennsylvania.
[00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:30.087]  That's where Russia was founded.
[00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:34.809]  In an encyclopedia it says that.
[00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:36.930]  Go to the history of Russia.
[00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.812]  The founding of Russia.
[00:22:39.812 --> 00:22:45.155]  In any encyclopedia it'll tell you.
[00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:45.695]  That it was
[00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:50.808]  Founded in Crimea and Russia's had eight major wars over it.
[00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:53.369]  The last time Hitler took it from them.
[00:22:53.369 --> 00:23:01.494]  And so they never got all of Ukraine back because, yes, Western Ukraine was Catholic and more aligned with the Germans and the Poles.
[00:23:01.494 --> 00:23:04.595]  And did the Russians abuse Western Ukraine a lot?
[00:23:04.595 --> 00:23:07.057]  You bet your bottom dollar the Tsars did.
[00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:12.500]  And you bet your bottom dollar at the same time.
[00:23:14.016 --> 00:23:15.016]  So did the Communists.
[00:23:15.016 --> 00:23:16.817]  The Russians did horrible things to the Ukrainians.
[00:23:16.817 --> 00:23:18.758]  That's not debated even by the Russians.
[00:23:18.758 --> 00:23:22.000]  But that's a whole other world back then, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.442]  And they think people are so stupid.
[00:23:26.442 --> 00:23:26.862]  Now, let me see.
[00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:28.903]  Yeah, there's Associated Press.
[00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:35.986]  George Soros, the puppet master behind the new Ukrainian regime.
[00:23:37.113 --> 00:23:38.074]  Unbelievable.
[00:23:38.074 --> 00:23:44.178]  So, Putin brought that up, but I'm going to shift gears now and get back into that in the next segment and all this other incredible world news.
[00:23:44.178 --> 00:24:04.574]  A couple big tidbits here, because I don't have time to toot my horn, but if you list in the thousands of articles I've seen the last week saying ban InfoWars, ban Alex Jones from the internet, USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, they use the example of Alex Jones says Anthony Bourdain was murdered and that's fake news.
[00:24:06.323 --> 00:24:10.124]  And Alex Jones says that there would be a giant civil war on July 4th.
[00:24:10.124 --> 00:24:12.485]  Now, I said the Democrats are calling for a civil war.
[00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:16.686]  Professors and USA Today say we're in one.
[00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:21.328]  And I see this as the mark of when they're going to intensify their attacks and their behavior, which has happened.
[00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:25.249]  So they misrepresent it.
[00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:26.570]  Let's get back to this real quick.
[00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.530]  I'm going to play more of this later.
[00:24:28.902 --> 00:24:52.527]  There were thousands of articles saying how dare Alex Jones say Anthony Bourdain was going to come out and call Bill Clinton a rapist, and say that he hoped that Harvey Weinstein would die, deserve the death penalty, and that he was aware of giant sex trafficking going on because his fiancée, the word is they're basically married, his Italian fiancée,
[00:24:54.161 --> 00:25:10.853]  At least when she was there with him on the set, that's what they were calling her, that she was aware, because her dad's a famous director, who reportedly was involved in some of this, and that because he learned about all this, he was going to go public and was doing interviews with Elon Musk and others.
[00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:15.476]  Word for word!
[00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:22.281]  It's all in the Daily Mail today, in a nine-page article.
[00:25:24.215 --> 00:25:25.255]  The girlfriend.
[00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:26.656]  How she was abused.
[00:25:26.656 --> 00:25:27.536]  Sex cults.
[00:25:27.536 --> 00:25:29.177]  Harvey Weinstein needs to die.
[00:25:29.177 --> 00:25:30.537]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:25:30.537 --> 00:25:33.138]  Word for word.
[00:25:33.138 --> 00:25:34.539]  Please pull up YouTube.
[00:25:34.539 --> 00:25:36.780]  Just type in Alex Jones, Anthony Bourdain.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.040]  Please?
[00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.228]  And you will get the videos.
[00:25:40.228 --> 00:25:43.529]  And again, showing how we don't toot our own horn, which is a problem.
[00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:50.670]  I got up this morning, saw that InfoWars had the headline, oh, the Daily Mail's breaking, that he was about to do a Kanye West.
[00:25:50.670 --> 00:26:05.833]  Our own people, who I love to death, think so, let's just say, calmly about ourselves, we're so shy, that none of us would even say I was right.
[00:26:05.833 --> 00:26:06.693]  Here's the video.
[00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:14.014]  Learn what Anthony Bourdain was planning to say before he died.
[00:26:14.014 --> 00:26:24.039]  And then you watch the 34-minute live video I did, and I say everything you just read in the Daily Mail.
[00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:27.161]  Word for word!
[00:26:27.161 --> 00:26:33.204]  He gave an interview that has been unpublished in February.
[00:26:33.204 --> 00:26:37.627]  He was then interviewed by multiple filmmaking crews
[00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:45.058]  In March and April, he owned his own production company.
[00:26:45.058 --> 00:26:51.182]  And he got more informed as the months went on and the whole Kanye West thing happened.
[00:26:51.182 --> 00:26:59.466]  And he went from hating Trump to being neutral on Trump and then suddenly became pro-Trump and they killed him within 24 hours.
[00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:08.990]  I've talked to the people that were in the meetings.
[00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.430]  And you notice, I warned Sia at the time.
[00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.291]  I said, you come out and say I'm a liar.
[00:27:12.291 --> 00:27:13.571]  The rest of the media will.
[00:27:13.571 --> 00:27:23.154]  We've got access to the Elon Musk-bordained tape.
[00:27:23.154 --> 00:27:25.395]  And I told everybody, this is the type of stuff that gets you killed.
[00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:30.743]  Yeah, show his fiancée, show her.
[00:27:30.743 --> 00:27:33.444]  She's in the Daily Mail article, which I list everything.
[00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:35.224]  And how did I know all this word for word?
[00:27:35.224 --> 00:27:45.108]  Because I had one source, then I contacted another source, and I know other individuals that were good friends with Bourdain, and they said, yeah, he's been really freaked out.
[00:27:45.108 --> 00:27:49.689]  He's learned all about the Illuminati, all about the sex traffic, all about the little kids being grabbed.
[00:27:49.689 --> 00:27:54.991]  He's learned it all from his fiancée, whose dad's a famous director in Europe.
[00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:58.150]  And she reportedly was abused.
[00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.651]  We won't get into by who, but I was told all of it.
[00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:08.435]  And then word for word, exactly what I tell you comes out, and I'm the bad guy.
[00:28:08.435 --> 00:28:09.835]  My old friend Joe Rogan.
[00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:12.016]  Alex is full of crap on this.
[00:28:12.016 --> 00:28:14.077]  You know, thousands of publications.
[00:28:14.077 --> 00:28:15.438]  No, I'm not full of crap.
[00:28:15.438 --> 00:28:20.380]  I told the truth again because it's my job to tell the truth, and I'm going to keep on doing it.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.682]  But that's why we need your support, why we need your prayers, and when I come back,
[00:28:25.148 --> 00:28:31.390]  We have detailed in a key report at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and listen to me, this isn't hype.
[00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.530]  Nothing I do is hype.
[00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.751]  It's reality.
[00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:36.572]  We have a system to defeat their entire internet takeover.
[00:28:36.572 --> 00:28:38.753]  If we don't get this done, they may win.
[00:28:38.753 --> 00:28:39.653]  We'll be back.
[00:28:39.653 --> 00:28:41.113]  Please spread the word about the live feed.
[00:28:41.113 --> 00:28:42.374]  Tell everyone right now.
[00:28:42.374 --> 00:28:42.914]  You're our only hope.
[00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:47.617]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:47.617 --> 00:28:49.340]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.667]  A key piece of information will start at the beginning of the next segment.
[00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:55.550]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.532]  That's your news today.
[00:28:59.235 --> 00:29:04.002]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon Living Water Bottle.
[00:29:04.002 --> 00:29:08.368]  It creates alkaline water on the go while reducing plastic waste and saving you money.
[00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:16.319]  Made with surgical grade stainless steel, the Dillon Bottle increases the pH up to 9 to deliver both alkaline and antioxidant water anywhere you want it.
[00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:19.903]  Alkaline water is healthier, tastes better, and can even boost energy.
[00:29:19.903 --> 00:29:24.608]  The Dillon Bottle makes it easy and affordable to be healthy and achieve optimal hydration.
[00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:27.451]  Get your Dillon Bottle today at DYLN.CO.
[00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:29.294]  That's DYLN.CO.
[00:29:29.294 --> 00:29:30.715]  You have been lied to.
[00:29:31.516 --> 00:29:33.237]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[00:29:33.237 --> 00:29:35.938]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.938 --> 00:29:41.260]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.943]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:50.384]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.384 --> 00:29:53.506]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.
[00:29:53.506 --> 00:29:57.668]  Get them right now at KillingUncleSamBook.com KillingUncleSamBook.com
[00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:07.934]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:30:07.934 --> 00:30:08.415]  It's you!
[00:30:09.522 --> 00:30:12.004]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:12.004 --> 00:30:13.385]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:16.308]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.140]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:02.649]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:31:02.649 --> 00:31:04.810]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.731]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:20.235]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:31:20.235 --> 00:31:29.338]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:35.623]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:41.048]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:31:41.048 --> 00:31:43.330]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.331]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:31:46.172 --> 00:31:46.913]  Living in Volcano.
[00:32:01.463 --> 00:32:04.106]  May sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:07.389]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:10.212]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater.
[00:32:10.212 --> 00:32:13.656]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:16.438]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:20.984]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.984 --> 00:32:27.472]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.472 --> 00:32:32.437]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:37.097]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.097 --> 00:32:44.301]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:49.004]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.004 --> 00:32:55.208]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:59.191]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.304 --> 00:33:16.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.307 --> 00:33:21.188]  Imagine... A time traveler came and warned you.
[00:33:21.188 --> 00:33:22.448]  Everything he said was proven right.
[00:33:22.448 --> 00:33:25.628]  Live from the Infowars.com studios... Then would you listen?
[00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:28.249]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.999 --> 00:33:43.004]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:33:43.004 --> 00:33:56.091]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:33:57.572 --> 00:34:01.355]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:05.699]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:34:05.699 --> 00:34:07.801]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:34:10.475 --> 00:34:26.812]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[00:34:26.812 --> 00:34:27.893]  InfoWars.
[00:34:27.893 --> 00:34:29.095]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:34:29.095 --> 00:34:31.998]  Today.
[00:34:31.998 --> 00:34:33.199]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:35.959 --> 00:34:39.482]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, Owen Schroyer is going to be in studio.
[00:34:39.482 --> 00:34:43.825]  Then, next hour, Mike Adams is going to be joining us.
[00:34:43.825 --> 00:34:54.454]  What we have put together, what I'm about to announce, will defeat the attempt to end the First Amendment here in the United States and to roll back free speech in Europe and across the world.
[00:34:56.348 --> 00:35:15.633]  You accept this mission, just like we've already changed the world together, as listeners and viewers, as the folks that have gotten around the censors, gotten around the algorithms, to find InfoWars.com forward slash show, to find InfoWars.com forward slash app, to find InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:35:15.633 --> 00:35:19.935]  If you accept this mission, 100% we will beat them.
[00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:25.700]  That's not bragging, that's fact.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:39.750]  Now, my horror is that this will just be more chatter out there and it won't penetrate through to all your minds.
[00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:50.798]  Because I need every one of you, no matter how old you are, what color you are, or where you're from, to get this report for free at InfoWars.com, at NaturalNews.com, at NewsWars.com, and to get it out.
[00:35:53.001 --> 00:35:55.043]  Because, let me explain something.
[00:35:55.043 --> 00:36:09.853]  No one has written a report detailing the blueprint and the admission of the big tech companies, the EU, the Democratic Party, Hollywood, and their admitted plan with News Corp.
[00:36:09.853 --> 00:36:10.494]  News Corp.
[00:36:10.494 --> 00:36:13.096]  was in the Wall Street Journal five months ago, remember?
[00:36:13.096 --> 00:36:17.899]  And they are the only other people to actually blueprint it.
[00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:20.061]  And they said, we're going to start by banning WikiLeaks,
[00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:33.243]  And Alex Jones, when we're done, we're going to ban everybody off the web and control everything and only let you see messages we want you to see from a few dozen companies.
[00:36:33.243 --> 00:36:36.046]  They said maybe a hundred sources.
[00:36:36.046 --> 00:36:37.267]  And they're doing it.
[00:36:37.267 --> 00:36:38.549]  And it's here.
[00:36:38.549 --> 00:36:41.993]  They've gone from 30-40% of conservative posts being censored
[00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:47.446]  Just automatically during the campaign to 90% now.
[00:36:47.446 --> 00:36:52.594]  Facebook came out last week and admitted the exact number I've given you of 80% because we can see the algorithm.
[00:36:52.594 --> 00:36:55.800]  We have access to the Facebook login, to the Google login.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.841]  We can see it in live time.
[00:36:58.564 --> 00:37:04.790]  Two days after Hillary was defeated, our graph went like from straight up to straight down.
[00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.191]  And they admitted they just blocked it.
[00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:07.673]  We have to go to the page to find it.
[00:37:07.673 --> 00:37:16.080]  And now they're all in the news calling for us to totally be banned from the web, from any other platform, and admitting that they've already been strangling us.
[00:37:17.008 --> 00:37:18.469]  But that's all in this report.
[00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:19.730]  Now imagine you're the president.
[00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.930]  Imagine you're Congress.
[00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.891]  You're busy.
[00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:24.132]  There's a hearing about internet censorship of conservatives.
[00:37:24.132 --> 00:37:25.433]  Diamonds and silk come in.
[00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:26.774]  Diamond and silk.
[00:37:26.774 --> 00:37:28.615]  They get yelled at the whole time of the Democrats.
[00:37:28.615 --> 00:37:29.556]  Nothing happens.
[00:37:29.556 --> 00:37:30.777]  The Republicans seem ignorant.
[00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:32.157]  They don't know what's going on.
[00:37:32.157 --> 00:37:39.122]  This is how Republican congressmen and women who try to put their own campaign announcements on Facebook or Twitter get banned.
[00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.611]  The Democrats are allowed to.
[00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:47.534]  This is how Facebook and Twitter are already dialing back the President and admitting that they shadow banned the President.
[00:37:47.534 --> 00:37:51.416]  So you have to be on his page to get his Twitter alerts.
[00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:53.837]  I point that out, everybody goes, yeah, I don't get him.
[00:37:53.837 --> 00:37:55.678]  I've got to go to his site.
[00:37:55.678 --> 00:37:57.399]  I've got to go to his page.
[00:37:57.399 --> 00:38:00.201]  It's the company brags they're doing it.
[00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:04.623]  They said six months ago in a statement, don't worry about us banning him.
[00:38:04.623 --> 00:38:05.604]  We already block him.
[00:38:07.697 --> 00:38:16.922]  And I talked to high-level people in the campaign, you name it, they're not even aware of this, so they say, listen, give us a report.
[00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:23.366]  I talked to people at the Capitol, and they said, Alex, we're aware of a lot of this.
[00:38:23.366 --> 00:38:27.247]  Give us the report, because thinking people know we're light years ahead.
[00:38:27.247 --> 00:38:35.351]  The media tries to ridicule Infowars and say we're fake news and misrepresent what we say all day, because they tune in and go, my God, this guy's got the blueprint to the Death Star.
[00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:36.992]  Take him out now!
[00:38:36.992 --> 00:38:43.574]  Good Lord, if people pay attention to this, we're done!
[00:38:43.574 --> 00:38:46.896]  So, I started asking Paul Watson last week,
[00:38:49.437 --> 00:38:57.679]  I said they want a big email list of all the news articles and all the quotes and statements and how they're shadow banning and how they're doing it and what we think we should do to counter them.
[00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:02.260]  I'm like, antitrust investigations will get them to stop doing it real quick.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.041]  That right there will make them back off.
[00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.561]  But they need to be busted up.
[00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:06.902]  We need to expose the racketeering.
[00:39:06.902 --> 00:39:14.064]  We need to expose how Google, Facebook, Twitter bragged that we're owned by the Democrats and we're delivering all the votes to Hillary and no one can stop us.
[00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:17.465]  That was in the news during the campaign.
[00:39:17.465 --> 00:39:18.645]  So you talk about collusion.
[00:39:20.302 --> 00:39:24.205]  What about big tech collusion, just like mainstream media against Trump?
[00:39:24.205 --> 00:39:36.936]  So that's all in a 50-plus page PDF that's on Infowars.com, linked in the article's emergency report, the censorship master plan decoded.
[00:39:36.936 --> 00:39:42.040]  It's linked in the article on Infowars.com.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.304]  There's also a Paul Watson report that's an excellent boil-down of the report for people that don't want to read.
[00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:50.818]  50-something pages with all the exhibits.
[00:39:50.818 --> 00:40:05.691]  Now, Mike started writing this last Wednesday, and he's an engineer, best-selling author, all-around scientist, very successful, as everyone knows, and Mike did an excellent job putting the report out, working with Paul and myself.
[00:40:05.691 --> 00:40:09.454]  But it was a collaborative effort, but I would say 80% of the work goes to Mike.
[00:40:09.454 --> 00:40:10.895]  But this isn't about credit.
[00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:12.737]  It's about defeating these monsters.
[00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:18.494]  So we have Paul's Boil Down Report, that's six pages.
[00:40:18.494 --> 00:40:27.343]  We have Mike's that is 60 plus pages.
[00:40:27.343 --> 00:40:30.706]  All right there for you on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:30.706 --> 00:40:32.108]  You're like, well, I already know about all this.
[00:40:32.108 --> 00:40:33.189]  I mean, I've already been banned.
[00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:34.050]  I've already experienced it.
[00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.712]  If you're a listener, you've already seen it happen to yourself.
[00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.792]  He sent out a 4th of July thing saying, God bless America, and you get, you know, banned for two days.
[00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:43.993]  You've seen the Veritas videos behind the scenes where they brag about all this.
[00:40:43.993 --> 00:40:44.933]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:44.933 --> 00:40:47.374]  Congress doesn't understand it.
[00:40:47.374 --> 00:40:52.736]  Half of them are like that famous senator from, what, Rogers?
[00:40:52.736 --> 00:40:53.557]  Richards was his name?
[00:40:53.557 --> 00:40:54.237]  He's dead now.
[00:40:54.237 --> 00:40:56.758]  He thought the internet was tubes.
[00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:58.959]  Or, you know, Governor Perry talks about his tweeters.
[00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.453]  They don't understand this.
[00:41:01.453 --> 00:41:06.759]  And the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU are admittedly paid off by Soros and the Democrats now.
[00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:07.740]  So they're out of the game.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.202]  They support censorship.
[00:41:09.202 --> 00:41:13.127]  The journalism schools are anti-free speech engines.
[00:41:13.127 --> 00:41:13.548]  All of this.
[00:41:14.966 --> 00:41:17.588]  And so, they're coming for everybody.
[00:41:17.588 --> 00:41:25.233]  Infowars is the sacrificial lamb where they demonize us, they lie about us, and they set the precedent to de-platform us.
[00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:26.774]  Don't let companies publish our books.
[00:41:26.774 --> 00:41:29.856]  Don't let us have venues to have speeches.
[00:41:29.856 --> 00:41:38.642]  This is like China and their social score, where you then get put in an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge coined the term of and warned us in studio two and a half years ago.
[00:41:40.703 --> 00:41:42.464]  So, we're here.
[00:41:42.464 --> 00:41:45.105]  Hillary was going to carry all this out, just like Merkel has in Europe.
[00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:47.687]  But Trump got in, so we've bought some time.
[00:41:47.687 --> 00:41:50.228]  But it doesn't mean we're winning.
[00:41:50.228 --> 00:41:54.730]  We're now in sudden death overtime with these people, and they know it.
[00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:59.092]  And they are everywhere saying, ban us, take us down, and lying about us, and lying about what we said.
[00:41:59.092 --> 00:42:02.974]  So, there is a censorship master plan decoded.
[00:42:02.974 --> 00:42:05.776]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:42:05.776 --> 00:42:07.937]  Everyone needs to get it, retweet it, point it out.
[00:42:10.003 --> 00:42:12.708]  An emergency report to Congress and to the President concerning Big Tech.
[00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:16.455]  The Democrats in the deep states plan to kill the First Amendment in America.
[00:42:16.455 --> 00:42:18.518]  That's also how they're doing it worldwide.
[00:42:18.518 --> 00:42:19.320]  The key report...
[00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:23.479]  I'm the President of the United States!
[00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:23.639]  The U.S.
[00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:24.839]  President is Donald Trump.

[00:47:03.362 --> 00:47:06.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.499 --> 00:47:18.503]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:18.503 --> 00:47:20.005]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:47.641]  Owen Schroyer is here with us for a couple of segments and Mike Adams is going to join us on the confirmed plan to end internet freedom as we know it, the unbelievable arrogant statements about how we're too dumb to understand it, and no one thought to collate it, no one thought to put it together, nobody thought to do it.
[00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:48.802]  We've done it.
[00:47:48.802 --> 00:47:53.745]  Just like nobody thought to try to relaunch Americana against globalism.
[00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:55.606]  But InfoWars did it over the last 20 years.
[00:47:57.237 --> 00:48:01.261]  And the listeners did it, and so we're now winning on that front.
[00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:02.461]  People don't understand.
[00:48:02.461 --> 00:48:04.083]  We're selling victory.
[00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:05.204]  We're selling what works.
[00:48:05.204 --> 00:48:07.806]  We're selling the real McCoy, the Bonifidis.
[00:48:09.292 --> 00:48:10.872]  The bones.
[00:48:10.872 --> 00:48:11.452]  The guts.
[00:48:11.452 --> 00:48:13.233]  The real thing, man.
[00:48:13.233 --> 00:48:15.693]  Not vapor.
[00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.134]  And that's why we win if we take the field.
[00:48:18.134 --> 00:48:19.814]  We don't take the field, we lose.
[00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:21.394]  The report is on Infowars.com.
[00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:25.755]  It is critical, critical, critical, critical, critical, critical, critical.
[00:48:25.755 --> 00:48:26.756]  And read our own report.
[00:48:26.756 --> 00:48:27.836]  Check it for yourself.
[00:48:27.836 --> 00:48:29.036]  Write your own report.
[00:48:29.036 --> 00:48:30.616]  But they're coming for your free speech.
[00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:33.517]  They admit we're the beta test to shut you up.
[00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:44.565]  My God, there's articles out where mainline Christian bands can't have videos on Facebook about everyone coming together and loving each other.
[00:48:44.565 --> 00:48:46.866]  That was banned by Facebook this weekend.
[00:48:46.866 --> 00:48:49.788]  World Net Daily reported, saying it's political.
[00:48:49.788 --> 00:48:52.369]  They don't like Christians!
[00:48:52.369 --> 00:48:59.612]  They've taken Christianity off the Apple and off the Google calendars this year.
[00:49:00.697 --> 00:49:03.238]  They mean business, folks.
[00:49:03.238 --> 00:49:05.459]  They mean business.
[00:49:05.459 --> 00:49:07.160]  They're coming for you.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.721]  So they want to go, oh, I don't want to be censored.
[00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:10.762]  I better comply with the censorship.
[00:49:10.762 --> 00:49:17.925]  And then I watch all these fake conservatives that they bring in, their little darlings with Brian Stelter and, you know, darlings when they go on Bill Maher.
[00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:22.688]  Oh, I'm a big fan, you know, says our anointed leader.
[00:49:23.922 --> 00:49:32.485]  Ben Shapiro and others, when they're just there to control us, they're there to be the last conservatives, the only ones that are allowed to have a voice, and then we all bow down to them.
[00:49:32.485 --> 00:49:40.648]  Oh, you don't get censored, you get force-fed to the front page of YouTube, just like Sacha Baron Cohen, or just like Michael Moore.
[00:49:40.648 --> 00:49:46.150]  It's force-fed, whatever's on the front page, whatever they're making you look at is the enemy.
[00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.531]  Historic times though, Owen Troyer.
[00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:52.793]  Well, I think, considering what you just talked about and the censorship,
[00:49:53.703 --> 00:50:00.765]  You know, it's not necessarily... take what you just said about Christian channels on YouTube being shut down.
[00:50:00.765 --> 00:50:02.745]  Well, you know, you can... Facebook too.
[00:50:02.745 --> 00:50:04.526]  And Facebook and Twitter and everywhere.
[00:50:04.526 --> 00:50:05.006]  You know what it was?
[00:50:05.006 --> 00:50:09.547]  It was a bunch of white, black, and Hispanic people hugging each other saying, we love each other, we're not racist, we love God.
[00:50:09.547 --> 00:50:15.069]  But here's what I think the audience that doubts what's really going on needs to ask themselves.
[00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.469]  Why
[00:50:16.129 --> 00:50:25.874]  Do you see this type of behavior against Christians, whereas if this type of censorship was happening to Muslim individuals, it would be the number one story in the world.
[00:50:25.874 --> 00:50:27.294]  How dare you censor Muslims?
[00:50:27.294 --> 00:50:29.595]  How dare you be anti-Islamic?
[00:50:29.595 --> 00:50:32.917]  So, if you don't think it's going on, fine.
[00:50:32.917 --> 00:50:39.160]  But how do you explain the contrast in the way that Christians are treated on social media?
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.081]  But they admit they are now.
[00:50:41.081 --> 00:50:43.002]  Here's the World Net Daily article.
[00:50:43.002 --> 00:50:44.583]  They called it a political ad.
[00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:46.944]  It was a music video, Zion's Joy.
[00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:47.804]  Pull it up.
[00:50:47.804 --> 00:50:50.966]  And it's a multi-racial group of Christians loving each other.
[00:50:50.966 --> 00:50:53.287]  That's what they don't like, is people coming together.
[00:50:53.287 --> 00:50:55.509]  That's what they hate, is unity.
[00:50:55.509 --> 00:51:01.532]  And you can see that they hate that because they love to stand up for women and minorities.
[00:51:01.532 --> 00:51:06.034]  That is, until those women or minorities have conservative values and they toss you to the curb.
[00:51:06.034 --> 00:51:06.935]  They think they own you.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:15.434]  So I don't think, but here's the problem Alex, people can, you know this, people can see the facts and that's not going to change them.
[00:51:15.434 --> 00:51:16.356]  I can't explain it.
[00:51:16.356 --> 00:51:17.819]  I see the fact, I respond.
[00:51:20.205 --> 00:51:25.750]  Twenty to thirty percent of the sheeple in this country that go out in the streets refuse the facts.
[00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.873]  And they're not going to fight for free speech because they don't see it's under attack.
[00:51:28.873 --> 00:51:33.517]  That's why it's so important for our audience to take this battlefield and to fight for free speech.
[00:51:33.517 --> 00:51:36.059]  Because so many Americans don't see it.
[00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:40.183]  It's the whole, you know, I forget how the saying goes, but, you know, they came for the Jews.
[00:51:40.183 --> 00:51:41.805]  I said nothing because I'm not Jewish.
[00:51:42.185 --> 00:51:43.486]  Why would they want to ban you, Alex?
[00:52:00.922 --> 00:52:03.444]  On Anthony Bourdain came out to be true?
[00:52:03.444 --> 00:52:08.408]  Oh, is that because you were right when you told them that Saudi Arabians were involved in 9-11?
[00:52:08.408 --> 00:52:11.651]  See, they want control over information, Alex.
[00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:13.372]  That's what this really comes down to.
[00:52:13.372 --> 00:52:18.496]  They could care less whether Joe Schmo out there has a Twitter account and can say whatever he wants.
[00:52:18.496 --> 00:52:21.819]  It's about controlling information.
[00:52:21.819 --> 00:52:27.224]  And if Alex Jones doesn't exist, to put the exclusives out there, like Anthony Bourdain's
[00:52:28.064 --> 00:52:41.487]  He said he was afraid of Bill Clinton, but he was still going to go public calling him a rapist, and hoped that Weinstein would die, and that he now was about to go public, and then that was... I know people that were in the interviews a month after he'd really woken up.
[00:52:41.487 --> 00:52:44.867]  See, this interview was from February, just now released.
[00:52:44.867 --> 00:52:47.848]  And isn't this a personification of everything we're dealing with, Alex?
[00:52:47.848 --> 00:52:51.148]  If you don't fight, you're going to die.
[00:52:51.148 --> 00:52:53.529]  And I'm not saying that Anthony Bourdain did or didn't fight, I'm saying...
[00:52:54.469 --> 00:52:55.450]  He's now dead.
[00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:02.198]  He had a fiancee who had been abused and who had been raped by Weinstein.
[00:53:02.198 --> 00:53:07.544]  He had found out from her about her dad, the big director, and about the whole underworld and the sex rituals.
[00:53:07.544 --> 00:53:08.385]  This is public!
[00:53:09.506 --> 00:53:16.692]  I talked to people that were there at the meetings with him out in the countryside of Morocco for two days while they were drinking sangria.
[00:53:16.692 --> 00:53:19.034]  Then I talked to other people and they go, no, that's true.
[00:53:19.034 --> 00:53:21.116]  He was really pissed and about to go public.
[00:53:21.116 --> 00:53:22.397]  He was a real liberal.
[00:53:22.397 --> 00:53:24.258]  He was upset about the wrong things.
[00:53:24.258 --> 00:53:25.780]  And he saw Kanye and everything else.
[00:53:27.173 --> 00:53:29.873]  Even in this interview, he goes to being neutral on Trump from hating him.
[00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.374]  But see, a few months later, he was down, got it.
[00:53:32.374 --> 00:53:35.594]  And they go, we're not letting Anthony Bourdain, the hero to the left, come out against us.
[00:53:35.594 --> 00:53:38.195]  Because he was going to come out, because he wasn't a wimp.
[00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:40.075]  He was going to come out and attack the left.
[00:53:40.075 --> 00:53:41.836]  He was going to attack the establishment.
[00:53:41.836 --> 00:53:43.436]  And they said, we're not, no, no.
[00:53:43.436 --> 00:53:47.797]  If they get this guy, one of our own people, to turn against us, we're done.
[00:53:47.797 --> 00:53:51.777]  And the Clintons looked at the calculation and said, deader than a hammer.
[00:53:51.777 --> 00:53:55.318]  And then you saw thousands of articles say that I was wrong and I was a liar.
[00:53:55.578 --> 00:53:59.881]  You just think I'd go on air and say he owned his own production company.
[00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:13.551]  He owned, starting in February, according to my sources, which now word for word is confirmed, months later, a month plus later, word for word, ladies and gentlemen, word for word, word for word,
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.464]  Then he got progressively more awake, and he owned the final cut.
[00:54:18.464 --> 00:54:22.228]  Just like Eyes Wide Shut with Stanley Kubrick, they cut 24 minutes out of it.
[00:54:22.228 --> 00:54:23.530]  I know it was in 24 minutes.
[00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:24.611]  His daughter told me.
[00:54:24.611 --> 00:54:29.116]  His protégé, the only person in his family he liked, helped direct his last films.
[00:54:29.116 --> 00:54:33.120]  I mean, had I been sworn to secrecy when I was told there, I almost don't even want to know this stuff.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.303]  If I'd have known before I was told, I wouldn't want to know it.
[00:54:35.743 --> 00:54:38.144]  I know about the NASA stuff.
[00:54:38.144 --> 00:54:40.825]  I know about Dr. Strangelove.
[00:54:40.825 --> 00:54:42.426]  I know about Full Metal Jacket.
[00:54:42.426 --> 00:54:44.307]  I know about all of it.
[00:54:44.307 --> 00:54:45.607]  For two days, I was briefed on it.
[00:54:45.607 --> 00:54:46.508]  Let me tell you something.
[00:54:46.508 --> 00:54:49.689]  All hell broke loose after I was given that information.
[00:54:49.689 --> 00:54:59.473]  Let me tell you, even before Trump even showed up on the scene, that's when hell broke loose four and a half years ago against me, was when Vivian Kubrick told me all this stuff about the whole thing.
[00:54:59.473 --> 00:55:00.914]  And it was stuff I already knew.
[00:55:00.914 --> 00:55:02.474]  And that was what was so crazy.
[00:55:02.474 --> 00:55:03.275]  I'm just stopping right there.
[00:55:03.275 --> 00:55:03.955]  We've got to come back.
[00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:08.317]  And Mike Adams is waiting, but we've got to get to these few clips, and I'm sure he'll be fine with it.
[00:55:08.317 --> 00:55:11.539]  He's an awesome guy who joined us via Skype, but I know I'm ranting here, Owen.
[00:55:11.539 --> 00:55:13.120]  It's just people don't understand.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:23.566]  I didn't just get up here and say he was going to come out and say Weinstein's a rapist and rape my fiancé, and Bill Clinton's a rapist, and Jerry Epstein's a rapist, and they use child kidnapping to control people.
[00:55:23.566 --> 00:55:27.128]  I was on the phone with people that had video of it!
[00:55:27.788 --> 00:55:28.949]  They have the video.
[00:55:28.949 --> 00:55:30.951]  You know, CNN kept their fat mouth shut.
[00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:34.775]  Because I told them, I said, CNN, you say I'm a liar on this, I'm going to release it.
[00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:36.857]  They kept their fat mouth shut.
[00:55:36.857 --> 00:55:39.960]  But all their surrogates attacked us and said we were liars.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.682]  So again, we're right again.
[00:55:41.682 --> 00:55:42.843]  It's all in the Daily Mail.
[00:55:42.843 --> 00:55:44.144]  How he was scared of the Clintons.
[00:55:44.144 --> 00:55:46.026]  How they were a bunch of rapists.
[00:55:46.026 --> 00:55:48.468]  And that was in February, this interview.
[00:55:48.468 --> 00:55:50.830]  People were so scared in February, they never published this.
[00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.212]  Because they had to check with Weinstein and people.
[00:55:53.212 --> 00:55:54.573]  We have all their spies in New York.
[00:55:54.573 --> 00:55:55.413]  See, it was okay.
[00:55:55.413 --> 00:55:56.654]  And see what happened?
[00:55:56.654 --> 00:56:04.117]  They got enough pings back down their spiderweb that Bourdain was getting loose from the web that they ran in and went ahead and ate him.
[00:56:04.117 --> 00:56:05.638]  Before his soul got away from him, they think.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:11.102]  Well, and again, where are the apologies to Alex Jones for reporting the facts?
[00:56:11.102 --> 00:56:16.564]  Just for having the chutzpah to come out here and report this, which other people may or may not have known.
[00:56:16.564 --> 00:56:21.866]  The point is that you said it, Alex, and they came out and they attacked you for it, and you got vindicated once again.
[00:56:21.866 --> 00:56:25.468]  So, you know, I know that you don't want apologies.
[00:56:25.468 --> 00:56:28.629]  You do this because this is just getting the truth out there, and that's your mission.
[00:56:29.289 --> 00:56:41.257]  But it's just like, it's gonna happen again, and then Salon will attack, and Media Matters will attack, and David Brock, and they'll all attack you, and it's just like, whoa, you know, a month later it all comes up true, where's the apology?
[00:56:41.257 --> 00:56:46.021]  Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't expect an apology from Salon that endorses pedophilia.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.183]  And notice thousands, thousands came out and attacked me for the Bourdain thing.
[00:56:50.183 --> 00:56:52.366]  Jones claims he was killed by the Clintons.
[00:56:52.366 --> 00:56:58.872]  I said I was told by smart people he was getting ready to go public against them and that he was scared and that he was basically hiding out.
[00:56:58.872 --> 00:57:04.377]  But see, he had this whole crisis of conscience because of his fiancée who told him everything.
[00:57:04.377 --> 00:57:08.702]  I was told by people that were at the meetings about him telling him about rituals and everything.
[00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.502]  She needs to go public!
[00:57:11.502 --> 00:57:12.442]  She's in danger!
[00:57:12.442 --> 00:57:14.103]  His wife put it all on social media.
[00:57:14.103 --> 00:57:15.843]  I mean, she tweets all this stuff out.
[00:57:15.843 --> 00:57:17.984]  She knows what's going on.
[00:57:17.984 --> 00:57:20.505]  Let's come back and get to all the highlights of the Putin-Trump meeting.
[00:57:20.505 --> 00:57:21.285]  We'll come back.
[00:57:21.285 --> 00:57:23.546]  Folks, I didn't even plug to buy our products this hour.
[00:57:23.546 --> 00:57:25.547]  If you don't buy our products, we've got huge sales going right now.
[00:57:25.547 --> 00:57:26.607]  We'll be shut down.
[00:57:26.607 --> 00:57:28.608]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:28.608 --> 00:57:33.309]  If you believe some of the hardcore information, become sponsors of us by buying products that are great for you and your family.
[00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:34.410]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:35.070]  Please spread the word.
[00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:36.671]  Without you, the scissors will win.
[00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:37.191]  With you, they'll win.
[00:57:44.693 --> 00:57:49.696]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:57:49.696 --> 00:57:51.617]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:57:51.617 --> 00:57:53.597]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:57:53.597 --> 00:57:58.060]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:02.422]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance, the globalists.
[00:58:02.422 --> 00:58:07.524]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:58:07.524 --> 00:58:11.266]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:58:12.106 --> 00:58:14.408]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:58:14.408 --> 00:58:16.350]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:19.513]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:26.659]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:28.520]  We have record sales going on right now.
[00:58:29.491 --> 00:58:35.815]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:35.815 --> 00:58:35.995]  It's you!
[00:58:59.847 --> 00:59:02.029]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:10.736]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.736 --> 00:59:15.340]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.802]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.802 --> 00:59:20.325]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:21.005 --> 00:59:32.372]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.372 --> 00:59:40.356]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.356 --> 00:59:47.400]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.142]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[00:59:53.393 --> 01:00:04.007]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.007 --> 01:00:09.013]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.064 --> 01:00:18.989]  All right, Mike Adams is coming up in 15 minutes with a mission that if you choose to accept it.
[01:00:18.989 --> 01:00:21.831]  In fact, when we intro, Mike, we play Mission Impossible.
[01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.133]  I think it's in the computer, the old original one, or maybe the modern one.
[01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:27.416]  But this is a mission very easy to win.
[01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:34.381]  We have them arrogantly bragging that they're censoring conservatives, Christians, and plan a total takeover of the web in the next few months.
[01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:37.024]  And we have a blueprint to stop it, so that's coming up.
[01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:41.807]  But next segment, this is a short segment, we're going to get to the Putin-Trump press conference.
[01:00:42.734 --> 01:00:45.418]  The media freaking out, Brian Stelter, all of it.
[01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:49.323]  But just, you came in at 4am with Rob doing the rest of the crew, you covered it all.
[01:00:49.323 --> 01:00:52.648]  Give people a briefing before we play these clips of what you witnessed.
[01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.871]  Well, I think, first off...
[01:00:55.734 --> 01:01:07.061]  The fact that Putin and Trump were able to finally sit down in private and have the one-on-one meeting, it's really probably immeasurable as to how important that is.
[01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:17.788]  Because Alex, as you know, they, the globalists and the deep state of America, they want their eyes, they want their ears, they want their fingertips, they want their noses all over anything.
[01:01:17.788 --> 01:01:18.729]  So they can misquote it!
[01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.731]  And so that they can manipulate it, too.
[01:01:21.731 --> 01:01:23.332]  Well, they don't control Putin.
[01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:24.212]  That's why they hate him.
[01:01:24.212 --> 01:01:25.673]  Say whatever you want about Putin, it's true.
[01:01:25.673 --> 01:01:27.334]  He's not controlled by the globalists.
[01:01:27.334 --> 01:01:28.315]  And they don't control Trump.
[01:01:28.315 --> 01:01:29.936]  He's not part of their secret society.
[01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.256]  He's not in their sex cults.
[01:01:31.256 --> 01:01:33.458]  So now you have... He's not into having sex with little boys.
[01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:41.523]  Now you have the two most... I mean, you could, I guess, debate this, but in my opinion, the two most powerful men in the world, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin... Who don't like to have sex with kids.
[01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:42.744]  And who aren't in sex cults.
[01:01:43.564 --> 01:01:47.405]  Meeting one-on-one and the globalists have no clue what's going on.
[01:01:47.405 --> 01:01:49.866]  Kissinger has no idea what's going on.
[01:01:49.866 --> 01:01:51.367]  Clinton has no idea what's going on.
[01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:54.048]  Obama has no idea what's going on.
[01:01:54.048 --> 01:01:56.168]  Erdogan has no idea what's going on.
[01:01:56.168 --> 01:01:57.869]  You go down the list, right?
[01:01:57.869 --> 01:02:01.510]  So they're panicked, Alex, because they don't know what they're saying.
[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.852]  They know they're running a PSYOP right now, claiming that Russia's hacking the election.
[01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:06.812]  So what does Putin do?
[01:02:06.812 --> 01:02:08.473]  Putin says, OK, well, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:09.253 --> 01:02:15.595]  Why don't you enlist our ministry, our agencies, and let's dig into this together.
[01:02:15.595 --> 01:02:17.115]  Let's find out who actually hacks them.
[01:02:17.115 --> 01:02:21.836]  So now, and this is just, I mean, there were so many... Now Putin says, we're going to send our people to your court.
[01:02:21.836 --> 01:02:23.517]  They're going to land on planes.
[01:02:23.517 --> 01:02:27.438]  We're going to come and show you that it's Hillary buying bots in Russia.
[01:02:27.438 --> 01:02:37.901]  But you think about it, Alex, and honestly, the whole thing was bombshell, but how can, this is how empty it really is, Robert Mueller, how can he possibly indict
[01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:43.184]  The FBI tried to get in the DNC servers, we're gonna play this clip, 22 times!
[01:02:43.184 --> 01:02:46.926]  They're like, hiding the servers, going, the Russians are in it but you can't look at them!
[01:02:46.926 --> 01:02:49.167]  It'd be like if I said, it'd be like if I said,
[01:03:04.488 --> 01:03:07.010]  My wife ran off into the night, hypothetically, and is missing.
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.071]  Alright, let me see your house.
[01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:09.793]  But then I don't call the cops when it happens.
[01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:11.754]  I just tell them later, oh, she just ran away.
[01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:14.057]  No, your wife runs off crazy in the middle of the night.
[01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:15.077]  You call the police.
[01:03:15.077 --> 01:03:16.999]  It's like, oh, I have the servers, but no.
[01:03:16.999 --> 01:03:18.060]  Yeah, oh, your wife ran off?
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.461]  Alright, we're gonna come investigate your house.
[01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:19.661]  No!
[01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:21.923]  Don't come in my house!
[01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.324]  But she's not here!
[01:03:23.324 --> 01:03:24.845]  But don't come in!
[01:03:24.845 --> 01:03:28.428]  And so they already demanded discovery for the original indictments.
[01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:31.690]  Mueller balked, didn't show up, made some bogus claim, he didn't have enough evidence.
[01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:32.911]  That was just a bot!
[01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:36.294]  And you never indict someone until you have all the evidence, so that's a lie.
[01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:37.314]  So here's what's gonna happen, Alex.
[01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:44.600]  They're gonna show up in court, they're gonna demand discovery, and Mueller's gonna get caught with his tail between his legs, and they're either gonna be forced to turn over the servers,
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.245]  Or they're going to have egg on their face when they're like, well, we're not going to turn over the servers to you.
[01:03:49.245 --> 01:03:49.885]  You want evidence?
[01:03:49.885 --> 01:03:50.586]  Go screw yourself.
[01:03:50.586 --> 01:03:54.010]  Well, that's why they dropped the Roger Stone Trump suit saying they're Russian agents.
[01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:55.551]  OK, we want access to those servers.
[01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:56.773]  It's all made up.
[01:03:56.773 --> 01:04:01.177]  We're Russian agents like we're, again, Martians from Pluto, man.
[01:04:01.177 --> 01:04:02.138]  We're Americans.
[01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:05.182]  Look at the country coming back!
[01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:10.466]  But see, now it's the whole thing, attack Putin, demonize Putin, indict the Russians.
[01:04:10.466 --> 01:04:12.647]  Oh, this vindicates things!
[01:04:12.647 --> 01:04:24.134]  Now that they indicted another fake group of indictments by the crooks that have been caught in their emails and text messages saying, we're going to keep him from getting elected, we're going to kick him out of office, we've got to manufacture stuff, we're frauds!
[01:04:24.134 --> 01:04:26.755]  It's all food of the poison tree!
[01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:28.997]  The whole thing should be dropped!
[01:04:28.997 --> 01:04:30.718]  I mean, listen, if they caught detectives,
[01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:33.419]  In a, in a, in a murder trial.
[01:04:33.419 --> 01:04:37.302]  In emails or text messages saying, we gotta set these people up, we gotta make sure they go to jail.
[01:04:37.302 --> 01:04:38.002]  It's over!
[01:04:38.002 --> 01:04:41.304]  Even if they're guilty, the investigation, the trial's over!
[01:04:41.304 --> 01:04:42.925]  Because it's BS!
[01:04:42.925 --> 01:04:43.785]  You mean like O.J.
[01:04:43.785 --> 01:04:45.266]  Simpson case?
[01:04:45.266 --> 01:04:46.347]  It's exactly what happened.
[01:04:46.347 --> 01:04:48.748]  They manipulated evidence and he got off.
[01:04:48.748 --> 01:04:49.329]  Even though he did it.
[01:04:57.738 --> 01:05:18.250]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.371]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.371 --> 01:05:24.373]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.373 --> 01:05:25.394]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.814 --> 01:05:31.618]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.618 --> 01:05:34.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.443]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:41.945]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:51.131]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.131 --> 01:05:55.574]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:59.536 --> 01:06:13.442]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:13.442 --> 01:06:15.823]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:40.471]  What?
[01:06:46.425 --> 01:06:48.726]  Well, they cut one of our heads off, and we just grow two more.
[01:06:48.726 --> 01:06:59.109]  Because, you see, the globalists think that we're Satanists like them, and that we just want to dominate only according to our own personal gain.
[01:06:59.109 --> 01:07:00.429]  But we're connected to everything.
[01:07:00.429 --> 01:07:04.071]  It's the gain of everybody for justice in the future and fighting evil.
[01:07:04.071 --> 01:07:14.714]  And so we don't mind being demonized or attacked or even sacrificing ourselves, not even from a historic perspective, but from a spiritual perspective, knowing it's those decisions that govern who we are.
[01:07:15.762 --> 01:07:17.924]  Well, and I always like to use sports analogies.
[01:07:17.924 --> 01:07:19.926]  It's like, you know, a ball hog.
[01:07:19.926 --> 01:07:22.789]  Where, okay, maybe you have the best player on the floor, but he's a ball hog.
[01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:23.710]  Nobody else is getting involved.
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.151]  You never win a championship.
[01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:27.213]  So you want to be on the winning team.
[01:07:27.213 --> 01:07:28.134]  That's what this is all about.
[01:07:28.134 --> 01:07:33.480]  It's not about Alex Jones getting all the credit because he was right about Anthony Bourdain or all the other tomorrow's news today.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.264]  It's about we want Americans to be informed so they can make informed decisions.
[01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:39.506]  That's really what this comes down to.
[01:07:40.441 --> 01:07:47.546]  They, on the left, and even in Republicans and historical perspectives, but it's changing now because of Trump, they don't want informed voters.
[01:07:47.546 --> 01:07:48.827]  They don't want you to know what's going on.
[01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:51.609]  They enjoy the total control and thinking of us as a bunch of idiots.
[01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:52.510]  But we're not idiots!
[01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:54.051]  That's why they try to keep the info from us.
[01:07:54.051 --> 01:07:56.713]  And here's the perfect example, because we've got to go to these clips.
[01:07:56.713 --> 01:08:04.058]  They don't want people to know that the DNC and the DCCC have still never turned their servers over.
[01:08:04.058 --> 01:08:07.661]  If anyone is guilty of obstruction of justice, it's the damn Democrats!
[01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.502]  It's an open-shut case!
[01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:14.186]  And I love how they changed the subject from her illegal server that all these countries were accessing.
[01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:17.950]  She was using it as a drop box, like the old spy would put in a trash can or under the bench.
[01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:19.231]  She goes, oh, my server!
[01:08:19.231 --> 01:08:21.252]  I didn't know I put all this classified info on there.
[01:08:21.252 --> 01:08:23.354]  Another five million goes into her bank account.
[01:08:23.354 --> 01:08:23.935]  Yeah, where?
[01:08:23.935 --> 01:08:25.876]  She made three plus billion dollars.
[01:08:25.876 --> 01:08:26.257]  I mean, my...
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:28.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.281]  All these foreign governments are putting money in her bank account?
[01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:33.381]  Oh, it's a foundation!
[01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:37.002]  Russians are hacking while Obama's president.
[01:08:37.002 --> 01:08:38.562]  Not Trump, Obama.
[01:08:38.562 --> 01:08:40.863]  But that narrative doesn't seem to exist, you know?
[01:08:40.863 --> 01:08:46.624]  Well, see, they had to say Trump's the Russian to open the fake investigation and then cover up their illegal spying.
[01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:49.725]  And it's all falling down around them, and they're all betting that you're an idiot.
[01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.546]  The first clip I want to play is Brian Stelter.
[01:08:51.546 --> 01:08:55.767]  Then we'll play the three clips that are most important, and then Mike Adams is coming up.
[01:08:55.767 --> 01:08:56.647]  This is so incredible.
[01:08:56.647 --> 01:08:57.407]  Brian Stelter
[01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:06.357]  Put this out last night saying he's going to be meeting soon, the next few hours, with Putin.
[01:09:06.357 --> 01:09:07.277]  He is a liar.
[01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:08.738]  You can't trust him.
[01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:09.979]  Everything he says is a fraud.
[01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.501]  Actually, you guys say everything he says is a lie.
[01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:16.983]  Trump's only gone sideways on three things he said.
[01:09:16.983 --> 01:09:17.544]  Vaccines.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:28.025]  And the situation in Afghanistan, and then you could argue he's been too strong on Russia.
[01:09:28.025 --> 01:09:31.547]  It's actually incredible how he's crushing them for no reason.
[01:09:31.547 --> 01:09:34.989]  But again, they're not screwing us over like the EU is, but fine.
[01:09:35.549 --> 01:09:36.349]  Whatever.
[01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:38.250]  The point is, he's certainly in our interest.
[01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.471]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:46.614]  And then here's this little anti-American globalist at CNN, known to hate flyover country, known to hate this country, their own admissions.
[01:09:46.614 --> 01:09:50.035]  Listen to this projection where everything he's saying is him.
[01:09:50.035 --> 01:09:50.855]  He's a fraud.
[01:09:50.855 --> 01:09:51.956]  He's dishonorable.
[01:09:51.956 --> 01:09:54.237]  He's this dropping from the New York Times.
[01:09:54.237 --> 01:09:55.857]  Everything he's saying is him.
[01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:58.538]  And it's so disingenuous and so wimpy.
[01:09:58.538 --> 01:09:59.419]  This is just epic.
[01:09:59.419 --> 01:09:59.779]  Here it is.
[01:10:00.828 --> 01:10:06.352]  Putin and Trump plan to meet for a private one-on-one conversation before official talks begin.
[01:10:06.352 --> 01:10:09.494]  No aides, no note-takers.
[01:10:09.494 --> 01:10:12.156]  So we'll never really know what is said.
[01:10:12.156 --> 01:10:13.397]  Pause again.
[01:10:13.397 --> 01:10:19.402]  Going back to Malta and going back to... Presidents always meet with foreign leaders privately.
[01:10:19.402 --> 01:10:21.123]  But again, he thinks you're dumb.
[01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:22.684]  He's stelter, you're dumb.
[01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:23.845]  He doesn't know.
[01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:25.146]  He thinks you don't know this is standard.
[01:10:25.146 --> 01:10:25.486]  Continue.
[01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:32.616]  Because, really, can we trust either man?
[01:10:32.616 --> 01:10:33.736]  No.
[01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:35.658]  We can't.
[01:10:35.658 --> 01:10:37.339]  In the past, the U.S.
[01:10:37.339 --> 01:10:42.322]  President's words have projected power and shaped global decisions.
[01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:45.705]  Trump is seen all over the world as one of the most powerful presidents ever.
[01:10:45.705 --> 01:10:46.565]  Everyone's in awe.
[01:10:46.565 --> 01:10:49.227]  Everything he's doing has been successful so far.
[01:10:49.227 --> 01:10:51.288]  But again, oh, we don't have power anymore.
[01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:51.929]  We're a joke.
[01:10:51.929 --> 01:10:53.110]  The economy's coming back.
[01:10:54.110 --> 01:11:00.614]  Uh, all the positivity, people believe in the future, but again, stelters demoralizing you like Tokyo Rose.
[01:11:00.614 --> 01:11:05.537]  Oh, as we're about to invade the Japanese homeland, 1945, you've lost.
[01:11:05.537 --> 01:11:06.617]  America's been conquered.
[01:11:06.617 --> 01:11:08.518]  Everybody, it's like Baghdad Bob.
[01:11:08.518 --> 01:11:09.819]  This guy's like Baghdad Bob.
[01:11:09.819 --> 01:11:10.860]  Continue.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.921]  What the president said meant something.
[01:11:12.921 --> 01:11:14.702]  It meant a lot.
[01:11:14.702 --> 01:11:15.702]  But not now.
[01:11:15.702 --> 01:11:16.283]  Not anymore.
[01:11:17.284 --> 01:11:27.852]  What President Trump says is so frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power, the same impact as past presidents.
[01:11:27.852 --> 01:11:28.433]  It's a shame.
[01:11:31.155 --> 01:11:32.636]  The president doesn't have power.
[01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:34.838]  His words don't have power anymore.
[01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:36.439]  We don't have any power.
[01:11:36.439 --> 01:11:39.061]  No, you don't have any power anymore, CNN!
[01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.622]  It's all what you are!
[01:11:40.622 --> 01:11:42.404]  This is an incredible one minute.
[01:11:42.404 --> 01:11:43.284]  Continue.
[01:11:43.284 --> 01:11:44.285]  Just look at that.
[01:11:44.285 --> 01:11:52.231]  So frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power, the same impact as past presidents.
[01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:54.293]  But this big failure is defeating you.
[01:11:54.293 --> 01:11:54.613]  Continue.
[01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:59.000]  It's a shame, but it's true.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.401]  It's a shame, but it's true.
[01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:06.845]  Just because you say a pile of dog crap is Dutch chocolate ice cream doesn't make it so.
[01:12:06.845 --> 01:12:09.808]  You know, I mean, would you let Brian Stelter babysit your kids?
[01:12:09.808 --> 01:12:10.528]  Just look at that face.
[01:12:10.528 --> 01:12:11.629]  Let's continue.
[01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:13.830]  Trump simply cannot be trusted.
[01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.412]  He has proven this himself time and time again.
[01:12:16.412 --> 01:12:20.095]  It's his own lies and his own contradictions that have proven it.
[01:12:20.095 --> 01:12:24.498]  And that is why this is a profound test for journalists.
[01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.583]  A profound test.
[01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:29.064]  Will you really attack him more?
[01:12:29.064 --> 01:12:30.965]  He's up there buggy whipping like he's the boss.
[01:12:30.965 --> 01:12:31.926]  Ban InfoWars.
[01:12:31.926 --> 01:12:33.267]  InfoWars is a disease.
[01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:36.990]  Take Jones off the air so he can't respond so I can lie about him and he can't respond to me.
[01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:39.191]  This is the cult of this little son of a bitch.
[01:12:39.191 --> 01:12:43.954]  Well, it's perfect that he actually looks and acts like George Costanza.
[01:12:43.954 --> 01:12:46.436]  You know, Costanza, kind of a cheapskate.
[01:12:46.476 --> 01:12:47.776]  But he's a lovable guy.
[01:12:47.776 --> 01:12:51.638]  Don't compare George Costanza to this poster boy.
[01:12:51.638 --> 01:12:52.798]  The point is he's a joker.
[01:12:52.798 --> 01:12:53.438]  He's a con man.
[01:12:53.438 --> 01:12:54.018]  You can't trust him.
[01:12:54.018 --> 01:12:57.319]  That's the spokesman for lock up your kids, man.
[01:12:57.319 --> 01:12:58.600]  Pennywise, Stelter.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.340]  But you know what, Alex?
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:12:59.780]  Here's the thing.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.221]  You'll float too, yeah.
[01:13:01.221 --> 01:13:02.001]  He's floating alright.
[01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:02.641]  Here's the thing.
[01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:07.643]  I would love to wind up and punch Brian Stelter right in the face, but here's the problem.
[01:13:08.499 --> 01:13:10.360]  He's not even there.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.641]  He's not really there.
[01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:13.322]  He's an aberration.
[01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:16.223]  Let's be clear, we don't wish any harm on him.
[01:13:16.223 --> 01:13:20.546]  Democrats shooting members of Congress and breaking Ron Paul's ribs and calling for violence.
[01:13:20.546 --> 01:13:22.347]  We're peaceful.
[01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:25.729]  No, I'm just saying, he's not... See, that's what it is.
[01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:27.430]  We won't know what Trump and Putin said.
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:29.091]  Doesn't he look like the subway spokesperson?
[01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:31.818]  Don't?
[01:13:31.818 --> 01:13:33.199]  I think he looks more like Pennywise.
[01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:34.580]  George Costanza is a great comedian.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:35.360]  Don't compare him to George.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.801]  Jason Alexander is a great comedian.
[01:13:36.801 --> 01:13:38.162]  We love George Costanza.
[01:13:38.162 --> 01:13:39.343]  Put him next to Pennywise.
[01:13:39.343 --> 01:13:41.124]  But he said it all in the opening.
[01:13:41.124 --> 01:13:44.246]  He says, we're not going to know what Trump and Putin say.
[01:13:44.246 --> 01:13:45.687]  Oh my gosh, Brian.
[01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:52.412]  You mean you're going to be crapping your little adult diaper because Trump and Putin might be conspiring to make the world a better place?
[01:13:52.412 --> 01:13:55.434]  Oh no, Stelter, what will you do?
[01:13:55.434 --> 01:13:56.174]  He's an aberration.
[01:13:56.174 --> 01:13:57.555]  He's fake.
[01:13:57.555 --> 01:13:59.016]  Look, it really is true.
[01:13:59.016 --> 01:14:00.397]  Brian Stelter lost some weight right there.
[01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:04.762]  Oh my gosh, that's actually Jared from Subway.
[01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:06.924]  I thought that was Brian Stelter.
[01:14:06.924 --> 01:14:08.184]  They must be separated.
[01:14:08.184 --> 01:14:11.666]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying Brian Stelter's a pedophile.
[01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:16.309]  I don't think, I just think he looks like... I'm just saying he flirts with the rest of them.
[01:14:16.309 --> 01:14:18.390]  I'm just saying he scares the hell out of me.
[01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:20.031]  He's one scary looking dick, man.
[01:14:20.031 --> 01:14:22.152]  Well, anybody who's willing to go on television... He's got the look!
[01:14:22.152 --> 01:14:22.993]  He's got the look!
[01:14:22.993 --> 01:14:24.794]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's got the look!
[01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:28.792]  Anybody who's willing to go on... Woah!
[01:14:28.792 --> 01:14:30.072]  Woah!
[01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:33.313]  That's Hillary Clinton's daughter.
[01:14:33.313 --> 01:14:34.574]  Her beard.
[01:14:34.574 --> 01:14:35.734]  Mr. Ed!
[01:14:35.734 --> 01:14:36.975]  That is Webster Hubble's daughter.
[01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:40.516]  Hello Wilbur.
[01:14:40.516 --> 01:14:42.316]  Hello Wilbur.
[01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:44.117]  A horse is a horse, of course, of course.
[01:14:44.117 --> 01:14:47.098]  That is, of course, unless the horse is a famous Mr. Ed.
[01:14:48.294 --> 01:14:49.395]  So what is it?
[01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:51.698]  We haven't gotten to these big historic clips yet.
[01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:07.998]  Heard like that in the game.
[01:15:07.998 --> 01:15:09.280]  Like I'm saying, I'm not calling for balance.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.643]  I'm just saying, if you swing at Stelter, you miss.
[01:15:11.643 --> 01:15:12.824]  There's nothing there.
[01:15:12.824 --> 01:15:14.466]  It's like swinging at CNN.
[01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:14.867]  They're dead.
[01:15:14.867 --> 01:15:17.069]  It's like Slimer from Ghostbusters.
[01:15:17.069 --> 01:15:17.490]  Exactly!
[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.551]  They're not actually there.
[01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:20.073]  They're just an aberration.
[01:15:20.073 --> 01:15:23.037]  They're just projecting themselves out there to be real.
[01:15:23.037 --> 01:15:24.018]  Jackie G's the rat.
[01:15:24.018 --> 01:15:25.380]  We knew that show would get cancelled.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:25.940]  And he's gone.
[01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:29.182]  Bye-bye, Chuck E. Cheese the rat.
[01:15:29.182 --> 01:15:30.782]  Here's the deal, Mike Adams is coming up.
[01:15:30.782 --> 01:15:33.523]  I know you've been doing so many hours of your own show coming today.
[01:15:33.523 --> 01:15:36.144]  How about you, we've got to get to these clips.
[01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:38.444]  So why don't you come back in the last segment of this hour with Mike Adams.
[01:15:38.444 --> 01:15:48.307]  Every day there's two segments in the report and we'll get to these epic clips of Putin and Trump and the Alwan brothers and the server and Hillary server and Soros involved in the elections.
[01:15:48.307 --> 01:15:49.867]  Come on, can you come back?
[01:15:49.867 --> 01:15:51.388]  I'll be back, baby!
[01:15:51.388 --> 01:15:52.508]  For America!
[01:15:52.508 --> 01:15:52.888]  Yeah!
[01:15:57.327 --> 01:16:01.210]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:06.194]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:11.018]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[01:18:11.499 --> 01:18:16.200]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.482]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.

[01:19:54.601 --> 01:19:56.162]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:35.319 --> 01:20:43.346]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:20:43.346 --> 01:20:49.310]  That's, of course, a famous line.
[01:20:54.335 --> 01:20:58.477]  Off of the documented words of Julius Caesar.
[01:20:58.477 --> 01:21:02.918]  Well, our fortune is freedom and productivity in our time.
[01:21:02.918 --> 01:21:04.999]  And this is not a mission impossible.
[01:21:04.999 --> 01:21:12.762]  It is a mission objective that is 100% absolutely in our grasp.
[01:21:12.762 --> 01:21:13.122]  But you...
[01:21:14.773 --> 01:21:34.134]  No matter what color you are, or what gender you are, or where you came from, if you believe in internet freedom, and that means access to the marketplace of ideas, commerce, you name it, if you're against the communist Chinese plan of a global social score, now being adopted by Apple and others, for total control of everything you do in your life, well then this mission is for you if you should choose to accept it.
[01:21:35.219 --> 01:21:36.420]  Mike Adams is on fire.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:42.864]  Paul Watson wrote a six-page boil-down report that also links to his report that's on InfoWars.com.
[01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:50.749]  But the 50-plus page report, the censorship master plan decoded, is from the enemy's own arrogant statements.
[01:21:50.749 --> 01:21:58.334]  But no one had collated this together or produced a battle plan, just like Congress doesn't read the bills.
[01:21:58.334 --> 01:22:04.258]  If folks read the articles on InfoWars.com and retweet them and Facebook them and hand-share them,
[01:22:05.307 --> 01:22:08.092]  And get them to Congress for the hearings they're having tomorrow.
[01:22:08.092 --> 01:22:13.300]  This will change the world because no one did this.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.822]  People said, well, why didn't we have airplanes earlier?
[01:22:14.822 --> 01:22:17.086]  Well, the Wright Brothers didn't come along.
[01:22:17.086 --> 01:22:18.288]  Why didn't we have radio earlier?
[01:22:18.288 --> 01:22:19.429]  Well, Marconi didn't come along.
[01:22:20.287 --> 01:22:23.029]  This is their own arrogant admissions.
[01:22:23.029 --> 01:22:24.370]  They think we're stupid.
[01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:29.673]  They've bought off the so-called free speech watchdogs, ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:22:29.673 --> 01:22:36.037]  So we're having to do it, and Mike Adams, an engineer, software designer, best-selling author, he knows what's going on.
[01:22:36.037 --> 01:22:36.918]  He writes all these great articles.
[01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:38.319]  I said, why don't you?
[01:22:39.099 --> 01:22:44.181]  Put together the whole decode of this, of what's happening and how to strike back against it.
[01:22:44.181 --> 01:22:46.862]  So, a lot of big news, obviously.
[01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:51.264]  John Brennan is a total traitor to this country, converted to Wahhabism and caught lying to Congress.
[01:22:51.264 --> 01:22:59.128]  Says Trump press conference an impeachable offense, treasonous to even meet with the Russians and talk about working together, even though Trump's squeezing Russia.
[01:22:59.128 --> 01:22:59.688]  Incredible.
[01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:00.728]  That's all coming up.
[01:23:00.728 --> 01:23:01.649]  We've got highlights of it.
[01:23:02.569 --> 01:23:05.073]  The Awan Brothers, it's all coming out, Hillary Server.
[01:23:05.073 --> 01:23:10.660]  But right now, emergency report, the censorship master plan, emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed.
[01:23:12.599 --> 01:23:25.886]  We all know as libertarians, as nationalists, as conservatives, as natural health advocates, or real anti-war liberals, we all know free thinkers, organizations, groups the globalists don't like that challenge their system.
[01:23:25.886 --> 01:23:31.229]  We all know, of all the diverse groups out there, that we've been censored, we've been blocked, and it's gotten exponentially worse.
[01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:37.953]  Well now they've come out and jumped the shark last week, and in big public symposiums admitted we're going to shut down Infowars and everybody else.
[01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:47.316]  So it's all there, and Mike Adams has collated it into this report that you can forward, that you can send a talk show host, that you can ring the alarm.
[01:23:47.316 --> 01:23:48.157]  This is it.
[01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.418]  We have their Death Star plans.
[01:23:50.418 --> 01:23:52.560]  Mike Adams, congratulations on your great work.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.102]  Paul Watson, I want to thank him as well, and the whole crew here.
[01:23:56.102 --> 01:23:57.443]  I don't normally hype things up.
[01:23:57.443 --> 01:24:07.671]  You know, we broke the Bourdain thing, as I had sources inside that said he had a Kanye West moment, was saying he wanted to basically kill Harvey Weinstein, was going to expose Bill Clinton as a rapist, and now that's come out in mainstream news today.
[01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:13.814]  I'm told even more is about to come out, including video, so people better watch out.
[01:24:13.814 --> 01:24:17.457]  But I tell you, this is so huge.
[01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:23.280]  Try to encapsulate for people why this is so important, because again, no one understands the attack plan.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.562]  It's so complex, people throw their hands up.
[01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:28.824]  You have, from their own admissions, diagrammed it all.
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:41.510]  Well, primarily, Alex, and thanks for having me on, the tech giants thought that they could censor and de-platform and shadowban all of us and that no one would notice because they do it using covert algorithms.
[01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:47.996]  And they're doing it for a purpose that I outline in the report, which turned out to balloon to 59 pages, by the way.
[01:24:47.996 --> 01:24:50.619]  But, you know, you're free to print it and share it and post it.
[01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:53.841]  And Paul Joseph Watson did a really great story covering it as well.
[01:24:55.454 --> 01:25:10.882]  They're doing this because, number one, they want to create an internet where there's only one allowable opinion on any given topic, and that that official opinion is determined by radical left-wing ideology, which is always a moving target.
[01:25:10.882 --> 01:25:12.583]  No one can possibly keep up with it.
[01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:13.944]  They redefine it daily.
[01:25:14.524 --> 01:25:16.967]  And so it's basically insanity.
[01:25:16.967 --> 01:25:23.494]  It's a call for online insanity echo chambers where no one is allowed to dissent on any topic whatsoever.
[01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:27.559]  From climate change, to politics, to gender, to finance, to history.
[01:25:27.559 --> 01:25:29.481]  All of these topics and much more.
[01:25:29.481 --> 01:25:35.428]  We are looking at a nuclear apocalypse of censorship if we don't stop this right now.
[01:25:36.008 --> 01:25:39.769]  And that's why we have to have these legislative and regulatory actions.
[01:25:39.769 --> 01:25:49.251]  I've outlined 13 of them in the report that legislators and regulators could use as a starting point to brainstorm action, to take action.
[01:25:49.251 --> 01:25:57.413]  You've either got to indict these CEOs of Facebook for racketeering, or you've got to reel in the censorship.
[01:25:57.413 --> 01:25:57.993]  You've got to make them
[01:25:59.133 --> 01:25:59.954]  We're good to go.
[01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.637]  This is a blueprint.
[01:26:20.637 --> 01:26:26.621]  This document destroys the entire justification, the hate speech nonsense, the fake news nonsense.
[01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:29.863]  It destroys it with an academic language approach.
[01:26:29.863 --> 01:26:32.465]  I don't know if you've had a chance to read even a few paragraphs.
[01:26:32.465 --> 01:26:33.806]  It's excellent.
[01:26:33.806 --> 01:26:45.253]  It's designed for Congress and the lawyers to show them that they're creating prior restraint, chilling effect, a giant re-education camp online, where if you promote whatever their latest garbage is, you get promoted.
[01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:48.934]  Which is a form of digital payoff, digital currency.
[01:26:48.934 --> 01:26:51.355]  Everyone else is shunted and controlled.
[01:26:51.355 --> 01:26:57.077]  This is just unprecedented, this technotronic takeover.
[01:26:57.077 --> 01:27:01.099]  Actually, it is the crushing of the human soul.
[01:27:02.626 --> 01:27:04.847]  And they've lost control of the narrative, Alex.
[01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:06.288]  CNN is panicked.
[01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:12.572]  Panicked because they know that if you were allowed to compete in the marketplace of free ideas, you would crush CNN.
[01:27:12.572 --> 01:27:17.114]  I mean, you're crushing them anyway in terms of audience, but CNN would be obsolete overnight.
[01:27:17.114 --> 01:27:18.315]  They are panicked.
[01:27:18.315 --> 01:27:24.459]  They have to call for destroying you and your network because they can't compete with your ideas.
[01:27:24.459 --> 01:27:26.660]  They can't compete with your news reporting staff.
[01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:36.567]  And I outline all this in the report, fact by fact, paragraph by paragraph, with citations, with examples, irrefutable logic on many levels.
[01:27:36.567 --> 01:27:43.032]  This is a blueprint for how we fight back and stop the techno-dictatorship that's trying to destroy our country.
[01:27:43.032 --> 01:27:45.333]  And listen, we don't want to be the only ones doing this.
[01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:46.834]  It actually scares us.
[01:27:46.834 --> 01:27:48.316]  When I talked to Mike last week, I said,
[01:27:49.176 --> 01:27:50.177]  You're an engineer.
[01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.277]  You're a well-known tech writer.
[01:27:51.277 --> 01:27:52.738]  You've got hundreds of websites.
[01:27:52.738 --> 01:27:56.180]  You're just as successful as Infowars, just under the radar.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.421]  I said, I don't know how to try to put this together.
[01:27:58.421 --> 01:28:00.362]  High-level folks need it.
[01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:03.664]  And I was so upset that they say no one's done a report.
[01:28:03.664 --> 01:28:05.505]  No one's collated their own admissions.
[01:28:05.505 --> 01:28:06.985]  Well, we've done it now.
[01:28:06.985 --> 01:28:07.346]  This is...
[01:28:08.186 --> 01:28:18.392]  This is quotes and admissions and exhibits of the crimes they've committed against our Republic and our free speech in a public conspiracy against free will and free association.
[01:28:18.392 --> 01:28:22.074]  This is the true civil rights, human rights fight of the century.
[01:28:22.074 --> 01:28:24.255]  I can't believe we're right in the middle of it, Mike.
[01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:25.436]  Yeah, and you know what?
[01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.891]  You look at the writing of Paul Joseph Watson, or even this report.
[01:28:28.891 --> 01:28:34.374]  I know we're going to break, but we know what we're talking about because we have been attacked.
[01:28:34.374 --> 01:28:35.654]  We have had to defend ourselves.
[01:28:35.654 --> 01:28:40.696]  We have had to build systems to defend against these assaults, so we intimately know how the censorship works.
[01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:41.097]  That's right.
[01:28:41.097 --> 01:28:42.577]  And it's been going on forever.
[01:28:42.577 --> 01:28:44.598]  It's just now, what, it's a hundred times worse.
[01:28:44.598 --> 01:28:45.238]  Exactly.
[01:28:45.238 --> 01:28:48.240]  We are experts because we have experienced it.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:48.780]  We do.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.280]  Exactly.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:49.821]  Mike Adams is on fire.
[01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:50.961]  We're on the front lines every day.
[01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:52.702]  We're going to come right back with Mike Adams.
[01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:53.682]  This is so critical.
[01:28:53.682 --> 01:28:55.243]  This is the First Amendment, folks.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.402]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Patreon?
[01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.122]  Well, now you don't have to be.

[01:30:03.687 --> 01:30:04.248]  Thanks for holding.
[01:30:04.248 --> 01:30:05.669]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:09.353]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[01:30:09.353 --> 01:30:18.043]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was
[01:30:18.083 --> 01:30:34.300]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:43.409]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:30:43.409 --> 01:30:48.314]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:30:48.314 --> 01:30:53.920]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:30:58.464 --> 01:31:02.446]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.446 --> 01:31:05.187]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:05.187 --> 01:31:10.010]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:12.411]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[01:32:07.915 --> 01:32:11.416]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[01:33:01.782 --> 01:33:04.376]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:21.572]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:33:21.572 --> 01:33:34.140]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:39.944]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:44.248]  Where people aren't extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:33:44.248 --> 01:33:46.390]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:33:49.059 --> 01:33:50.820]  Well, the society unravels.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:55.861]  Men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[01:33:55.861 --> 01:34:02.363]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[01:34:02.363 --> 01:34:04.384]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[01:34:04.384 --> 01:34:05.364]  It's fulfilling.
[01:34:05.364 --> 01:34:06.464]  InfoWars.
[01:34:06.464 --> 01:34:10.525]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:34:10.525 --> 01:34:13.226]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:13.226 --> 01:34:18.428]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:34:21.363 --> 01:34:40.890]  There's so much entertainment, so much news out there, but what you're hearing is the only detailed scientific report from their own admissions for the plan to end free speech, not just here but worldwide, now being executed against anybody who's nationalist or capitalist ahead of the 2018 election and beyond.
[01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:44.311]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com is an engineer, an expert.
[01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:46.652]  He and Paul Watson both have reports out today.
[01:34:46.652 --> 01:34:48.533]  Paul has a boiled-down report on his report.
[01:34:49.701 --> 01:34:53.544]  They're at naturalnews.com, infowars.com.
[01:34:53.544 --> 01:34:54.805]  And I know all of you already know this.
[01:34:54.805 --> 01:34:57.767]  Our listeners are like, Alex, we know there's sins for everybody, we know it's bad.
[01:34:57.767 --> 01:35:01.230]  Congress doesn't understand it.
[01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:05.913]  The President understands it's going on, but doesn't even know his Twitter pushes.
[01:35:05.913 --> 01:35:07.575]  Most of his Twitter users don't even get it sent to them.
[01:35:08.723 --> 01:35:12.645]  So, Facebook said last week, look, we already banned Alex Jones from sharing info.
[01:35:12.645 --> 01:35:14.687]  We kick his page off, he can sue us.
[01:35:14.687 --> 01:35:16.268]  Just don't, we already banned him.
[01:35:16.268 --> 01:35:17.288]  CNN, stop.
[01:35:17.288 --> 01:35:20.210]  New York Times, Washington Post, thousands of publications.
[01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:22.352]  But they're making their big push, so there's this big fight.
[01:35:22.352 --> 01:35:24.153]  Mike Adams, I want to get back in your report.
[01:35:24.153 --> 01:35:27.575]  It's on Infowars.com, the censorship master plan decoded, again.
[01:35:28.857 --> 01:35:31.258]  I liken it to a Star Wars analogy, Episode 4.
[01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.039]  These are Death Star plans.
[01:35:33.039 --> 01:35:34.619]  These are valuable.
[01:35:34.619 --> 01:35:38.681]  See, the globalists just think you're idiots, and they're just, oh, that's just no big deal, you know.
[01:35:38.681 --> 01:35:43.183]  You think it's a little piece of gold foil sitting on the side of the road.
[01:35:43.183 --> 01:35:44.623]  It's a big old gold coin.
[01:35:44.623 --> 01:35:45.484]  This is critical.
[01:35:46.314 --> 01:35:47.476]  This is their battle plan.
[01:35:47.476 --> 01:35:51.862]  This is how to show what they're doing and then expose them and defeat them.
[01:35:51.862 --> 01:35:53.544]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[01:35:53.544 --> 01:35:53.885]  Get it.
[01:35:53.885 --> 01:35:54.205]  Get it.
[01:35:54.205 --> 01:35:54.586]  Tweet it.
[01:35:54.586 --> 01:35:55.347]  Facebook it.
[01:35:55.347 --> 01:35:55.748]  Share it.
[01:35:55.748 --> 01:35:57.370]  Print off copies.
[01:35:57.370 --> 01:35:58.512]  Call Congress.
[01:35:58.512 --> 01:35:59.473]  Email it to Congress.
[01:35:59.473 --> 01:36:02.577]  Everyone hammer them that they've got hearings tomorrow legitimizing this.
[01:36:04.363 --> 01:36:12.645]  Mike, what do you think's going on in the intramural battles of the big corporate dying dinosaur media that's very jealous of Facebook, YouTube, and Google?
[01:36:12.645 --> 01:36:16.786]  Because they still get force-fed to everybody, but that's not enough.
[01:36:16.786 --> 01:36:21.407]  They want us completely banned because they admit these reports that will other people create subsites.
[01:36:21.407 --> 01:36:22.547]  They still share it.
[01:36:22.547 --> 01:36:24.568]  It goes viral other places.
[01:36:24.568 --> 01:36:29.369]  They want that desire of legitimizing the complete ban, first in cyberspace and then physically.
[01:36:30.249 --> 01:36:34.432]  But what do you think, because you're a smart guy, is going on in the public debate?
[01:36:34.432 --> 01:36:36.834]  Is it about legitimizing censorship?
[01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:38.074]  Or is it just panicking?
[01:36:38.074 --> 01:36:39.535]  Where are they going?
[01:36:39.535 --> 01:36:40.836]  Well, they are panicked.
[01:36:40.836 --> 01:36:42.617]  I call them media monopolists.
[01:36:42.617 --> 01:36:52.404]  And they've come to the realization that without the artificial algorithmic boosting of their visibility by Facebook, Google, and others, they would already be obsolete.
[01:36:52.404 --> 01:36:58.028]  The independent media is really the decentralization of information and news analysis.
[01:36:58.028 --> 01:36:59.589]  It's giving power back to the people.
[01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:02.711]  Decentralization is good for society.
[01:37:02.711 --> 01:37:14.261]  Centralized news or monopolized news is New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and you know they're handed scripts every day of what to say, what to report, and what to avoid reporting.
[01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.222]  That model is obsolete.
[01:37:16.222 --> 01:37:24.930]  The people don't want to be spoon-fed false narratives every day by different faces spouting the exact same words over and over again.
[01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:29.474]  People want a diversity of ideas, a diversity of analysis.
[01:37:29.474 --> 01:37:37.701]  People understand, in fact, that there are different points of view in the world, and they'd like to actually eat from that ideological buffet, so to speak.
[01:37:37.701 --> 01:37:43.746]  And they're trying to define different points of view as fake news, and then de-platform it, and you're right.
[01:37:43.746 --> 01:37:44.606]  They are hanging on.
[01:37:46.454 --> 01:38:06.940]  They're absolutely panicked, and remember that the central assertion of these media monopolists is that they alone have a unique divine right, or a divine ability to discern reality without bias or distortion, and that no one in the independent media, they claim, has any such capability, and can't even obtain such a capability.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:13.682]  In other words, they think they are gods, or that they are in touch with actual gods, even though they hate religion and they hate Christians.
[01:38:14.302 --> 01:38:23.384]  Their mythology, their dogma, is that they are the gods of truth, and that anyone who disagrees with them is, by default, fake news.
[01:38:23.384 --> 01:38:31.506]  So that's the dark corner of the media that we have now crept into, and we're exposing it every day.
[01:38:31.506 --> 01:38:40.508]  That's what this report is about, and that's why InfoWars, not just survival, but thriving and expanding, is so crucial to the freedom to think.
[01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.289]  In our society.
[01:38:42.289 --> 01:38:45.452]  Remember, they're trying to crush your freedom to think!
[01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:51.737]  Not just your freedom to share a link, or your freedom to express your voice, but your very freedom to think for yourself.
[01:38:51.737 --> 01:39:06.450]  That is what is under assault, because the media monopolists, in order for them to maintain control over society, and influence the outcomes of elections, they must be able to inject and insert thoughts, ideas, cultural narratives, and belief systems into the minds of the masses, Alex.
[01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:12.754]  And let's bring this up, because you're a smart businessman, not just an engineer, and all the things you've done.
[01:39:12.754 --> 01:39:27.465]  The Streisand effect, the arrogance of Stelter saying, ban InfoWars, Cuomo saying, ban InfoWars, them having conferences, they are so crazy that historically, you say something's banned, you push it right to the avant-garde.
[01:39:27.465 --> 01:39:31.128]  And so, it's, why do you think they've chosen InfoWars?
[01:39:31.128 --> 01:39:31.928]  And then let's go into
[01:39:35.438 --> 01:39:41.804]  The section in here when you talk about the way to counter this, because that's the most important part.
[01:39:41.804 --> 01:39:45.727]  We need Congress to know, hey, read the report now, here's what you do.
[01:39:45.727 --> 01:39:57.758]  We have all the cards, as President Trump says, this is one of the few areas where he fights with them instead of understanding they've hijacked utilities, they have engaged in classical racketeering, they must be, I mean, to have CNN calling
[01:39:58.339 --> 01:40:01.800]  Because when you read the reports out of even the New York Times, they want everyone banned.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.801]  All, quote, conspiracy theories.
[01:40:03.801 --> 01:40:12.925]  When CNN says to fact-checkers, we don't like what they're saying, that Hillary, you know, has bad health problems or whatever, or the Federal Reserve is private, they want the power to ban that.
[01:40:12.925 --> 01:40:14.405]  That is so draconian.
[01:40:14.405 --> 01:40:15.726]  They're clearly villains.
[01:40:15.726 --> 01:40:17.927]  So how are they risking jumping the shark like this?
[01:40:18.627 --> 01:40:37.451]  Well, they specifically target you, and I outlined some of this in the report, because your delivery style, which is aggressive, which is asking big questions, kind of shaking people awake out of a slumber, almost like a hypnotic type of slumber, where they're subjected to this IV drip.
[01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:39.312]  InfoWars is the opposite of NPR.
[01:40:39.312 --> 01:40:40.812]  It's more like an annoying alarm clock.
[01:40:41.644 --> 01:40:42.144]  Exactly.
[01:40:42.144 --> 01:40:46.106]  And NPR, I'm glad you mentioned that, because it is lulling people to sleep.
[01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:55.671]  You've got to understand that controlling people's thoughts and ideas requires a continuous CNN fake news disinfo stream.
[01:40:55.671 --> 01:40:57.612]  It has to be uninterrupted.
[01:40:57.612 --> 01:41:06.116]  And you, Alex Jones, are the interrupter of that toxic stream of disinformation that CNN is trying to drip into the minds of people.
[01:41:06.116 --> 01:41:08.337]  You are the primary interrupter.
[01:41:08.337 --> 01:41:09.998]  I actually call you that in the report.
[01:41:09.998 --> 01:41:11.079]  You're the interrupter
[01:41:11.702 --> 01:41:12.350]  Of the false...
[01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:16.612]  Paradigm that's being shoved into the minds of the masses.
[01:41:16.612 --> 01:41:25.036]  And that is key, because they don't go after independent media outlets that are, you know, more subdued or more stylistically like the mainstream media.
[01:41:25.036 --> 01:41:35.341]  They're going after you because you're the guy who walks into the room of people being, you know, lulled to sleep and, you know, you rip off the covers and you throw ice on them and you say, wake up!
[01:41:35.341 --> 01:41:36.722]  Look what's happening here!
[01:41:36.722 --> 01:41:38.142]  Welcome to reality!
[01:41:38.142 --> 01:41:41.144]  That's what you do and you're the best at it and that's why they're trying to take you down.
[01:41:41.874 --> 01:41:49.483]  Well, all I know is they do want people hypnotically into a lull, be lazy, be dumb, and I'm running around raising an alarm bell.
[01:41:49.483 --> 01:41:51.505]  I'm just like Paul Revere.
[01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:55.610]  They've also censored you massively as well, and it's a real badge of honor that's happened.
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:57.052]  It's not about tooting horns, folks.
[01:41:57.052 --> 01:42:00.536]  It's about what are they most afraid of that lets you know what is most effective.
[01:42:01.857 --> 01:42:03.618]  And they've turned us into warriors, Alex.
[01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:04.838]  I mean, think about this.
[01:42:04.838 --> 01:42:11.100]  We are stronger and more determined and more passionate and even really more informed today because of all the attacks on us.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:15.901]  I mean, think about how you and I and Paul Watson... The attacks totally motivate us.
[01:42:15.901 --> 01:42:16.621]  Absolutely.
[01:42:16.621 --> 01:42:18.502]  They've turned us into warriors.
[01:42:18.502 --> 01:42:26.824]  They've given us the spirit of the Founding Fathers, the revolutionary spirit to take back our nation and our freedom of speech.
[01:42:26.824 --> 01:42:29.305]  We are stronger today because of it, and that's why we will win.
[01:42:30.416 --> 01:42:31.076]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:42:31.076 --> 01:42:35.759]  I want to get your analysis of the whole Trump-Putin meeting with Owen Schroer coming in and more on this report.
[01:42:35.759 --> 01:42:39.842]  Listen, I never... I'm not even plugging by-products today because I'm so obsessed with this.
[01:42:39.842 --> 01:42:41.683]  DemFullRestore.com, please support us.
[01:42:41.683 --> 01:42:43.484]  We've got big sales going, or we won't be here.
[01:42:43.484 --> 01:42:52.349]  The enemy is really trying to take us down, and we're glad because it means we're effective, but it's just so critical to realize without you spreading the word or sharing the links, we're nothing.
[01:42:52.349 --> 01:42:54.851]  Only you can override their censorship and control.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.501]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:01.481]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:43:01.481 --> 01:43:05.923]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:43:05.923 --> 01:43:10.284]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:15.386]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:43:15.386 --> 01:43:19.127]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:43:19.987 --> 01:43:22.290]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.232]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:43:24.232 --> 01:43:27.376]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is tracking back.
[01:43:27.376 --> 01:43:34.525]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on this 4th of July that's so historic.
[01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:36.407]  We have record sales going on right now.

[01:43:55.721 --> 01:43:56.802]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:43:57.475 --> 01:44:01.437]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.437 --> 01:44:04.718]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.718 --> 01:44:10.981]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.981 --> 01:44:13.743]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.483 --> 01:44:18.308]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.308 --> 01:44:24.795]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.795 --> 01:44:29.761]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.495 --> 01:44:34.416]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.416 --> 01:44:41.617]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.617 --> 01:44:46.758]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.758 --> 01:44:52.519]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:56.500]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:01.157]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[01:45:01.157 --> 01:45:06.944]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[01:45:58.775 --> 01:46:03.637]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.637 --> 01:46:12.541]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:12.541 --> 01:46:17.883]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:46:17.883 --> 01:46:26.146]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:46:26.186 --> 01:46:26.446]  I think so.
[01:47:01.223 --> 01:47:18.887]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:18.887 --> 01:47:25.229]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:27.864 --> 01:47:46.232]  Alright, we got a long way to go and a short time to get there, but I was literally during the four minute break thinking and then I came back and sat down and Mike Adams via Skype, the health ranger, started saying the exact same thing I was thinking when I was in the bathroom combing my hair and flossing my teeth because I just had a hamburger.
[01:47:46.232 --> 01:47:46.772]  And it was...
[01:47:47.984 --> 01:47:53.228]  Like when I was on the plane years ago, flying to The View in New York, and one of the heads of one of the big banks was on board.
[01:47:53.228 --> 01:47:54.869]  He said, Alex, you don't get it.
[01:47:54.869 --> 01:47:57.330]  You think people will adapt and overcome tyranny.
[01:47:57.330 --> 01:47:59.812]  They will submit to tyranny.
[01:47:59.812 --> 01:48:00.833]  And I was going to come back and say that.
[01:48:00.833 --> 01:48:05.316]  And Mike said, they don't, during the break, he goes, they don't think we're fighters.
[01:48:05.316 --> 01:48:06.336]  They think we're going to lay down.
[01:48:06.336 --> 01:48:12.020]  They're just in control of things because people have handed over responsibility and aren't conscious and just submit.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.981]  And that's exactly what I was about to say.
[01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:17.724]  When you understand that fighting back and being involved is animating and makes you stronger.
[01:48:18.044 --> 01:48:19.205]  And it's the only hope you've got.
[01:48:19.205 --> 01:48:21.307]  Plus, you always have victory if you take action.
[01:48:21.307 --> 01:48:34.600]  Not at first, but down the road, because it creates these wavelengths, these ripples in the pond, culturally, spiritually, economically, that are unstoppable with the whole human momentum of our ancestors that were such winners.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.963]  They've just diverted us off this little loser area.
[01:48:37.963 --> 01:48:38.544]  We're winners.
[01:48:38.544 --> 01:48:40.866]  We're an incredible species with unlimited potential.
[01:48:42.316 --> 01:48:47.298]  If you get animated and get upset and then take action with the information, you're unstoppable.
[01:48:47.298 --> 01:48:49.319]  Like Mike said, they turned us into warriors.
[01:48:49.319 --> 01:48:54.261]  I don't sit here when I get attacked or get blocked or whatever and go, oh my god, poor me.
[01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:58.043]  But see, the globalists, they all sell out to power for whatever's easiest.
[01:48:58.043 --> 01:49:01.404]  They're a collection of weenies and sellouts and weaklings.
[01:49:01.404 --> 01:49:07.527]  But we, as trailblazers, rugged individuals, only get stronger in the animating contest of liberty, Mike.
[01:49:08.646 --> 01:49:09.267]  Well, think about it.
[01:49:09.267 --> 01:49:13.170]  If you're parents and you have two kids, and one kid you just give them everything.
[01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:14.311]  Bonus points.
[01:49:14.311 --> 01:49:15.632]  They don't have to earn anything.
[01:49:15.632 --> 01:49:16.994]  There's no merit to their behavior.
[01:49:16.994 --> 01:49:17.634]  They get everything.
[01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:21.318]  But then the other kid, you make them earn everything.
[01:49:22.151 --> 01:49:23.672]  Which kid is going to be stronger?
[01:49:23.672 --> 01:49:25.693]  And the same thing is happening in media.
[01:49:25.693 --> 01:49:36.638]  We, in the independent media, we have to not just earn everything that we're getting, we have to work twice as hard, three times as hard as the media monopolists because we are being artificially penalized.
[01:49:36.638 --> 01:49:43.081]  So we have become, in essence, just from a pragmatic point of view, experts.
[01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:44.002]  The modern Spartans.
[01:49:45.788 --> 01:49:46.228]  Right, right.
[01:49:46.228 --> 01:49:49.451]  I mean, guerrilla information marketing, you know, things like that.
[01:49:49.451 --> 01:49:58.078]  I mean, we know how to get the word out, and we don't depend on these mainstream systems, because those systems have been penalizing us for so long, we've had to find workarounds.
[01:49:58.078 --> 01:50:06.025]  Now, if they would stop censoring us, we would be a hundred times bigger, you know, almost immediately, because there is an effect.
[01:50:06.025 --> 01:50:07.706]  And by the way, I know your numbers, I don't mind.
[01:50:07.706 --> 01:50:08.767]  That's actually true.
[01:50:10.293 --> 01:50:11.055]  I know, I know.
[01:50:11.055 --> 01:50:11.757]  It is true.
[01:50:11.757 --> 01:50:14.364]  You know, millions of followers I have on Facebook.
[01:50:14.364 --> 01:50:16.570]  You have tens of millions across many platforms.
[01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:18.014]  And they won't even let you hit any of them.
[01:50:19.062 --> 01:50:19.922]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:19.922 --> 01:50:29.165]  You built them, you got them to go there, you advertised with your huge platform and built it, and then they steal it, and then won't even let you have access to it, but then let the left be force-fed.
[01:50:29.165 --> 01:50:30.245]  I want to get to some of these clips.
[01:50:30.245 --> 01:50:31.305]  Owen, you want to comment?
[01:50:31.305 --> 01:50:31.905]  Well, yeah.
[01:50:31.905 --> 01:50:41.528]  Just to talk about, real quick, what you're saying about the animating contest of Liberty, just to kind of give a physical representation or manifestation of that, imagine
[01:50:42.328 --> 01:50:58.632]  Uh, a land, whatever you choose, all historically, just a bunch of slaves working in the fields or on the pyramids or whatever you want to say, and they all know they're slaves and oppressed, but they just kind of do it, that's all they know, and even though they think they need to rebel, they don't see it, so they just kind of go along.
[01:50:58.632 --> 01:51:06.434]  But then, as soon as they see one person attacking the slave master, two people, three people, four people, boom, all of a sudden everyone's attacking and it's like,
[01:51:07.054 --> 01:51:07.494]  Bam!
[01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:08.315]  Kick into gear!
[01:51:08.315 --> 01:51:08.695]  Fight!
[01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:09.456]  Take them down!
[01:51:09.456 --> 01:51:10.696]  Get your freedom back!
[01:51:10.696 --> 01:51:11.677]  That's the engagement.
[01:51:11.677 --> 01:51:12.618]  That's the clicking.
[01:51:12.618 --> 01:51:13.278]  That's what you're doing.
[01:51:13.278 --> 01:51:14.339]  And think about it.
[01:51:14.339 --> 01:51:26.126]  Most of your mainline conservatives and people know there's censorship, so they all pay their pound of flesh and attack me or say whatever and then get promoted and go, oh look, I got promoted, but you're promoting crap!
[01:51:26.126 --> 01:51:27.087]  It's empty!
[01:51:27.087 --> 01:51:29.048]  So you just parroted what they wanted?
[01:51:29.048 --> 01:51:29.829]  That wasn't you.
[01:51:29.829 --> 01:51:31.550]  You just lost your soul.
[01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:35.993]  One person we reach through their barricade of lies is worth more than a million zombies.
[01:51:36.553 --> 01:51:39.674]  We're not trying to win in their paradigm!
[01:51:39.674 --> 01:51:51.057]  Just like China has a social scoring system, there is a de facto system in place in America today, where if you attack Alex Jones, you're going to get moved up in the media.
[01:51:51.057 --> 01:51:54.477]  But if you go along with anything that Infowars says, then you're going to be penalized.
[01:51:54.477 --> 01:52:00.479]  It's not an official scoring system, but it's an unofficial covert scoring system, and it is in place, and it is modeled after China.
[01:52:01.577 --> 01:52:04.258]  And that's the most key thing that's been said today.
[01:52:04.258 --> 01:52:08.959]  You get into how they're outsourcing in your report, on page 46, the censorship.
[01:52:08.959 --> 01:52:19.941]  Foreign countries, the Chinese government just banned, I mean I know your wife's Taiwanese, the emoji of Taiwan for all Apple users globally was banned and it would crash your phone if you used it!
[01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:22.782]  I mean, the level of control is unbelievable!
[01:52:23.582 --> 01:52:31.854]  Yes, and they claim they have no responsibility because they're outsourcing the censorship to these radical left-wing groups like the SPLC, which has been widely discredited.
[01:52:31.854 --> 01:52:33.377]  So where are the civil rights lawsuits?
[01:52:33.377 --> 01:52:34.699]  Where are the racketeering suits?
[01:52:34.699 --> 01:52:37.383]  Where are the Human Rights Commission meetings?
[01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:37.903]  Where are the...
[01:52:39.221 --> 01:52:40.262]  Censorship hearings.
[01:52:40.262 --> 01:52:41.443]  Where are the monopoly hearings?
[01:52:41.443 --> 01:52:42.884]  This is cut and dry!
[01:52:42.884 --> 01:52:52.914]  Kim, Cook, and Apple don't just have slave factories now, they officially moved five months ago to China and now let them control in America what emoji you can send!
[01:52:52.914 --> 01:52:55.897]  My God, America, what are you gonna put up with next?
[01:52:56.557 --> 01:53:02.960]  And if this censorship had been targeting leftists, the ACLU would be screaming bloody murder right now.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.741]  The EFF would be all over it.
[01:53:04.741 --> 01:53:06.642]  There would be protests nationwide.
[01:53:06.642 --> 01:53:13.685]  There would be mobs of people protesting the Facebook buildings and campai and headquarters all across the country if leftists were being censored.
[01:53:14.065 --> 01:53:18.067]  But because it's conservatives being censored, the left is perfectly okay with it.
[01:53:18.067 --> 01:53:27.310]  Because what they want, an authoritarian society where they control the only allowable opinion that can be spoken or shared in any online forum.
[01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:31.172]  That is an Orwellian, authoritarian, tyrannical dictatorship.
[01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:35.334]  That's what they want, so they can open the borders without dissent.
[01:53:35.334 --> 01:53:39.336]  So they can take your guns without anybody being able to complain online or share a complaint.
[01:53:39.336 --> 01:53:44.019]  So they can get rid of Trump and bring in whoever they want without anyone being able to express outrage.
[01:53:44.019 --> 01:53:50.583]  And even more, Mike Adams, everything he said, I keep saying that's the most important, that's the most important, until he trumps over something more important.
[01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:59.228]  They're launching this super risky mass censorship program that was in beta to now maximum, you know, 90 plus percent of conservatives being banned, it was 80 percent last week.
[01:54:00.632 --> 01:54:02.713]  Because they're getting ready to make their move.
[01:54:02.713 --> 01:54:03.454]  Civil War.
[01:54:03.454 --> 01:54:04.895]  They already called it a civil war.
[01:54:04.895 --> 01:54:06.476]  I go, hey, look, they say we're in a civil war.
[01:54:06.476 --> 01:54:08.077]  Oh, Jones claims we're in a civil war.
[01:54:08.077 --> 01:54:09.338]  They're the ones saying it.
[01:54:09.338 --> 01:54:13.061]  Rob Reiner, Bill Maher, Michael Moore.
[01:54:13.061 --> 01:54:17.183]  I want to play some of these clips, but again, they think their audience is so dumb.
[01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.805]  They go, we're in a civil war.
[01:54:18.805 --> 01:54:19.825]  Time to start overthrowing.
[01:54:19.825 --> 01:54:21.206]  I go, well, look, they say we're in a civil war.
[01:54:21.206 --> 01:54:22.167]  Jones is crazy.
[01:54:22.167 --> 01:54:22.667]  Ban him.
[01:54:22.667 --> 01:54:23.568]  He says we're in a civil war.
[01:54:25.282 --> 01:54:33.188]  Well, the Civil War has already begun in the online realm, and it's the left... And now Uber has a list of conservatives that won't give you rides!
[01:54:33.188 --> 01:54:33.629]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:37.192]  Just like China won't let you fly if you have a bad social score.
[01:54:37.192 --> 01:54:40.694]  Remember, the first chapter of every kinetic war is the Info War.
[01:54:40.694 --> 01:54:43.056]  As you well know, that's the name of your operation.
[01:54:43.056 --> 01:54:44.998]  The Information War is happening online.
[01:54:44.998 --> 01:54:48.881]  It is the opening chapter of the Civil War, and they want to take it kinetic.
[01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:54.466]  So this signifies, this is like enemy armies... This is like enemy armies building up on your border.
[01:54:54.966 --> 01:54:55.286]  That's right.
[01:54:55.286 --> 01:54:57.608]  I mean, they're here, it's on, Owen.
[01:54:57.608 --> 01:55:06.675]  Well, and again, what do they do to the slave that steps out and shows the rest of the slaves, hey, you don't have to be a slave.
[01:55:06.675 --> 01:55:07.515]  Stand up for yourself.
[01:55:07.515 --> 01:55:08.256]  What do they do to that slave?
[01:55:08.256 --> 01:55:09.236]  They flog him.
[01:55:09.236 --> 01:55:09.637]  Exactly.
[01:55:09.637 --> 01:55:10.757]  That's what they're doing to you, Alex.
[01:55:10.757 --> 01:55:12.299]  That's what they're doing to Infowars.
[01:55:12.299 --> 01:55:14.520]  We're the ones awakening the mind slaves.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.941]  I'm sorry, it's true, and I'm glad to do it.
[01:55:15.941 --> 01:55:19.344]  I'm not bitching, I'm not a victim, but they got us strapped up with Cater 9 tells.
[01:55:20.164 --> 01:55:22.806]  I don't care what they do.
[01:55:22.806 --> 01:55:23.567]  They've attacked Mike.
[01:55:23.567 --> 01:55:24.287]  And we're not bitching.
[01:55:24.287 --> 01:55:26.149]  We're saying we are over the target.
[01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:28.050]  We are bombers are getting the main flag.
[01:55:28.050 --> 01:55:30.012]  We are dropping bombs on the enemy.
[01:55:30.012 --> 01:55:36.677]  If you want to be part of the war, join us, spread the links, get involved, buy our products, call Congress, send this report to everyone.
[01:55:36.897 --> 01:55:38.578]  We are fighting for the country!
[01:55:38.578 --> 01:55:40.358]  This is the 21st century war!
[01:55:40.358 --> 01:55:41.419]  This is not a drill!
[01:55:41.419 --> 01:55:42.299]  It's not a game!
[01:55:42.299 --> 01:55:43.259]  It's not a joke!
[01:55:43.259 --> 01:55:47.421]  Behind the scenes, they've got intelligence ops, they've got PIs, they've got stuff.
[01:55:47.421 --> 01:55:50.542]  Folks, if I told you, you wouldn't believe it, but I'm not going to give them the time of day talking about it.
[01:55:50.542 --> 01:55:53.503]  It has been, for four years, total war.
[01:55:53.503 --> 01:55:55.544]  And the last year, it's intensified massively.
[01:55:55.544 --> 01:55:56.564]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:55:56.564 --> 01:55:57.504]  I asked for this.
[01:55:57.504 --> 01:55:59.885]  But I'm just telling you, this is total war.
[01:55:59.885 --> 01:56:00.985]  This isn't entertainment.
[01:56:00.985 --> 01:56:01.826]  This isn't Netflix.
[01:56:02.566 --> 01:56:04.327]  Mike Adams.
[01:56:04.327 --> 01:56:09.690]  They've driven us, Alex, to the point where, in terms of online presence, we have nothing left to lose.
[01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:10.711]  Think about that.
[01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:15.394]  It's not like we want to appease Google or appease Facebook.
[01:56:15.394 --> 01:56:23.059]  They practically censored us to the point of oblivion anyway, with down-raking algorithms, punishment, shadow-banning, all these things.
[01:56:23.059 --> 01:56:24.780]  We have nothing left to lose in the online world.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:29.002]  You either stand up and fight, or you become completely obsolete.
[01:56:29.002 --> 01:56:34.564]  And a lot of folks, they think, our listeners will go, well I better not promote natural news or Infowars, because I'll get restricted or banned.
[01:56:34.564 --> 01:56:36.324]  You're going to lose it all anyways, and again, let's explain.
[01:56:36.324 --> 01:56:37.325]  Exactly.
[01:56:37.325 --> 01:56:40.246]  On the internet, we are as big as ever with real fans, real people.
[01:56:40.606 --> 01:56:42.667]  We're just telling you now they want us totally banned.
[01:56:42.667 --> 01:56:45.309]  Not just on big platforms, but they're physically suing us.
[01:56:45.309 --> 01:56:46.529]  They're trying to sabotage us.
[01:56:46.529 --> 01:56:48.030]  They're trying to infiltrate us.
[01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:52.293]  We've got Hillary's law firms contacting anybody that ever worked here, offering them money to lie about us.
[01:56:52.293 --> 01:56:54.114]  This is total war, people.
[01:56:54.114 --> 01:56:56.235]  A lot of folks go, well, you're dumb to fight them.
[01:56:56.235 --> 01:56:58.336]  No, you're dumb to roll over.
[01:56:58.336 --> 01:56:59.597]  You're not Americans.
[01:56:59.597 --> 01:57:01.438]  I'm talking to the minority of folks that listen.
[01:57:01.438 --> 01:57:03.659]  If you don't understand how critical this is, shame on you.
[01:57:04.696 --> 01:57:15.860]  And really, you've got to ask people, do you want to wake up in a society where you can't even share a link or utter a sentence online unless you first check to see, is that the officially allowed sentence for today?
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:18.821]  And is it different from yesterday's opinion?
[01:57:18.821 --> 01:57:21.522]  And then you're rewarded for being a parent!
[01:57:21.522 --> 01:57:21.982]  That's right.
[01:57:21.982 --> 01:57:22.322]  That's right.
[01:57:22.322 --> 01:57:26.783]  Because they want the internet to be an authoritarian echo chamber of bad ideas.
[01:57:26.783 --> 01:57:28.844]  Liberal ideas are bad ideas.
[01:57:28.844 --> 01:57:29.864]  They don't work.
[01:57:29.864 --> 01:57:31.105]  And that's why we must defeat them.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.801]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[01:57:32.801 --> 01:57:33.642]  I've got to get to these clips.
[01:57:33.642 --> 01:57:34.523]  There's so many epic clips.
[01:57:34.523 --> 01:57:36.206]  We've got like seven or eight of them.
[01:57:36.206 --> 01:57:38.729]  Mark Dice, we had him set up a week ago talking about internet censorship.
[01:57:38.729 --> 01:57:39.810]  That's what he wanted to come on about.
[01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:41.292]  Of course, we're right here in the middle of it.
[01:57:41.292 --> 01:57:42.313]  Mike Adams is our guest.
[01:57:42.313 --> 01:57:43.275]  InfoWars.com.

[01:59:57.289 --> 01:59:58.971]  You gotta keep them separated.
[02:00:12.032 --> 02:00:20.455]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:20.455 --> 02:00:24.236]  Well, here's Putin, he says the Cold War is over!
[02:00:24.236 --> 02:00:31.919]  We carefully analyzed the current status, the present and the future of the Russia-United States relationship, key issues of the global agenda.
[02:00:33.784 --> 02:00:48.190]  It's quite clear to everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a complicated stage, and yet those impediments, the current tension, the tense atmosphere, essentially have no solid reason behind it.
[02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:50.671]  The Cold War is a thing of past.
[02:00:50.671 --> 02:00:57.154]  The era of acute ideological confrontation of the two countries is a thing of remote past, is a vestige of the past.
[02:00:58.342 --> 02:01:03.426]  The era of human expansion and renaissance is here if we can defeat the globalists.
[02:01:03.426 --> 02:01:06.028]  Mike Adams, your take on that powerful quote.
[02:01:06.028 --> 02:01:16.656]  Well, part of the reason the globalists need to dominate the media is because they can't allow humanity to explore the innovation, the entrepreneurship, and the individual creativity that leads to abundance and prosperity.
[02:01:16.656 --> 02:01:18.877]  Prosperity makes the globalists obsolete.
[02:01:18.877 --> 02:01:21.179]  That's really the bottom line to all of this.
[02:01:21.179 --> 02:01:23.901]  I know you've covered this in various ways many times, but
[02:01:24.381 --> 02:01:36.351]  Setting humanity free is the greatest fear of the globalists, and controlling the media narrative is the mental enslavement system by which they keep people controlled and keep people down.
[02:01:36.351 --> 02:01:43.577]  And so this is why, ultimately, this translates into the attacks on you and me and others, because we literally, I mean, we want a free humanity!
[02:01:44.077 --> 02:01:50.643]  We want a free humanity on medicine and technology, science, economic abundance, spiritual awakening, all of these issues.
[02:01:50.643 --> 02:01:52.005]  We love humanity.
[02:01:52.005 --> 02:01:54.067]  CNN hates America.
[02:01:54.067 --> 02:01:56.629]  CNN hates civilization, if you think about it.
[02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:57.870]  They want to keep it down.
[02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:59.172]  That's my take.
[02:01:59.172 --> 02:02:05.037]  Hey guys, which one of these clips is the Awan Brothers clip?
[02:02:05.037 --> 02:02:05.818]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:06.759]  It's a longer clip.
[02:02:07.927 --> 02:02:11.210]  Well, you know what, let's just get into that now, because you've got to go and Mark Dice is coming up.
[02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:13.493]  A Wan brother's being brought up.
[02:02:13.493 --> 02:02:17.437]  The fact that Soros is manipulating our elections, not Russia.
[02:02:17.437 --> 02:02:19.319]  Trump going, hey, who cares who hacked the server?
[02:02:19.319 --> 02:02:20.660]  There's no proof Russia did it.
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:22.803]  What about the crimes Hillary committed with the server?
[02:02:23.283 --> 02:02:30.047]  And then Putin mentions Bill Browder and the potential crimes he's committed to.
[02:02:30.047 --> 02:02:37.812]  Bill Browder's been going on mainstream media for the last seven days trying to build up his own little fake faux personality.
[02:02:37.812 --> 02:02:38.993]  That's going to be totally destroyed.
[02:02:38.993 --> 02:02:40.714]  So they're all out.
[02:02:40.714 --> 02:02:44.617]  I mean, they're all in right now to try to save what they've created.
[02:02:44.617 --> 02:02:47.859]  And just to echo what Mike said earlier, you know, and what it comes down to,
[02:02:49.051 --> 02:02:51.173]  is individual independence.
[02:02:51.173 --> 02:03:00.422]  The average human has been so beaten down by the media, so beaten down by the chemicals they ingest, they don't even know how to empower themselves.
[02:03:00.422 --> 02:03:05.607]  And the individual human being is capable of everything.
[02:03:05.607 --> 02:03:06.928]  That's what they don't want you to think.
[02:03:06.928 --> 02:03:07.469]  And that's key.
[02:03:07.469 --> 02:03:08.530]  I mean, you watch CNN.
[02:03:08.530 --> 02:03:09.911]  It's total demoralization.
[02:03:09.911 --> 02:03:12.493]  Mike, let me ask that last question, because they are desperate.
[02:03:12.493 --> 02:03:12.834]  You're right.
[02:03:13.334 --> 02:03:14.776]  Let's not be too confident here though.
[02:03:14.776 --> 02:03:16.459]  They are now going to pull out all the stops.
[02:03:16.459 --> 02:03:20.966]  I think terror attacks, false flags to make themselves the victims, gut level Mike Adams.
[02:03:20.966 --> 02:03:21.948]  What do you think they're going to do?
[02:03:22.777 --> 02:03:29.379]  Well, you're right, they are going to pull out all the stops, but we should also, I think, think about the Berlin Wall as a historical metaphor.
[02:03:29.379 --> 02:03:35.922]  The wall fell suddenly and unexpectedly, and the media monopolists today are like a Berlin Wall around your mind.
[02:03:35.922 --> 02:03:44.465]  But that wall can be shattered in an instant when we wake up and decide to take back our freedom and our human dignity, which is what independent media is all about.
[02:03:44.465 --> 02:03:44.945]  So really,
[02:03:45.845 --> 02:03:52.087]  I can imagine a world where suddenly the entire media monopoly regime collapses.
[02:03:52.087 --> 02:03:55.388]  That can happen, but we're going to have to push and press the fight.
[02:03:55.388 --> 02:04:01.369]  We're going to have to take action and not just sit on your couch being spoon-fed false ideas from MSNBC.
[02:04:01.369 --> 02:04:02.950]  You're going to have to take action.
[02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:04.490]  You're going to have to get with the program.
[02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:07.571]  And I want to be clear.
[02:04:07.571 --> 02:04:08.851]  I think it's already collapsed.
[02:04:08.851 --> 02:04:12.132]  This is their counter-strike trying to convince us we're not free.
[02:04:12.132 --> 02:04:14.973]  And we're about to go to break, but I think that's the moment we've gotten to.
[02:04:14.973 --> 02:04:17.154]  We've already blown giant holes in this wall, Owen.
[02:04:17.154 --> 02:04:22.815]  Yeah, like Brian Stelter goes on CNN and tries to act like the authority of reality and news.
[02:04:22.815 --> 02:04:24.276]  Trump is a liar.
[02:04:24.276 --> 02:04:26.376]  Trump has done nothing good.
[02:04:26.376 --> 02:04:28.737]  They want you to feel like a second-class citizen.
[02:04:28.737 --> 02:04:31.358]  They want you to feel like someone has to tell you what to do.
[02:04:31.698 --> 02:04:33.119]  No, you're a sovereign citizen.
[02:04:33.119 --> 02:04:35.821]  Remember Cuomo saying I can read WikiLeaks, you can't.
[02:04:35.821 --> 02:04:37.442]  No, no Cuomo.
[02:04:37.442 --> 02:04:40.164]  No, we're all independent sovereign citizens here.
[02:04:40.164 --> 02:04:42.305]  Mike Adams, great job with your report on censorship.
[02:04:42.305 --> 02:04:43.446]  Everybody get it out.
[02:04:43.446 --> 02:04:45.367]  That's your mission, folks.
[02:04:45.367 --> 02:04:46.748]  Alright, thank you Alex.
[02:04:46.748 --> 02:04:47.449]  Good to join you.
[02:04:47.449 --> 02:04:48.429]  Thank you, amazing job.
[02:04:48.429 --> 02:04:49.010]  God bless you.
[02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:52.112]  Get the report, the censorship master plan, naturalnews.com.
[02:04:56.277 --> 02:05:00.219]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.219 --> 02:05:03.501]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.501 --> 02:05:09.784]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:09.784 --> 02:05:12.546]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.286 --> 02:05:17.108]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.108 --> 02:05:23.592]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.592 --> 02:05:28.555]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.295 --> 02:05:33.219]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.219 --> 02:05:40.425]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.425 --> 02:05:45.129]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.129 --> 02:05:51.334]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.334 --> 02:05:55.318]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:05:59.639 --> 02:06:06.721]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:08.941]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[02:06:08.941 --> 02:06:21.544]  We love the American people.
[02:06:21.544 --> 02:06:23.764]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[02:06:23.764 --> 02:06:25.265]  We love the American people.
[02:06:25.265 --> 02:06:26.645]  We love the American people.
[02:06:28.578 --> 02:06:31.020]  We love the American people.
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:44.912]  They came in peace.
[02:06:44.912 --> 02:06:47.134]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[02:06:47.134 --> 02:06:48.856]  We love the American people.
[02:06:56.269 --> 02:07:01.791]  This is CNN.
[02:07:01.791 --> 02:07:10.174]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:07:10.174 --> 02:07:25.039]  You know, it's something the dying corporate media does now, in the thousands of articles a week that I can't even keep track of, hundreds a day that I actually try to scan over, they go, Jones is an internet talk show host, with over 5 billion views on YouTube,
[02:07:26.343 --> 02:07:30.267]  And that was years ago when YouTube told me I had that many views, not just the billions on our own channel.
[02:07:30.267 --> 02:07:36.512]  But no, we're on over 200 radio affiliates, over 400 TV stations, over 80 cable stations now, some huge, some small.
[02:07:36.512 --> 02:07:38.114]  They're all very special.
[02:07:38.114 --> 02:07:39.375]  If you're watching, please spread the word.
[02:07:39.375 --> 02:07:40.356]  That's how we get around the censors.
[02:07:40.356 --> 02:07:50.565]  But isn't it something better if I was internet, like Mark Dice with his media relations degree, his best-selling books with over a billion views on YouTube, all by himself?
[02:07:51.673 --> 02:07:59.974]  I mean, we always heard, like, the rugged individualist, the prospector, went out to Alaska for 10 years and he found the big mother load and, you know, became a billionaire.
[02:07:59.974 --> 02:08:05.755]  I mean, isn't it cool that, like, nobody really helped Mark Dice or me?
[02:08:05.755 --> 02:08:20.618]  And then meanwhile, the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., came out last week retweeting Paul Watson's article and what Mark Dice had said, that CNN, the kings of fake news, say I'm fake news, and then every time they misrepresent what I said.
[02:08:22.244 --> 02:08:23.305]  They go, he needs to be banned.
[02:08:23.305 --> 02:08:24.766]  He says Anthony Bourdain was killed.
[02:08:24.766 --> 02:08:36.733]  No, I said, he said Bill Clinton was a rapist and that Harvey Weinstein should die and that his wife was raped by Weinstein or is his fiance and that she was also abused and in Illuminati rituals and he was gonna go public.
[02:08:37.742 --> 02:08:41.345]  That came out in the Daily Mail today.
[02:08:41.345 --> 02:08:42.906]  I told you a month ago.
[02:08:42.906 --> 02:08:52.034]  Because I talked to not one, but two people that were at different shoots, where he was flipping out about Kanye West and everything, and finally became pro-Trump.
[02:08:52.034 --> 02:08:57.458]  The interview out now is from a month before that, when he was saying, well, I'm neutral on Trump, but I don't like Democrats.
[02:08:57.458 --> 02:08:59.680]  And it goes through all of it.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:02.343]  Now, how did I just make that up?
[02:09:02.343 --> 02:09:03.604]  No, I have real sources.
[02:09:04.907 --> 02:09:07.869]  One of which can't even come on air now because of what they told me.
[02:09:07.869 --> 02:09:09.010]  And I'm not at liberty to tell you.
[02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:12.092]  I've asked them to tell you what happened with law enforcement when they came on.
[02:09:14.411 --> 02:09:17.593]  But I'm just pointing out to you, this is a war.
[02:09:17.593 --> 02:09:18.774]  This is not a game.
[02:09:18.774 --> 02:09:19.434]  It's not a joke.
[02:09:19.434 --> 02:09:25.318]  When Mark Dice doesn't play games, they censor him from 10 million views a video to a half million views a video.
[02:09:25.318 --> 02:09:26.479]  When we do that, it's the same thing.
[02:09:26.479 --> 02:09:32.202]  And now they admit it last week in this big push to ban InfoWars, and then Facebook goes, hey, don't worry.
[02:09:32.202 --> 02:09:33.443]  They're already basically banned.
[02:09:33.443 --> 02:09:34.624]  Conservatives are.
[02:09:34.624 --> 02:09:35.445]  Libertarians are.
[02:09:35.445 --> 02:09:36.365]  Christians.
[02:09:36.365 --> 02:09:37.546]  Don't totally ban them.
[02:09:37.546 --> 02:09:39.007]  They'll have lawsuits.
[02:09:39.007 --> 02:09:41.068]  So Mark, I was trying to get him on for a couple weeks.
[02:09:41.068 --> 02:09:41.609]  He's a busy guy.
[02:09:42.409 --> 02:09:43.930]  He finally said last, like, Monday.
[02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:45.071]  I'll come on next Monday.
[02:09:45.071 --> 02:09:53.336]  Before this whole controversy happened, he wanted to come on to talk about the censorship he's tracking and what's unfolding, so he's with us for the balance of the hour.
[02:09:53.336 --> 02:09:54.897]  MarkDice.com.
[02:09:54.897 --> 02:09:55.397]  Remember that?
[02:09:55.397 --> 02:10:02.002]  We used to have our own website, so you need to go back to InfoWars, back to MarkDice.com, because more and more, InfoWars has its own streams, its own posts.
[02:10:02.622 --> 02:10:02.802]  I don't
[02:10:19.216 --> 02:10:20.458]  What was really going on?
[02:10:20.458 --> 02:10:25.405]  But see, once they're done kicking us off YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, they're going to get our own websites.
[02:10:25.405 --> 02:10:27.067]  So this is the big fight.
[02:10:27.067 --> 02:10:31.894]  Mark Dice, couldn't be a better time for you to come on, right in the zeitgeist here, my friend.
[02:10:31.894 --> 02:10:36.000]  I've laid a lot of stuff out here, but whoa, where would you historically say we are right now?
[02:10:37.947 --> 02:10:46.132]  We're pushing against the possible Orwellian nightmare scenario where people and their websites, their businesses disappear down the memory hole.
[02:10:46.132 --> 02:10:57.699]  And for over a decade, the mainstream media has been downplaying the social media aspect of businesses, social media stars, YouTubers, you're an internet radio host, I'm just a YouTuber.
[02:10:57.699 --> 02:10:58.480]  But now today,
[02:10:59.386 --> 02:11:09.354]  Facebook is launching their own exclusive CNN and other mainstream media shows, not streaming the CNN and cable news and other outlets on Facebook.
[02:11:09.787 --> 02:11:21.177]  Anderson Cooper today is launching his own Facebook exclusive show called Anderson Cooper Full Circle, where he's going to be answering questions from the Facebook audience.
[02:11:21.177 --> 02:11:25.561]  So they have embraced social media because they were late to the game.
[02:11:25.561 --> 02:11:27.003]  They didn't innovate.
[02:11:27.003 --> 02:11:29.305]  They had their establishment system set up.
[02:11:29.932 --> 02:11:46.486]  They had their cable channels, they had their FCC licenses, their printing presses, their magazines distributed at all the grocery stores, the bookstores, and then we came along and using this basic, what is now basic technology, which at the time, 12 years ago, was cutting edge,
[02:11:47.026 --> 02:11:50.828]  We built huge audiences that completely dominate them.
[02:11:50.828 --> 02:11:59.592]  My YouTube channel has more subscribers than MSNBC's channel, than CBS News, than MTV News, than NBC News.
[02:11:59.592 --> 02:12:11.438]  I mean, CNN's YouTube channel is pretty much the only one out of the big mainstream media channels that's bigger than mine, and I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen, or now in my family room.
[02:12:12.138 --> 02:12:15.581]  And they're so scared because we've dominated them.
[02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:16.822]  We've snuck up behind them.
[02:12:16.822 --> 02:12:18.983]  They were asleep at the wheel.
[02:12:18.983 --> 02:12:20.864]  And so now they're suppressing us.
[02:12:20.864 --> 02:12:22.766]  They're teaming up with the very infrastructure.
[02:12:23.579 --> 02:12:23.999]  We're good to go.
[02:12:44.324 --> 02:12:47.306]  Trying to get conservatives to go along with that than everybody else.
[02:12:47.306 --> 02:12:49.928]  And so how do we organize to fight this, Mark Dice?
[02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:53.731]  Because this is clearly, they got caught flat-footed in 2016.
[02:12:53.731 --> 02:12:55.392]  They're not getting caught flat-footed now.
[02:12:55.392 --> 02:12:57.213]  The President needs to act.
[02:12:57.213 --> 02:12:58.534]  The White House needs to take action.
[02:13:00.071 --> 02:13:01.372]  We need more people to get involved.
[02:13:01.372 --> 02:13:03.634]  We need to do things the old-fashioned way like you were mentioning.
[02:13:03.634 --> 02:13:04.815]  We need to go to websites.
[02:13:04.815 --> 02:13:07.176]  We need to bookmark websites on the browsers.
[02:13:07.176 --> 02:13:15.642]  We can't rely on just scrolling through a social media feed and expect to see the articles and the pages and the people that we're following to actually show up.
[02:13:15.642 --> 02:13:23.108]  We've been seeing this continuing to expand over the last 10 years and now it's so obvious that they're literally admitting it.
[02:13:23.348 --> 02:13:26.409]  We've suspected a lot of these things were happening.
[02:13:26.409 --> 02:13:35.154]  We've noticed that some weird things were happening with our subscribers, with our views, and with our videos and posts sort of disappearing and the views stalling out.
[02:13:35.154 --> 02:13:40.016]  Tremendous growth over years all of a sudden vanishing and reversing.
[02:13:40.636 --> 02:13:46.842]  People don't saying that they're not getting the notification, so they've been tweaking the system and they're going to continue to tweak it.
[02:13:46.842 --> 02:13:48.164]  We need more people to get involved.
[02:13:48.164 --> 02:13:57.553]  We need to keep sending out old-fashioned emails, texting videos, bookmarking the websites, and they're not only trying to censor our message,
[02:13:57.993 --> 02:14:02.955]  But they're also trying to cripple us financially so that people can't do this full time.
[02:14:02.955 --> 02:14:08.778]  And they also misrepresent what we've said and what we do while not letting us respond to what's happening.
[02:14:08.778 --> 02:14:14.381]  So understand folks, you see a Mark Dice video, a Paul Watson video, an Alex Jones video, whichever one you think is most important.
[02:14:15.001 --> 02:14:15.842]  Hand-share it.
[02:14:15.842 --> 02:14:17.503]  Tell people it's forbidden.
[02:14:17.503 --> 02:14:18.283]  It's verboten.
[02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:19.704]  Send it out on your own email.
[02:14:19.704 --> 02:14:20.845]  Sign up for our newsletters.
[02:14:20.845 --> 02:14:22.026]  This is a war.
[02:14:22.026 --> 02:14:24.928]  Don't think just because Trump got in, we're going to win this.
[02:14:24.928 --> 02:14:26.949]  They are making their move.
[02:14:26.949 --> 02:14:30.651]  And what's crazy is, Mark, most members of Congress and folks aren't even aware of this.
[02:14:30.651 --> 02:14:32.172]  I've sent the report to the president.
[02:14:32.172 --> 02:14:33.053]  He's now gotten it.
[02:14:33.053 --> 02:14:35.695]  I'm talking to folks as we were just speaking.
[02:14:35.695 --> 02:14:37.996]  They're all asking, you know, what should we do?
[02:14:37.996 --> 02:14:38.957]  I say it's in the report.
[02:14:38.957 --> 02:14:39.998]  So imagine.
[02:14:40.638 --> 02:14:46.662]  Just like we innovated internet and dominated, I with more subscribers than CNN, you with more than other big channels.
[02:14:46.662 --> 02:14:48.704]  Think about how panicked they are.
[02:14:48.704 --> 02:14:51.446]  So again, we don't think of ourselves as big shots.
[02:14:51.446 --> 02:14:53.708]  What I'm saying is, we're the trailblazers, man.
[02:14:53.708 --> 02:14:54.228]  We are.
[02:14:54.228 --> 02:14:55.369]  We have to act like that.
[02:14:57.404 --> 02:15:01.806]  We saw this new technology emerge, started using it, started dominating it.
[02:15:01.806 --> 02:15:07.109]  They were asleep at the wheel, and now they're regretfully trying to stomp us down.
[02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:13.932]  And now because we've won Wimbledon 15 times in a row, they're just saying, Mark Dice and Alex Jones and all you other guys, you're not allowed on the field.
[02:15:13.932 --> 02:15:15.292]  We're like, but we're the winners.
[02:15:15.292 --> 02:15:16.052]  We play by the rules.
[02:15:16.052 --> 02:15:16.553]  They go, no!
[02:15:17.373 --> 02:15:25.208]  Anderson Cooper, the little, you know, billionaire heir son, you know, one of the oldest Robert Barron families, he is God.
[02:15:25.208 --> 02:15:26.771]  We will force-feed him to everyone.
[02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:37.233]  Now, you may recall, much of the audience, I think this is probably part of pop culture now, the YouTube ad-pocalypse that happened last April, when all of a sudden the mass demonetization hit.
[02:15:37.233 --> 02:15:46.416]  They rolled out their new demonetization features to scroll through the audio transcripts looking for keywords in videos that people say and then demonetize them.
[02:15:46.416 --> 02:15:52.958]  So then, one year later, in April of this year, CNN did their own expose, just like the Wall Street Journal did.
[02:15:52.958 --> 02:15:54.879]  Stay there, we'll talk about the next strike on freedom.
[02:15:55.279 --> 02:15:59.501]  Now there's a proven powerful anti-inflammatory that absorbs 40 times better.

[02:17:56.084 --> 02:18:03.772]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:18:03.772 --> 02:18:04.233]  It's you!
[02:18:05.350 --> 02:18:07.531]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:18:07.531 --> 02:18:16.277]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:18:16.277 --> 02:18:20.840]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:22.301]  You are the info war.
[02:18:22.301 --> 02:18:25.823]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:18:26.503 --> 02:18:37.887]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:37.887 --> 02:18:45.850]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:52.433]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:52.893 --> 02:18:55.935]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[02:18:55.935 --> 02:19:06.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:08.361]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.581 --> 02:19:11.442]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.442 --> 02:19:12.922]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:12.922 --> 02:19:19.763]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.763 --> 02:19:21.844]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.844 --> 02:19:31.546]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.546 --> 02:19:36.527]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[02:19:36.647 --> 02:19:48.354]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.354 --> 02:19:51.656]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.656 --> 02:19:59.260]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:01.902]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.108 --> 02:20:07.689]  We've got it.
[02:20:07.689 --> 02:20:14.194]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:20:14.194 --> 02:20:18.117]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:18.117 --> 02:20:24.061]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:20:24.061 --> 02:20:24.281]  Look.
[02:20:29.324 --> 02:20:33.467]  I played a disgusting Brian Stelter clip earlier, but I'm going to play it and get Mark Dices taped on it.
[02:20:33.467 --> 02:20:34.307]  It's one minute long.
[02:20:34.307 --> 02:20:36.068]  Him saying, I control reality.
[02:20:36.068 --> 02:20:36.628]  I'm God.
[02:20:36.628 --> 02:20:38.830]  I say Trump can't be trusted.
[02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:41.672]  I say you're a Russian agent if you meet with Putin.
[02:20:41.672 --> 02:20:47.315]  I say Trump shouldn't be able to meet alone with the Russian president, which all presidents have done.
[02:20:47.315 --> 02:20:50.297]  Again, it's just a little pathetic nobody doing it, but...
[02:20:52.179 --> 02:21:01.124]  Just as he got to the break, we'll play it in a minute, they launched their new attack in April this year, and CNN said ban InfoWars, ban everybody else, and now they're in the news.
[02:21:01.124 --> 02:21:02.904]  I think they've miscalculated, Mark.
[02:21:02.904 --> 02:21:11.229]  To brazenly demand we be completely deplatformed shows what incredible authoritarians they are, or have they been slowly censoring everybody so long
[02:21:11.989 --> 02:21:14.513]  Everybody just kind of hears, okay, censorship of conservatives.
[02:21:14.513 --> 02:21:17.076]  Yeah, we know, but we're conservatives, we'll take it.
[02:21:17.076 --> 02:21:18.999]  No, we're being robbed.
[02:21:18.999 --> 02:21:20.000]  We're being attacked.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.482]  This is how they intend to take over.
[02:21:21.482 --> 02:21:22.063]  Mark, what do you think?
[02:21:23.399 --> 02:21:26.960]  They've lost half their audience permanently for generations.
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:31.602]  Nobody's going to ever trust CNN, MSNBC, most of these mainstream media outlets.
[02:21:31.602 --> 02:21:38.964]  So every time that they try to censor us or call for censorship, all that's doing is proving our point of why we don't watch them.
[02:21:38.964 --> 02:21:43.365]  Half of the country has permanently abandoned watching those platforms.
[02:21:43.365 --> 02:21:46.126]  So all they're doing is speaking to the choir.
[02:21:46.126 --> 02:21:47.087]  They're singing to the choir.
[02:21:47.087 --> 02:21:48.007]  It's an echo chamber.
[02:21:48.687 --> 02:21:53.491]  And CNN, many of us remember, used to actually cover some news.
[02:21:53.491 --> 02:22:04.300]  They used to focus on a few stories for weeks on end to draw out the dramatic effect or some celebrity murder or some interesting event or natural disaster.
[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:07.222]  Now it's all Trump-bashing 24-7.
[02:22:07.222 --> 02:22:15.229]  So even people who used to watch CNN, who aren't even really conservatives or into alternative media, are tuning out and coming into outlets like us.
[02:22:15.896 --> 02:22:21.964]  Which is why we've been dominating, which is why they're also trying to not only just censor us, but cripple financially.
[02:22:21.964 --> 02:22:33.140]  CNN in April literally targeted YouTube and said that they're funding, the advertisers are still playing ads on offensive content and racist content and all this.
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:37.481]  CNN's literally trying to financially cripple YouTubers.
[02:22:37.481 --> 02:22:44.163]  I was stunned when I saw them literally, this is the second time now that they've just overtly tried to shut down InfoWars.
[02:22:44.163 --> 02:22:46.304]  One, when you had a strike on your channel.
[02:22:46.304 --> 02:22:50.105]  Okay, well two strikes away from being shut down, that's not a news story.
[02:22:50.105 --> 02:22:54.267]  I mean, maybe if you were, you know, shut down or one strike away.
[02:22:54.267 --> 02:23:02.129]  But it was CNN that filed the fake complaints saying I said no one died at Parkland, so they admitted they were the ones complaining.
[02:23:03.266 --> 02:23:07.808]  And now they're literally admitting that they're the ones that are pressuring Facebook to ban you!
[02:23:07.808 --> 02:23:19.493]  I mean, to have one news organization, which is probably the most inaccurate fake news outlet, CNN, claiming that another news outlet should be shut down is preposterous.
[02:23:19.493 --> 02:23:26.216]  And so again, today, Facebook started their $90 million campaign to stream not just
[02:23:26.897 --> 02:23:33.762]  So their answer is force-feed us more of their crap, censor whatever's really popular, and they've all got these weird, you-know-what-eating grins.
[02:23:33.762 --> 02:23:34.363]  They're so delusional.
[02:23:53.271 --> 02:23:56.474]  Well, they're making $15,000 a day.
[02:23:56.474 --> 02:24:06.041]  I mean, just imagine, they're making, in a week, what more than an average American makes all year to sit in a studio and talk for an hour a day with a couple hours of prep.
[02:24:06.041 --> 02:24:11.526]  I mean, Anderson Cooper literally makes $15,000 to $20,000 every single show.
[02:24:11.526 --> 02:24:15.088]  And so, he pretends to connect with the average American, which is absurd.
[02:24:15.088 --> 02:24:16.750]  These people are actors.
[02:24:17.472 --> 02:24:21.434]  And they're trying to shut down, of course, any alternative emerging social media networks.
[02:24:21.434 --> 02:24:28.537]  You've had Andrew Torba on, founder and CEO of Gab, which has been prevented from having their app in the App Store.
[02:24:28.537 --> 02:24:35.680]  And, meanwhile, they're censoring Gab from having an app in the App Store, saying that it's offensive content on the platform.
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:43.384]  Meanwhile, in the Apple App Store right now, and this has been the case for well over a year, there are slap Donald Trump video games.
[02:24:43.704 --> 02:24:50.469]  So there are literally games in the App Store for Apple that encourage violence against the President of the United States.
[02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:53.371]  Sure, so there's total censorship, total draconian control.
[02:24:53.371 --> 02:24:54.691]  They're arrogant monsters.
[02:24:54.691 --> 02:24:55.892]  Congress needs to act.
[02:24:55.892 --> 02:24:57.473]  The problem is they're not informed.
[02:24:57.473 --> 02:25:01.676]  That's why Mike Adams and I and others put together this report with Paul Watson.
[02:25:01.676 --> 02:25:03.097]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:25:03.097 --> 02:25:09.061]  We need to get to Congress and have them take action for antitrust, civil rights violations, racketeering, you name it.
[02:25:10.717 --> 02:25:12.199]  Thankfully we have Donald Trump Jr.
[02:25:12.199 --> 02:25:26.893]  on our team who is, you know, a Generation Xer who's familiar with the power of social media and so he has the ear, obviously, of his dad and so he can get some information to him because YouTube was sort of left on the sideburner, forgotten about, and this whole
[02:25:27.543 --> 02:25:28.044]  Thank you.
[02:25:42.503 --> 02:25:43.823]  Well, it must be shut down.
[02:25:43.823 --> 02:25:46.744]  It's how brazen they are.
[02:25:46.744 --> 02:25:48.305]  Let's play this Brian Stelter clip.
[02:25:48.305 --> 02:25:52.006]  You may have seen it hours before Trump met with Putin.
[02:25:52.006 --> 02:25:58.988]  This is the dribble where he sits there and says, I control reality, like Cuomo saying, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, only I am.
[02:25:58.988 --> 02:26:02.570]  The arrogance of these people is only matched by their low ratings.
[02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:02.930]  Here it is.
[02:26:03.985 --> 02:26:10.227]  Putin and Trump plan to meet for a private one-on-one conversation before official talks begin.
[02:26:10.227 --> 02:26:12.647]  No aides, no notetakers.
[02:26:12.647 --> 02:26:15.608]  So we'll never really know what is said.
[02:26:15.608 --> 02:26:20.870]  Because really, can we trust either man?
[02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:23.910]  No, we can't.
[02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:30.172]  In the past, the US President's words have projected power and shaped global decisions.
[02:26:30.172 --> 02:26:32.973]  What the President said meant something, it meant a lot.
[02:26:34.005 --> 02:26:36.586]  But not now, not anymore.
[02:26:36.586 --> 02:26:47.150]  What President Trump says is so frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power, the same impact as past presidents.
[02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:48.611]  It's a shame, but it's true.
[02:26:50.014 --> 02:26:52.216]  Trump simply cannot be trusted.
[02:26:52.216 --> 02:26:54.798]  He has proven this himself time and time again.
[02:26:54.798 --> 02:26:58.480]  It's his own lies and his own contradictions that have proven it.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:03.964]  And that is why this is a profound test for journalists.
[02:27:03.964 --> 02:27:09.789]  It's a shame, but it's true for one of the biggest liars on the planet.
[02:27:09.789 --> 02:27:12.311]  It's just profound, the projection, Mark, guys.
[02:27:13.723 --> 02:27:17.524]  It sounded like Brian Stelter's inhaling helium before that segment.
[02:27:17.524 --> 02:27:19.304]  And everything that they say is projection.
[02:27:19.304 --> 02:27:21.485]  Everything that they accuse others of, they're guilty of.
[02:27:21.485 --> 02:27:26.946]  Brian Stelter recently was at a forum for journalists at the Aspen Institute to think tank.
[02:27:26.946 --> 02:27:33.748]  And he was asked a question by one of the audience members who said, you know, I'm old enough to remember when, you know, CNN actually covered news.
[02:27:33.748 --> 02:27:34.908]  Now it's all Trump 24-7.
[02:27:36.108 --> 02:27:37.969]  And he said, well, we're in an emergency.
[02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:39.150]  This is an emergency.
[02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:41.912]  The President Trump is in the White House.
[02:27:41.912 --> 02:27:50.477]  So I guess it's an emergency that the black unemployment's at an all-time low, that the economy is booming, that the streets are getting safer.
[02:27:50.477 --> 02:28:01.964]  It's an emergency to the globalists because he's the biggest obstacle to their plan to destroy the United States, which is why for the last year and a half now, they've just been going overboard and completely freaking out.
[02:28:01.964 --> 02:28:04.205]  Oh, one thing I want to mention about the censorship on YouTube.
[02:28:04.205 --> 02:28:04.645]  It's so funny.
[02:28:04.645 --> 02:28:05.346]  They're burying
[02:28:05.886 --> 02:28:32.624]  So much content that if you search for my number one most viewed video, which has about 9 million views, President Trump's or Donald Trump's funniest insults and comebacks, it would or used to be the number one search result, but now it's literally buried under 50 other videos and all of the videos on top of it are all mainstream news sources because now they've realized that YouTube is a search engine
[02:28:33.044 --> 02:28:36.546]  As opposed, in conjunction with a distribution platform.
[02:28:36.546 --> 02:28:36.806]  That's right.
[02:28:36.806 --> 02:28:37.466]  Stay there though.
[02:28:37.466 --> 02:28:38.266]  Let's explain that.
[02:28:38.266 --> 02:28:40.127]  Because used to even our own feeds would be our videos.
[02:28:40.127 --> 02:28:41.108]  Now it's not.
[02:28:41.108 --> 02:28:44.329]  Sasha Barrett Cohen engaged in fraud is on the front.
[02:28:44.329 --> 02:28:46.090]  Couple hundred thousand views.
[02:28:46.090 --> 02:28:48.351]  Our videos with millions are on the front page.
[02:28:48.351 --> 02:28:49.732]  Again, total fraud.
[02:28:49.732 --> 02:28:50.972]  Total control.
[02:28:50.972 --> 02:28:51.853]  But we have the truth.
[02:28:55.350 --> 02:28:58.391]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[02:28:58.391 --> 02:29:02.372]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[02:29:02.372 --> 02:29:03.633]  The Bug-A-Salt.

[02:31:48.254 --> 02:31:50.395]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:31:50.395 --> 02:31:53.036]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:56.258 --> 02:31:58.200]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:00.201]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:32:00.201 --> 02:32:04.645]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:32:04.645 --> 02:32:09.008]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[02:32:09.008 --> 02:32:14.113]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:32:14.113 --> 02:32:17.856]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:21.001]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:32:21.001 --> 02:32:22.941]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:32:22.941 --> 02:32:26.082]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:32:26.082 --> 02:32:33.224]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:32:33.224 --> 02:32:35.105]  We have record sales going on right now.

[02:32:51.201 --> 02:32:54.442]  This 4th of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[02:32:54.442 --> 02:32:58.782]  Infowarestore.com.
[02:32:58.782 --> 02:33:01.463]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.839 --> 02:33:18.823]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:33:18.823 --> 02:33:31.390]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:33:33.391 --> 02:33:37.173]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[02:33:37.173 --> 02:33:41.536]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:33:41.536 --> 02:33:43.638]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[02:33:46.311 --> 02:33:48.051]  Well, the society unravels.
[02:33:48.051 --> 02:33:53.112]  Men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[02:33:53.112 --> 02:33:59.614]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[02:33:59.614 --> 02:34:01.634]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[02:34:01.634 --> 02:34:02.614]  It's fulfilling.
[02:34:02.614 --> 02:34:03.715]  InfoWars.
[02:34:03.715 --> 02:34:04.895]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:34:04.895 --> 02:34:06.095]  Today.
[02:34:06.095 --> 02:34:10.276]  Alright, I've done two and a half hours of live broadcast that have not plugged yet.
[02:34:10.276 --> 02:34:10.376]  And...
[02:34:11.769 --> 02:34:13.850]  Quite frankly, it's just because I'm so focused on the news.
[02:34:13.850 --> 02:34:15.211]  But that's how we finance things.
[02:34:15.211 --> 02:34:17.153]  I want to thank you all that buy products.
[02:34:17.153 --> 02:34:18.293]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:18.293 --> 02:34:19.795]  You see mainstream media obsessed with it.
[02:34:19.795 --> 02:34:21.636]  They want it shut down.
[02:34:21.636 --> 02:34:26.319]  Supplements, books, videos, great t-shirts, you name it.
[02:34:26.319 --> 02:34:29.521]  We've got... Vox Dei has come out.
[02:34:29.521 --> 02:34:34.264]  We're the only libertarian conservative comic books out there.
[02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:36.326]  They've already gone to number one on Amazon.
[02:34:36.326 --> 02:34:37.987]  We got a couple thousand of these in.
[02:34:37.987 --> 02:34:38.347]  They're $5 a piece.
[02:34:40.831 --> 02:34:41.872]  Want to be politically incorrect?
[02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:42.373]  Buy these.
[02:34:42.373 --> 02:34:47.698]  Give them to your, you know, 10th grade students, your 6th grade students, whatever.
[02:34:47.698 --> 02:34:50.160]  Or donate them to the library.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:56.126]  Alt-Hero Crackdown, Volume 1, talking about how they're shutting down the free speech.
[02:34:56.126 --> 02:34:57.588]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:59.025 --> 02:35:03.409]  So get the nice color comic book.
[02:35:03.409 --> 02:35:07.072]  It's a revolutionary act to go into these areas.
[02:35:07.072 --> 02:35:09.755]  You see Christian films now dominating Hollywood.
[02:35:09.755 --> 02:35:13.398]  This, what's happening, we're getting on the playing field.
[02:35:13.398 --> 02:35:25.488]  Also, I'm not going to spend time on it because it's so complex and so cool that I don't want to take the time up from Mark Dice, but we have Super Silver Wound Gel now available.
[02:35:26.488 --> 02:35:30.611]  That has the strongest silver you can get without a prescription.
[02:35:30.611 --> 02:35:35.214]  I remember talking about how great silver was when the other antibiotics and things aren't working.
[02:35:35.214 --> 02:35:37.616]  Twenty years ago in the media saying, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:37.616 --> 02:35:45.842]  Now you go to the Walgreens and they're selling it or you get a prescription for, you know, a hundred bucks and the hospitals are using it, you know, spray bottles everywhere.
[02:35:45.842 --> 02:35:49.025]  But super silver wound gel use silver salt technology.
[02:35:50.481 --> 02:35:55.503]  It's an advanced patented technology that has forever changed the colloidal nano silver market.
[02:35:55.503 --> 02:35:57.904]  This has been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[02:35:57.904 --> 02:36:10.108]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as a first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity study done on any silver product, but it's for topical use.
[02:36:10.108 --> 02:36:16.610]  The formula is 24 ppm, 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:18.531]  Well, you can sell over-the-counter.
[02:36:18.531 --> 02:36:21.993]  This is an over-the-counter product, which had to be clear to the FDA.
[02:36:21.993 --> 02:36:23.734]  It's 24 ppm.
[02:36:23.734 --> 02:36:25.796]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:36:25.796 --> 02:36:26.176]  It's $29.95.
[02:36:26.176 --> 02:36:38.724]  It is one of the only OTC products where you can make direct claims against MRSA, VRE, and many other deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[02:36:38.724 --> 02:36:42.767]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn,
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:47.663]  Super Silver Wound Gel is essentially armor for your wounds.
[02:36:47.663 --> 02:36:52.027]  It is a protective barrier that guards the wounds and helps keep them from getting infected.
[02:36:52.027 --> 02:36:57.332]  The barrier of protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[02:36:57.332 --> 02:37:02.156]  It is perfect for athletes, particularly of all ages, in all sports areas.
[02:37:02.156 --> 02:37:03.517]  That's how it originally got developed.
[02:37:03.517 --> 02:37:04.658]  It's sold under a brand name for $40.
[02:37:06.326 --> 02:37:09.369]  And I'm going to just leave it at that, but they're patriots that let us private label it.
[02:37:09.369 --> 02:37:10.890]  We're selling it for $29.95.
[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:14.653]  It cost us a lot to secure it because it said to get FDA approval.
[02:37:14.653 --> 02:37:18.236]  So can you imagine how much it cost to get this FDA cleared?
[02:37:18.236 --> 02:37:23.060]  Even though it's been approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sale, we can't even say, we say cleared.
[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:24.721]  That's what a police state in this country is.
[02:37:24.721 --> 02:37:26.743]  This is cleared by the FDA.
[02:37:26.743 --> 02:37:31.647]  But this is the strongest over-the-counter silver in existence.
[02:37:32.825 --> 02:37:34.167]  Supersilver.
[02:37:34.167 --> 02:37:38.171]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:38.171 --> 02:37:43.036]  We've got another big, huge Defeat the Democrats censorship sale, one of the biggest ever running.
[02:37:43.036 --> 02:37:43.937]  I haven't even plugged it yet.
[02:37:43.937 --> 02:37:45.539]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:37:45.539 --> 02:37:46.540]  Mark Dice, coming back to you.
[02:37:48.208 --> 02:38:06.664]  This is the dastardliness of mainstream media being arrogant while you had a billion views, and I had five billion views, and you had all these best-selling books, and they would all just laugh at us when we would do a video and, you know, get a million views, and then Anderson Cooper would do one and have 5,000 on their channel.
[02:38:07.478 --> 02:38:13.203]  So now Facebook 90 million investment to act like CNN's this god to buy the content.
[02:38:13.203 --> 02:38:16.926]  It's like buying dog turds to then force feed it to everybody.
[02:38:16.926 --> 02:38:18.507]  It just shows what a joke it is.
[02:38:18.507 --> 02:38:23.811]  And even if they try to censor and ban everybody, I don't see people going back on the plantation.
[02:38:23.811 --> 02:38:26.853]  I don't think Humpty Dumpty can be put back together again.
[02:38:26.853 --> 02:38:27.314]  What do you think?
[02:38:28.533 --> 02:38:43.918]  No, they've completely ruined their brand name recognition, which is why now we're seeing newer media companies like Vox, which actually owns a whole dozen or so of media companies, to then try to fill the internet with all these various different brands.
[02:38:44.398 --> 02:38:57.964]  Oh, it's Axios News, it's The Verge, it's Vox Media, all these new brands so that people sort of think that it's a newer emerging company when really it's part of the same umbrella.
[02:38:57.964 --> 02:39:10.530]  It's going to be interesting to see if CNN or if Facebook shows the view count of their new shows on their watch pages because what if only 50,000 people, 100,000 people are watching these shows?
[02:39:10.530 --> 02:39:11.631]  MTV News
[02:39:12.291 --> 02:39:19.896]  Can put out a video of an interview with a major celebrity on their YouTube channel, and it barely gets a thousand views.
[02:39:19.896 --> 02:39:21.237]  Nobody cares.
[02:39:21.237 --> 02:39:33.105]  And the power of the individual and the individual YouTuber, the individual Facebook user, so important because Mitt Romney, they say lost, potentially lost.
[02:39:33.105 --> 02:39:36.768]  I mean, let's just say there was no, you know, no voter fraud manipulation.
[02:39:37.466 --> 02:39:38.888]  It was a fair system.
[02:39:38.888 --> 02:39:52.464]  Many analysts credit Mitt Romney with losing the 2012 election because of that YouTube video of him at an event, at a fundraiser, where he was talking trash about the 47% of Americans who are never going to vote for him.
[02:39:52.464 --> 02:39:57.610]  He was at a fundraiser, the bartender propped up his cell phone on the table, took a video of it.
[02:39:57.990 --> 02:40:10.318]  Just posted it on YouTube and it organically spread and that upset so many people that they literally, the analysts, Republican analysts credit that as diminishing his credibility beyond repair.
[02:40:10.318 --> 02:40:20.484]  So that's the power of one individual with a cell phone posting on YouTube and now obviously Twitter and Facebook and Instagram all have these video capabilities.
[02:40:20.484 --> 02:40:21.885]  And so we now know their answer.
[02:40:22.745 --> 02:40:25.109]  Is to govern everybody back.
[02:40:25.109 --> 02:40:25.950]  That's their answer.
[02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:30.057]  But people see, people know Axios is a clone of Politico.
[02:40:30.057 --> 02:40:33.803]  So as fast as they get discredited they create new bodies.
[02:40:33.803 --> 02:40:35.165]  I think they're admitting defeat here, Mark.
[02:40:36.707 --> 02:40:37.967]  I don't know how they're going to hold on.
[02:40:37.967 --> 02:40:43.329]  They're going to get more and more desperate as the midterms approach and then as the 2020 election approaches.
[02:40:43.329 --> 02:40:49.671]  I think they're going to just keep on stumbling over their own, what they're hoping are going to be stepping stones.
[02:40:49.671 --> 02:40:55.993]  Because the Trump train is so engaged that we didn't just relax after the election.
[02:40:55.993 --> 02:40:59.294]  We didn't fall asleep at the wheel and think we'll vote again in four years.
[02:40:59.294 --> 02:41:02.875]  This movement is so energized that we're constantly watching.
[02:41:04.916 --> 02:41:14.803]  You and I have pretty big audiences, pretty big channels, but everybody who has a small YouTube channel of a thousand subscribers... All of it together, and that's the key.
[02:41:14.803 --> 02:41:18.666]  Our listeners, our viewers, no matter who you are, it's like whack-a-mole.
[02:41:18.666 --> 02:41:27.632]  I see female, black, you name it, YouTubers that are just as smart as you and I, emerging Facebookers with millions of views because they haven't censored them yet.
[02:41:28.132 --> 02:41:28.993]  Then they censor him.
[02:41:28.993 --> 02:41:29.915]  They start a new channel.
[02:41:29.915 --> 02:41:30.355]  It's big.
[02:41:30.355 --> 02:41:31.377]  Then they censor him.
[02:41:31.377 --> 02:41:32.118]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:41:32.118 --> 02:41:35.963]  People now get it so they know to follow whatever they're not allowed to have.
[02:41:35.963 --> 02:41:38.747]  So again, how do the globalists get around the Streisand effect?
[02:41:40.526 --> 02:41:40.866]  I don't know.
[02:42:02.268 --> 02:42:10.870]  I'll start tweeting to the YouTube CEO, to Susan Wojcicki, who says that just interrupting her is a sexist microaggression.
[02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:16.571]  So we have to just continue to counter every move that they make because they're so desperate.
[02:42:16.571 --> 02:42:17.911]  They've been failing.
[02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:19.151]  We're winning.
[02:42:19.151 --> 02:42:21.071]  And we just have to keep it up.
[02:42:21.071 --> 02:42:22.792]  I don't think we're in uncharted territory.
[02:42:22.792 --> 02:42:23.852]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:42:23.852 --> 02:42:25.212]  I don't think they know what's going to happen.
[02:42:25.212 --> 02:42:26.052]  No, I agree.
[02:42:26.052 --> 02:42:28.673]  But we'll come back in the final segment with Max from Averginia.
[02:42:28.673 --> 02:42:29.333]  Now, here's the good news.
[02:42:29.833 --> 02:42:31.894]  We don't just have Trump in our awakening here.
[02:42:31.894 --> 02:42:39.456]  All over the world, nationalism, capitalism is the hottest thing, especially with Generation Z. I'm telling you, the worm is turning.
[02:42:39.456 --> 02:42:42.797]  It's an exciting time to be alive, but the enemy counterstrikes straight ahead.
[02:42:42.797 --> 02:42:43.897]  MarkDice.com.

[02:45:00.285 --> 02:45:06.029]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:13.894]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.894 --> 02:45:17.036]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:17.236 --> 02:45:22.499]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[02:46:03.582 --> 02:46:07.364]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.364 --> 02:46:16.068]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.068 --> 02:46:20.670]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:22.110]  You are the info war.
[02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:25.652]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[02:46:45.685 --> 02:46:52.730]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:55.472]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:59.733 --> 02:47:03.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:03.637 --> 02:47:08.943]  Big Brother.
[02:47:08.943 --> 02:47:10.745]  Mainstream media.
[02:47:10.745 --> 02:47:12.647]  Government cover-ups.
[02:47:12.647 --> 02:47:14.328]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:47:14.328 --> 02:47:15.990]  Well, so does he.
[02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:20.535]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:25.521 --> 02:47:31.405]  I don't make Tokyo Rose-type announcements or Baghdad Bob announcements like, Globalist, you've been defeated.
[02:47:31.405 --> 02:47:32.967]  Come out with your hands up.
[02:47:32.967 --> 02:47:33.567]  There's the deal.
[02:47:33.567 --> 02:47:36.509]  They thought they'd use the web to dumb us down, to force-feed their garbage.
[02:47:36.509 --> 02:47:37.810]  They were arrogant.
[02:47:37.810 --> 02:47:40.612]  Now they're going to try to block innovation.
[02:47:40.612 --> 02:47:42.834]  They're going to try to block free ideas.
[02:47:42.834 --> 02:47:43.734]  It's not going to work.
[02:47:43.734 --> 02:47:50.679]  They can try to pick InfoWars as a lead pony to take out as a precedent, and it's important to fight for that, but they're going to lose in the end.
[02:47:50.679 --> 02:47:52.461]  And I was thinking about, I forget who put the tweet out.
[02:47:53.513 --> 02:48:09.336]  It might have been Donald Trump Jr., a few months ago, when it came out that CNN, we already knew this, but I guess it's a proverbial evergreen story, has to pay in bars and pay in hotels and pay at bus terminals and train stations and airports to have their crap force fit.
[02:48:09.336 --> 02:48:10.836]  And it's in all the high schools in the country.
[02:48:10.836 --> 02:48:13.997]  They pay for the TVs and the cable in the school.
[02:48:13.997 --> 02:48:18.117]  When they've got to pay to make you watch it and listen to it, what does that tell you?
[02:48:18.117 --> 02:48:20.358]  So the question was, how much would you have to be paid?
[02:48:21.294 --> 02:48:22.615]  To watch CNN.
[02:48:22.615 --> 02:48:27.357]  I mean a year ago they were less popular than reruns of Yogi Bear.
[02:48:27.357 --> 02:48:29.179]  Now they're a shadow of that.
[02:48:29.179 --> 02:48:31.720]  So of course they're, we are the authority!
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:34.221]  We are the only ones that can read WikiLeaks!
[02:48:34.221 --> 02:48:35.242]  Shut down Trump!
[02:48:35.242 --> 02:48:36.062]  Trump is a liar!
[02:48:36.062 --> 02:48:37.723]  InfoWars is a liar!
[02:48:37.723 --> 02:48:43.647]  But I'm actually surprised we still have massive traffic at InfoWars and our core audience is great.
[02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:45.368]  But this isn't a bigger deal.
[02:48:46.405 --> 02:48:53.930]  That they're all over the news saying, oh don't worry, we've already shadow banned conservatives and we're already blocking push notifications of Trump's tweets.
[02:48:53.930 --> 02:48:56.512]  That's antitrust violations.
[02:48:56.512 --> 02:49:11.843]  So Mark, separate from what we do on air talking about this, we need to get Congress, we need to get the President, we need everyone informed because this attempt to take over the internet is outrageous.
[02:49:11.843 --> 02:49:13.464]  It just shows how arrogant they are.
[02:49:13.464 --> 02:49:15.946]  So how do you see all this unfolding?
[02:49:17.045 --> 02:49:28.194]  Yeah, we need to talk to our congressman, congressperson, and get them to be educated about these issues because we saw during the Mark Zuckerberg hearing, several hours, there were literally only about three decent questions.
[02:49:28.194 --> 02:49:34.739]  Ted Cruz asked, you know, Ted Cruz obviously knows what's going on, but there were three decent questions asked of Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:49:34.739 --> 02:49:36.380]  These congressmen don't know the power of this.
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:39.883]  They don't know about the algorithms and the push notifications and the censorship.
[02:49:40.243 --> 02:49:43.044]  And of course, there's no transparency from Facebook.
[02:49:43.044 --> 02:49:45.605]  They don't tell you which pages have been censored.
[02:49:45.605 --> 02:49:48.886]  They don't show you, oh well you violated our policies.
[02:49:48.886 --> 02:49:50.286]  There's no transparency.
[02:49:50.286 --> 02:49:52.747]  There's no option to appeal.
[02:49:52.747 --> 02:49:55.508]  It's they say what they want to do and they do it.
[02:49:55.508 --> 02:49:57.249]  There's no way around it.
[02:49:57.249 --> 02:50:01.310]  And Facebook responded to the CNN reporter when he called for your
[02:50:01.988 --> 02:50:02.488]  We're good to go.
[02:50:22.777 --> 02:50:25.079]  Why is CNN allowed to have a platform?
[02:50:25.079 --> 02:50:30.944]  I don't think there's been a news outlet that's been more incorrect about more issues than CNN.
[02:50:30.944 --> 02:50:32.545]  So why is it that they're even allowed on there?
[02:50:32.545 --> 02:50:33.666]  And of course they should be allowed.
[02:50:33.666 --> 02:50:35.568]  I'm not for censorship.
[02:50:35.568 --> 02:50:38.510]  No, I agree, but how are they the policeman that decides?
[02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:41.273]  It's like having Hitler shit over the Nuremberg trials.
[02:50:42.005 --> 02:50:47.348]  Because they're all friends, and the Sun Valley Conference just happened in Idaho, which is an annual Bilderberg of tech media.
[02:50:47.348 --> 02:50:58.836]  So Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, all these heads of all the media and social media companies were there, this small little resort town where they meet every year, to talk about the new policies, the new censorship.
[02:50:58.836 --> 02:51:08.802]  So we're obviously not in the good old boy club, whereas you have the executives, you know, Jeff Zucker from CNN's over there, all these guys, so they're sitting around in a room having
[02:51:09.202 --> 02:51:12.605]  Lunch, talking about what they're going to do and who's not going to get censored.
[02:51:12.605 --> 02:51:18.329]  So that's why we're just not part of the club, as George Carlin said.
[02:51:18.329 --> 02:51:22.692]  And even Google is censoring their own Google custom news feed.
[02:51:22.692 --> 02:51:33.220]  You may have seen a few months ago, you used to be able to filter your Google news feed to custom search results, but now they just show you what's recommended for you.
[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:37.203]  And I guess you can go to your favorites page on Google News.
[02:51:37.763 --> 02:51:42.165]  And now you have to click each individual topic that you have favorited.
[02:51:42.165 --> 02:51:43.485]  It's a whole mess.
[02:51:43.485 --> 02:51:45.466]  They're killing their own algorithm.
[02:51:45.466 --> 02:51:47.947]  I mean, I go to Bing now, even though it's Microsoft, for a big search engine.
[02:51:47.947 --> 02:51:49.308]  It works like Google used to.
[02:51:49.308 --> 02:51:50.408]  It's more fair.
[02:51:50.408 --> 02:51:51.528]  It's totally one-sided.
[02:51:51.528 --> 02:51:53.709]  You can't even get real medical news.
[02:51:53.709 --> 02:51:55.090]  You can't get anything about Hillary.
[02:51:55.090 --> 02:51:56.670]  It's all controlled.
[02:51:56.670 --> 02:52:00.052]  They've gone pure authoritarian in their desperateness, and I think they've jumped the shark.
[02:52:01.886 --> 02:52:04.467]  Mark, I think you've hit the heart of this, though.
[02:52:04.467 --> 02:52:10.569]  You can't force people to watch stuff, and I think they have gone too far.
[02:52:10.569 --> 02:52:20.231]  I think as long as we make a big deal about it, as long as we inform Congress, as long as our listeners understand it, and as long as our listeners understand this, and viewers, you've got to hand go to MarkDice.com.
[02:52:20.231 --> 02:52:21.952]  You've got to hand go to Infowars.com.
[02:52:21.952 --> 02:52:23.172]  You've got to hand share that.
[02:52:23.172 --> 02:52:25.513]  Go, hey, this is the verboten.
[02:52:25.513 --> 02:52:26.553]  This is the forbidden.
[02:52:26.553 --> 02:52:27.794]  Learn why.
[02:52:27.794 --> 02:52:29.134]  This is where they don't want you to go.
[02:52:30.799 --> 02:52:32.581]  You've got to go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:32.581 --> 02:52:35.004]  You've got to get a reelect Trump 45 shirt.
[02:52:35.004 --> 02:52:37.507]  You've got to get a me and Michael Wolverine shirt.
[02:52:37.507 --> 02:52:43.534]  You've got to get our Defeat Democrat censorship sale 50% off on all our best-selling items free shipping.
[02:52:43.534 --> 02:52:44.895]  We brought the Supercell back.
[02:52:46.617 --> 02:52:50.039]  Official app that works really great with live streaming, podcast, everything.
[02:52:50.039 --> 02:52:52.060]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:54.702]  You already are awake, so you're like, hey, we already know all this.
[02:52:54.702 --> 02:52:56.062]  The public doesn't.
[02:52:56.062 --> 02:52:58.384]  They are now ripe to be told what's happening.
[02:52:58.384 --> 02:52:59.844]  People are so ready to wake up.
[02:52:59.844 --> 02:53:01.305]  Mark Dice, let's move on to this.
[02:53:01.305 --> 02:53:05.067]  People go to MarkDice.com and also get some of your great t-shirts as well to fund you.
[02:53:05.067 --> 02:53:05.928]  Because it's a war, folks.
[02:53:05.928 --> 02:53:06.728]  These are war bonds.
[02:53:06.728 --> 02:53:08.989]  If you don't buy it, the enemy wins.
[02:53:08.989 --> 02:53:12.251]  Mark and I have already paid monetarily massively, you know, for telling the truth.
[02:53:12.251 --> 02:53:12.791]  We don't care.
[02:53:12.791 --> 02:53:13.412]  We just want to win.
[02:53:15.117 --> 02:53:22.141]  The bullying on the street, the attacks, the Uber drivers not driving conservatives, the harassment of conservatives.
[02:53:22.141 --> 02:53:23.742]  They clearly are hitting the streets.
[02:53:23.742 --> 02:53:25.463]  We need to hit the streets as well.
[02:53:25.463 --> 02:53:29.606]  When they try to censor us in cyberspace, more and more we need to do stuff on the streets as well.
[02:53:29.606 --> 02:53:32.868]  Can you speak to this whole attempt for them to start a civil war?
[02:53:34.921 --> 02:53:38.362]  You know, the Democrat Party is embracing violence as a whole.
[02:53:38.362 --> 02:53:45.345]  The fact that Maxine Waters hasn't been widely denounced by every Democrat in Congress is completely absurd.
[02:53:45.345 --> 02:53:48.666]  Their silence is acceptance.
[02:53:48.666 --> 02:53:55.089]  And they can shut us down online and then we're gonna have people start popping up and peacefully confronting some of these people.
[02:53:55.089 --> 02:54:03.912]  Like back, you know, 10 years ago, really before YouTube, we would see people peacefully confronting or shouting down from a distance the live cable news feeds.
[02:54:04.392 --> 02:54:06.513]  Some of your contests I think are fantastic.
[02:54:06.513 --> 02:54:14.995]  Maybe it's time for another Jam CNN contest where people can get on the air and jam them because holding signs up at sporting events.
[02:54:14.995 --> 02:54:19.357]  They're not going to stop us and we're not going to get violent like the Democrats.
[02:54:19.357 --> 02:54:25.359]  We're just going to be peacefully innovating and continuing to come up with new ideas.
[02:54:25.359 --> 02:54:29.420]  We need to start filling their Twitter feeds and Facebook pages with more messages.
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:32.061]  Every time Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, tweets
[02:54:32.924 --> 02:54:43.610]  He should have hundreds of responses in that thread about the double standards, about them censoring and banning Roger Stone, but allowing other Democrats to be on there.
[02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:53.436]  Censoring Roger Stone for just criticizing CNN anchors, or swearing at a CNN anchor, it's completely absurd, but allowing someone who's calling for the
[02:54:54.116 --> 02:54:58.617]  You know, the abuse of Donald Trump's children to still be allowed on that platform.
[02:54:58.617 --> 02:54:59.217]  It's absurd.
[02:54:59.217 --> 02:55:01.378]  So, we need to just get engaged.
[02:55:01.378 --> 02:55:11.321]  I want every time Jack Dorsey tweets something to be filled with hundreds of tweets responding, pointing out their hypocrisy, linking to certain videos.
[02:55:11.321 --> 02:55:14.602]  Same with Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.
[02:55:14.602 --> 02:55:18.183]  These people, we're going to show them who they are.
[02:55:18.183 --> 02:55:22.464]  We're going to show their own followers who they are in case they're in their little echo chamber.
[02:55:23.499 --> 02:55:30.041]  And it's critical to just keep pressing forward, and that's why I appreciate you saying it just goes directly to websites.
[02:55:30.041 --> 02:55:35.643]  You have to come right to youtube.com slash Mark Dice or scroll down to go directly to my channel.
[02:55:35.643 --> 02:55:40.085]  You can no longer go to your YouTube homepage and see a variety of videos.
[02:55:40.685 --> 02:55:44.228]  It doesn't matter if you have views, you know, tens of millions of views on the video and it was number one.
[02:55:44.228 --> 02:55:50.132]  They downvoted and will take the same name and put something pro-Hillary on top of it.
[02:55:50.132 --> 02:55:53.974]  Again, in fact, give a few examples of that because it happens to all our videos now.
[02:55:53.974 --> 02:55:57.937]  People have to go directly to it and realize it's not work, it's a victory.
[02:55:57.937 --> 02:55:59.838]  They're censoring us because we're winning.
[02:55:59.838 --> 02:56:01.139]  It's so cowardly.
[02:56:01.139 --> 02:56:02.220]  It's so pathetic.
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:05.502]  They totally make us the underdogs because we're Americana.
[02:56:05.502 --> 02:56:06.443]  We're promoting freedom.
[02:56:07.341 --> 02:56:17.483]  In the past, when you would search for a certain title in YouTube, it would show you not the most viewed video, but the most watched video, meaning the most watched time.
[02:56:17.483 --> 02:56:21.984]  So if somebody clicks on a video and clicks off of it, you know, it gets a few seconds of watch time.
[02:56:21.984 --> 02:56:29.565]  So if somebody clicks on a video and they stay watching it for two, three, four minutes, that's rallying, that's tacking up the watch time.
[02:56:29.565 --> 02:56:33.186]  And they broke their algorithm about what the humans really voting.
[02:56:34.026 --> 02:56:40.071]  Crowdsourcing ideas, the knowledge of the crowd, they broke it for this!
[02:56:40.071 --> 02:56:48.877]  Yeah, so again, having most watched views can be deceptive, so they changed that model a decade ago to the most watched time.
[02:56:48.877 --> 02:56:58.685]  So my video about Donald Trump's funniest insults and comebacks has 9 million views, a high amount of watch time, but if you type it in, that exact title into YouTube,
[02:56:59.265 --> 02:57:01.748]  It's the 51st result.
[02:57:01.748 --> 02:57:14.219]  There are 50 other videos, half of which aren't even, don't even have anything to do with it, but maybe have, you know, oh, Trump funny, or something about Trump insults, so-and-so, and every single one of them is from a mainstream source.
[02:57:14.219 --> 02:57:18.904]  Even the Huffington Compost, or the HuffPost, I guess they've renamed their channel.
[02:57:19.504 --> 02:57:24.708]  Has under 2,000 views and their video is one of the top results.
[02:57:24.708 --> 02:57:29.531]  NBC, CBS, all these mainstream outlets which have a small amount of views.
[02:57:29.531 --> 02:57:31.953]  It just shows what pathetic losers they are.
[02:57:31.953 --> 02:57:35.315]  We'll be right back with five more minutes with Mark Geiss right after this quick break.
[02:57:35.315 --> 02:57:36.696]  Infowars.com, stay with us.
[02:57:45.404 --> 02:57:47.769]  Informark Live is launching its newest product.
[02:57:47.769 --> 02:57:49.913]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:34.717]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.

[02:58:36.758 --> 02:58:40.061]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:58:40.061 --> 02:58:42.583]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[02:58:52.202 --> 02:58:53.063]  It'd take hours.
[02:58:53.063 --> 02:58:55.504]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.504 --> 02:58:56.685]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.685 --> 02:58:58.306]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.306 --> 02:59:01.508]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.508 --> 02:59:02.649]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.649 --> 02:59:05.811]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.811 --> 02:59:09.134]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.554 --> 02:59:09.714]  I think?
[02:59:28.377 --> 02:59:30.138]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:57.261 --> 03:00:01.124]  News analysis reports.
[03:00:01.124 --> 03:00:05.867]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.867 --> 03:00:11.151]  Ali Alexander's taken over, then Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and more in the war room.
[03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:14.741]  We got the clip coming up at the start of the next segment.
[03:00:14.741 --> 03:00:18.562]  I'll introduce Alexander Schumer just called for more sanctions on Russia.
[03:00:18.562 --> 03:00:22.263]  Trump is sending tow missiles to the rebels for a year.
[03:00:22.263 --> 03:00:24.904]  Huge economic operations crushing Russia.
[03:00:24.904 --> 03:00:29.906]  I don't think Russia even deserves, but everything else I agree with Trump on.
[03:00:29.906 --> 03:00:31.667]  I see Communist China as a threat.
[03:00:31.667 --> 03:00:35.728]  Mark Dice, I really appreciate you at markdice.com and all the work you're doing.
[03:00:35.728 --> 03:00:37.049]  You're being blocked and censored.
[03:00:38.345 --> 03:00:41.569]  You know, so your average video had a million views, now your average has a half million.
[03:00:41.569 --> 03:00:46.614]  But it's a real testament that your fans come to the actual Mark Dice site on YouTube.
[03:00:46.614 --> 03:00:49.097]  They gotta do the same thing for InfoWars, the same thing for everything.
[03:00:49.097 --> 03:00:58.747]  And you know, I saw the censorship intensifying a few years ago, so we have our own streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we have our own videos we're posting now, it's very expensive.
[03:01:00.222 --> 03:01:01.823]  But we're doing it.
[03:01:01.823 --> 03:01:04.665]  So, Mark, you know, people said, well, you just get off YouTube.
[03:01:04.665 --> 03:01:07.406]  Well, it's already half the video views in the world.
[03:01:07.406 --> 03:01:08.987]  They advertise for us to come there.
[03:01:08.987 --> 03:01:09.888]  We follow the rules.
[03:01:09.888 --> 03:01:11.009]  Then they cheat us.
[03:01:11.009 --> 03:01:12.009]  No, this is fraud.
[03:01:12.009 --> 03:01:14.150]  We need to stand up against it.
[03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:18.953]  Yeah, I see so many people want us to put our legs between our tail between our legs and leave to another platform.
[03:01:18.953 --> 03:01:21.915]  But no, we need to fill it with more conservative content.
[03:01:21.915 --> 03:01:23.596]  And I think there was a quote.
[03:01:23.596 --> 03:01:29.860]  I think it's from Inside Man or a movie from a decade ago that the greatest currency is respect.
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:42.806]  And that's why my fans do the best that I can to earn and gain their respect, and that's why I've been able to develop such a large channel, same with you, because nobody respects CNN.
[03:01:42.806 --> 03:01:45.647]  Anderson Cooper doesn't respect his audience, he despises them.
[03:01:45.647 --> 03:01:46.407]  He's a parasite.
[03:01:46.407 --> 03:01:47.268]  He preys on them.
[03:01:48.728 --> 03:01:51.629]  And these people, their time has come.
[03:01:51.629 --> 03:01:54.051]  Their time, they've missed the boat.
[03:01:54.051 --> 03:01:58.513]  Now they're astroturfing to try to keep up with this modern technology.
[03:01:58.513 --> 03:01:59.913]  And we keep crushing them.
[03:01:59.913 --> 03:02:02.914]  And we need, the midterm's coming in three and a half months.
[03:02:02.914 --> 03:02:03.895]  Time flies.
[03:02:03.895 --> 03:02:05.556]  We need to schedule the vote.
[03:02:05.556 --> 03:02:09.978]  You need to look at voting in the midterm and in the 2020 election as like paying your taxes.
[03:02:09.978 --> 03:02:13.019]  If you don't do it, the government's gonna screw you.
[03:02:13.019 --> 03:02:15.200]  And it's a little bit of a hassle, you gotta schedule it.
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:19.861]  Let's say we have the red wave that even with fraud looks like we're gonna have.
[03:02:19.861 --> 03:02:23.322]  Do they capitulate then or they just get crazier?
[03:02:23.322 --> 03:02:24.282]  That I'm not sure.
[03:02:24.282 --> 03:02:39.106]  We're in uncharted territory but I know that we have to get in touch with our congressperson and educate them about the censorship on social media and so we can have more legitimate questions when these people are testifying and so we can get new bills perhaps
[03:02:39.526 --> 03:02:43.368]  Introduced so that we can't be shut down and... No, I agree.
[03:02:43.368 --> 03:02:44.229]  That's the key.
[03:02:44.229 --> 03:02:49.412]  And please help us with this Mike Adams report and Paul Watson report that are on Infowars.com.
[03:02:49.412 --> 03:02:50.793]  These are scholarly.
[03:02:50.793 --> 03:02:51.833]  These detail it all.
[03:02:51.833 --> 03:02:53.934]  And I mean, Mark, we need your help.
[03:02:53.934 --> 03:02:59.578]  We need to get this report, the censorship master plan decoded, to the president, which we've done, and to Congress.
[03:02:59.578 --> 03:03:00.098]  Please help us.
[03:03:01.277 --> 03:03:02.078]  I definitely will.
[03:03:02.078 --> 03:03:04.199]  I'll be retweeting that as soon as I get off the show.
[03:03:04.199 --> 03:03:05.440]  Always great to be with you, Alex.
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:09.402]  It's incredible what you guys are doing, and it's incredible to see the attacks against us.
[03:03:09.402 --> 03:03:27.274]  I mean, you can't even imagine the things that they're doing, and then they pull them out of their sleeves, literally calling for you to be banned, the manipulation of the social media, YouTube now literally paying $25 million to AstroTurf YouTubers embracing
[03:03:27.714 --> 03:03:33.759]  You know, Hollywood celebrities as the new YouTuber, giving them consultants.
[03:03:33.759 --> 03:03:41.925]  I had to figure out how to do this, what camera, how to do the lighting, what time to post the videos, how to make a thumbnail.
[03:03:41.925 --> 03:03:48.771]  All of these people now, the mainstream media, which missed the boat, they're getting the consultants and the cash.
[03:03:48.771 --> 03:03:52.794]  And they're invading and they're propping them up and they're force feeding and it's still failing.
[03:03:52.794 --> 03:03:54.635]  And that's what's so crazy about this is,
[03:03:55.396 --> 03:03:57.598]  This is really epic, my friend.
[03:03:57.598 --> 03:04:01.561]  And I just have a gut level feeling we're going to win as long as we just keep pressing the attack.
[03:04:01.561 --> 03:04:06.426]  But like you said, we need our own platforms, which you're building, I've built.
[03:04:06.426 --> 03:04:07.186]  We have to do it.
[03:04:07.186 --> 03:04:09.889]  The listeners have to understand they're the only reason we're still standing.
[03:04:09.889 --> 03:04:15.754]  We do respect them because they are, you know, Mark Dice, they are Alex Jones, our listeners, our viewers, our supporters.
[03:04:15.754 --> 03:04:18.556]  They're the reason CNN and so many people are upset.
[03:04:18.556 --> 03:04:20.078]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[03:04:20.078 --> 03:04:21.159]  And thank God for Donald Trump, huh?
[03:04:22.489 --> 03:04:23.310]  He is a godsend.
[03:04:23.310 --> 03:04:30.835]  He has delayed the bankruptcy, moral and financial of this country, perhaps decades into the future.
[03:04:30.835 --> 03:04:33.156]  And that's why they keep on pressing against him.
[03:04:33.156 --> 03:04:48.867]  And when I can sit in my apartment and make a video and get a quarter million views, quarter of the audience of CNN, when I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen, that is dangerous to the mainstream establishment when they're spending... And that's your Lobo video.
[03:04:48.867 --> 03:04:49.367]  Exactly.
[03:04:49.367 --> 03:04:50.168]  It's amazing.
[03:04:50.168 --> 03:04:50.888]  People want choice.
[03:04:50.888 --> 03:04:51.489]  God bless you, Mark.
[03:04:51.969 --> 03:04:52.270]  Great job.
[03:04:52.270 --> 03:04:54.513]  Good to be with you Alex.

[03:06:16.866 --> 03:06:25.109]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.770 --> 03:06:29.972]  And we are the real American free market resistance to the globalists.
[03:06:29.972 --> 03:06:31.073]  They claim they're the resistance.
[03:06:31.073 --> 03:06:32.233]  Yeah, to us.
[03:06:32.233 --> 03:06:34.134]  Ali Alexander is about to take over.
[03:06:34.134 --> 03:06:36.596]  Political consultant, philosopher, activist.
[03:06:36.596 --> 03:06:38.937]  All the great work he's done with the Trump campaign, you name it.
[03:06:38.937 --> 03:06:40.938]  Patreon.com Ali Alexander.
[03:06:40.938 --> 03:06:42.339]  Twitter at Ali.
[03:06:42.339 --> 03:06:43.960]  Organizer AmericanPriority.com
[03:06:45.026 --> 03:06:50.212]  But I wanted to play Chuckie Schumer's response, and I never got to all these clips today, but Alexander wants to play them.
[03:06:50.212 --> 03:06:53.275]  I know he's got a guest coming on about the globals trying to crash the economy.
[03:06:53.275 --> 03:06:54.756]  Will they be successful?
[03:06:54.756 --> 03:06:56.158]  Talk about treason.
[03:06:56.158 --> 03:07:01.063]  You've got Brennan calling Trump treasonous for meeting with Putin when every other president meets with Russian leaders.
[03:07:01.063 --> 03:07:02.244]  They just think you have no memory.
[03:07:04.639 --> 03:07:10.906]  I've got Trump on Hillary's server, Putin on intelligence in Soros, Putin on compromising info on Trump in Moscow.
[03:07:10.906 --> 03:07:12.168]  I may play that before I go to Alexander.
[03:07:12.168 --> 03:07:17.093]  I've got so many of these clips, the war room's coming up in about 53 minutes, but here's Chuckie Schumer.
[03:07:18.288 --> 03:07:22.330]  Well he's this democrat, globalist, anti-American guy that sold us out to China.
[03:07:22.330 --> 03:07:30.133]  Here he is saying, more sanctions on Russia, when Trump, quite frankly, one of the few things he's done bad is beat the hell out of Russia for no reason.
[03:07:30.133 --> 03:07:30.873]  Here it is.
[03:07:30.873 --> 03:07:38.136]  Our allies will consider abandoning us, possibly for China and others, and Putin's Russia will emerge stronger for it.
[03:07:38.136 --> 03:07:42.698]  That's what he wants, and that's what President Trump inexplicably is helping him do.
[03:07:44.753 --> 03:07:53.417]  Our Republican colleagues can take steps right now to push back against this slippery slope the President has put us on.
[03:07:53.417 --> 03:07:58.300]  Speaker Ryan today said nice things, but talk is not enough.
[03:07:58.300 --> 03:07:59.501]  We need action.
[03:07:59.501 --> 03:08:01.402]  Bipartisan, strong action.
[03:08:01.402 --> 03:08:07.725]  And we need our Republican colleagues to stand up for the good of this country.
[03:08:07.725 --> 03:08:11.567]  I am asking our Republican colleagues to do four things.
[03:08:12.685 --> 03:08:24.794]  First, they can start by refusing to water down and instead decide to ratchet up sanctions against Russia.
[03:08:24.794 --> 03:08:28.637]  Back up a few seconds if you can.
[03:08:28.637 --> 03:08:29.898]  This is the globalist traitor.
[03:08:29.898 --> 03:08:38.764]  This is the globalist who's shelling America out trying to point at some foreign country and going that's the enemy when Russia can hardly get its streetlights working nationwide.
[03:08:38.764 --> 03:08:39.845]  When they've sold out to China.
[03:08:41.035 --> 03:08:42.676]  Hollywood's owned by China now.
[03:08:42.676 --> 03:08:51.662]  And he's just up there like he's the patriot and all of us, red-blooded Americans that believe in the Second Amendment, private property, all of it, we're the enemy!
[03:08:51.662 --> 03:08:55.845]  I mean, just how are we ruled by this piece of crap?
[03:08:55.845 --> 03:08:58.987]  Let's go back to it.
[03:08:58.987 --> 03:09:01.229]  Sanctions against Russia.
[03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:05.652]  In the House, there is right now an effort to ratchet these sanctions down.
[03:09:06.969 --> 03:09:12.130]  Given what Mr. Putin said today, given the indictments, given what Mr. Trump said today.
[03:09:12.130 --> 03:09:12.930]  Pause again.
[03:09:12.930 --> 03:09:14.090]  The indictments!
[03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:16.611]  They already had 13 bots indicted.
[03:09:16.611 --> 03:09:17.491]  The people showed up.
[03:09:17.491 --> 03:09:20.092]  It's all fake.
[03:09:20.092 --> 03:09:21.932]  Ali Alexander is going to take over right now.
[03:09:21.932 --> 03:09:23.652]  War Room is coming up.
[03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:27.373]  They'll have coverage of the big historic press conference.
[03:09:27.373 --> 03:09:29.153]  It's the left trying to take my free speech.
[03:09:29.153 --> 03:09:30.393]  The left trying to take my guns.
[03:09:30.393 --> 03:09:32.814]  The left on TV saying, let's bankrupt this recovery.
[03:09:33.752 --> 03:09:37.394]  I mean, if the Russians were in my business, I'd say they're the enemy.
[03:09:37.394 --> 03:09:39.816]  But I don't see them in my life.
[03:09:39.816 --> 03:09:44.859]  I don't see the Russian fingerprints or footprints on anything I'm doing.
[03:09:44.859 --> 03:09:46.160]  God, I wish it was that easy.
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:50.483]  No, it's the left, it's the globalists, it's the universities, it's the anti-free speech groups.
[03:09:50.483 --> 03:09:52.885]  They're the ones constantly, it's the Antifa.
[03:09:53.445 --> 03:10:06.315]  It's these bullies, and they want to imprison Dinesh D'Souza, and they want to put me in prison, and they want to shut me up, and shut you up, and they want to kidnap and rape the president's son, and they just, they're a group of crazy people!
[03:10:06.315 --> 03:10:08.857]  So, Ali Alexander, thanks for taking over.
[03:10:08.857 --> 03:10:19.144]  God bless you, and I know you've got a special guest coming on, an economist about, you can probably play the clip of, you know, even defending it, Bill Maher saying, yeah, I want to bankrupt people, get them under my control.
[03:10:19.144 --> 03:10:20.846]  I mean, that's called feudalism.
[03:10:20.846 --> 03:10:22.467]  Ali Alexander, thanks for joining us.
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:24.141]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[03:10:24.141 --> 03:10:30.125]  And you know, America, I couldn't agree with Alex more is how are we ruled by these idiots?
[03:10:30.125 --> 03:10:41.112]  I mean, you have these reporters in Finland asking the president of these two countries that occupy 90% of the nuclear weapons in the world, these stupid dumb questions.
[03:10:41.112 --> 03:10:47.697]  I actually liked it when President Putin described the intelligence gathering process and how impossible it would be
[03:10:48.337 --> 03:10:59.705]  To have the foresight that Donald Trump would run for president, be elected president, or memorize all the businessmen that are coming to Moscow or St.
[03:10:59.705 --> 03:11:00.165]  Petersburg.
[03:11:00.165 --> 03:11:02.307]  We're absolutely ruled by idiots.
[03:11:02.307 --> 03:11:06.990]  And you know, I'll tell you, I've got this theory, it's called the avatar culture.
[03:11:06.990 --> 03:11:08.771]  We're all living in signals.
[03:11:08.771 --> 03:11:10.633]  And this isn't just the left, right?
[03:11:10.633 --> 03:11:12.294]  The left has virtue signaling.
[03:11:12.634 --> 03:11:20.538]  They want to say, well, we care about the gays, we care about the blacks, we care about the poors, and none of their policies actually address any of these issues.
[03:11:20.538 --> 03:11:23.460]  But the right has much of the same thing.
[03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:31.564]  And what you see from the right now is I was going through my Twitter this morning and I was like, oh, my gosh, this is a disaster of a press conference.
[03:11:31.564 --> 03:11:33.045]  Everyone I know and I respect it.
[03:11:34.269 --> 03:11:37.051]  Was saying Trump is selling out the United States.
[03:11:37.051 --> 03:11:41.815]  And I even texted the Infowars producer and I was like, I'm going to have some choice words for the president.
[03:11:41.815 --> 03:11:50.522]  But I want to make sure that before I got on the air, before I talked to millions of patriots across the nation, that I listened to the press conference myself.
[03:11:50.522 --> 03:11:57.467]  And I'll tell you, it was, it wasn't night and day, but there was a huge, stark difference from the isolated quotes.
[03:11:57.467 --> 03:12:00.009]  And this is what I want to encourage everyone to do.
[03:12:00.009 --> 03:12:02.531]  For the first time ever, I'm going to say, don't listen to me.
[03:12:03.277 --> 03:12:04.557]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[03:12:04.557 --> 03:12:06.478]  Don't listen to the mainstream media.
[03:12:06.478 --> 03:12:25.184]  Go watch 35 minutes of reporters, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump talking about these issues and decide for yourself because it was night and day when I read those quotes and I said, oh my gosh, Donald Trump's throwing America under the bus a little bit.
[03:12:25.874 --> 03:12:27.214]  You know, I get what he's doing, right?
[03:12:27.214 --> 03:12:27.975]  He's fighting for security.
[03:12:27.975 --> 03:12:30.275]  That's all out of context, and that's what they do.
[03:12:30.275 --> 03:12:32.716]  Trump is sending tow missiles to Ukraine.
[03:12:32.716 --> 03:12:34.156]  Trump is crushing them on energy.
[03:12:34.156 --> 03:12:35.357]  Trump is... Yeah!
[03:12:35.357 --> 03:12:36.437]  It's too much!
[03:12:36.437 --> 03:12:41.779]  And then he's conciliatory, you know, I guess lubing up Russia while he does it.
[03:12:41.779 --> 03:12:43.119]  I think it's too much, actually.
[03:12:44.301 --> 03:12:47.803]  Yeah, well Alex, it's a part of the negotiation technique, right?
[03:12:47.803 --> 03:12:54.827]  So he understands now, this is something that Reagan probably couldn't have even understood, that the negotiations have to happen in public.
[03:12:54.827 --> 03:12:58.509]  So to disrespect Putin is going to invite retaliation.
[03:12:58.509 --> 03:13:05.712]  But if he can retaliate, I think, against Russia, and the media is not going to cover that, well then he forces Putin at the table.
[03:13:05.712 --> 03:13:09.414]  I think that this is strategically brilliant, even though, yeah, he's hitting...
[03:13:10.555 --> 03:13:13.477]  Backing Russia emboldens him with the Russian population.
[03:13:13.477 --> 03:13:21.681]  This is actually the most diabolical anti-Russian plan to tell Putin how much he loves him and loves Russia while we're stabbing him in the stomach.
[03:13:21.681 --> 03:13:25.263]  I want to work with Russia and get their resources and come together.
[03:13:25.263 --> 03:13:27.304]  They're not the Chai Koms.
[03:13:27.304 --> 03:13:30.526]  I see America's destiny as real trade like Ron Paul says.
[03:13:30.526 --> 03:13:34.048]  I think Trump's over-aggression towards Russia is one of his only bad spots.
[03:13:35.461 --> 03:13:41.609]  Yeah, yeah, I think I'm a little bit more hawkish than you, and so we might diverge a little bit on it, but you know, he is a hawk.
[03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:42.730]  I mean, he's a super hawk.
[03:13:42.730 --> 03:13:45.113]  No, I'm fine with being hawkish, and I get the Russians' respect.
[03:13:45.113 --> 03:13:45.674]  Shrink.
[03:13:45.674 --> 03:13:47.637]  The Russians don't own Hollywood.
[03:13:47.637 --> 03:13:50.781]  The Russians aren't taking, the chi-coms are the problem.
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:52.881]  Oh, entirely.
[03:13:52.881 --> 03:13:53.322]  Entirely.
[03:13:53.322 --> 03:13:55.365]  It's our number one geopolitical foe right now.
[03:13:55.365 --> 03:13:56.146]  Exactly.
[03:13:56.146 --> 03:14:01.573]  So making it about Russia is a strategic distraction by the globalists that have sold us out to China.
[03:14:01.573 --> 03:14:02.794]  That's the real threat.
[03:14:02.794 --> 03:14:05.698]  That's why it's treason to obsess on Russia all day.
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:07.380]  Bingo!
[03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:07.660]  Bingo!
[03:14:25.188 --> 03:14:25.528]  Bingo.
[03:14:25.528 --> 03:14:27.129]  And this is what Ronald Reagan understood.
[03:14:27.129 --> 03:14:31.091]  You know, Ronald Reagan went from a hawk to a guy who brokered peace.
[03:14:31.091 --> 03:14:37.073]  And if we don't take Russia with us into this next age, it makes us harder to negotiate with these rogue states.
[03:14:37.073 --> 03:14:39.554]  It makes it, you know, it destabilizes North Korea.
[03:14:39.554 --> 03:14:40.074]  Exactly.
[03:14:40.074 --> 03:14:41.495]  We make a deal with Russia.
[03:14:41.495 --> 03:14:45.337]  We have that entire arc through Eastern Europe, Asia, Central Asia.
[03:14:45.337 --> 03:14:47.137]  Broke peace.
[03:14:47.137 --> 03:14:48.438]  The whole, the whole crescent.
[03:14:48.438 --> 03:14:50.359]  That's the, you win the whole game with that.
[03:14:51.100 --> 03:14:51.982]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:14:51.982 --> 03:14:54.949]  But see, the globalists want continued crisis politics.
[03:14:54.949 --> 03:14:56.473]  And I'd love to be friends with China.
[03:14:56.473 --> 03:14:59.801]  But our own elites put the chi-coms in power and are using them for global domination.
[03:15:00.851 --> 03:15:02.792]  Total global domination.
[03:15:02.792 --> 03:15:10.755]  In fact, when I have my guests on here in a couple of minutes, we're going to even talk about that America's elites are eyeing China and Singapore as their plan B's.
[03:15:10.755 --> 03:15:16.377]  As they rape and pillage America, they're going to try to force a recession down our throat here in the next 12 months.
[03:15:16.377 --> 03:15:21.699]  And we can only hope and pray that it doesn't happen before the midterms, because they want to take Trump out of power.
[03:15:21.699 --> 03:15:23.520]  So what's the headline coming up?
[03:15:23.520 --> 03:15:24.920]  Globalists attempting to crash U.S.
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:26.801]  economy ahead of midterms.
[03:15:26.801 --> 03:15:26.961]  Yep.
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:28.781]  Economist.
[03:15:28.781 --> 03:15:30.002]  Globalist attempting to crash U.S.
[03:15:30.002 --> 03:15:31.623]  economy out of midterms.
[03:15:31.623 --> 03:15:33.124]  And hell, they're on TV saying it.
[03:15:33.124 --> 03:15:35.206]  Ali Alexander takes over right now.
[03:15:35.206 --> 03:15:36.487]  Really smart guy.
[03:15:36.487 --> 03:15:38.789]  Having an open, free debate here.
[03:15:38.789 --> 03:15:39.689]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:39.689 --> 03:15:40.930]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:40.930 --> 03:15:44.093]  Get that report on censorship of the Internet to Congress.
[03:15:44.093 --> 03:15:45.694]  They're having hearings tomorrow.
[03:15:45.694 --> 03:15:47.476]  Please accept this mission, listeners.
[03:15:47.476 --> 03:15:49.837]  If you don't take action, they may win.

[03:15:53.197 --> 03:15:56.658]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:11.524]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:17:11.524 --> 03:17:14.606]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[03:17:23.109 --> 03:17:26.550]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.

[03:17:54.301 --> 03:17:58.242]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.242 --> 03:18:01.543]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.543 --> 03:18:07.805]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.805 --> 03:18:10.566]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.306 --> 03:18:15.132]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.132 --> 03:18:21.622]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.622 --> 03:18:26.589]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.324 --> 03:18:31.246]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.246 --> 03:18:38.449]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.449 --> 03:18:43.151]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.151 --> 03:18:49.353]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.353 --> 03:18:53.315]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.096 --> 03:18:58.259]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:18:58.259 --> 03:19:05.304]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:20:05.327 --> 03:20:14.592]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.592 --> 03:20:15.952]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[03:20:15.952 --> 03:20:18.053]  This is Ali Alexander.
[03:20:18.053 --> 03:20:24.456]  I'm hosting the last hour of Alex's show here on InfoWars, InfoWars.com.
[03:20:24.456 --> 03:20:27.038]  Go ahead if you're online and click that share button.
[03:20:27.038 --> 03:20:31.340]  You're not going to want to miss the next 40 minutes where we're going to talk about
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:33.221]  The agenda of the globalists.
[03:20:33.221 --> 03:20:34.942]  You know, Bill Maher said this earlier.
[03:20:34.942 --> 03:20:38.325]  They want to crash the economy to hurt the Republican majority.
[03:20:38.325 --> 03:20:40.086]  Really, it's a Trump majority, right?
[03:20:40.086 --> 03:20:47.931]  We've seen the Republicans act more conservative, more Trumpian, since Donald Trump has called his own party to the mat.
[03:20:47.931 --> 03:20:49.372]  And so I'm going to introduce a friend of mine.
[03:20:49.372 --> 03:20:51.674]  This is a guy I actually talk to pretty frequently.
[03:20:52.014 --> 03:20:54.035]  I manage my own portfolio.
[03:20:54.035 --> 03:20:55.236]  I keep track of the news.
[03:20:55.236 --> 03:20:57.997]  I don't follow the fake news.
[03:20:57.997 --> 03:21:00.258]  Instead, I make money on the real news.
[03:21:00.258 --> 03:21:03.920]  But I always have a couple of people that I put around me to keep me sane.
[03:21:03.920 --> 03:21:06.341]  And one of those is my friend Edward Dowd.
[03:21:06.341 --> 03:21:08.723]  Edward Dowd is a former BlackRock guy.
[03:21:08.723 --> 03:21:13.505]  BlackRock is making some news today because they're pushing for a Bitcoin ETF.
[03:21:13.505 --> 03:21:15.446]  But it's no longer associated with them.
[03:21:15.866 --> 03:21:25.989]  Instead, he's a woke, he's a red-pilled Wall Street analyst who agreed to come on today and talk about the possibility of a coming recession within the next 12 to 18 months.
[03:21:25.989 --> 03:21:29.370]  I think, frankly, it could be sooner, but we're going to talk about this all with Ed.
[03:21:29.370 --> 03:21:31.970]  We're going to have a fruitful discussion.
[03:21:31.970 --> 03:21:38.972]  Right now, he's raising funds for one of his funds that really indexes and models what the economy is doing.
[03:21:38.972 --> 03:21:41.113]  His performance has been remarkable.
[03:21:41.113 --> 03:21:43.033]  It's why I've come to rely on him.
[03:21:43.033 --> 03:21:44.174]  And he's calling from Hawaii.
[03:21:44.174 --> 03:21:44.914]  How are you, my friend?
[03:21:46.138 --> 03:21:46.959]  I'm good, Ali.
[03:21:46.959 --> 03:21:48.060]  Thanks for having me on today.
[03:21:48.060 --> 03:21:50.983]  I appreciate it.
[03:21:50.983 --> 03:21:55.367]  With my partners, we're launching a new firm, Ocean Square Asset Management.
[03:21:55.367 --> 03:21:56.808]  It's a global macro hedge fund.
[03:21:56.808 --> 03:21:58.930]  We're pre-launched, so we don't have any assets yet.
[03:21:58.930 --> 03:22:04.936]  We've been running a model portfolio since Labor Day of last year, so we are in the process of trying to find
[03:22:05.576 --> 03:22:10.578]  Someone to go into business with us and partner with us and give us a seed investor spot.
[03:22:10.578 --> 03:22:17.880]  So that's what we're trying to do, but I can share with you what we're seeing now and what I think is going to happen.
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:29.163]  I mean, obviously, I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but what we're seeing is starting to concern me from an economic recession standpoint.
[03:22:30.515 --> 03:22:45.385]  Yeah, and just to give a little background on some of our private conversations, you know, I'm not one, you know, I love my friends, but I'm not one to brag, but, you know, you and I were talking, you know, February 5th, 6th, 7th, and then boom, 8, the market drops.
[03:22:45.385 --> 03:22:47.147]  We see that massive correction.
[03:22:47.147 --> 03:22:51.310]  February, you and I were talking towards the end of March, I think it was March 25th or 24th,
[03:22:53.651 --> 03:22:55.472]  And boom, you called that one.
[03:22:55.472 --> 03:23:01.235]  And I said, OK, well, this guy is seeing something on a macro level that I'm also seeing at the political level.
[03:23:01.235 --> 03:23:06.178]  And you know, you told me something that was really salient.
[03:23:06.178 --> 03:23:10.340]  You said, you know, a lot of these recessions are triggered by the Federal Reserve.
[03:23:12.549 --> 03:23:14.850]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:23:14.850 --> 03:23:25.316]  So, this is not something that's advertised, but we talk about it all the time on Wall Street, and typically speaking, more often than not, a recession is due to Fed policy error.
[03:23:25.316 --> 03:23:34.001]  They over-tighten, financial conditions worsen, liquidity is withdrawn from the system, some sort of excess that had been building in the system is exposed.
[03:23:35.053 --> 03:23:46.815]  And then they furiously then play catch-up and start to loosen monetary policy, but by then it's usually too late and a recession has taken hold, and they're usually always behind the eight ball.
[03:23:46.815 --> 03:24:02.778]  And I think, given what I'm seeing in the asset classes that we follow and how we're positioned, we're starting to see, you know, we're of the opinion that we're in the early stages of the Fed, probably has already made a policy error, and it's starting to affect the asset markets, which sends signals to us.
[03:24:03.709 --> 03:24:14.316]  So what are some of these signals that you guys over at Ocean Squared are seeing and that you've modeled your, so far, successful portfolio after?
[03:24:14.316 --> 03:24:19.560]  So we play in bonds.
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:21.381]  So my partners are fixed income, I'm equity.
[03:24:21.381 --> 03:24:23.443]  We play in bonds, currencies, and equities.
[03:24:24.558 --> 03:24:33.864]  And we started to see, technically, that the dollar was putting in a major four-year cycle low in February.
[03:24:33.864 --> 03:24:36.186]  We also saw that bonds, the U.S.
[03:24:36.186 --> 03:24:39.788]  30-year Treasury bond, was putting in a three-year cycle low, or we thought it was.
[03:24:40.535 --> 03:24:55.651]  So, we made some bets in the model portfolio, and we are currently expressing our dollar bullishness by being short the euro, the South African Rand, the Chilean peso, and the Australian dollar.
[03:24:55.651 --> 03:25:00.676]  We're so bullish on the dollar, and I think something needs to be understood is Trump is very bullish.
[03:25:00.676 --> 03:25:02.798]  His policies are very bullish and pro-dollar.
[03:25:03.863 --> 03:25:13.079]  And so, I'm going to say something that's going to sound pretty crazy, but you know, if you look at the long-term downtrend of the dollar,
[03:25:14.777 --> 03:25:18.179]  That downtrend has been broken in the last couple years.
[03:25:18.179 --> 03:25:24.103]  And the dollar, this is a very long downtrend since going back to the 70s.
[03:25:24.103 --> 03:25:26.964]  And the dollar, you know, had a little correction here the last two years.
[03:25:26.964 --> 03:25:27.845]  It weakened a little bit.
[03:25:27.845 --> 03:25:30.407]  But we think the dollar put in its four-year cycle low.
[03:25:30.407 --> 03:25:38.532]  It could go, by the end of this four-year cycle, we could see it going back to 121 on the Dixie DXY.
[03:25:38.532 --> 03:25:40.093]  And that would be the prior top in 2000.
[03:25:42.381 --> 03:25:46.130]  You know, I can tell you, I can give you the, I can, is that technically what we see?
[03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:48.675]  I can tell you what the fundamental reasons are if you want to hear those.
[03:25:49.255 --> 03:26:00.203]  Yeah, well, before we get into that, I'll tell you, when Donald Trump won, which, you know, I mean, I do this for a living, and yet still two, three hours into the night, I said, there's no way, there's no way that we're going to win.
[03:26:00.203 --> 03:26:13.432]  In fact, I was so, I was so bearish on Donald Trump winning that night, even though I wanted him to win, right, I supported him, is I bet my younger friends a hundred bucks a piece saying, well, we're not going to win Florida.
[03:26:13.912 --> 03:26:16.074]  You know, I knew that I could put my money on that.
[03:26:16.074 --> 03:26:22.318]  And so I lost about $400, $500 that night to the guys who were, you know, we were all wearing our MAGA hats.
[03:26:22.318 --> 03:26:23.679]  We were celebrating.
[03:26:23.679 --> 03:26:28.123]  And, you know, but the next day I got up and I wiped myself off of politics.
[03:26:28.123 --> 03:26:29.764]  Instead, I said, you know what?
[03:26:29.764 --> 03:26:41.153]  I need to readjust my portfolio now that Hillary's not going to rig the economy for solar, get us into war with Russia via Syria, capitulate to China, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:26:41.153 --> 03:26:43.054]  And I started investing in some biotech.
[03:26:43.275 --> 03:26:45.414]  Because what I realize is Donald Trump...
[03:26:46.090 --> 03:26:56.393]  Was a nationalist and a populist, but he had conservative policies that, you know, have been coming from Cato, Heritage Foundation, and they were all going to be swooped into the White House.
[03:26:56.393 --> 03:26:59.334]  These are ideas that hadn't been tested in 30 or 40 years.
[03:26:59.334 --> 03:27:05.516]  And I was excited to test some of these theories and my stock portfolio has been booming ever since.
[03:27:05.516 --> 03:27:08.497]  But I will say, you know, you hit something that that I thought, too.
[03:27:08.497 --> 03:27:10.118]  I said, OK, well, this is going to be interesting.
[03:27:10.118 --> 03:27:13.259]  I don't want anyone to think that we're talking down the economy.
[03:27:13.639 --> 03:27:32.439]  You know, Trump and the Republicans have been wildly successful at the economy, but the market has grown at such a fast rate that I have some concerns, especially when you have the Federal Reserve, especially when you have the globalists, especially when you have George Soros, especially when you have China trying to match even with the petrodollar.
[03:27:32.439 --> 03:27:34.301]  So this is really interesting that you brought up.
[03:27:34.961 --> 03:27:39.342]  You know, we're a minute away from the break, but you brought up something that stuck out to me.
[03:27:39.342 --> 03:27:47.344]  And I was betting on a strong dollar, whereas everyone was really bullish on gold because they were saying, oh, well, Donald Trump isn't predictable.
[03:27:47.344 --> 03:27:48.164]  We'll buy gold.
[03:27:48.164 --> 03:27:49.524]  I said, no, no, no, no.
[03:27:49.524 --> 03:27:55.305]  If this guy implements Republican conservative policies, we are going to be American again, baby.
[03:27:55.305 --> 03:27:56.546]  And I'm glad that you touched that.
[03:27:56.546 --> 03:27:58.566]  But China seems threatened by this, don't they?
[03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:00.401]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:28:00.401 --> 03:28:03.405]  And China's had a very difficult time of it.
[03:28:03.405 --> 03:28:05.367]  Their stock market has depreciated over 20%.
[03:28:05.367 --> 03:28:08.591]  It's officially in a bear market.
[03:28:08.591 --> 03:28:16.241]  Their economy, as you and I know, they produce quarter in and quarter out 7% GDP growth rate, which
[03:28:16.721 --> 03:28:16.821]  Yes.
[03:28:36.676 --> 03:28:40.041]  China right now is slowing down precipitously.
[03:28:40.041 --> 03:28:42.465]  We're playing that, but we're short semiconductors.
[03:28:42.465 --> 03:28:44.127]  I started picking up.
[03:28:44.127 --> 03:28:45.069]  Hold that thought on China.
[03:28:45.069 --> 03:28:46.711]  We're going to come back after the break.
[03:28:46.711 --> 03:28:49.014]  You guys are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:49.014 --> 03:28:51.478]  We'll be right back to talk about China.
[03:28:51.478 --> 03:28:51.859]  China.
[03:28:53.214 --> 03:28:55.815]  Get The Ultimate Knife at an ultimate price!
[03:28:55.815 --> 03:28:57.516]  The Fox Karambit Knife!

[03:33:20.617 --> 03:33:26.123]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.123 --> 03:33:29.286]  Let's say China.
[03:33:29.286 --> 03:33:29.887]  China.
[03:33:29.887 --> 03:33:30.307]  China.
[03:33:30.307 --> 03:33:30.507]  China.
[03:33:30.507 --> 03:33:31.108]  China.
[03:33:31.108 --> 03:33:31.508]  China.
[03:33:31.508 --> 03:33:32.089]  China.
[03:33:32.089 --> 03:33:32.469]  China.
[03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.950]  China.
[03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:33.430]  China.
[03:33:33.430 --> 03:33:34.331]  China.
[03:33:34.331 --> 03:33:34.652]  China.
[03:33:40.685 --> 03:33:46.026]  And we're warning against a potential recession, folks.
[03:33:46.026 --> 03:33:47.466]  You guys need to know this.
[03:33:47.466 --> 03:33:50.167]  You can't just trust people managing your money.
[03:33:50.167 --> 03:33:56.448]  You also have to be aware, which is why I have one of the smartest guys in the business, my friend Edward Dow.
[03:33:56.448 --> 03:33:58.929]  We had to cut him off to go to a hard break.
[03:33:58.929 --> 03:34:07.351]  But, Ed, you were telling us that China, who, you know, on their balance sheet, governing a billion people, said that they've been, you know, growing at
[03:34:08.882 --> 03:34:21.393]  7% but you don't think that's the case and you think that there's other fundamentals that are gonna that you know they're officially in the bear market you told us so what else are you seeing in regards to China and how that relates to us and what we need to be on the lookout for?
[03:34:22.617 --> 03:34:28.000]  Right, so I'll get back to my fundamental reasons for why the dollar is going up as well, but let me start with China.
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:37.766]  So China, look, it's been a well-known publicized joke on Wall Street that the Chinese economy numbers that they present to us are fraudulent.
[03:34:37.766 --> 03:34:40.168]  But that's been, you know, we've been okay with that, we're not going to...
[03:34:41.352 --> 03:34:42.052]  Uh-huh.
[03:34:42.052 --> 03:34:50.954]  But here we are, and China's, you know, the amount of debt that they've accrued since, you know, the early 2000s is eye-popping.
[03:34:50.954 --> 03:34:57.556]  They're, you know, Donald Trump, his policies are really having an impact on their stock market.
[03:34:57.556 --> 03:35:00.877]  The trade deficit, as obviously, it's a joke.
[03:35:00.877 --> 03:35:01.697]  I mean, the amount of
[03:35:02.669 --> 03:35:07.811]  You know, they can't hurt us, but we can definitely hurt them, and Trump knows that, and that's the leverage he's using.
[03:35:07.811 --> 03:35:20.375]  So, China's stock market has rolled quite significantly, and the data points I was picking up in June was that semiconductors were rolling hard, and semiconductors are the tip of the spear from an economic standpoint.
[03:35:20.375 --> 03:35:25.897]  They're global, and China consumes a lot of them as well as, you know, everybody else.
[03:35:25.897 --> 03:35:27.158]  So, I was hearing that
[03:35:27.953 --> 03:35:32.737]  Literally, orders were just falling out of the bed, and things were getting pulled.
[03:35:32.737 --> 03:35:36.200]  Factories that we heard were going to get built, those plans were put on hold.
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:40.323]  These are coming from high-level executives that I know.
[03:35:40.323 --> 03:35:45.828]  And then if you look at the price action of the semiconductors, let's marry what I heard with price action.
[03:35:46.788 --> 03:35:47.468]  We're good to go.
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:17.760]  We're good to go.
[03:36:41.417 --> 03:36:49.727]  This is India, China, Turkey, Brazil, all of them.
[03:36:49.727 --> 03:36:56.615]  It's estimated that the dollar amount of emerging market debt in dollars is $7-9 trillion.
[03:36:56.615 --> 03:36:57.877]  So as interest rates go up,
[03:36:58.669 --> 03:36:59.890]  We're good to go!
[03:37:23.672 --> 03:37:26.774]  You know, slowing of our economy or recession.
[03:37:26.774 --> 03:37:33.957]  And the timing of it's unclear, but we're seeing that in the asset markets that the yield curve is flattening.
[03:37:33.957 --> 03:37:40.119]  We're long 30-year Treasuries because we believe that, you know, that yields, like I said, bonds have bottomed.
[03:37:40.119 --> 03:37:46.642]  And we think that the yield curve will invert at some point here over the next, you know, three to six months.
[03:37:46.642 --> 03:37:50.784]  The 10-30 curve is down to about 10 basis points.
[03:37:51.471 --> 03:37:52.111]  We're good to go.
[03:38:15.362 --> 03:38:19.787]  You know, quick, quickly, you know, Trump is really pro-dollar.
[03:38:19.787 --> 03:38:24.453]  His policies, the corporate tax rates have now brought investment back to this country.
[03:38:24.453 --> 03:38:25.754]  Thank God.
[03:38:25.754 --> 03:38:26.255]  Yeah.
[03:38:26.255 --> 03:38:26.655]  Yeah.
[03:38:26.655 --> 03:38:28.037]  Long term, that's a good thing.
[03:38:28.037 --> 03:38:30.059]  Short term.
[03:38:30.059 --> 03:38:32.682]  Otherwise, we had all this foreign investment coming
[03:38:32.882 --> 03:38:34.403]  And you know, and I'm not opposed to it, right?
[03:38:34.403 --> 03:38:37.464]  We have this Foxconn plant in Wisconsin.
[03:38:37.464 --> 03:38:39.245]  That's going to help Governor Walker.
[03:38:39.245 --> 03:38:40.506]  That might help Republicans.
[03:38:40.506 --> 03:38:43.267]  At the end of the day, it's going to help Americans, and that's important.
[03:38:43.267 --> 03:38:50.450]  But, you know, if you go to places like Irvine, California, I mean, you know, I'm obviously not a racist.
[03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:51.211]  I'm not a racist.
[03:38:51.211 --> 03:38:52.891]  I'm half black, half Arab.
[03:38:52.891 --> 03:38:54.452]  My best friend is Vietnamese.
[03:38:54.452 --> 03:38:56.313]  But when I flew into L.A.
[03:38:57.446 --> 03:38:58.847]  And I went around Irvine.
[03:38:58.847 --> 03:39:04.450]  I was like, OK, well, is this entire town owned by Chinese nationals?
[03:39:04.450 --> 03:39:11.193]  And I was hearing from the locals there who had been there for decades that, yeah, basically they go in and they buy these homes for cash.
[03:39:11.193 --> 03:39:17.957]  And then when they go back to China, they'll leave these Louis Vuitton or Gucci bags like they're buying so much with cash.
[03:39:17.957 --> 03:39:21.639]  And we were suffering the Obama non-recovery.
[03:39:21.639 --> 03:39:24.661]  So what would you say to someone who's listening to this?
[03:39:24.661 --> 03:39:26.882]  And they're saying, well, this is technical mumbo jumbo.
[03:39:27.322 --> 03:39:31.387]  You know, Obama and his friends and Janet Yellen held down the economy.
[03:39:31.387 --> 03:39:33.008]  Trump is bringing it back.
[03:39:33.008 --> 03:39:35.231]  How can we possibly reach?
[03:39:35.231 --> 03:39:38.434]  How can we possibly go into a recession even in the next 10 years?
[03:39:40.583 --> 03:39:49.246]  Well, look, cycles occur, and interest rates and liquidity have a powerful impact on the asset markets, and the asset markets lead the real economy.
[03:39:49.246 --> 03:39:53.268]  So, again, I don't believe there's going to be a financial crisis.
[03:39:53.268 --> 03:40:01.370]  I believe this will be a bump in the road and be much like potentially what happened to Ronald Reagan in his second year.
[03:40:01.370 --> 03:40:03.731]  He had a recession, and then things really took off.
[03:40:03.731 --> 03:40:08.313]  So don't fear the recession, and you'll have an opportunity.
[03:40:08.993 --> 03:40:12.616]  You'll have an opportunity to buy assets on the cheap.
[03:40:12.616 --> 03:40:13.336]  And I like that.
[03:40:13.336 --> 03:40:13.917]  And you know what?
[03:40:13.917 --> 03:40:19.180]  That's the great thing that conservatives, populists, nationalists, and Republicans are doing.
[03:40:19.180 --> 03:40:21.602]  They're strengthening our country, right?
[03:40:21.602 --> 03:40:23.804]  And I told my friends this in D.C.
[03:40:23.804 --> 03:40:26.706]  They said, Ali, you know, you used to be with us.
[03:40:26.706 --> 03:40:28.347]  Why are you so much more Trumpian?
[03:40:28.347 --> 03:40:30.649]  You know, you're an ideological conservative.
[03:40:30.649 --> 03:40:35.232]  Why are you kind of getting wishy-washy with Trump when it comes to NAFTA or tariffs?
[03:40:35.232 --> 03:40:36.233]  And I told them simply,
[03:40:36.773 --> 03:40:43.618]  I'm done watching the obliteration of the culture in Pennsylvania, in West Virginia, in Ohio.
[03:40:43.618 --> 03:40:59.868]  And if I have to go to the dollar store and pay $2 more for a product, and generations can grow up in Dayton, Ohio, in Falling Waters, West Virginia, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, well then that's good for the country.
[03:40:59.868 --> 03:41:01.049]  That's good for people.
[03:41:01.049 --> 03:41:03.851]  And fundamentally, I think it's also a national security issue.
[03:41:04.211 --> 03:41:08.514]  Donald Trump believes that we ought to have some manufacturing base here.
[03:41:08.514 --> 03:41:09.534]  We ought to have things here.
[03:41:09.534 --> 03:41:14.778]  And what I find interesting, and I warn people this would happen, Donald Trump is restoring order.
[03:41:14.778 --> 03:41:16.859]  He's making sovereignty great again.
[03:41:16.859 --> 03:41:20.241]  You alluded to it with Turkey's doing this, China's doing this.
[03:41:20.241 --> 03:41:23.343]  They're all trying to get their currency
[03:41:24.103 --> 03:41:25.744]  I mean, think of it this way, Ollie.
[03:41:46.801 --> 03:41:51.914]  At least 10-15 years has been weak dollar policy since the top in 2000.
[03:41:51.914 --> 03:41:53.798]  They're selling us out to the globalists.
[03:41:54.788 --> 03:41:58.670]  And, well, you know, however you want to categorize it, it's been a weak dollar policy.
[03:41:58.670 --> 03:42:03.133]  Well, if you look at the long-term charts, you look at what Donald Trump's policies are, the dollar is going to be strengthening.
[03:42:03.133 --> 03:42:04.573]  So, what does that mean?
[03:42:04.573 --> 03:42:07.655]  That means more investment here in the U.S., dollars coming home.
[03:42:07.655 --> 03:42:15.779]  And, of course, because the system in the world globally has been geared towards a weak dollar, there is going to be pain as that regime shift happens.
[03:42:15.779 --> 03:42:19.101]  And we're going to see that pain in the form of economic slowdown.
[03:42:19.101 --> 03:42:20.302]  But our slowdown will be
[03:42:21.822 --> 03:42:27.924]  Way less than it will be in the emerging economies in China because of their reliance on a weak dollar.
[03:42:27.924 --> 03:42:31.265]  And that's what it's all about.
[03:42:31.265 --> 03:42:32.025]  That's what it's all about.
[03:42:32.025 --> 03:42:33.325]  It's a competition.
[03:42:33.325 --> 03:42:37.266]  Everyone on the world stage.
[03:42:37.266 --> 03:42:38.727]  It's a competition.
[03:42:38.727 --> 03:42:42.548]  And Donald Trump wants America to be first.
[03:42:42.548 --> 03:42:45.029]  After the break, we're going to talk about more strategies.
[03:42:45.029 --> 03:42:47.929]  We're going to pick Ed's brain.
[03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:49.330]  Fear not.
[03:42:49.330 --> 03:42:49.970]  America first.
[03:42:53.280 --> 03:42:57.244]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.244 --> 03:43:00.527]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.527 --> 03:43:06.813]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.813 --> 03:43:09.575]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.316 --> 03:43:14.119]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.119 --> 03:43:20.603]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.603 --> 03:43:25.567]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.314 --> 03:43:30.235]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.235 --> 03:43:37.437]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.437 --> 03:43:42.078]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.078 --> 03:43:48.340]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.340 --> 03:43:52.321]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.161 --> 03:44:12.004]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWareStore.com, you are funding
[03:44:12.344 --> 03:44:13.125]  The revolution.

[03:45:56.341 --> 03:45:58.342]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[03:45:58.342 --> 03:46:02.784]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[03:46:02.784 --> 03:46:07.146]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[03:46:07.146 --> 03:46:12.248]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[03:46:12.248 --> 03:46:16.010]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[03:46:16.850 --> 03:46:19.133]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[03:46:19.133 --> 03:46:21.075]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[03:46:21.075 --> 03:46:24.238]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[03:46:24.238 --> 03:46:31.385]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[03:46:31.385 --> 03:46:33.247]  We have record sales going on right now.

[03:46:52.579 --> 03:46:56.720]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:56.720 --> 03:46:59.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.763 --> 03:47:27.787]  Y'all, we are talking about the market.
[03:47:27.787 --> 03:47:28.867]  We're talking about the market.
[03:47:28.867 --> 03:47:36.249]  This is sometimes, sometimes it's very hard to talk about the market because people think about the economy.
[03:47:36.249 --> 03:47:39.110]  You know, the economy is not the market.
[03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:40.730]  The market's not the economy.
[03:47:40.730 --> 03:47:42.371]  The market is a part of the economy.
[03:47:42.964 --> 03:47:48.690]  And helping us guide us through this in our last segment is Edward Dowd.
[03:47:48.690 --> 03:47:51.513]  He is a partner at Ocean Squared.
[03:47:51.513 --> 03:47:52.874]  He's running a model portfolio.
[03:47:52.874 --> 03:47:55.177]  They're raising funds for their fund.
[03:47:55.177 --> 03:47:56.919]  And it's been really remarkable.
[03:47:56.919 --> 03:47:58.560]  And I've really actually enjoyed our friendship.
[03:47:58.560 --> 03:47:59.461]  My mother says this.
[03:47:59.461 --> 03:48:02.124]  She says, Ollie, sometimes you're too transactional.
[03:48:02.665 --> 03:48:05.589]  But what I like about our friendship is you share your expertise with me.
[03:48:05.589 --> 03:48:07.391]  I share my expertise with you.
[03:48:07.391 --> 03:48:11.477]  And boy, we've called a lot of things right together.
[03:48:11.477 --> 03:48:16.383]  And, you know, I love I love, you know, let's throw Ed's Twitter account up on the screen.
[03:48:16.383 --> 03:48:17.365]  But, you know, I love.
[03:48:17.885 --> 03:48:18.646]  Retweeting you.
[03:48:18.646 --> 03:48:23.790]  And one of the things that, you know, you encouraged me to take a second look at is I'm a technologist.
[03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:26.032]  You know, they call it the fang stocks, right?
[03:48:26.032 --> 03:48:35.840]  But these things have been growing at such an alarming rate without increasing their revenues at the same rate that there's got to be some type of retracement, right?
[03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:37.561]  I mean, there was with Bitcoin.
[03:48:37.561 --> 03:48:46.288]  Why wouldn't there be with Netflix or Facebook, especially when they're busy pissing off half their base, the conservatives in America, the people who have the money?
[03:48:46.608 --> 03:48:51.910]  You know, are you concerned at all about what has been dubbed the FANG stocks?
[03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:54.210]  Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google?
[03:48:54.210 --> 03:48:55.991]  Absolutely.
[03:48:55.991 --> 03:49:02.393]  So, you know, look, the way we're positioned, we're not short the stock market.
[03:49:02.393 --> 03:49:07.194]  We're shorting some stocks and we're long some stocks, so we're kind of neutral to stock market, but making bets.
[03:49:07.975 --> 03:49:08.535]  We're good to go.
[03:49:26.862 --> 03:49:30.763]  The FAANGs, I have some real issues with the FAANGs.
[03:49:30.763 --> 03:49:34.004]  A, they've been phenomenal performers.
[03:49:34.004 --> 03:49:39.365]  Their revenue growth has been great, but I think the second derivative on their revenue growth is about to turn.
[03:49:39.365 --> 03:49:45.406]  I also think that the regulatory issues that you and I talked about in February in D.C.
[03:49:45.406 --> 03:49:47.126]  are coming at the forefront.
[03:49:47.126 --> 03:49:54.868]  And, you know, I'm watching Alex and others being censored by Facebook and Google, and, you know,
[03:49:55.700 --> 03:50:05.909]  That's not going to sit well with a lot of Republican congressmen, and today Alex talked about they're going to get some reports to these congressmen to show them what's going on.
[03:50:05.909 --> 03:50:13.636]  So, you know, if I'm a betting man, technically I see them topping and then I see regulatory action coming down the pike.
[03:50:14.256 --> 03:50:27.780]  And I think what's behind the curtain is going to be very, very problematic for them and very unsettling for lots and lots of people with the amount of control that they have over our dialogue in this country.
[03:50:27.780 --> 03:50:31.381]  And, you know, I'm not bullish on these stocks.
[03:50:31.381 --> 03:50:34.202]  I think they have a tremendous amount of downside once they turn.
[03:50:35.037 --> 03:50:46.861]  Well, what's really interesting, what struck me as interesting is when Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's been tremendously kind to me, you know, not conservatives in general, but to me, they've sponsored my parties in D.C.
[03:50:46.861 --> 03:50:51.082]  You know, the Facebook government team has been absolutely wonderful to me, full disclosure.
[03:50:51.082 --> 03:51:02.166]  But when Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and founder of Facebook, said that, well, we are willing to accept regulations on advertisements, I thought, well, that's your moneymaker.
[03:51:02.166 --> 03:51:02.766]  And I thought, well,
[03:51:03.306 --> 03:51:10.833]  Wow, he's really acting like a media institution because he doesn't want to be regulated right in the areas of speech.
[03:51:10.833 --> 03:51:15.617]  He doesn't want to be regulated in the areas of fairness or censorship.
[03:51:15.617 --> 03:51:19.921]  They're entirely willing to take regulation on the advertising front.
[03:51:19.921 --> 03:51:27.228]  And I have to believe, well, you're willing to let your stock price take a hit, theoretically, because come on, more regulation inside of the advertising space.
[03:51:27.888 --> 03:51:29.850]  Makes the ads convert less, right?
[03:51:29.850 --> 03:51:39.937]  More text, more gobbling gloop, more disclosure is going to lead to fewer people, fewer marketing departments and fewer advertisers placing these buys.
[03:51:39.937 --> 03:51:51.346]  And I thought, wow, we really live in such an Aurelian system where these companies aren't after money, they're after influence, they're after power, they're after control.
[03:51:51.346 --> 03:51:54.128]  And we know once you control thought, you control speech.
[03:51:54.128 --> 03:51:55.789]  And this is why it's so important for us to
[03:51:56.249 --> 03:51:57.810]  You know, declare this or declare that.
[03:51:57.810 --> 03:52:01.612]  But, you know, it's so salient when you told me that.
[03:52:01.612 --> 03:52:06.555]  I mean, if you look at the technical case, we've got to see some type of retracement.
[03:52:06.555 --> 03:52:11.758]  And if you look at what some of, you know, I don't make it too public, but you know it.
[03:52:11.758 --> 03:52:14.359]  You know, I've talked to a number of members of Congress.
[03:52:14.359 --> 03:52:18.982]  In fact, the House Judiciary Chairman, Bob Goodlatte, is a friend of mine.
[03:52:18.982 --> 03:52:21.723]  You know, I lived in Lynchburg for a number of years.
[03:52:21.723 --> 03:52:23.224]  And the Congressman out of Roanoke.
[03:52:23.864 --> 03:52:29.826]  And, you know, a number of these other senators and congressmen are very, very concerned about this issue.
[03:52:29.826 --> 03:52:33.007]  Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, a number of them.
[03:52:33.007 --> 03:52:42.690]  And, you know, I told one major CEO, everyone, you know, on Twitter knows I have a relationship with a couple of CEOs in Silicon Valley, some major ones.
[03:52:42.690 --> 03:52:45.391]  And I told him, I said, if you all don't get your crap together,
[03:52:46.098 --> 03:52:52.522]  By January, you know, you're going to see the ire of the Republican Party so long as we are still in the majority.
[03:52:52.522 --> 03:52:54.803]  And I think that we are going to be in the majority.
[03:52:54.803 --> 03:53:09.731]  Are other analysts in Wall Street recognizing that Republicans are willing to put aside some of their conservative ideology and regulate a lot of these spaces if they're going to continue to come down on consumers and our speech?
[03:53:11.134 --> 03:53:12.455]  So it's actually the opposite.
[03:53:12.455 --> 03:53:20.018]  So let me tell you why the stocks have worked well after Zuckerberg's congressional testimony last, I think it was April.
[03:53:20.018 --> 03:53:23.940]  So here's the reason why these stocks are hitting slight new highs.
[03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:33.782]  It's the belief on Wall Street that Mark Zuckerberg is now willing to be regulated, but he's going to help write most of the regulations.
[03:53:33.782 --> 03:53:36.263]  And it's going to be, look over here, don't look over here.
[03:53:36.263 --> 03:53:43.285]  And in the net effect, it's going to actually destroy the competition and it's going to be more power to the monopolist.
[03:53:43.285 --> 03:53:45.925]  So that's why these stocks are going up.
[03:53:45.925 --> 03:53:52.827]  Wall Street is betting that it's going to be business as usual and that the crony capitalism is going to continue.
[03:53:52.827 --> 03:53:53.367]  That's the bet.
[03:53:55.823 --> 03:54:12.396]  So, I'm taking the opposite bet that the populism worm is here, globalism is over, the crony capitalism is, I think it's almost too untenable to get away with it, there's too many eyeballs on it, they're trying to censor and de-platform other people.
[03:54:12.396 --> 03:54:19.262]  So, my bet is technically we're getting exhaustion cell signals on these stocks, and I think
[03:54:19.989 --> 03:54:24.010]  I think fundamentally, we're going to start to hear some bad news for them on the regulatory front.
[03:54:24.010 --> 03:54:27.892]  And also, I think more and more, I think we're going to start to see whistleblowers come forward.
[03:54:27.892 --> 03:54:33.634]  I think there's going to be more discovery of things, nefarious things that they've been up to.
[03:54:33.634 --> 03:54:37.255]  So, you know, this is, I'm actually, so Wall Street, I think, has it wrong.
[03:54:37.255 --> 03:54:38.175]  That's the opportunity.
[03:54:38.175 --> 03:54:39.455]  That's why I'm betting against them.
[03:54:39.455 --> 03:54:41.856]  I think Wall Street's off on this.
[03:54:41.856 --> 03:54:44.037]  What is that, buy the rumors, sell the news?
[03:54:44.037 --> 03:54:45.137]  What's that quote?
[03:54:45.137 --> 03:54:47.038]  And will you tell our audience what that means?
[03:54:48.610 --> 03:55:07.956]  Yeah, so stocks are a discounting mechanism and what that means is by the time you're reading the headline on a stock, the news, all of it's already been discounted and smart investors have already figured it out and the stock has already either gone down to that point or up to the point.
[03:55:07.956 --> 03:55:09.817]  So by the time you hear the news, it's too late.
[03:55:11.232 --> 03:55:13.173]  Yeah, mom and pops are kind of screwed.
[03:55:13.173 --> 03:55:20.457]  These other guys, they're playing with inside information or legally obtained information, and they're playing pre-market.
[03:55:20.457 --> 03:55:25.579]  You know, it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not inside information.
[03:55:25.579 --> 03:55:30.902]  It's a it's it's it's call it like they're putting together the analyst mosaic.
[03:55:30.902 --> 03:55:39.126]  They're more informed than the general person, and they start to become cautious on a stock and slowly the stock starts to relatively underperform.
[03:55:39.126 --> 03:55:39.766]  And by the time
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:41.381]  We're good to go.
[03:55:57.492 --> 03:56:00.434]  Okay, so I believe we're at a four-year cycle low.
[03:56:00.434 --> 03:56:06.757]  I'm a cycle believer, and the dollar on average has, from major low to low, is four years, and we had it in February.
[03:56:06.757 --> 03:56:17.662]  Interest rate differentials between us and the rest of the world, the Fed's been leading, so that's going to cause people to become more attracted to our bonds and our treasuries, which will then create a bid for dollars.
[03:56:17.662 --> 03:56:23.685]  Again, Trump's policies are very dollar bullish, corporate tax rates being lower, repatriation of offshore funds.
[03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:39.663]  Also, he's going to have a budget deficit, which is going to crowd out other countries, and we're going to fund our deficit that way, because of, like I said, the interest rate differential, so that'll cause a bid for dollars.
[03:56:39.663 --> 03:56:48.912]  I talked about the $9 trillion in emerging market debt that's denominated in dollars, so effectively those countries are short the dollar, so that'll start to feed on itself.
[03:56:49.511 --> 03:56:54.634]  And then ultimately, as the global economy slows, there's always a safety bet for the dollar.
