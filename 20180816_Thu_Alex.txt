[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:34.000]  Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world!
[00:34.000 --> 00:51.560]  Now I always wanted to go toe-to-toe with the globalists with George Soros and the Rothschilds
[00:51.560 --> 00:54.720]  and the New World Order and the Rockefeller Combine.
[00:54.720 --> 00:59.000]  Now we're toe-to-toe, ladies and gentlemen, toe-to-toe at point blank range with their
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.800]  lie machine, their deception machine, their poverty machine.
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I have ever
[01:09.600 --> 01:13.400]  done today.
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.400]  And at the bottom of the hour I am going to lay out exactly what they're planning, exactly
[01:19.400 --> 01:23.520]  what they're doing and how they're going to move against everyone.
[01:23.520 --> 01:28.400]  There is no doubt we know about their plan for an October surprise.
[01:28.400 --> 01:32.960]  We know about their entire concerted operation to bring us down, everyone else down and we
[01:32.960 --> 01:39.920]  know about it mainly because Senator Warner and Senator Murphy and others have been writing
[01:39.920 --> 01:45.400]  memos and talking about it and now the memos have leaked and are public.
[01:45.400 --> 01:53.440]  And I have my big blue chip DC law firm with this Intel report, attorney-client privilege
[01:53.440 --> 01:59.840]  but I've blacked out the names and I'm going to let you see this coming up.
[01:59.840 --> 02:06.400]  This is the admitted battle plan by next year to have no conservatives, no libertarians,
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.080]  no talk radio, you name it.
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.160]  Now you ask how they're going to do it, you know how they're going to do it.
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.800]  First it was going to be 100 newspapers, now it's 350, all writing editorials saying that
[02:17.800 --> 02:22.400]  Trump is going to cause violence against the media by when they call him a liar or a Nazi,
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.640]  he says they're liars, they say that's going to cause violence, then they promote violence
[02:27.640 --> 02:34.160]  just like they edit what I've said when Antifa says in front of the White House with signs
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.640]  and more than 15 people on video, we've got bullets for the Republicans, we've got bullets
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.680]  for Trump, we're coming to kill them at their houses, we're going to kill their families.
[02:42.680 --> 02:47.160]  I say man, if I was one of these people targeted by Antifa, I would have my battle rifle by
[02:47.160 --> 02:55.600]  my bed, that turns into, Alex Jones is going to use a battle rifle on Lester Holt and
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.920]  Lester Holt literally looks at a piece of paper and goes, Jones essentially said he's
[03:01.920 --> 03:08.160]  going to engage in criminal activity and come after us with weapons, I'm scared.
[03:08.160 --> 03:15.840]  Total hoax, he didn't show a video, nothing and my lawyers have never seen anything like
[03:15.840 --> 03:23.200]  it, they say they are stunned and they agree they are making their complete move and I
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.120]  just got off the phone with high level folks in talk radio, they've confirmed this, I
[03:28.120 --> 03:34.360]  mean they are making their move, Barry Diller said earlier this year, big globalist Democrat,
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.880]  one of the founders of Fox News, he said we will have paid internet, everyone will be
[03:39.880 --> 03:45.120]  off the web, all the competition by 2019, the Wall Street Journal said that five months
[03:45.120 --> 03:51.120]  ago as well, you asked how they are going to do it, how are you going to do that?
[03:51.120 --> 03:58.080]  You sell the point that the president and Alex Jones and alternative media is going
[03:58.080 --> 04:06.240]  to cause violence, you then promote the violence, you then edit what people said, you then provocateur
[04:06.240 --> 04:14.840]  or stage an event against yourself and then the Democrats sweep in in the 2018 midterms
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.840]  as their false flag.
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.120]  Now I'm going to break it all down to the bottom of the hour, remember Bill Clinton
[04:19.120 --> 04:27.480]  on Air Force One to U.S. today, the New York Times, all of them in 1996 said, I owe my
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.360]  reelection, we were 10 points behind to Oklahoma City bombing, which we know was a false flag,
[04:33.360 --> 04:36.640]  we've interviewed the police officers, the witnesses, we have the hotel receipts, World
[04:36.640 --> 04:41.520]  Net Daily does, they proved it all, law firms involved, it all came out in lawsuits, that
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.640]  the feds bombed that out of Elohim City and the Southern Prairie Law Center was running
[04:45.640 --> 04:49.720]  that group and that's all come out.
[04:49.720 --> 04:54.040]  And so that's the only way they've got to win the midterms is a big terror attack against
[04:54.040 --> 05:00.800]  a media institution, a fake media group or big tech to be blamed on us.

[06:19.880 --> 06:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now 100% crystal clear.
[06:26.880 --> 06:33.000]  Like the deepest blue sky in the high desert.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.280]  The desperate corporate dying media, the desperate dying democratic party, the desperate dying
[06:38.280 --> 06:45.120]  globalist combine of the Rockefellers and Soros is being defeated on a planetary scale.
[06:45.120 --> 06:50.720]  They're desperately organizing in Europe and in the United States in the holes of power
[06:50.720 --> 06:56.400]  to bring in draconian censorship of nationalist and populist movements who are awake and winning
[06:56.400 --> 06:59.160]  elections everywhere.
[06:59.160 --> 07:03.800]  They're putting total censorship grids into places that are going nationalist and patriot
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.640]  conservative like Brazil.
[07:06.640 --> 07:11.360]  Like France, the list goes on and on and how are they going to snatch victory from the
[07:11.360 --> 07:14.920]  jaws of defeat?
[07:14.920 --> 07:17.320]  How are they going to do it?
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.320]  They've shed it.
[07:18.320 --> 07:20.880]  It started about six months ago.
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.880]  If Trump criticizes the media he's calling for violence, there's going to be violence.
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.840]  There will be blood on his hands.
[07:26.840 --> 07:34.160]  Thousands of CNN, MSNBC comments, thousands of articles, 300 plus dying newspapers today,
[07:34.160 --> 07:38.640]  all publishing in unison in a coordinated effort saying Trump's calling for violence.
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.640]  There's going to be violence.
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.640]  There's going to be violence.
[07:40.640 --> 07:46.800]  There's not, they're calling for violence and desperately saying we're in a civil war.
[07:46.800 --> 07:50.320]  We hope it doesn't have to get violent, says Rob Reiner.
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.000]  But whatever happens, it's going to happen.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.080]  On and on and on, a Trump's hate movement against the media.
[07:56.080 --> 08:03.200]  And then in the last 24 hours they've had thousands of fake news publications come out
[08:03.200 --> 08:09.600]  in a unified, concerted script and say, quote, Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist.
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.560]  He's going to kill people with no link to where I said it.
[08:12.560 --> 08:20.200]  The lawyers have seen it open and shut, lawsuit will be lost unless by the time that lawsuit
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.600]  gets filed it's happened.
[08:23.600 --> 08:28.320]  They have thrown all caution to the wind.
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.000]  They are lying everywhere showing none of the proof.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.040]  CNN article accuses them for being complicit domestic terror.
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.040]  That's yesterday.
[08:36.040 --> 08:41.840]  It says I am a terrorist, close quote, involved in terrorism.
[08:41.840 --> 08:47.840]  Twitter blocks Alex Jones for calling for violence on the media, anti-fun the Chai comms.
[08:47.840 --> 08:58.200]  They only show quotes around each word, never said it, total hoax.
[08:58.200 --> 09:04.320]  I have top law firms, two of them in the country saying 100% victories.
[09:04.320 --> 09:09.560]  It's open and shut, but we're not going to have a country by then.
[09:09.560 --> 09:11.600]  This is war-level propaganda.
[09:11.600 --> 09:19.760]  This is beyond what they did to invade Iraq in 2003 with all the fake intelligence because
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.360]  they're not invading Alex Jones.
[09:21.360 --> 09:23.160]  They're invading the First Amendment in America.
[09:23.160 --> 09:25.800]  This is their move.
[09:25.800 --> 09:33.720]  Soros just poured billions into Facebook and into Spotify and others for censoring me,
[09:33.720 --> 09:37.080]  which is the payment for them losing all the business they're going to get when they ban
[09:37.080 --> 09:41.880]  all libertarians, all Christians, all conservatives, and it's been announced by Barry Deller.
[09:41.880 --> 09:43.520]  It's been announced by News Corp.
[09:43.520 --> 09:44.520]  They're involved.
[09:44.520 --> 09:45.760]  Now, split off.
[09:45.760 --> 09:46.760]  It's here.
[09:46.760 --> 09:48.800]  It's here.
[09:48.800 --> 09:50.280]  This is the maximum alert.
[09:50.280 --> 09:53.960]  Now, remember, I'm going to lay all this out at the bottom of the hour in detail, but
[09:53.960 --> 10:01.640]  remember, within hours of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Bill Clinton, I think it's
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.560]  even on YouTube still, and Janet Reno then gave a press conference that night saying
[10:07.560 --> 10:12.520]  Rush Limbaugh caused the bombing.
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.400]  The Republicans were going to win the House and the Senate.
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.920]  Bill Clinton was going to lose.
[10:18.920 --> 10:20.880]  In fact, I forgot to print that.
[10:20.880 --> 10:21.880]  I need that to bottom of the hour.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.880]  It's an exhibit.
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.120]  Type in Bill Clinton credits, 96 reelection to Oklahoma City bombing.
[10:27.120 --> 10:30.560]  You may have to click web or click images that we print out, so like USA Today.
[10:30.560 --> 10:31.560]  I need that.
[10:31.560 --> 10:34.000]  I'm going to put this whole exhibit on here at the bottom of the hour.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.280]  It's why they want me off air.
[10:35.280 --> 10:40.840]  They want me off air before they carry this out.
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.040]  Now, I'm going to explain something.
[10:42.040 --> 10:43.640]  I've talked to a lot of sources.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.640]  They concurred on the analysis.
[10:44.640 --> 10:46.280]  This is my analysis, though.
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.840]  Remember, I was able to predict a World Trade Center attack in 2001, too much for it happened
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.080]  with total precision.
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.440]  They are going to stage these events, and they were planning to de-platform me when
[11:00.440 --> 11:02.640]  they staged the event.
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.280]  But they knew when I started saying a couple of weeks ago, not just the Chai-Com info,
[11:07.280 --> 11:10.300]  but about how I believe they were pairing a false flag, and I was talking about Stelter
[11:10.300 --> 11:13.680]  in the media and these newspapers saying Trump's going to cause violence, and that Trump needs
[11:13.680 --> 11:15.280]  to understand that.
[11:15.280 --> 11:18.600]  And they know for a fact I've been trying to get that information to Trump that they
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.920]  just said, listen, we can't have this guy up there on all these platforms before we
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.800]  pull this off.
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.920]  So you need to call the White House.
[11:28.920 --> 11:29.920]  You need to call Congress.
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.560]  You need to do it every day, every hour.
[11:31.560 --> 11:33.280]  You need to call Talk Radio.
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.760]  She's spanned everywhere.
[11:34.760 --> 11:40.200]  Just like I said, on July 25, 2001, the audience wasn't that big then.
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.920]  I'm just all maybe 100 radio stations and local TV.
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.960]  I need everybody to understand this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.480]  They built me up into this giant boogeyman thinking it would get Trump unelected, where
[11:57.480 --> 11:59.320]  he wouldn't get elected.
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.440]  Now they think he won't get elected, but it's beyond that.
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.040]  They're going to make their move, and that's why they ran the hoax today.
[12:07.040 --> 12:11.320]  I get up at 5 a.m., type my name in, getting ready to be punched in the stomach.
[12:11.320 --> 12:18.600]  It's always some new lie, but it's worth it for the country and my children.
[12:18.600 --> 12:25.280]  And it's Alex Jones' pirate radio station rated $15,000 fine.
[12:25.280 --> 12:32.120]  And I read the AP, and then I go to the Hill, they lied even worse, they said, Alex Jones'
[12:32.120 --> 12:33.120]  radio station.
[12:33.120 --> 12:36.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't broadcast on TV or radio.
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.280]  We have satellite up, at least the satellites that are totally legal and lawful.
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.400]  We also have fiber optics that shares the show.
[12:43.400 --> 12:49.080]  Anybody running a station knows that, but this is put out to create the idea that now
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.280]  my broadcast, now my radio show itself is illegal, and you'll read the Facebook comments
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.720]  on CBS's story, just one, I looked at 1,000s and it says, good, take him off the air, arrest
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.720]  him.
[12:59.720 --> 13:01.600]  They are getting their mob wound up.
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.320]  The idea that Alex Jones has an illegal radio station, Alex Jones has taken off the air
[13:06.320 --> 13:16.240]  and an FCC rated, then I read the article, and I knew the hoax was even worse than that.
[13:16.240 --> 13:22.280]  They admit in the AP, since we're done on purpose, that at some station you can't even
[13:22.280 --> 13:26.840]  hear for half a mile, I didn't even know it was there, anybody could buy one of these
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.160]  kits I guess online, probably thousands of these around the country carrying different
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.280]  things, nobody knows, and so they put this out to have the illusion that I'm running
[13:36.280 --> 13:42.600]  a legal radio station and that my offices are illegal and criminal, and I'm telling
[13:42.600 --> 13:48.880]  you right now that they're going to try to parlay that and to cook that into some type
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.480]  of raid on us to try to actually shut down the broadcast.
[13:54.480 --> 13:57.400]  I mean, I remember over the years, there have been a bunch of groups that have run different
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.320]  stuff, and I've been at gun shows and stuff, you know, 10 years ago and shit somebody's
[14:00.320 --> 14:03.800]  hands in, oh, I'm running you on this or I'm running you on a half watt that, and I'm
[14:03.800 --> 14:07.200]  like, oh, really, where can I hear that, and I kind of drive around sometimes and never
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.680]  really pick it up, and I believe in the First Amendment, I believe when corporate stations
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.880]  don't serve the people, people have a right to have micros, what they call pirates, but
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.080]  they now imagine waking up and you hear you're running, quote, an illegal radio station and
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.200]  there's a $15,000 fine and it's Alex Jones and it's his flagship, I don't even know it
[14:26.200 --> 14:27.200]  exist.
[14:27.200 --> 14:28.720]  I asked the office, is anybody ever heard of this?
[14:28.720 --> 14:32.840]  They said no, years ago there were stations, I go, yeah, like two, three years ago, it
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.160]  was a station up for a while, you could hear every once in a while, I'm like 90.1 or something,
[14:38.160 --> 14:45.280]  so that's how crazy this is, folks, is that they're on the news saying is illegal broadcasts
[14:45.280 --> 14:50.560]  rated by the federal government, $15,000 fine, when we're on over 200 radio stations
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.360]  approaching 300, on our satellite, big ones, little ones, you name it, we're on 400 plus
[14:56.360 --> 15:03.320]  UHFVHF TV stations, over 100 cable stations, we probably signed 50 agreements last week,
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.360]  I've got a stack of liners and promos I'm supposed to cut for stations, I'm way behind,
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.680]  we have stations knocking down our doors, we just met with broadcast stations two days
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.680]  ago in Houston at a big meeting, that's why they're pissed because they wanted to kill
[15:16.680 --> 15:22.080]  Sinclair's deal to put Patriot stuff on TV and they have Sinclair's expansion, they run
[15:22.080 --> 15:29.120]  these lies that I'm on Sinclair, I'm not, total hoax, never been on a Sinclair radio
[15:29.120 --> 15:37.280]  station, which is another group, I mean it's just insane, so it's a total hoax, I don't

[18:00.280 --> 18:05.640]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:28.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses, they began studying this effect in published
[18:28.920 --> 18:34.280]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable
[18:34.280 --> 18:38.160]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.320]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[18:43.320 --> 18:48.160]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.280]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.640]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of
[18:57.640 --> 19:05.080]  our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:22.520 --> 20:29.520]  Alright, I have never had this many butterflies in my chest, on air in 24 years, I can speak
[20:29.520 --> 20:36.520]  to a group of 10,000 people, auditorium and not have any butterflies, I'm a pretty confident
[20:36.520 --> 20:43.520]  guy, I can walk over to a beautiful woman when I wasn't married or whatever and ask her out
[21:00.160 --> 21:04.240]  and be calm about it, I could be ready to get into a fist fight with somebody starting
[21:04.240 --> 21:07.960]  a fight with me back in those days and I didn't have anxiety, but let me tell you something
[21:07.960 --> 21:13.240]  right now, the anxiety I have is not personal fear, it's that I'm not going to execute this
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.160]  properly and lay this out properly to you because this is the whole future of the country,
[21:18.160 --> 21:24.200]  the Trump Revolution, our children, Christianity, free market, everything, these people trying
[21:24.200 --> 21:28.640]  to take over are really, really, really bad, so I'm going to try not to break down too
[21:28.640 --> 21:33.120]  and the reason I start crying at these moments is the emotions are so strong, how much I
[21:33.120 --> 21:37.680]  love my family, how much I love you and how bad these people are, how evil they are and
[21:37.680 --> 21:42.400]  the clutch of lies that they've had on us for so long and what they're doing to our
[21:42.400 --> 21:46.800]  children, how they're brainwashing our children, how they're trying to screw them up psychologically,
[21:46.800 --> 21:51.440]  how they've got 30% of the population on psychotropics and everywhere you go, you've
[21:51.440 --> 21:56.720]  gone from one in 30,000 with autism to one in 58 and there's just brain damaged children
[21:56.720 --> 22:00.880]  everywhere and it's all by design, it's all declassified and it's just such a horrible
[22:00.880 --> 22:08.720]  eugenics program that's 5,000 times bigger conservatively than something like Tuskegee,
[22:08.720 --> 22:15.480]  secretly injecting black people with syphilis and it's just all coming out and it's every
[22:15.480 --> 22:22.160]  day a new lie, if you've been in broadcast radio like I have been for 23 years, started
[22:22.160 --> 22:31.840]  that on Access TV my first year, 24 years ago in 1995 but got on local radio in 1996,
[22:31.840 --> 22:38.000]  you know about the FCC, about transmitters, about Q-tones, about all of it and then to
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.280]  get up this morning, I'm just going to tell the story now because it's illustrative of
[22:41.280 --> 22:48.720]  everything else I'm saying, just a microcosm of the tapestry of lies and 5 a.m. I get up,
[22:48.720 --> 22:56.960]  it's glass of water, walk out on the back ports, type in my name into an iPad and it's
[22:56.960 --> 23:04.040]  Alex Jones' flagship pirate radio station rated, I'm like, are there even pirates in
[23:04.040 --> 23:05.040]  Austin anymore?
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.040]  It's been two, three years since I even heard one, there was like punk rock ones and religious
[23:09.040 --> 23:17.600]  ones and you know, it's crazy and yeah, absolutely, there have been groups out there that have
[23:17.600 --> 23:21.480]  all over the country, I get calls from stations that we say, well, what's your call letter?
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.160]  Oh, it's not a call letter, some guys got a, you know, a micro up on the mountain here
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.600]  in Colorado, I can hear it for 20 miles.
[23:29.600 --> 23:35.560]  So this is part of the American fabric, it's an uncivil thing, you can get fines for it
[23:35.560 --> 23:40.240]  but we're not involved in it, we don't broadcast, we don't have TV stations, radio stations,
[23:40.240 --> 23:46.420]  we are a provider, we have satellite uplinks, our fiber optic, you know, goes to another
[23:46.420 --> 23:51.760]  place in Austin with satellite uplinks and then those go to satellites legally and lawfully
[23:51.760 --> 23:56.720]  and we pay tens of thousands of dollars a month to do that, that's from our building
[23:56.720 --> 23:59.120]  up to space and then back down to the planet.
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.960]  We don't have radio transmitters, we don't even have a walkie talkie system on the building
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.160]  that we could have, which I thought might be good for us, you can get those, you know,
[24:08.160 --> 24:13.480]  easily that go a few miles or whatever but just think about that, you get up, you're
[24:13.480 --> 24:17.560]  drinking a glass of water, making coffee, walking on the back porch, all right, let
[24:17.560 --> 24:21.800]  me see, Alex Jones, get ready to get hit in the stomach, boom, you know, it's a live
[24:21.800 --> 24:27.800]  per day or more and I'm like, I read the names of the people and never heard of them
[24:27.800 --> 24:30.520]  because, you know, going back 10 years ago or so, I'd be the gun show, somebody say,
[24:30.520 --> 24:36.760]  hey, I'm running you on whatever, two watts, it goes out five miles, I'm like, wow, interesting,
[24:36.760 --> 24:37.760]  great.
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.000]  You know, those empty spaces on the frequency, I don't know these people, you know, a lot
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.240]  of folks have bemoaned the fact that it's been years since we could even hear any of
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.280]  these pirates in Austin and I've been on different stations here in Austin that are
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.120]  commercial, we're on 50,000 watt stations across the country, we're on stations that
[24:54.120 --> 25:00.880]  are licensed, stations that cover whole multi-states, so the idea behind this is all crafted and
[25:00.880 --> 25:07.640]  all planned and then I read the article, it said that the low-powered station that only
[25:07.640 --> 25:13.240]  went like a mile or something hadn't been on since last year and that there was an
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.040]  FCC letter sent to them.
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.320]  So now, Alex Jones' flagship station taken off, I didn't even know it's on, I don't
[25:21.320 --> 25:28.760]  know who it is, I don't even know if I was really on it, it's crazy and that is a microcosm
[25:28.760 --> 25:34.000]  of how they lie because you go to CBS News everywhere, it's screw you, Jones, like Ben
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.800]  Friget, we're reading it in his office, I have to bring over the quotes because I wanted
[25:37.800 --> 25:41.720]  to read them, it's like, good, take your criminal show off the air, I knew it was illegal and
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.840]  it's all done knowing the public doesn't know how radio and TV networks work, they don't
[25:47.840 --> 25:53.880]  know how it works, so they hear Alex Jones hit with $15,000 fine, no, it's a hoax, it's
[25:53.880 --> 26:00.280]  a total and complete hoax but it's to put out there that I'm illegal, that I'm bad,
[26:00.280 --> 26:03.960]  that I'm doing terrible things, that I've got to be shut down, that I'm this terrible
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.840]  villain, Alex Jones is mean to children, Alex Jones is a terrorist, Alex Jones has
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.640]  illegal radio stations, Alex Jones' show is illegal, I've never had one FCC action
[26:14.640 --> 26:24.560]  on me in 23 years on radio, twice we've missed cuss words that went out but there was never
[26:24.560 --> 26:32.800]  any FCC action, we have never had an FCC case or issue and I've been on there 24 years
[26:32.800 --> 26:39.080]  and there aren't many people that can say that, people complain about everything, 24
[26:39.080 --> 26:49.720]  years, 23 and a half, FCC Chairman Pied defends crackdown on pirate radio station broadcasting
[26:49.720 --> 26:56.160]  Alex Jones, what is pie weighing in on this, print me that, this is a station that I couldn't
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.440]  even hear, that I even know about and it's a big national issue because now all the
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.700]  corporate guys get their cover, well even the conservative FCC head defends the crackdown
[27:06.700 --> 27:14.960]  on the Alex Jones station, he says we will always follow the law, it's a station used
[27:14.960 --> 27:21.440]  by Alex Jones, so that means if those stations picked up anything off a satellite, thousands
[27:21.440 --> 27:27.720]  of feeds, they're all guilty too, but I never heard it to even know if I was on it, that's
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.640]  the next level deception, that's the next level lies and it's every day something new,
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.320]  a new lie, I say wow, Antifone these videos just said they're coming with firearms to
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.600]  kill members of Congress, President Trump and talk show hosts and others, everybody
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.560]  better get their battle rifles ready at their homes for self defense, that's the quote,
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.320]  but Twitter says if we play it, they'll ban us, so only media matters can show the quote
[27:51.320 --> 27:56.440]  but then no one else actually plays the quote, it's a 20-something minute transmission and
[27:56.440 --> 28:00.880]  it's about chai comms of taking over the government, taking over Hollywood, Antifone says they're
[28:00.880 --> 28:04.600]  coming to attack you, we need Trump to legally and lawfully through the criminal justice
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.960]  system come after him, that turns into quote, we need to criminally with battle rifles go
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.520]  after the media, never said that, that's what Lester Holt and MSNBC and CNN and the New
[28:15.520 --> 28:21.800]  York Times and again, the fraud level is like 20, 30 times whatever was, they've gone pure
[28:21.800 --> 28:28.560]  fraud and they wouldn't be doing this if they weren't planning something ultra massive and
[28:28.560 --> 28:31.720]  what are they saying, Trump and Alex Jones are going to cause violence against us and
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.560]  the media, that's their reelection bid, that's how they make themselves the victims, try
[28:36.560 --> 28:41.360]  to bring in the midterms, impeach Trump, shut down all of his support, all the pro-americana
[28:41.360 --> 28:46.280]  people and roll out and as they cover up all the Antifone stuff, oh and get the clip, as
[28:46.280 --> 28:51.520]  Governor Cuomo says America was never great, these people hate America but you can stop
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.120]  them, the live feeds are on infowars.com, I want to thank DrudgeReport.com being the
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.320]  only place that put my Lester Holt response out.

[32:04.760 --> 32:09.960]  about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake
[32:09.960 --> 32:15.960]  strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia
[32:15.960 --> 32:22.760]  and then voila, two weeks later ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[32:22.760 --> 32:30.080]  where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show,
[32:30.080 --> 32:34.000]  subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.760]  your podcast in, it'll pop up there, it's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward
[32:38.760 --> 32:43.800]  slash newsletter and give us your emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send
[32:43.800 --> 32:49.160]  you videos and articles on our own platform, but whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com
[32:49.160 --> 32:53.560]  forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can
[32:53.560 --> 32:58.280]  then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info, this
[32:58.280 --> 33:03.520]  is what they don't want you to see.
[33:03.520 --> 33:25.760]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show, you are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline
[33:25.760 --> 33:42.480]  report, it's Alex Jones, if you just joined us, I'm going to lay out the most important
[33:42.480 --> 33:48.560]  information that we have ever broke down, not just for America, but for the planet.
[33:48.560 --> 33:56.460]  This information persists of the globalist enemy plan to turn the election in the mid
[33:56.460 --> 34:01.840]  terms for the Democrats and then abolish the First Amendment bringing in draconian free
[34:01.840 --> 34:07.560]  speech controls in America that Senator Warner and Senator Murphy admit they're doing and
[34:07.560 --> 34:13.360]  we have their own admitted plans that leaked two weeks ago that they admit are real.
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.600]  Since then they've gone public saying we will silence all conservatives.
[34:17.600 --> 34:22.320]  Their commo has come out and said America was never that great.
[34:22.320 --> 34:28.800]  These are globalists, they are the enemy of the American people.
[34:28.800 --> 34:37.080]  They literally unveiled their new slogan, America was never that great.
[34:37.080 --> 34:44.320]  They're putting out disinfo articles about us everywhere, lies about us, that we got
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.800]  criminally rated yesterday over the legal radio station that I literally didn't even know
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.960]  was operating and it turns out wasn't operating.
[34:52.960 --> 34:59.480]  They say it was off last December and I didn't even know they had pirates in Austin for years
[34:59.480 --> 35:05.600]  because they were so low powered, but that's what they're doing ahead of the big event.
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.680]  Now, I pulled together a lot of these articles and I put together the evidence of what's
[35:10.680 --> 35:18.080]  going to unfold.
[35:18.080 --> 35:20.880]  That's going to be a favorite, close the second door please.
[35:20.880 --> 35:25.760]  But I'm not even up to doing this at this point, I'm going to have to do it next segment.
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.240]  This is just so monstrous, so complete that if I just get caught up in the minutiae and
[35:31.240 --> 35:34.960]  proving every point of it, it won't be the announcement I need to make because unlike
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.720]  mainstream media where they just say Alex Jones says use your battle rifles on mainstream
[35:39.720 --> 35:44.000]  media and then they don't show where I said it, if I'm going to say it, I'm going to show
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  it.
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.480]  I've got the New York Times right here where Bill Clinton said he won re-election in 1996
[35:51.480 --> 35:52.800]  because of Oklahoma City.
[35:52.800 --> 35:59.160]  I need to highlight that part when I do the presentation, I just need to put that out
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.200]  so you guys take this and highlight that and then I've got all the letters and all the
[36:03.200 --> 36:09.440]  facts and all the documents and I've got mainstream corporate media saying I'm a terrorist,
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.280]  CNN.
[36:13.280 --> 36:16.760]  I have just got unbelievable information here that we're going to have to go over in the
[36:16.760 --> 36:21.080]  next segment and I'm going to try my best.
[36:21.080 --> 36:30.440]  I'm going to try my very, very, very, very best but I'm going to have to get some focus
[36:30.440 --> 36:36.200]  in here first before I do this because make no mistake, they're getting ready to make
[36:36.200 --> 36:37.200]  their move.
[36:37.200 --> 36:39.920]  They're going to engage in propaganda of this magnitude.
[36:39.920 --> 36:40.920]  That wasn't the case.
[36:40.920 --> 36:51.200]  Guys, can I have a video list please, thank you.
[36:51.200 --> 37:00.240]  All I can say to the listeners is that everybody better get their act together right now and
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.640]  everybody better get serious because we're not going to take the country back from the
[37:03.640 --> 37:08.920]  globalist and then have this situation be easy.
[37:08.920 --> 37:09.920]  This is going to be hard.
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.520]  This is going to be serious and this is going to be hard fought politically and the enemy
[37:14.520 --> 37:19.080]  is going to try to make it physical but there's no doubt they're getting ready to carry out
[37:19.080 --> 37:26.840]  a large false flag against themselves, mainstream media, the Democrats, big tech companies to
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.400]  make themselves the victims.
[37:29.400 --> 37:33.480]  Morro admits he did this just a few years ago in Ukraine where they staged attacks on
[37:33.480 --> 37:41.160]  the populace to get it launched against the elected government to overthrow it.
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.720]  So we're going to be going over all of that when we come back from break.
[37:45.720 --> 37:52.080]  All I can tell you is if it wasn't for DrudgeReport.com, go to the left-hand side, he had at the
[37:52.080 --> 38:00.560]  top last night and this morning that I responded to Lester Holt and others and said, you are
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.480]  a liar.
[38:03.480 --> 38:07.080]  Show where I said use battle rifles on the media, the Chai comms.
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.720]  I said if Antifa comes to your house and I played the video of them saying we're coming
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.440]  to kill Republicans at their houses, you should have your rifle ready to protect yourself.
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.440]  And for that, Jack Dorsey banned me on Twitter for seven days and then went on the show with
[38:20.440 --> 38:28.880]  Holt and said yes, he saw me say all these things I didn't say.
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.200]  You can just see where this is going where I'll have no voice.
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.600]  And so now they're taking some pirate micro stations, what they're called, that did not
[38:36.600 --> 38:45.720]  even know existed, that closed in December, according to even the news as a footnote,
[38:45.720 --> 38:48.640]  and then they say that I'm running a legal station and got raided by the feds.
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.480]  There was no raid by feds, there was no station, they sent them an FCC letter and now that's
[38:54.480 --> 39:02.200]  national news that some micro station that you can buy for a kit for like $200, I know
[39:02.200 --> 39:07.080]  it was weak because I haven't heard any of those stations in years.
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.640]  Ten years ago I interviewed a guy running one in Austin that was strong up on a hill.
[39:11.640 --> 39:19.360]  It was a former sheriff, Frank, and I was on hundreds of stations at that time.
[39:19.360 --> 39:22.600]  So you know, micros, I know we're on them, they're getting out, as long as I don't interfere
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.080]  with the commercial stations, I'm happy they're there.
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.000]  It's an old American pastime, everybody knows, the left has them in a lot of big cities.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.120]  Those don't really get messed with.
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.320]  But he was getting messed with, and I remember telling him when he came on, I said, well,
[39:37.320 --> 39:40.880]  you're an old guy, your wife just died.
[39:40.880 --> 39:42.880]  Why don't you go ahead and turn this sucker off?
[39:42.880 --> 39:44.920]  I don't need you to have this station running for me.
[39:44.920 --> 39:46.880]  And he said, no, because he was running a bunch of other stuff.
[39:46.880 --> 39:52.880]  He goes, oh, I run 60 minutes programs I like plugged in the TV, but he looked in the hills
[39:52.880 --> 39:53.880]  outside town.
[39:53.880 --> 39:56.480]  So it covered part of the, like a half the city a little bit.
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.920]  I mean, if you were in your car, you could hear it, but you still kind of, I mean, I
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.280]  was already listening to an iPod or whatever, 10 years ago in my car.
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.600]  I just don't listen to really a lot of local radio unless it's the affiliate I'm on.
[40:09.600 --> 40:14.040]  You know, 590 is what we were on back at that time, which is the number one talk station
[40:14.040 --> 40:15.040]  in Central Texas.
[40:15.040 --> 40:19.040]  And we're on a bunch of other stations in Texas that are commercial stations.
[40:19.040 --> 40:24.920]  So I don't want them saying I'm running illegal radio stations to distract off the big news
[40:24.920 --> 40:27.320]  I'm about to cover.
[40:27.320 --> 40:29.040]  I don't want that to happen.
[40:29.040 --> 40:34.120]  But I'm just saying it's an example of every day the hoaxes that I'm doing something illegal.
[40:34.120 --> 40:42.360]  Here's an example, Antifa attacked me at the RNC and there's raw video of it online.
[40:42.360 --> 40:45.520]  And the police came in to protect me and took me out.
[40:45.520 --> 40:55.480]  Just type in Alex Jones, protected by police Cleveland, 2016, just show images.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.320]  It's all over the news.
[40:57.320 --> 41:02.040]  And it shows state police with me on each arm guiding me out and guys behind me in a
[41:02.040 --> 41:09.960]  protective detail, just type in Alex Jones, police Cleveland, click images, it'll come
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.440]  up or Alex Jones, protected by police Cleveland.
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.560]  But in the news, they always put the picture up.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.640]  Like I'm being arrested.
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.400]  So it's like Alex Jones, I saw a bunch of today, Alex Jones rated by the FCC.
[41:24.400 --> 41:27.840]  Yeah, that's not the photo.
[41:27.840 --> 41:28.840]  It doesn't matter.
[41:28.840 --> 41:31.480]  See, I just, I just can't do it anymore.
[41:31.480 --> 41:32.480]  It's all over the news today.
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.280]  I mean, it's just everywhere with the state police in their kind of Marine Corps hats leading
[41:38.280 --> 41:39.280]  me out.
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.280]  Everybody's seen it.
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.280]  We don't need to show it.
[41:41.280 --> 41:42.280]  It just doesn't matter.
[41:42.280 --> 41:44.840]  And we do need to get that camera straight though.
[41:44.840 --> 41:45.840]  There it is.
[41:45.840 --> 41:46.840]  That's the photo.
[41:46.840 --> 41:52.800]  So that's the photo they run everywhere, your TV viewer, and they run it like FCC raids
[41:52.800 --> 41:55.280]  Alex Jones' flagship station.
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.680]  And then that's in the news, that picture that I'm going to jail.
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.600]  And that's the hoax of these dirty lovelies.
[42:03.600 --> 42:08.440]  So while they're launching all this, they don't want me on air to respond to this and
[42:08.440 --> 42:09.680]  it's bigger than Alex Jones.
[42:09.680 --> 42:11.280]  They're coming for your free speech.
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.520]  They're coming for the election.
[42:12.520 --> 42:13.680]  They're coming for your guns.
[42:13.680 --> 42:14.840]  They're coming for your kids.
[42:14.840 --> 42:15.840]  They're coming for Trump.
[42:15.840 --> 42:20.120]  So what you can do is what Drudge Report has wisely done.
[42:20.120 --> 42:21.360]  Thank you for finding it guys.
[42:21.360 --> 42:22.360]  Great job.
[42:22.360 --> 42:28.880]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, go and get the verboten videos that they
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.920]  don't want you to see and post them on YouTube, post them on Facebook, download them, get
[42:33.920 --> 42:34.920]  them out.
[42:34.920 --> 42:36.320]  This is going to be a fight for the web.
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.400]  They're beta testing how to unperson somebody and how to phantom zone somebody on me right
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.400]  now.
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.200]  Now I'm not going to false start again.
[42:44.200 --> 42:45.440]  I'm going to just get wound up.
[42:45.440 --> 42:47.560]  I just got so much data to go over here.
[42:47.560 --> 42:51.120]  Any of my New York Times article highlighted, please, and I'm going to rampage through
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.360]  this on the other side of what's coming and what's going to happen and how we can stop
[42:55.360 --> 42:56.360]  it.
[42:56.360 --> 42:59.360]  I'm going to do some broadcast, probably in U.S. history.
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.400]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[43:03.400 --> 43:07.640]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[47:19.920 --> 47:45.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:45.920 --> 48:02.040]  The
[48:02.040 --> 48:04.600]  globalists think you're stupid.
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.720]  They think you're not paying attention.
[48:06.720 --> 48:14.440]  They launched their operations with huge PR rollouts, with psychological preparation,
[48:14.440 --> 48:23.080]  for what one law enforcement friend of mine called tactical brainwashing.
[48:23.080 --> 48:28.720]  They have been building me up for the last two years as the most evil person on earth
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.520]  with lie after lie and hundreds of thousands of news articles, thousands of TV news programs,
[48:35.520 --> 48:38.440]  highly edited for deception.
[48:38.440 --> 48:44.640]  Now they're saying I'm calling for people to use battle rifles on the mainstream media.
[48:44.640 --> 48:50.320]  They're claiming Trump's going to have blood on his hands any time because he's calling
[48:50.320 --> 48:55.080]  for violence against the media and then they show no proof.
[48:55.080 --> 48:59.280]  Now hundreds and hundreds of newspapers have published front page editorials saying Trump's
[48:59.280 --> 49:05.120]  going to cause violence against the media, we're poor victims.
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.400]  They're running pieces saying that I'm calling for violence and then they're running fake
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.680]  pieces saying I'm running illegal radio stations and my broadcast has been taken off the air
[49:12.680 --> 49:14.600]  in Austin, raided by the feds.
[49:14.600 --> 49:22.880]  There was no raid, there is no illegal station, it's a total hoax.
[49:22.880 --> 49:28.120]  For them to tell lies this big means they're about to go for broke.
[49:28.120 --> 49:37.080]  Now you have to understand the Clintons and the very same Soros globalist, Muller, the
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.760]  deputy attorney general at the time later became Obama's attorney general, he was involved
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.760]  in Oklahoma City, I interviewed the police officers, the widows, the witnesses, people
[49:45.760 --> 49:46.760]  in the buildings.
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.560]  Oklahoma City was an inside job, bombs inside, truck bomb outside, run out of Elohim City,
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.120]  control of the Southern Prairie Law Center, we have the receipts of the FBI and the ATF
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.240]  and German intelligence at the local La Quinta, World Net Daily broke it all, came out in
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.360]  federal lawsuits, witnesses saw them planting the bombs, they said, what is that?
[50:05.360 --> 50:12.280]  They said, oh, it's butter, gray butter to people that were in the building.
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.800]  They have done this before.
[50:16.800 --> 50:23.800]  They were going to lose the election in 1996, they were down 10 to 15 points in all the
[50:23.800 --> 50:24.800]  real polls.
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.200]  There was going to be a total political realignment, they were going to reject globalism.
[50:29.200 --> 50:32.360]  They just lost the House and Senate because of the gun control.
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.920]  What were they going to do?
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.120]  Bill Clinton a year later on Air Force One, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN,
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.920]  it's credited everywhere, credited his reelection to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[50:43.920 --> 50:45.800]  Why?
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.360]  Because within hours of the attack, Bill Clinton put out a press release and so did Janet
[50:50.360 --> 50:58.120]  Reno-Shang, Rush Limbaugh and talk radio were the cause of making people hate the federal
[50:58.120 --> 51:01.480]  government.
[51:01.480 --> 51:18.240]  Fast forward 23 years, 24 years and they're doing the same thing everywhere.
[51:18.240 --> 51:22.040]  We don't think NBC doesn't think about running a story saying, I'm calling for people to
[51:22.040 --> 51:26.600]  attack the media with battle rifles and not show a clip or not even show the fake articles
[51:26.600 --> 51:30.880]  where they take one word and one word and one word and put it in quotes to make up something
[51:30.880 --> 51:34.240]  fake.
[51:34.240 --> 51:36.480]  Thousands of publications running that.
[51:36.480 --> 51:39.920]  I had family calling this morning saying, did you get raided by the feds, were you running
[51:39.920 --> 51:40.920]  an illegal radio station?
[51:40.920 --> 51:46.160]  And I'm like, no, it's a hoax and they're like, God, sounds like everybody, my family,
[51:46.160 --> 51:57.160]  the worker going, we're getting set up, aren't we, and I'm like, yeah.
[51:57.160 --> 51:58.160]  So here's the deal.
[51:58.160 --> 52:00.240]  It's bigger than M-Full Wars.
[52:00.240 --> 52:03.860]  We were set up as the beta test, the straw man.
[52:03.860 --> 52:09.360]  Then they expand to Trump and they say, Trump is going to cause violence.
[52:09.360 --> 52:10.360]  Type in the headlines.
[52:10.360 --> 52:12.240]  Trump's going to have blood on his hands.
[52:12.240 --> 52:14.200]  Trump's creating a mob of violent people.
[52:14.200 --> 52:23.840]  Trump's creating all this and then they de-platform me off of Facebook, off of Google, off of
[52:23.840 --> 52:29.840]  YouTube, off of Spotify, off of Stitcher, and off of 19 other platforms.
[52:29.840 --> 52:33.560]  They go after our servers, they hack, attack us and bring us down.
[52:33.560 --> 52:35.200]  They do fake raids that don't exist.
[52:35.200 --> 52:38.520]  They go, oh, a station turned off some pirate in December last year.
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.920]  We sent people a letter that turns into a raid on my station, some half-watt thing I
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.200]  never even heard.
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  We're just guessing.
[52:45.200 --> 52:47.200]  I never even heard it.
[52:47.200 --> 52:51.640]  So that's the level that this has reached, folks.
[52:51.640 --> 52:52.640]  Of Jones is illegal.
[52:52.640 --> 52:53.640]  He's been raided.
[52:53.640 --> 52:54.640]  He's off the air.
[52:54.640 --> 52:56.000]  He's calling for killing the feds.
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.400]  He's calling for battle-rifling the media.
[53:01.400 --> 53:05.200]  When Antifuzz in the news saying, we're going to come to your house last Sunday at the White
[53:05.200 --> 53:08.360]  House, they said, we're going to come kill the president and we're going to come kill
[53:08.360 --> 53:09.360]  members of Congress.
[53:09.360 --> 53:12.440]  And I said, you folks better have security or you better have your battle rifle ready.
[53:12.440 --> 53:15.360]  Because Antifuzz is ready to do it.
[53:15.360 --> 53:16.360]  And they mean business.
[53:16.360 --> 53:18.120]  And I could play it again.
[53:18.120 --> 53:22.160]  The video that Twitter banned saying I was calling for battle-rifles and the media was
[53:22.160 --> 53:25.080]  the video of them saying it.
[53:25.080 --> 53:28.080]  So this is a major sigh-up.
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.760]  And we have Senator Warner and Senator Murphy's.
[53:31.760 --> 53:36.760]  My lawyers were so freaked out that off my dime, not even paying for it, they went and
[53:36.760 --> 53:38.160]  wrote a detailed analysis.
[53:38.160 --> 53:45.640]  Document cam shot, please, about how this is totally illegal, an organized plan to take
[53:45.640 --> 53:50.080]  everyone down, and how they have never seen it, and they're actually scared.
[53:50.080 --> 53:53.000]  By the way, a lot of these lawyers thought I was over the top just six months ago.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.080]  Now they are completely freaked out.
[53:56.080 --> 53:59.120]  And he's got all the senators and all their admissions.
[53:59.120 --> 54:02.840]  They're going to ban all conservatives, all Christians, all veterans groups, all gun groups.
[54:02.840 --> 54:04.440]  The NRA will be totally banned.
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.280]  They will have de-platform, no credit cards.
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.800]  You'll not be able to even be an NRA member.
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.320]  This is a violent counter-revolution against Trump coming in.
[54:14.320 --> 54:18.040]  And this is, I've got to file injunctions, everything, but the lawyers agree.
[54:18.040 --> 54:24.160]  They said this would not be going on if they weren't already planning to have the government
[54:24.160 --> 54:31.680]  take it over, because what they're doing is criminally legal.
[54:31.680 --> 54:36.800]  They are saying Senator Murphy, all of them are saying ban all conservatives.
[54:36.800 --> 54:37.800]  They're on record.
[54:37.800 --> 54:43.640]  So I'm going to tell you again, they're rolling out paid for PR, because most news articles
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.840]  nowadays are actually paid for on mainstream sites, it's propaganda.
[54:47.840 --> 54:53.600]  They're coming out with this office of counter-propaganda, Obama set up with the CIA before he left,
[54:53.600 --> 54:56.000]  and Congress to quote counter Alex Jones.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.920]  They said that last year, remember, in January before he left office.
[54:59.920 --> 55:02.640]  And now they're doing it with coordination.
[55:02.640 --> 55:08.160]  They've got three New York Times writers, two Washington Post writers, and Buzzfeed people
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.760]  here full time.
[55:09.760 --> 55:14.240]  And we're even getting recordings of these now, where they're calling up Mike Adams
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.840]  and other people, six people called me the last week and said, listen, first they call
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.200]  up and say, give us the dirt on Alex Jones, we'll write a huge puff piece on you, how
[55:22.200 --> 55:23.200]  great you are.
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.520]  When they say there is no dirt, they say, we're going to destroy you over the phone.
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.960]  The New York Times only does that, like about uranium or yellow cake or aluminum tubes or
[55:33.960 --> 55:34.960]  WMDs.
[55:34.960 --> 55:38.720]  They only lie when the strategic elites tell them to at that level.
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.800]  The New York Times has so-called Pulitzer Prize winners having their minions call, they
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.800]  actually use college students, so they have plausible liability to call up, yeah, we told
[55:51.800 --> 55:54.560]  you guys out of there, we know, you think I'm stupid.
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.280]  So anyways, but it didn't matter, all the stuff we've got is not going to matter.
[55:59.280 --> 56:00.360]  They're about to hit everybody.
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.760]  They literally call up and go, we will destroy you in the New York Times if you don't tell
[56:03.760 --> 56:06.000]  us that Alex Jones is bad and did illegal things.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.800]  I mean, the criminal focus is the invasion level.
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.200]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking down America and Trump and the recovery and
[56:17.200 --> 56:19.400]  the entire free press.
[56:19.400 --> 56:26.760]  So I'm telling you, like night follows day, the stage terror attacks are coming on big
[56:26.760 --> 56:34.000]  tech government buildings, mainstream media, all the stars will be gone that day, all the
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.840]  stelters will be gone that day, all the Lester Holtz will be gone, and they are going to
[56:38.840 --> 56:45.480]  drive a truck bomb or something into a daycare at CNN or ABC or something and have people
[56:45.480 --> 56:50.120]  shooting everybody you name it, you can see the pre-programming and say, see the hate
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.160]  did this, the hate did this while they cover up Antifa and the attack on Scalice and the
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.880]  attack on Rand Paul and all the calls to kidnap Baron and rape him.
[56:57.880 --> 56:59.520]  And we've got to get this out to Trump.
[56:59.520 --> 57:02.640]  We've got to let him know because Trump's not calling for violence when they attack Trump
[57:02.640 --> 57:03.640]  and lie about him.
[57:03.640 --> 57:04.640]  He says, you're fake news.
[57:04.640 --> 57:05.640]  You're lying.
[57:05.640 --> 57:06.640]  I'm not a racist.
[57:06.640 --> 57:07.640]  I love Mexicans, whatever.
[57:07.640 --> 57:08.640]  They go, oh, you're a Nazi.
[57:08.640 --> 57:09.640]  You're calling for violence.
[57:09.640 --> 57:10.640]  Put on your hands.
[57:10.640 --> 57:11.640]  Same thing with me.
[57:11.640 --> 57:14.000]  Editing stuff out of context to build this.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.840]  They got big tech, they got the media, they got the Democrats, they got Warner reportedly
[57:17.840 --> 57:23.160]  running it all, ready to quarterback this whole deal could happen today, tomorrow, next
[57:23.160 --> 57:24.160]  week, next month.
[57:24.160 --> 57:30.000]  But before, a couple of weeks before election, before we get there, they're going to do this.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.080]  But here's the key when we come back.
[57:32.080 --> 57:36.160]  If we expose it and if you get these videos out, we're going to post a live feed and you
[57:36.160 --> 57:39.800]  spread them no matter what and you go wild with the truth and we're all peaceful and
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.680]  call for peace and expose the fact that the left is the one being violent, they will not
[57:43.680 --> 57:53.440]  have the Cajones to launch it, but they silenced me ahead of time because I smelled it.
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.400]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[57:58.400 --> 57:59.400]  yeast.
[57:59.400 --> 58:02.960]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[58:02.960 --> 58:06.920]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[58:06.920 --> 58:12.040]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[58:12.040 --> 58:16.240]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.200]  product to help your body fight back.
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.960]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.640]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[58:27.640 --> 58:31.720]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarko
[58:31.720 --> 58:36.320]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[58:36.320 --> 58:39.320]  of time as powerful micro balancing properties.
[58:39.320 --> 58:46.320]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com.
[59:10.320 --> 59:14.800]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[59:14.800 --> 59:15.800]  You are the info ward.
[59:15.800 --> 59:20.880]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.960]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[59:25.960 --> 59:31.840]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:31.840 --> 59:37.400]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.400 --> 59:40.680]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[59:40.680 --> 59:46.880]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:46.880 --> 59:49.880]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.880 --> 59:56.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:20.880]  There must be some way out of here, say the Joker to the theme.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:27.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I've ever done
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.920]  in my life.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.960]  The mainstream corporate media is in every major paper in the country, every so-called
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.600]  news channel saying that President Trump wants violence against the media, that I want violence,
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.760]  that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks on the media, and then they don't even show
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.480]  where I said it.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.240]  This is grave.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.160]  It means we could be hours, days, weeks away going into this election in what, 82 days
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:09.360]  from now, to stage a huge event, just like evidence shows Bill Clinton and the Deep State
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:15.960]  did in 95 when they were way behind the polls to blame the Midwest and the American people
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:22.520]  for Oklahoma City to then get a sympathy vote for the Democrats and Bill Clinton.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.760]  They are saying that imminent attacks are going to happen and the blood will be on President
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.280]  Trump's hands.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.520]  They are now saying imminent attacks are coming and it's going to be my fault.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.680]  How obvious the very same Deep State with the Clintons in control of it has done this
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.240]  before and was able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in 1995.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.920]  Bill Clinton told USA Today on Air Force One, pull it up.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:54.000]  He said, I was able to win reelection and cover behind because of Oklahoma City.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.680]  Now they're saying that I'm promoting a new Oklahoma City.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.200]  Let me show you some of these incredible articles if you're a TV viewer.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:07.440]  Look at this CNN yesterday.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.000]  Alex Jones complicit in domestic terror, Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.240]  No proof, no links, no nothing.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.120]  Articles saying that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.840]  Nowhere is there a video.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.600]  All they show is quotes around single or two words connected together.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.360]  When Antifa said they were coming to attack members of Congress and their families, I
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.960]  said you better get your battle rifles ready.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.040]  They then show a quote and say Antifa, mainstream media, chai-com operatives.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.800]  And Twitter took me offline for that fraud.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:47.000]  DrudgeReport.com, link to our article, video, Lesker Holt's a liar, Alex Jones did not call
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  for violence.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.240]  MSM, talking heads falsely mimicking words and citing violence against the media ahead
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  of the big event.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.480]  They say there's going to be an attack mark my words on CNN.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.960]  That's Brian Stelter.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.400]  They're saying there's going to be a mass shooting.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.720]  There's going to be an Oklahoma city bombing.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]  They're everywhere.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.120]  And they've done it before.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.440]  So I'm not a rocket scientist to figure this out.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  They've done it before.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.920]  They've gotten away with it.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.520]  Meanwhile, FCC shuts down Alex Jones pirate flagship radio station, AP.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.400]  I woke up this morning and I said is there even a pirate radio station in Austin?
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.400]  There used to be some years ago punk rock, conservative, Christian sometimes shows would
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.680]  have my stuff on it.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.920]  I don't even really listen to a lot of threshold radio because I'm working all the time.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.440]  I don't read the article goes well actually last year or some locals had some low power
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.440]  you can only hear for a mile and they turned it off last year.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.520]  But then the article at the bottom says it was turned off this year or last year I have
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  nothing to do with it.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.520]  But I'm running it.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]  Didn't even know it existed.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.960]  It's all about saying I'm illegal.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.840]  I'm being shut down to scare our commercial AM and FM stations that they're going to get
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.160]  FCC rated.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is happening.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.400]  It is on the deep state is moving.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.880]  They believe you're stupid.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.360]  I believe you're not stupid.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.840]  But here's the last pieces of evidence.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.520]  That document cam shot please Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government take
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.240]  over the Internet reason Axios.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.120]  Senator Warner has a plan to censor the entire Internet and take it over zero hedge article
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  really breaks it down better.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.320]  Please print me that one.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.360]  Here's the actual plan to take over the Internet by Senator Warner.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.640]  Here's Senator Murphy saying that they're going to take over the Internet not stop with
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:38.720]  They're going to stage a false flag, ladies and gentlemen, and then against themselves
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.600]  make themselves victims and then blame all libertarians all conservatives Trump and then
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.480]  use our shut down on social media.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.680]  They've already beta tested on me as a smoke stream for stealing the election on November
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]  8.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680]  It's happening.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.680]  It's a fact.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680]  Emergency.

[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:30.960]  Cut my teeth 26, 27 years ago when Bill Clinton was in office.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.960]  And they had burned down Waco and murdered the people, and I didn't know what was going
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:42.480]  on when I was right out of high school and that happened, but I was working two jobs
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.720]  and I was going to community college, figuring out if I wanted to go to college or what I
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.360]  wanted to do because I was, you know, doing these jobs, I was making more money than most
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:58.080]  people I knew that had college degrees, the most of them were back in groceries.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.560]  And so I was thinking, I want to go to college and I would watch C-SPAN and I watched these
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.160]  hearings in 94 and 95 about Waco.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.320]  Now the Delta Force was sent in to kill everybody under orders and General Schumacher was depressed
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:18.480]  about it and it all came out in Congress and the flare footage and everything and I was
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:23.320]  like, man, the sheriff testified, why didn't they just pick me, why did they just pick
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:32.000]  up Vernon Howell, aka the cult leader, because he was a weirdo, in town?
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.560]  Why didn't they just pick up David Coresh in town where he had a business and auto parts
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.240]  repair shop because they wanted the big raid, they drove up, they shot at the building,
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:45.280]  they wanted to go after the right-wing American cults, it was all planned.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280]  But it blew up in their face.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.120]  So then they activated a special operation soldier, Tim McVeigh, who'd been assigned
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:08:02.320]  a sheep dip to a group even more secret than Delta Force, attached to the CIA, I know folks
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:10.120]  that served with McVeigh in the special group, that's why they're so scared of me.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.760]  And McVeigh went all over the country tracking militia groups, right-wing groups, all this
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.040]  stuff for the Clintons.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.840]  But when he wouldn't agree to bomb the daycare center and he said no, pick another target,
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.160]  they drugged him up, put him on the side of the road, state police found him drooling,
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:34.640]  crawling around the ground, that's in the original Oklahoma City newspaper.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.440]  State police said, yeah, we found him drooling, saying I got a chip, I got a chip, they blew
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:47.360]  my chip, it hurts, look it up, they blew my chip.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.600]  So imagine I start getting into this and reading this stuff and then Oklahoma City
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.600]  happens right at the time I'm going on access TV and I see Benton Parton, former head of
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.120]  the Air Force Weapons Development showing the bombs in the building and they're having
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.880]  press conferences with people that were in the building that saw, yeah, I saw the head
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.240]  of the FBI here the day after the bombing, but I saw him the week before putting wires
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.800]  in the walls and I sure thought he was handsome.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:23.880]  Then I reviewed the widows of the people, the police officers that were tortured to
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:30.960]  death and killed because they were the first responders and what they saw.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.720]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.680]  Don Browning, highly decorated Marine in Vietnam, head of the K9 unit, was the second to respond
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.240]  to Terrence Yeakey, black police officer, man of the year that holed out dozens of people
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.080]  on his back, he was a successful linebacker in college.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:54.240]  I reviewed his wife, his last call with his partner was I got the FBI pulling me over
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.520]  and they tortured him to death right there in that field.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.920]  Don Browning named the guys that they deleted it off YouTube, he was on a few years ago.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:09.120]  Don Browning was on this show and he said, yeah, the FBI threatened me at the water cooler
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.360]  and in my office twice to kill me and my wife if I talked about what I saw that day and
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:21.080]  I said, name their names and he went, okay, but you could tell he's a strong guy, a Vietnam
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.000]  hero, Silver Stars you name it, he's putting his wife and him on line here and he named
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  him.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  So did I.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.600]  So yeah, I crossed this bridge a long time ago, being scared of you guys, I'm scared
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.120]  of failing against you and I don't think the whole FBI is bad.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.120]  When I've had stuff done to us or stuff goes on, I go report to the FBI and that's the
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.320]  paradox of good and evil.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.480]  The FBI is either like the best people in the world or the worst people in the world
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.520]  and I've confronted Janet Reno and all of them about this.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:58.080]  So I learned about all this when I was knee high to a grasshopper and then everything
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.200]  I was told that I didn't even know was true or not came true and I learned it was all
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.480]  true from family that saw it for themselves first hand.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.600]  And I decided to be on the side of good.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.560]  And so if you want to know what's about to happen right now, you need to know about Oklahoma
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:23.520]  City and you need to know how the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Feds pulled that
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.240]  off and how federal informants thought they were just going to sting the bomb.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.480]  They tried to Carol Howell and they tried to stop it so they died at Herb and McVeigh
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]  was going to go public.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.320]  He said, I'm not going to blow up a daycare, blow it up at night when they're not there.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.280]  I talked to folks that knew him.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.240]  McVeigh was like, blow it up at night, damn it, kill a couple of guards in there.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:51.520]  I'm not blowing up school children, not blowing up the freaking nursery.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.040]  And Larry Nichols came out and said that.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.120]  I've interviewed death row inmates that were on with him.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.640]  And so the very same people, I mean Eric Holder was the deputy attorney general at the time
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.080]  running the operation, came out in emails and lawsuits.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.680]  They're the ones getting ready for a new Oklahoma City.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.000]  I don't know if it's going to be Google, Twitter, Apple, Spotify, Stitcher, they'll
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.160]  probably get some federal building, CNN, I don't know, but let me tell you something.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.240]  You ever come to work and your bosses were supposed to be there and you never show up
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.680]  to work and you look around and nobody's there in management.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.120]  You better get your butt out of that building like that.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.760]  Because the feds were out of the building on Oklahoma City too.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:49.080]  And I've interviewed Jane Graham at HUD, I've interviewed them all and they just showed
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.840]  up and like, it was mainly a federal building and nobody was there.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.320]  So because that's how this works.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.800]  You know, one of the CIA guys is having sex with one of the girls there, he's like, sweetheart,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.920]  I don't think you need to show up to work next week.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.880]  Kind of like they called it conspiracy therapy, it was even the New York Post, it was in the
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  New York Daily News.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.560]  A week before 9-11, Muslim kids would point at the towers and they'd say, those won't
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.880]  be there next week.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.360]  Yeah, there's CBS News.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.640]  What feds knew before OKC bombing?
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.880]  So people have a way of not being able to keep stuff secret.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880]  So let me tell you something.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.720]  I'm not that important.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.920]  They didn't spend hundreds of millions of dollars demonizing me the last two years for
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.920]  no reason.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.240]  They're going to use me as the catalyst to get everybody who'd shut me being de-platformed
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.760]  and you know, get the idea of feds, raid, Jones, shut down illegal station.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]  No such thing.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.680]  It's all made up.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.120]  Some half-watt thing a year ago or something, I never even heard.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:59.080]  They're beta testing to make their big move.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.440]  And this is it.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440]  This is it.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.160]  Now the good news is I've been called by national talk show host.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.560]  We have the phones ringing off the hook and affiliate relationship TV and radio because
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.800]  they know how things work.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.480]  They know we're on commercial satellites, fire the tones, follow FCC, even blur out
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.580]  people flipping folks off on videos we show.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.240]  Even CNN doesn't do that.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.120]  And the station managers are going, yeah, you're not running pirate stations.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.620]  You're all FCC compliant.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.620]  This is a hoax.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.760]  They all get it.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.040]  And they get how they stage, the globalist stage this in 1995 to blame talk radio and
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]  free speech.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.800]  Now they weren't able to shut talk radio down like they tried with bills, but they were
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.160]  able to get Bill Clinton reelected to continue on and he credited it.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160]  So what are you going to do?
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.080]  You're the ruthless Democrats that say America was never great and all the rest of this.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.480]  When you're way behind, you're losing the early bellwether special elections, no matter
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.200]  what you've done, you're behind all the world populace are popping up.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.920]  You're going to bring in censorship.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.360]  You're going to bring in control.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.720]  You're going to bring in bullying and you're going to silence Alex Jones and kick him off
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.520]  Google and YouTube and Facebook and freeze us on Twitter and knock us off Spotify and
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.040]  everywhere else ahead of the big event, but the people woke up, made us number one in
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040]  the podcast.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.720]  We're number one in the apps anyway.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.120]  So now they're going, what do we do?
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.960]  This is getting too obvious.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.840]  You take the video, this live show I've done that we're going to post on info wars.com
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.040]  or put a splash page up right in the front.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.600]  I had this idea when they took us down with a hack attack a few days ago, we could just
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.480]  direct to a splash page and then traffic went up even more.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.400]  So we'll just do that with a splash page.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.840]  By the way, we're under DDoS attack right now.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.080]  I was told an hour ago and we're going to link to all these videos they don't want so you
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.520]  can email the link and so you can call everybody so you can re-upload it and we may be able
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.060]  to stop the false flag.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:55.560]  We can stop their operation over throughout the country when we come back.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.200]  This is history.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.840]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon

[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160]  We knew it was coming.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.400]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.720]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.240]  children and Islamophobia.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240]  And then wallah.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.360]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.680]  all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:30.400]  Go to InfoWars.com, the fourth slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]  on the link.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.800]  Whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.400]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com, four slash newsletter and give us your emails
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:44.280]  so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.280]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com, four slash show, how they can download the
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.920]  free Android and iPhone apps and how they can then reach out to others with the information
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.160]  and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:01.440]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:11.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:24.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.080]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.640]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:35.640]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:42.920]  All right, this is not hype.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.560]  This is not hyperbole.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:50.920]  Every mainstream corporate false news, fake news outlet is lying, saying Trump is calling
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.280]  for violence against them, that I'm calling for violence.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.760]  They never showed the proof.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.240]  They just keep saying it.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:02.760]  Clearly, like 1995, they're preparing to stage a terror attack against themselves to make
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.680]  themselves the victims.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.240]  How do we counter this?
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.720]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.400]  Onlydrudgereport.com, top link yesterday.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.000]  It's mid link today because of the death of a famous musician, linked to our article
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:27.320]  ondrudgereport.com, where Alex Jones blatant lies being told about us.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.080]  Twitter defends healthy behavior of users.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.520]  They demand it.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:36.160]  Trust and safety counsel working overtime to ban conservatives, and that's what they've
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.720]  set up.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.520]  So I shoot videos yesterday on our other sub accounts saying, I'm not calling for violence.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]  I never said it.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:50.400]  I didn't delete those because the key here to the left is robbing your identity, saying
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.400]  they speak for you, saying you said things you didn't say, and then silencing you so
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.200]  they can lie about you.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200]  That's what's happening.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.280]  On the left hand side ofdrudgereport.com, Alex Jones blatant lies being told about
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280]  me.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.000]  Now, the next few hours, we will post to infowars.com.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:20.240]  The fifth segment and the first segment of the last hour.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.520]  My emergency warning of imminent false flag to throw the election for the Democrats in
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]  ban free speech.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.920]  And that's going to go up on infowars.com on our own servers.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:35.760]  Anyone that wants to take it from real.video to your own site on Facebook to your own site
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.720]  on Twitter, you have a right and a duty to get that up.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.320]  And if you want to do commentary on it, that's even better.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.560]  And yeah, they may try to block you.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.560]  They may try to whatever.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.560]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.880]  This is a total war.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.000]  They are beta testing staging attacks against themselves, preconditioning people.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.520]  It's our fault to throw the election and then shut our free speech town.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.080]  Senator Warner and Murphy say they're going to ban everyone.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.180]  This is their assault.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:04.000]  They're going to act like total authoritarians because we had an election.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.040]  We beat Hillary.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.480]  The country's coming back.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.640]  They're panicking.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.200]  They think America was never great.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:14.640]  They hate America because they're globalist will play commo in a minute.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.080]  So this is not rhetoric.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.280]  This is the main assault.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.040]  This is it infowars.com newswars.com.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.960]  Why are they running a hoax story that the feds rated a flagship station?
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.440]  That means that's what I broadcast out of like a flagship means where the admiral is,
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440]  where he commands from.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.880]  I've never heard of this radio station, never heard of the names they mentioned.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.720]  They say it was off like last year and that no one could hear it.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.120]  There's been some stations I could hear in Austin.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.400]  It's just total incentive.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.380]  It's the idea that the FCC is now moving against Alex Jones.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:54.600]  That gives it governmental cover.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.320]  That gives it the idea that I'm being shut down by the government.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.820]  It's insane.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:23:59.920]  And on GPI came out.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920]  He wasn't anti Alex Jones.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.120]  He said, listen, we shut down pirate stations regardless of what's on it.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.120]  Who knows what was even on it?
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.240]  So again, this is the illusion.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.720]  Drudge Alex Jones takes a lick and keeps on ticking.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.560]  Media pioneer remarks on big techs actions and simple wars.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.200]  Media pioneer Matt Drudge watched Wade in on the tech industries.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.560]  I'm president of moves against him for us by remarking Thursday on Alex Jones's resilience.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.800]  Matt, it's your resilience.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800]  We couldn't do without you.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.800]  And I'm not just saying that.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.800]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800]  I love you.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.440]  I love anybody I love and your courage because I don't want people won't have it.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.780]  And we would have no voice outside in fours wouldn't for you.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:39.780]  I mean so much.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:43.440]  I got so upset knowing that whole things he can lie about me and say that I want to kill
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.720]  journalists and not show it.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.940]  What a fraud.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.120]  And then no one would even know except for inforwardings at drugreport.com so thank you,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120]  Matt.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.060]  I'm serious, cause it's just insane.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.640]  He says takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.880]  It's a time X deal.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.040]  And that's what he put out takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.840]  I mean and now they're trying to take that away. I can't even know what tumbler is. It was a joke meme
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.600]  Spot attempts on a stream press and tech companies to stifle content interest in infowars website the LSE
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.280]  Don't show a skyrocketed. Thanks for you by word of mouth, but here's the problem
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.680]  Everybody my family you name it the cruise said they're getting ready to set us up
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.080]  Yeah, they don't take some pirate station
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.160]  I don't even know about from last year that went off the air that no one could hear that even though existed
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:09.240]  Then say it's by flagship and the feds are rating me. That's to like just get the idea. Well, he had that illegal station
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320]  You know we had their rating
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:17.480]  So just download everything i've ever said keep it whatever this has been a big marathon for me whatever happens happens
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.720]  I'm worried about you. I'm worried about trump. I'm worried about drudge. I'm worried about free market
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.200]  I'm worried about america worried about our kids because
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.000]  Man these people will lie their butts off man
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.880]  again
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.440]  There's even some recordings of this. I didn't ask folks to do it, but I I warned a few people it was coming
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.840]  I've been called by six people a lot of them. I didn't warn
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:43.080]  That the new york times literally has people threatening them saying you say bad stuff about jones or else
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.960]  Dude, that is so actionable. That's so illegal
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.600]  But they don't care
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:55.240]  Because there's going to be a stage terror attack against a major media institution or multiple ones a mass shooting a bombing whatever and they're going to say
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:02.520]  See we told you in these editorials at the boston globe ordered that trump's going to cause violence with no proof and i am
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:11.000]  And all this edited lives to prime the pump that people when they do the big massacre and carry out the bloody babies with fire with fireman carrying them
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  That people believe but
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:22.120]  If you take this live feed from infowars.com forward slash show it's spread to everybody, you know and say emergency emergency if you take the video that I did earlier

[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.520]  The newspapers are already bankrupt. It's all sinking. The corporate media is dead. The democrats are dead
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.920]  All they can do like a bar that's out of business and good fellows and and and and bankrupt it is burn it down for the insurance money

[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:01.960]  And they've got edited articles never even showing any video saying that i'm calling for battle rifles to be used on the press

[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.760]  This has to get to trump they did it in 95
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.320]  They used the oklahoma city bombing that was totally synthetic to bring in all the sympathy to get their police state in place
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:40.760]  And now they're getting ready to do it again. It's as plain as the nose on my face and then they have all these hoax articles
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  Going uh where jones was raided by the feds today and I woke up and like some radio station
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.760]  I never heard of it was off like a year ago of some micro i'm on little micro and pirate stations there all over the country
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:01.560]  Uh, and then I go jones was raided his flagship, which means where I broadcast from wow. We were raided. We're not broadcasting
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.400]  We're transmitting on satellite. We produced the broadcast here
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:13.240]  We're on 50,000 watts 100,000 watt fm's where we're getting 20 30 new affiliates a week in tv and cable
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.840]  Who are really exploding this idea that there's some illegal station?
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:23.000]  And the fcc suchdown alex jones private flagship radio station. It shows the commitment
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.560]  Of the idea that we're committing a crime and stations picking up a supper committing a crime
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.040]  Well, you may be able to fool your dumb readers
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.680]  but
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.680]  You're not going to be able to fool
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.880]  The people that run radio and tv stations. We got a bunch of calls today going you were on at night taped
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:48.040]  I'm putting you on prime time. We get what's going on. I mean the support is and I just say that it's the truth
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.320]  Number one on the android and the apple on the on the app from like number 40
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.200]  We only launched it a month ago our new app informers official
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.640]  number one
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.840]  All over the place millions of signups for our free podcast at informers.com forward slash show and I haven't plugged yet
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.600]  We're an hour and 35 minutes into the show and if I don't plug we won't fund our operation
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.760]  We have record sales going on free shipping right now
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.840]  but
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.320]  You've got cnn saying ban me they are desperate because I figured it out. We're not that important
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.640]  I was big but not that big. They built me up to try to bring down trump
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:28.520]  They built me up to do that. It didn't work. It hurt hillary. It gave trump that real authentic populism made us bigger
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:35.320]  Before hillary, I was getting like 50 million, you know visitors and listeners a week in the election
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.480]  And she called me dark heart and almost like 80 something
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.720]  I was like, whoa, and then they lost they went even more piss so they built me up more as the devil
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.320]  So then they I mean, so it's a real paradox newtonian physics for every action. There's an opposite or equal reaction
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.680]  But I hear about my family and you in the first amendment
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:56.840]  Warner and all them I have the articles right here. I'm gonna show them to you with with with roger stone are saying they're going to ban
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:03.000]  Everyone they're coming. They want all conservatives banned. So they have this delusion of grandeur. They're gonna remove trump
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.480]  They're gonna stage some event against mainstream media against tech giants to weigh the bloody shirt
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:12.600]  They're gonna they're gonna get their new congress. They're gonna ban free speech in it senator warner's already said it
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.000]  These people are arrogant though. They already had newsweek printed up that she was gonna win
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:23.320]  Uh, you know 2016 so we can beat this but I'm telling you just as sure as the sun came up
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.960]  Just like drudge report gets it
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.000]  He's linked to me pointing out that lesser holds a liar saying I said assault the media with battle rifles total fraud
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.800]  No video no link. No nothing. Thank you drudge for preserving your own future in mind. God bless you for not being a coward
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.240]  You are a hero
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.880]  Everybody else so sitting by and watching to see what happens
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.760]  But the new video we're uploading info wars calm for the first hour. I lay out the false flag plan
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.840]  I'm gonna lay out some of these others as well
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.920]  You got to get this out to everybody because they want a silence
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.800]  That's why they're doing this dangerous thing of kicking us off the air
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.520]  They're banning us lying about us because something big is about to happen and we know
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:06.600]  350 papers they brag published that trump's gonna kill people in the media and blood on his hands and they say
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.040]  I'm getting ready to kill the media and I'm telling my listeners to kill the media whenever
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.560]  Why I want the opposite don't make these dying dinosaur media people martyrs. They know that
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:21.240]  So they want me silence. They could false flag tomorrow. They could false flag next week. I'm telling you before the election
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.640]  I'd say probably september notice. I have a letter from google document cam shot, please
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.760]  From their vice president of the company head of advertising of all of google document cam shot

[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.600]  Excuse me go ahead

[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.280]  I'll be riding shotgun on the next hour that mike adams is on at about 15 after
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.640]  We put on emergency alert last night
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.120]  dealing with this roger
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.400]  With all your political gravitas you have any doubt they're getting ready to make their move
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.120]  No, I think this is this could not be clear
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.800]  What's a foot here and that is and that's why it's vitally important that people understand exactly what's going on
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.920]  We renounce violence. We do not advocate it. We are not calling for violence against anyone
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.440]  There will be an act of violence perpetrated by someone
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:38.920]  And then they will seek to blame alex jones as if e or we or info wars had something to do with it
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:44.680]  Remember this folks when it goes down and it will go down. We had nothing to do with it. We renounce it
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:49.480]  This is this is a setup. This is a classic setup. You can smell it
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:55.320]  Uh and this idea that it is our fault that we are advocating it that we make it happen
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:01.160]  It's the exact opposite. This is the very definition of a false flag as I know it alex
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:09.240]  And I need to make that declaration clear. It's when come back. We'll both make that declaration and that we're not suicidal and all the rest of it, but
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.000]  What do you make or you were even ranting about during the break about
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.120]  This claim that our flagship station to some half watt thing we even know about that hadn't been on the air
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.800]  Yeah, I hear I know this station very well because they used to broadcast
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.120]  From brave new books, which was libertarian books are so you see I don't go out in public anymore
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.800]  So tell me you were telling me what it is
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:33.560]  It's a tiny little pirate station the people involved in the station all began fighting amongst each other
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.400]  But the idea that this is alex jones's flagship station is a joke. It's a tiny little
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:45.400]  A pirate station that has been off the air since last december and the fines referred to in the hill today
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.800]  Were levied well over a year ago
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.280]  That the whole story is the epitome. Okay, so fill me in because literally
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.200]  I knew sheriff frank former sheriff great guy. He was running it up on a hilltop. It covered like half the city
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.960]  He invited me over for dinner once. I was like, dude the FCC's after you turn it off
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.520]  And he turned it off when I asked him to
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.040]  So it's the opposite like 10 years ago. This guy was like, dude, your wife just died. Don't do this. Don't do fines
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.680]  So that's the truth and then all these years later. This would pop up that would pop up. I'm not watching
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.160]  I don't even know what half my big affiliates that are commercial
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.520]  So but but this is clearly just have this idea that I have illegal stations and I've been raided and it's some
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  I'm told some half watt thing
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.240]  That no one could even hear and then they're saying I've been illegally doing stuff
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.760]  I don't think it's been on the air uh since last december as far as so you've been coming for a lot of book signings and speeches
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:39.320]  I didn't know. How did you know about this? Tell people, you know, I used to do book signings at brave new book
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:45.320]  You did one with me there. It's closed now. Uh, I now out of business and they used to broadcast out of there
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:48.360]  They were nice folks, but then they all began fighting among each other
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:55.080]  Uh, they had an affiliation with the logos radio network at one time. I think that fell apart
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.360]  Uh, but the idea that this is your flagship station is nonsense here. Oh, that was out of florida, right?
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.240]  No, it was out. It was out of austin. I heard logos in florida logos. I think is a network
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:09.480]  That's out of florida. The point is this is some there's thousands of these around the country
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:15.320]  The pirate radio is well known. How the hell is some place over here me and I'm a criminal and my flagship is down
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:24.040]  Here's what this station and alex jones having common. They're both in austin texas. That's it. This was not our flagship station never was
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:31.640]  Uh, they did evidently carry some uh, some pirated info wars content. Oh wait, I know that lady. She's an anti-florid activist
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.200]  Yes, that's exactly her. Okay. I haven't even seen this yet. Okay. Yeah, my god. This is one
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.320]  I'm sure they're good patreons that care about the truth. We love them. I mean, oh my god
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  How evil that's some half watt thing covered a mile or something. Yeah, they're real devils
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.320]  I tell you well that we're illegal folks earn it and it's all about building that we're criminal
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.280]  We're being taken off now the FCC is involved has to get big tech to cover to shut us down
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.640]  fake news fake news we'll talk about how to stop this trade ahead
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:03.080]  Patrick in the great nation of australia you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.040]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.840]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.200]  It was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial up into that
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.240]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the dvds and followed all your guess
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:27.080]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of survival shield and since then I'm on the x2 the
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:33.640]  Super male vitality the caveman the real red pill micro zx body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.760]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:42.200]  It's like you're just detoxing the mind you're detoxing the body you're detoxing the spirit
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:45.400]  And it's just the more you know god the more you fear god
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.080]  But the more you chase god
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:57.400]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you the crew and the listeners out there 1776 worldwide
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:00.840]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.200]  The real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:10.440]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.800]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:19.000]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.040]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:29.720]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.800]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.400]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.000]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.200]  As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.800]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.520]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.840]  We knew it was coming the whole thing was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.240]  Then sue us to add credibility to that
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:14.200]  Then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and islamophobia
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:20.920]  And then wallah two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:26.840]  Where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds go to info wars dot com

[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.840]  Thank you so much for being part of the second american revolution
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:03.800]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:45.320]  Well, the reason frank was made to jump into hyperspace. Well, great stuff
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.760]  Going back to roger stone
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.240]  I want to get right down to brass tacks
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.240]  Let's go the two shot. I want to talk to roger, please
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:04.520]  Roger we need to set the demarcation line right now as we've always done over and over again
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.560]  We are a hundred percent against offensive
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.200]  Political violence any other type of violence. We're winning culturally with ideas with free market
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.360]  It's the left and anti for that wants violence. They're the ones these rallies saying bullets for trump bullets for republicans
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.360]  They're coming to people's houses to kill them
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:28.760]  I say members of congress like rand paul and scolese. They're being targeted. They've been saying they're going to kill them
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.040]  Need to have a battle rifle. They need to have a gun in their house
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.320]  That's what I said and then soros's media matters came out a few days ago and said that I said
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.600]  Attack the media unless your houlton others went with that
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.720]  And then they're doing all these other fake announcements the FCC rated us and total hoax
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:51.320]  Even the pirate radio. We have no affiliate with they claim they rated never was rated shut down a year ago
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:55.320]  I mean, this is new level lying. This is trump derangement syndrome
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.720]  But I want to say
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:04.200]  I'm against offensive violence because I like civilization. I'm against offensive violence because I've always done things
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.480]  Through political and and and societal ideas and I've always been successful
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.720]  With my ideas. I didn't need to go conquer woman over the head like these llamas is doing
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.840]  You know carry her off to a slave pit. I could pick up as many girls
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:22.040]  I wanted to my bragging or anything, but you can get as many as I want believe me before I was ever famous
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:28.920]  I could so I was always a free market guy. And so this idea that I'm going to get stuff through conquest or violence instead of through
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:37.320]  Renaissance is just absolutely insane and the left is broken the social contract or saying big terror attacks are coming against trump
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.920]  against them that trump and and and that we are staging
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:46.200]  Unequivocally, I disavow any violence. I've not called for violence
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:53.000]  The media has edited or took out of context what I've said and framed it. They are frauds. They are liars. They are clearly preparing
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.960]  Some big event like Oklahoma City against mainstream media big tech or the government to demonize their opposition
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.440]  life they did in 95 bill clinton credited
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.040]  is
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:10.040]  Come from behind when of the presidency in 96 to Oklahoma City on air force 1 to the press crew to the press corps
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.360]  So I disavow all violence you disavow all violence
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.160]  We wish the antifa would stop their violence and calling for killing people
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.760]  But I disavow offensive violence. I do not disavow defense
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.000]  Which is clearly under the second amendment
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.960]  But the fact that they've gone to this level of lying roger stone of stoneculture.com tells me that something wicked this way comes
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520]  Alex this is a classic
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.440]  Set up that's why we're here today. That's why we're telling people out front right out front
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:45.960]  We disavow violence if something violent happens if there's an attack on some reporter or some news bureau or some news
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:51.800]  I if there is bloodshed, we are not behind that. We do not support that. We are not for that
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.320]  That is what they call a classic false flag
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:01.400]  So if tomorrow or next week or the week after that there is an assault on some media outlet
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.280]  that
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:09.160]  We had nothing to do with that and anyone who says alex jones fomented it or advocated or pushed it or arranged it
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:14.920]  Is lying. It's the big lie. You heard it here folks. This is the line of demarcation
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.280]  We're out ahead of this because we can smell it. It's a setup and it all began months ago
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.040]  First they they take things you say
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.880]  They distort them. They twist them. They take them out of context
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:34.040]  Then they use them as the basis for phony harassment, but expensive lawsuits
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.320]  Then they file those lawsuits to generate headlines
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:43.800]  Then they take those distorted headlines and they use them as the excuse to take us off the air
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:47.080]  To stop our ability to communicate with you directly
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:53.960]  And then they seek to blame us for violence that they will be responsible for and that we have nothing to do with
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:00.360]  It it it's a formula. It's a step-by-step formula and now you know exactly what's coming
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:06.360]  So when it goes down come back to this recording come back to this tape come back to this video
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:12.760]  You will know exactly what went down. We have nothing to do with violence. We do not advocate violence
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:18.840]  Violence in all honesty would be counterproductive. We are winning the war of ideas
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:24.840]  We believe in a intellectual struggle a political struggle a struggle for the electorate
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.240]  A struggle for the hearts and minds of the america struggle to bring the economy back and we've been proven right
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:36.040]  And that's what's so clear here is the unified discipline is what i've called it of the media lie about you to lie and say
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.320]  Trump hates all mexicans. There is no such quote always their lies
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.200]  And even the la times is on dredger report dot com
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:50.440]  La times rebukes group think says it's insane that 350 outlets denounced president's attacks on media claim. He's calling for violence
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.360]  Says chicago tribune op had written by dog
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:58.520]  I mean, this is just insane and i read the local one today
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.240]  It's like Trump's calling for violence the blood's on his hands
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:07.560]  They are going crazy and again. They're saying he wants violence. No when they lie about him and say he's a nazi
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.880]  He says you're fake news when they lie about him and say he didn't get us up to 4 growth rate
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.120]  He says you're a fake news when they lie about him. I mean they just it's incredible
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.600]  but again
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:19.880]  I'm not that important
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.760]  They have chosen us to demonize us as the beta test roger ahead of the big event
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.280]  Undoubtedly they're planning a false flag and i just want folks to know
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.080]  They want to silence us first
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:35.080]  So we can be demonized and they can project things on to us
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.200]  During the false flag
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.520]  You're absolutely right. That's why we've got to get this out people. This is this is d-day. This is it
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:50.040]  Right now. There's a federal grand jury in washington trying to frame me on some kind of defrauding the united states charge
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.080]  For which they have no evidence whatsoever. Why?
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:59.480]  Because they don't want me out there pointing out what's about to happen because it is their way of silencing me
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:05.320]  Just as they're trying to silence alex joneson info wars and they're trying to silence me on this platform
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:10.840]  Where I do the war room every day at five o'clock eastern proud to do it with owing shawyer growing audience
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:14.520]  Record number of people signing up for the podcast since they're move on us
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.280]  This is part and parcel of the same exact and by the way
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.760]  What do you think they're going to do now that we've gone to number one on the app?
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.240]  Past scene in new york times tens of millions tuning in it blew up in their face
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:31.880]  They're now going into crazy mode saying feds raid him. He has illegal stations. This is like saying. I have a pet dinosaur
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:37.400]  I mean, this is insane. I can tell you folks. I'm in the uh in the studio right here in austin
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.680]  There was no direct raid. There is no raid. We don't have a flagship radio station. That's a pirate station
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.480]  We don't broadcast we send out a transmission. We're the producer by satellite
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:50.520]  It's they're even talking about antiquated technology
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.360]  You know, it's disappointing alex because of the hill generally speaking
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.440]  Pretty accurate among of all the mainstream media unless they're attacking me
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.720]  Well, every once in a while you get a bad story there, but by and live, I think they have some journalistic integrity
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.840]  They need to pull this story down. It is false. It somebody has fed them completely
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.880]  Incorrect inaccurate information. Well, would you read like the cbs article and then they'll facebook
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:18.920]  It's like take him down. I knew he's illegal ban him. That's the idea is just alex jones is illegal
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.640]  What we don't have any radio stations. I own we're on hundreds of commercial stations
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.320]  I can hardly sign all the agreements all the tv and radio stations. We're exploding
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.200]  So their answer to that is oh a pirate somewhere that was off a year ago
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.960]  Picked him up. It's alex jones. He's been fined and you read the article
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:41.960]  It says they find these people a year ago, right and has nothing to do with us not even remotely
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.160]  I didn't even once you said what it was and bring new books. They pulled it up. I said, oh, I've met that lady a few times
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:52.920]  He's a flora anti-flora. Yeah, the whole thing is is it's a it's a construction. It's a fabrication
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:59.240]  I mean like I'm running around worried about what half a watt stations are doing when I can't even call the program directors
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:03.720]  We've got over 20 stations that are 50 000 watt a.m. Mega torches
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:07.800]  That cover multi-states. They ask me to come yeah, la you name it
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.480]  They ask me to come out. I can't come out and speak to their groups limbo. You do it. I should
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.760]  I mean, I got 50 000 watt mega
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.160]  Goblin stations. We barely had time to tape the liners
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:25.720]  Are you kidding? I've got a month of them and the stations are pissed. So so this is w this k that I mean
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:29.240]  It's 50 plus new cable and tv stations the last two weeks
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.880]  And what's interesting is that since the band if you go back and look and I've done the research
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:40.040]  Our listenership is up on every one of terrestrial radios. Listen station owners particularly know how this works
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:45.640]  And they know we're already they already know where I even can respond to them and they're like, oh, you're worried about some half watt station
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.160]  baloney
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.160]  well, listen, we have
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:54.520]  Almost 280 stations. You can buy them all. I don't know how many you're 50 000 1 000 5 000. They're all special
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.960]  Some are 100 000 watt fms. You can buy them all we're talking about
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.320]  100 millions of watts
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:06.040]  And I'm worried about a hat and I love little stations that reach neighborhoods or whatever whatever micros the point is
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.520]  I think it's americana if you don't interfere with commercials, but
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.480]  You're right, right. It's just insane roger
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:18.360]  Well, it's part of it's part of a larger plan and I think we've been we've been very clear about outlining exactly how this plan works
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:19.800]  Let me ask you as we come back
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.560]  How do we counter it? What do you think you're planning next and how do we get trump to move because
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.480]  Trump they're all over the news saying you're gonna kill people at cnn with no proof when they're the ones calling for violence
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  And they're saying I am too
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.240]  So there's a newark town you'll have blood on your hands. They are gearing up. They are planning something big a false flag
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:42.200]  Patriots in the government. We have to stop this. Everybody have your cameras ready be frosty man
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.560]  They do not want us on here talking about this. This is bigger than the china issue

[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.800]  I got the idea when we were hacked the other day we could put up a splash page
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.440]  Where I have the video fake news
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.680]  alex jones responds the lesser holds claim that he is calling for violence against the media
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:35.160]  And and it's no big deal of the crew, but I that's not the headline. I wanted it. It's the one that's actually on infowars.com
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:38.040]  The drudge report.com
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.360]  Is linked to where I say lesser hold is lying
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:45.720]  I am not calling so we had that meeting this morning and I said change it and whatever
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:49.560]  Let's say it on air it seemed to happen. This is where I kind of communicate to the crew here
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.560]  You can see it on drudge report.com alex jones blatant lies being told about me
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:59.960]  And then there's the headline I want for infowars.com video. That's why I wrote it
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:03.960]  Lesser hold is a liar alex jones did not call for violence
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.280]  But here's what's more important for the splash page on infowars.com
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.280]  I am going to
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.120]  Have uploaded the video
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:17.720]  Where I lay out the false flag plan how they plan to throw the election
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:20.920]  How they've done it before how we stop it coming up today
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.400]  That's going to be replaced on top on this splash page of infowars.com, but it's up to all of you
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.800]  You can see it. It's happening to get this out

[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.800]  We really need your help here to spread the truth

[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.960]  The only other thing I have to say having watched that video with lester hole
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  Uh and jack dorsi is jack
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.720]  Lose the nose ring. Okay, dude. It's not a good look
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:25.480]  Absolutely and
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.600]  We're going to break it all down. They've got the censor reports. They don't want you to see on info wars.com
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.240]  Since their emergency report alex jones vindicated after massive institutional pedophile ring busted
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.840]  I put that on twitter. They banned it. It's mainstream news. They just don't want you to know
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:46.440]  Exclusive meet donald trump secret black girlfriend roger stone tells all go there get those videos
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.680]  Upload them you download them upload them to your own twitter your own facebook your own whatever
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:55.400]  Send it out on your own email send our link info wars.com out. It's really backfired
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:00.440]  We've got to keep this wave going because they're hitting us harder trying to convince the feds to raid us
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.640]  Uh, so it's getting crazy and again exclusive alex jones response to lester holt's claim these calling for violence
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.880]  We're going to change that headline to what I wanted yesterday and they put up a wrong headline and it kept going today
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:16.200]  And I've been on my knees literally. I hit a knee and I said I want video lester holt's a liar alex jones
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:23.080]  Is not called for violence. I'm on my knees to this crew on my knees. I would
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:28.680]  I guess I got blood lead on here or something to just get that up and then we're going to get up the video
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.120]  I gave him the headline other. I love everybody. They asked me again an hour later. What's the headline?
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.960]  I'll come up with it again, and I'm not mad. I'm just kind of getting crazy here in the trenches
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:40.120]  War crazed is it's just that I mean alex jones warns of the impending false flag
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.480]  It's going to be used to blame conservatives and uh throw the election
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.000]  And this is the big october surprise. Let me ask you that when we come back roger think about it
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.520]  No, this is so real people don't take this serious. We're done folks
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.120]  Go ahead. No, you're absolutely right. This is a precursor for 2018 and 2020
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.760]  They look they know they lost control of the narrative
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:05.800]  They know that their monopoly control on political discourse in this country was broken in 2016
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.560]  This is an effort to put the toothpaste back in the tube
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:15.160]  And who is the cutting edge? Who is the one person with the courage and the fortitude to be out there on the cutting edge?
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:20.680]  And saying what nobody else will say it's alex jones and info wars, but folks we are the test case
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.720]  It's not just us. This isn't a fight about us
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:29.640]  Because sean hannity and tucker carlson and laura ingram and mike savage and and rush limbaugh
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.520]  Senator warner and senator murphy say when some of them come back they're shutting when we come back
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.480]  They say they're shutting everyone down. Oh the cruise went a great job
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:42.600]  I'm just really pissed and focused and we're going to upload soon this video on the imminent false flag
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.360]  Everybody's gotta gotta have go mega viral. We've got to get out ahead of it
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:52.440]  And it may stop them from doing it, but it worked in 95 the same clinton cabal runs it the clinton's at oklahoma city
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:54.440]  They're planning to do it again
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:58.280]  Feeling your body is hard work

[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:01.640]  Ladies and gentlemen the globalists are moving on all fronts against humanity right now roger stones in studio with me
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:03.640]  Mike Adams coming in with huge breaking news
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.720]  You are unstoppable when you spread the live links info wars dot com ford slash show
[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:13.800]  You're unstoppable when you're aware of what's happening. Here are the articles. You didn't know that are happening right now
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:19.560]  CNN article accuses info wars have been complicit in domestic terror
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:23.000]  No proof no links because they're getting ready to stage the terror attacks
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:30.760]  Absolutely go ahead if you are just a tuning in folks. You may have seen a story that says the flagship station in austin
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:36.120]  Uh, the broadcast alex jones has been rated and shut down 100 fake news
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:39.640]  We don't even broadcast that way. We're uplinked by satellite
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.760]  And it turns out a year ago
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:46.440]  There was some half a watt thing that you've been at a bookstore and seen it covered a mile and they say that's me to say
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:51.160]  I'm being shut down. I mean legal. They're trying to push that to totally shut us down
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:53.480]  Which means the false flag is imminent
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.720]  It is a classic case of fake news
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:58.760]  If you see that story out there because it will be picked up now in report
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.760]  You see that's how the fake news works
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:08.040]  One facing fake news outlet posts something and then a dozen others grab it and recycle it as if it's true
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:14.520]  So if you see this story about our our our radio station our flagship station in austin being rated
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.920]  It is 100 false. It never happened
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:21.240]  This station's been off the air for over a year and they were fined over a year ago
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:25.960]  And they have nothing to do with us at info. Well, it was like a huge fact like you said it was like a little
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:30.120]  Uh, think it's a mom and pop. I mean just a little bit. He chipped you put in the computer
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:33.000]  Right. It's so it's like something that covers a block. But look at this
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:37.080]  CNN article uses info wars of being complicit in domestic terror
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.200]  secret democrats
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:43.960]  Senate democrats are circulating plan for government takeover of the internet now. It's public
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:46.600]  Senate democrats are circulating the plan. There's reason
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:51.960]  There's senator warner admitting he wants all conservatives shut down senator murphy
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:58.360]  Uh saying similar things dim senator bans more censorship not conservatives these companies must do more than take down info wars
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:05.240]  This is insane and now they're claiming we have illegal radio stations that have been rated to create the idea
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:07.240]  We're like cocaine or something
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:10.920]  That story's a joke. It's just a joke. Well, I bring that up to show
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.200]  Every day listen, I confirm with mike adams is coming in
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:17.320]  and a bunch of other former employees and people
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.640]  That the new york times others call them up. They go, oh, I want to do a big front page article on you
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.280]  We love you so much and you're so big and you're so great
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:27.880]  And when they say no, I won't lie about all the students they call back and threaten them going
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.080]  We got dirt on you. You better say stuff about him people tell them f off
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:36.440]  But the new york times only acts like that when they're doing wmd fakes or about to invade a country
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:39.080]  They're owned by the you know king king pin carlo slim
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:42.680]  But I mean the fact roger that they are now threatening people
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:47.320]  You have a witness come in a minute and talk about this just yesterday threatening their employees
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.280]  I mean and I sat there with these new york times reporters
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:54.360]  Let her knew who she was the steel lady in the courtroom when they were trying to take my kids a few weeks ago
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:56.520]  It failed and this one was just going
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:03.480]  I mean it looked like a space alien met a you know ugly woman
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:09.560]  And I'm just and then she writes articles about this corporation had a pool party and their women and bikinis and they should be shut down
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:13.160]  I mean these people are crazy, man. Well Alex
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:16.760]  So I do need to ask you this one key question because I know the new york times confronted you with this
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:19.320]  How long have you been on the russian payroll?
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:21.560]  They actually asked me how long have you been working for rt?
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.960]  They said how long have you been working with rt and getting paid and I went i've never been there
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:28.360]  They're like, you're right
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:31.800]  Well, let them write that that's a lawsuit in the making look
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:36.520]  But the thing is they're not they don't care about lawsuits now because they think they're taking over do you understand that?
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:39.800]  They have an authoritarian plan on the other side of this internet takeover
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:46.840]  So there's only one person on the plant face of the planet who can stop this one person who needs to wake up because he's the ultimate target
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.040]  Let's stop there because I'm going to put this out as a five minute clip. Yep, right
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.680]  Roger stone trump must
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:57.560]  Trump is the only person that can save the internet or trumps the only person that can stop the internet purge
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:02.200]  We need to put this out on infowars.com. It's censored everywhere else. Everybody else can grab it and get it out
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:06.840]  This is so critical. You've got the floor. Let's be as clear about this as we possibly can
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.680]  It is internet freedom. It is the rise of a robust
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:17.080]  Uh, uh vigorous alternative media through the internet that allowed Donald trump to become president
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.720]  And now his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.480]  They want to return to the days when only abc nbc
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  and cbs
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:34.040]  Can control the political dialogue trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:42.440]  This is a threat to the trump presidency. This is a threat to republican control of the congress. This is a threat to our democracy
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:45.080]  Only the president can stop this
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:51.400]  He can quite simply order his assistant attorney general pardon me deputy attorney general for antitrust
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:57.800]  To bring an immediate action against those who are censoring us because if it is alex jones today
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.720]  It is sean hannity and tucker carlson and laura ingram and mike savage
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.680]  And rush limbaugh and other great patriots that i admire who are next don't think that this is all about infowars
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:14.360]  Don't think this is all about alex jones. This is about our future
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.600]  Donald trump needs to understand what's going on here and stand tall and the time is now
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.280]  Well, this is the big move roger and and they admit warner
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:28.040]  And murphy and others say we're gonna ban all conservatives
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:31.560]  Barry dillers bragging next year will be conservative free
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.440]  They've made the decision. They're crazy enough
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.240]  to do this this is like
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:42.760]  The soviet union invading, you know, poland or something. I mean this is like
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:45.320]  completely
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.920]  Crazy, I can't believe they're this bold roger. Well, you know, if you go back
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:53.240]  To election night right here at this very desk. You called this
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:57.800]  When I was celebrating with champagne, you were saying this isn't the this isn't the end
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:00.920]  This is just the beginning and you called it exactly right
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:07.240]  We are being punished because we are effective. We are being punished because we broadcast the truth
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:14.600]  We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the chinese communist plan to take over this country
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:17.480]  And because we've been unabashed about saying it
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.480]  There is no other reason
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.840]  Uh, and I think alex laid this out today
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  There's going to be violence in this country sometime in the near future against some reporter or some media outlet
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:35.160]  Or somebody in the news business and there's going to be a false attempt to blame it on us saying we advocated it
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:41.000]  Or we proposed it or we pushed it or we financed it or rearranged it and those things are lies
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.480]  We renounce violence
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.520]  Violence would be counterproductive and the republicans must not grovel and say we're sorry
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.960]  We throw the sacrificial lamb alex jones and trump under the bus
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.320]  Don't blame us when they're carrying the dead babies out, you know like oklahoma city that the democrats the southern prairie law center
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:59.640]  clearly was involved in uh did
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:03.560]  And we're not going to sit there and put up with that briefly because we've done
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:07.720]  an hour and 15 minutes of broadcast here and I haven't plugged yet

[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.360]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:12.600]  That's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the usa
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:19.560]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.720]  It is a classical 360 win
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:28.520]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:32.280]  When it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:38.920]  You want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:46.200]  And as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of america to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.440]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:55.320]  We're changing the world now. It's time to change our bodies with z shield info wars life dot com
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:02.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:19.560]  Alex jones here live and look i'm a little bit frantic
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:24.760]  I'm a little bit uh wild the cruise doing a great job. I seem angry. It's not them. I am
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.560]  I am literally seeing them run hoaxes against me people that have worked here
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:33.560]  Who don't even politically totally agree with me become like real
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:40.040]  People that are converted to the info war because they're like no I I you know
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:42.040]  I know you hired me even though i'm kind of a liberal
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:45.160]  But I i'm not against free speech and now I see this is crazy
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:51.800]  You're not running pirate radio stations out of here. You're not you're not wearing swastika shoes. You're not raping people in the hallways
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.320]  And then now all these new lies and this push
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:21:00.120]  in 300 plus papers alex jones is going to quote
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:06.600]  Order people to kill the media no no evidence trump is going to do it
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:11.000]  And only drudge report dot com is linked to our article about lester holt
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.760]  He's literally saying he's scared. I'm coming to kill him. I mean there's no such video antifa
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.200]  Tucker Carlson aired it monday. I covered it sunday
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:24.520]  They said we're going to kill trump. We're going to kill his family
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:29.960]  We're going to kill other members of congress and I said you better get your battle rifles ready if antifa's docks you
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:32.840]  Whether your ice or federal law enforcement or anybody
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.000]  okay
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.320]  And they literally don't ever show a quote except media matters showed the video where I didn't say any of this
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:46.760]  They all just show quotes out of context and now they're coming after everybody alex. There's there's historical
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:49.560]  precedent for your warning
[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:53.480]  communist regimes when they ran the cultural revolution in the late 1940s in china
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:59.160]  They went door to door and they murdered people who were trying to speak out. They murdered academics who were trying to say
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:05.320]  Let's have a society based in reason. They were overrun and murdered by the communists. They turned children against their parents
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:12.040]  They launched a snitch network where children literally turned in their parents to be murdered by communists and the operating system down the college
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.960]  Is his mouth so I'm going to give you the floor of this segment
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:18.840]  You came to interview me for an emergency report. You can do that the next segment or next but you've got the floor
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:21.240]  You've been on fire. You're absolutely right. They blamed
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:27.000]  Oklahoma city on the patriots and there's about to be a political realignment the same groups in in shadow government power now
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.560]  They're clearly playing the same thing lay it out mic Adams
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:36.600]  Well, one of the reasons that I'm here today is because it's extraordinary that the entire corporate media complex is now willing to commit
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:43.000]  Journalistic suicide in order to try to destroy you alex that they are now so over the top
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:47.400]  Fabricating fake quotes, you know, they're playing word salad games, right?
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.840]  Where they cherry pick words that you said in a long video
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:55.480]  They can pick a word from two minutes and a word from six minutes and a word from 12 minutes
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:23:00.680]  And then they recombined those to falsely claim that you said something that you did not say
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:06.440]  And by the way, my team's working on a video right now of lester holt. We're going to do a satire response
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:12.840]  We're going to have lester holt playing word games with himself to see what lester holt says that is hilarious
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:17.720]  Just by cutting and pacing his all his words together. So we're going to do that just as a demonstration
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.040]  We're not going to claim it's real news. We're going to claim it satire
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:24.600]  But this is an urgent moment because the media is willing to do anything
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:30.040]  To destroy you even they're willing to commit suicide of their own credibility. Look at cnn. They said yesterday
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:34.840]  I'm complicit in domestic terror closed quote and am a terrorist who should be arrested
[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:38.520]  Well, it's it's now clear. I I even texted you this
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:42.280]  I am 100 certain that they are going to dinner
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:47.480]  With my wife and roger stone and some crew and I said they're setting me up for a new oklahoma city
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:50.680]  And you literally texted me while I was saying really really
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:57.240]  Uh, I am 100 percent certain that they are going to stage an event real violence
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:23:59.640]  real shootings
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.200]  And they I think they're going to try to set up something where they
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:08.360]  Shoot their own people at cnn or a tech giant and they're going to blame you and they're going to call for your
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.000]  A real stelter and all of them saying blood on your hands new york times
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:14.840]  It's coming trump's going to kill us and this is what clinton did in 95
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:22.440]  And it's it's extraordinary because these are the same media organizations that number one advocate the mass killing of unborn babies
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:30.040]  Let's just start there. They've advocated the the the fake premise behind many of the international wars under president bush
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:36.760]  You know, you've talked about that as well. This is the same media and they wouldn't be silencing me and making this reckless action
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:43.160]  Unless they knew that something big was coming that would legitimize it and it's clear they've been ordered to attack you at all costs
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:49.000]  They've been ordered to do anything even to commit their own suicide as a credible news organization
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.000]  I mean lester holt
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.560]  He should not only apologize to you on the air
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.960]  He should resign or or be forced out of this is 50 times worse than ross who had to resign from abc
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:05.880]  Chang that flint admitted he was a russian agent right right exactly. I mean this is this is deliberately fake news
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:12.600]  It's not an accident and by the way as you are well aware you could win a defamation case against the lawyers are all freaked out right now
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.960]  They go no these are open and shut and they're all scared. They go no we agree now
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:21.480]  They're planning a total takeover that they wouldn't that's the thing mike. This is it. This is the final assault
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:24.200]  I get it and even coming here today
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:30.680]  I I'm asking myself driving here on the road is this the day that by the time I show up at info wars
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:36.440]  There is some massive attack taking place somewhere. I was gonna leave and I'm gonna just I'm gonna walk out for a couple seconds
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:40.360]  I'll keep interrupting or you want to interview me. No, it's okay this morning. I I was about to leave about nine o'clock
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:42.600]  I went and held my wife and the baby on the couch and I said
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:45.960]  We're winners. We're doing this for the country. We're in the right
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.280]  We're gonna have to make sacrifices and my wife said she said are you scared and I said
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.480]  This could be the last show any day now. They this is it. I mean this is this is real
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:02.360]  It's you know, you and I have have covered news and events and analysis for enough years to know the pattern
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:06.600]  This has been done before it is a blue only when they invented a major country
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:12.760]  It is but I mean never forget they they've tried to run operations before to take out other people
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:16.520]  Like this could fizzle if people take action, right, but if folks don't it's over
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.960]  They're gonna blow stuff up shoot people in blames. Let me ask you this. Yeah
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:25.240]  Do you think they're gonna hit a major tech or are they gonna hit like the new york times or cnn?
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.080]  I mean because they keep saying we're victims alex wants to kill us trump wants to kill us
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.840]  It's so clear what they're doing
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:34.200]  Who do you think they hit number one target that they want to
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:37.240]  Do show is attacks on journalists
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:39.080]  That's number one
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:43.400]  So if make them the untouchable make them the victims exactly blame you
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:49.560]  Use it to shut down all conservatives and attack anyone who has been associated with you including myself
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:54.760]  Roger stone and the president and then use this as an issue to try to defeat the president in 2020
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:59.000]  By saying look the president advocated for a terrorist
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:06.040]  Who was involved in the shooting supporter detonated a truck bomb outside the new york time right exactly exactly
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.680]  And all they have to do killed in the aftermath
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.960]  They can very easily put together a scapegoat, you know, they can do a manchurian candidate
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:19.480]  They can do like an aurora colorado batman guy, you know on crazy psych drugs hypnotized
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:24.600]  They can they can have you know all kinds of scenarios. They're sure fires have a mental patient drug
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.320]  Mental patient something like halcyon. Exactly. They go kill everybody. They put the person in a swat outfit and blame them
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:34.120]  Exactly that person never does the shooting. It's it's another team that does the shooting and then they're out of there
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:40.040]  And then that person gets the blame. I mean we've seen this before and then that person they will have on that person's browser
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.120]  Oh info wars info wars
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:42.920]  um
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.640]  Your episodes, uh, maybe maybe your products in their on their kitchen table
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:52.840]  I mean anything to frame you and they will report it as a fact by the way we'll call for your arrest
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.560]  This isn't a simulation. This is real and we come back lay out how you think we can counter this because I'm gonna say this again
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:04.040]  All right, I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about them winning. They know we woke up. They underestimated us
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.760]  They're making their move. Trump needs to take action, but Mike
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:09.400]  You can see it. I mean
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:13.720]  Thousand percent how do they think they don't hide that we're gonna physically attack them and lie about it
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:18.760]  And then we don't know it's their final card. It's evident. It's it's it's so obvious at this point
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.480]  There is no denying that they're running this play same play. It's a playbook. They've had for generations
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.640]  They're running the same thing. It's like a Hail Mary. It is because they know you're winning
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:33.160]  They know we're winning in the realm of ideas like Roger said we will win if we are allowed to speak
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.480]  That's what this is all about
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.880]  Very simple
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.640]  I want to tell bill clinton hillary something this worked when you bombed Oklahoma City
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:44.840]  20 years ago 20 something years ago. It ain't gonna work this time
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.080]  My god, I'm straight ahead. He wants to interview me for a piece. He wants to put out
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:51.080]  So we'll do that either this segment or the next
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.360]  And then he's gonna host with uh, roger stone in the fourth hour

[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:32.200]  You know i'm not nervous about me or my family because i know we're gonna lose the whole country in the world
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  We don't beat this but i am so
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:36.680]  upset that
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:42.440]  That it's on our shoulders mycadams myself you the listards of viewers. They are 100%
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:47.560]  Laying the groundwork with a huge pr rollout that trump and i and others are calling for violence
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:53.720]  When none of us are and that imminent terror attacks are coming and we've all got to be arrested all free speeches got to be taken
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:59.160]  Senator warner senator murphy have introduced plans to ban all conservative speech in talk radio
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:01.800]  They're announcing that
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:08.360]  Federal agents raided our offices for illegal broadcasting and shut us down today. No one was raided. It didn't even happen to some
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:11.160]  Micro pirate. It's all a hoax. So
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:17.000]  Ahead of the election. This is not gonna be like any other u.s. Election. This is the most critical in our history
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.320]  This is 1776 part two now mycadams had an idea. He called me last night
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.920]  We're on the same page saying player the false likes coming. He said somebody needs to interview you to get this on record
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:32.680]  But then part two of that is we're going to post it in fours.com with the great crew with the splash page
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:36.440]  You've got to get this interview out because they banned us everywhere including twitter
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:43.640]  So we can't respond to their lies mycadams of natural news com engineer health ranger best-selling author. Please continue
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:45.960]  all right, alex
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:52.440]  You're correct. I think that we need to ask you somebody independent of your organization like myself needs to ask you some very
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.080]  upfront and tough questions that maybe a
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:58.120]  Corporate media journalists would try to ask you
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.560]  But of course we can't trust them because they would mix and match your words and edit it
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:05.000]  So let's just do it live right here. Let me establish something right up front
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:10.680]  Do I have any financial ties with you or info wars or have I ever had any financial ties? No
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:18.520]  Okay, that that that and that's I affirm that as well. I've always been you know volunteer here because of because of what we're fighting for
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:25.560]  Next question. Do you advocate any use of violence to silence journalists who are attacking you?
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:28.680]  For example, do you think that lester holt should be shot and killed?
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.320]  Absolutely not a it's against what I believe in as a libertarian and as a constitutionalist as a renaissance person
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:39.480]  I'm winning politically against him. The last thing I want is for him to be hurt
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:41.480]  Because that turns even to a martyr
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:43.880]  So I pray every night that he lives to be 110 years old
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.320]  But do do you advocate others to carry out such violence inspired by your broadcast?
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:53.960]  Are you trying to get others to 100%? No
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:01.000]  That would make them the victim. I want to politically legally and lawfully challenge them
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:05.160]  Are you funding in any way?
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.560]  some
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.600]  Group that wants to commit violence against journalists
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:16.760]  Are you a no be hell? No see on my soul of my children? No
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.720]  A we wouldn't win politically that way B. We would lose see I don't want to be in a super max president. No, no, no, right, right
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:30.680]  Uh, have you ever violently assaulted children your own or anybody else's children because they're no
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:33.320]  I actually don't even spank my children and I'm probably spoiled
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:38.600]  Okay, I've never assaulted anybody offensively and I haven't been in a fight and
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.680]  Other than communist attacking me and I defended myself in decades
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:48.120]  Do you all right here here's a psychological question you might say
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.080]  I I think that leftists are terrified of your delivery style
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:57.640]  The words that you say if they were uttered by someone like barack obama
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:04.440]  Many of the things you say would be acceptable. It's in some way your style your your aggressive energy
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.560]  Do you do you recognize that leftists may be terrified of your style?
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:12.760]  If not your words, I think they're afraid of the confidence
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:19.000]  Okay, because if you look at them, that's all about being very oily and very subdued and very no no no
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:21.480]  heartbeat right academic speech
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:24.280]  um kind of mpr
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:29.160]  They I I think this is my opinion. I think they want to destroy you because they're terrified of you
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.640]  What would you do if you had absolute power? I mean if you ran the country
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:37.480]  What would you do with that power? I'm like Ron Paul said if he got elected president
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:39.480]  He would take a long time to fix things. He's not a dictator
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:44.200]  I would use the constitution and public persuasion and and popularity and prosperity
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:51.480]  He's trying to show people that free market true open society is better than corporate crony capitalism socialism or communism show it
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:55.480]  I would never run the country because that's not what a president does
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.520]  Right, right, but I cannot run the country
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:02.360]  Now you've given me permission to ask some tough questions here
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:08.680]  Are there circumstances under which you would call for Americans to stand up and defend their country?
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:15.000]  Using constitutionally protected means. I mean, what's the trigger point if we're under a spot on the sand? Yeah, exactly
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:19.240]  as I said, we played videos the other night the twitter band of antifa
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.800]  Dozens of them saying we're going to kill republicans. We're going to kill trump and his family
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.400]  We're going to kill congresspeople and talk show host and here's where they live
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:33.960]  And I said folks better get their battle rifles ready if they attack you to protect right then they that turned into I'm gonna attack the press
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:40.120]  There's no quote. There's no video. They just they just say Jones said get battle rifles ready for the chai comms wasn't even part of the discussion
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:46.600]  So if you're being offensively attacked if they're arresting conservatives all over the place if they're taking people off the air
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:54.120]  And if they're announcing that you know, republican members of congress got killed or their plane blew up or crumbs been assassinated
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.120]  I
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:02.360]  I mean, I think at that point people need to know who the globalist are in their area and they need to make their own decision between them and god
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:03.560]  What they're going to do but
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.560]  Uh, I'm trying to fix things peacefully
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:10.360]  But if they offensively attack us in a nine of the long knives like hitler right or a crystal night
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:12.440]  Or some type of soviet style purge
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:15.160]  I think it's up to every man and woman to be ready for what they're going to do
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:20.600]  They have their own action plan because we're not a centralized system, but you're describing a defensive posture about french resistance here
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:23.640]  Okay, a defensive operation what it sounds like to me
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:29.480]  But I think that many people on the left believe that you don't even have the right to shoot someone who invades your home
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:31.720]  I mean, they've said well in England and everywhere else
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:34.840]  The number one crime is if you're being looted or mugged or raped fighting back
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:41.480]  Because that's their constituency like they said ms 13 are god's children. They should be able to torture eight-year-old girls to death
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:44.760]  Would you
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:47.720]  Would you ever be willing to let me explain this?
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:50.840]  Yeah, Mike, I feel like we've lost if we get to the shooting war
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.240]  Yes, so I never even deal with the shooting war. I try to fight as hard as I can
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:59.800]  They want the shooting war. They want the censorship. They want to say we start this shooting war
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.520]  Because they're losing the intellectual war
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:05.400]  So well, I am literally strategically
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  intellectually culturally
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:10.920]  spiritually mathematically
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  financially
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:20.280]  Uh, topography wise geospatial wise against a civil war with a bunch of dumb bots
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:25.080]  I want to defeat the establishment's cultural elite that are eugenicists
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:31.400]  But if let's say there were a false flag attack carried out against journalists such as lesser holt who's attacked you
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:35.960]  Would you say that is coming would you celebrate? Oh my god? I would be on the air
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.400]  Instantly on any form of my could saying investigate this. I stand against this. This is horrible
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.240]  The last thing we want is violence offensively. I decry it. I say no
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:51.800]  Would you use the info wars organization to in any way
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:57.240]  Uh engage in acts of of lawlessness or sedition against america
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:01.320]  That would be turning my back on everything we've done for 24 years. I would never do that
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.600]  Right. It's the left pushing all that it's it's qualmos, you know, the governor saying america was never good
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:10.440]  Uh america was never that important america was never great america's not that great
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:13.240]  It's them covering up for antifa. It's them doing this
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.720]  Well, look those are the questions that I can think of alex. I appreciate you. Let me ask these
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:21.240]  It's just that that they will consistently lie about you
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:26.520]  They will they will twist your words and distort your words and they will try to demonize you and they're and they're having a
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:28.680]  lot of success and traction in that but
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:31.400]  If they're willing to abandon all these standards of journalism
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.440]  That means that they can report after such an attack takes place a false flag attack
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:42.200]  They can literally go out and report alex jones called for this attack. That is that is why we know it's about to happen
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  They're gonna lose the election unless they do this
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:48.120]  And I criticize the chai come take over and that was a big part of it
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:49.400]  But they say
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:55.960]  Are pointing out that stelter says we're about to be attacked. It's imminent blood on trumps hands the new york times the washington post every channel
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:00.840]  I said looks like a false flag. No one's threatening them. They're the ones calling for violence. Trump isn't threatening him
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.080]  He's fighting back calling them liars when they attack him. That's why they don't want me on air
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:10.440]  I thought they've been saying. Oh, don't say school shootings are staged or don't question anything and misrepresent when I said
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:12.520]  Because they don't want us on air
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:16.600]  How do you expose somebody that's exposed to false flags? How do you expose somebody that says look at events?
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:19.400]  You claim they're behind them. That's their ultimate cover
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:25.320]  Yeah, silence us and the folks that expose sometimes they stage things you blame those that expose it as the culprit
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:29.480]  All right, but last question alex. What is your end game? What is your purpose?
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:31.240]  Why are you doing this?
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:35.000]  You know, that's a big question and we'll answer that when we come back because I can't do it 20 seconds
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.760]  All right, my Adams is here natural news.com the health ranger. I'm with info wars.com and news wars.com

[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:11.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:27.960]  I
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:41.000]  Cannot stress the importance of this broadcast in my whole life. I could never imagine we'd be at this point. They are a hundred percent
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:47.880]  Admitting they're preparing false flags that trump and myself and others have called for violence to then ban us
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:54.280]  Democrat top senators are saying they're going to ban all conservatives fairness doctrine talk radio. It's all here
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:00.440]  But the fact that we've gone to number one on the apps the fact that people are flooding the info wars dot com
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  That's panic them. So now
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:08.520]  They're trying to put a a narrative that we're going to be rated by the feds that our broadcast itself is illegal
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.400]  Aka the first amendment total fraud over some half a watt thing a year ago
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:18.600]  That I never even knew about that some other people had that was in the news and now it's back on the news that the feds
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:20.920]  shut down my flagship and
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:22.440]  I'm going off air
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  It's really pathetic of the democrats if we're aware of it and act against it
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:31.320]  But president trump needs to take action and you need to take action. We'll talk about how we think you should do that
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:33.560]  coming up
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:35.880]  Well in the war room today, I think I'm gonna stick around I was gonna
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:39.080]  Go out and do some business stuff with roger and develop stuff
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:45.080]  I think we're gonna stay here and host there and take calls about wargaming all this three to six p.m. But mike adams of naturalnews.com
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:47.080]  Really smart guys here
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:52.360]  He's been concerned about the very very same things, but you were asking me a question the last question of the interview
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:55.560]  What was it? What I mean? What's my in game? Yeah, what's what's your in game?
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:49:00.600]  I mean, you're suffering a tremendous amount of fake news attacks a tremendous burden
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.520]  The pain and suffering that they're putting you through personally is extraordinary
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:06.840]  What
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.240]  What what makes it worth it? Why are you running in for wars? What is your end game?
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:15.320]  Nothing good's free
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:21.320]  I mean we stand on the shoulders of men and women that fought and died in all these wars the revolutionary war
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:25.720]  When the founding fathers many of their families we get kidnapped because they have to stay back at the house
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.320]  And they take and put them on slave ships and presidents ships till they starve to death
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.520]  They write them letters and say your wife weighs about 85 pounds now
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.560]  She's got a cough and the founders had to let their wives and children die and it wasn't because they didn't care about the
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:41.080]  Wives and children it was that they wanted to beat that tyranny
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:43.800]  And so they're not starving my wife and kids to death yet
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.720]  And you know, I realized that if they were doing that and I signed over to them
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:51.880]  My wives and children wouldn't have any future anyways. They'd probably die the day I got them back
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:53.880]  you know it was uh
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:58.280]  Andrew Jackson's mother died in a British concentration camp when he was 12 years older in a revolutionary war
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:03.080]  And then you know, he had other family killed by the Native Americans. That's why I probably hated the British and the native so much
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:05.480]  But he was a very hateful but also loving man
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:09.560]  But but you know, I've gone through nothing compared to those men
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:14.360]  And everything we stand on Mike is people that were willing to make the sacrifices
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:19.400]  And not be the sellouts and these stagnant folks that turn over to every new evil
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.080]  And I see some Pakistani woman that doesn't criticize
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:28.360]  Pakistan killing hundreds of thousands of women a year stoning them to death cutting their genitals off
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:35.000]  Calling me a terrorist from her sick high road and saying I'm complicit domestic terror and should be arrested
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:38.280]  Along with MSNBC saying and I know where they're going
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:43.480]  And with so so I'm not a terrorist. I'm the opposite so they don't scare me
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:46.440]  Having Islamists is telling me I'm a terrorist. We know the truth
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:51.160]  They run everything against you that they themselves are doing
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:57.720]  You know, I I've called the media quote journal terrorists for quite some time because it's a psychological terrorism
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:02.760]  Terrorized economy, right? They want to implode at the family. They push race wars that end up in violence
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:05.800]  They push the Ferguson violence. They push the war on police and cops
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:08.120]  That is actual
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:13.320]  Journal terrorism as I've called it, but they they run everything that they're doing against you
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:17.160]  So now they're going to play want to get rid of you. It's not the cops or things are perfect
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:20.920]  But America's been great compared to other kind. They want to overthrow it. So they're in charge
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.400]  So see that's my in game and I'll finish with this. Okay
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:26.760]  My in game is
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:29.560]  I I didn't realize how bad it was 25 years ago when I got involved
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:34.920]  But I knew it was bad and then I've successfully gone through this fight and learned just how bad it is and now I know I'm right
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:41.320]  So my in game is I believe humanity. I believe folks aren't cowards. I believe we're rallying call. I believe if we're strong
[02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:45.640]  We might be lucky and I might make it out and be able to be with my family and have a future
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:49.800]  But if I have to get killed or put in prison or shut down or whatever that compendium is
[02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:53.480]  I have to commit because the worse it gets the more I know how right we were
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:56.520]  So I've got to make this sacrifice or there's no future anyway
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:00.760]  And so it's it's actually very honorable and I'm very actually blessed
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:06.520]  I just get mad at myself when I burn with desire to be able to politically and culturally and spiritually beat these people
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:09.560]  That I'm weak enough and have enough problems that
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:13.400]  That I could have done a better job or where are they took it out of context or how?
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:19.240]  But it doesn't matter how the strongman stumbled as Teddy Roosevelt said as the weakman sits there and talks about what he did in the arena
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:21.640]  Well, you guys print me Teddy Roosevelt's here the arena quote
[02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:27.000]  Well, what matters is who strove in the arena and and and you know the great challenges that even when they failed
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:32.840]  They were taking action because I really believe in humanity. I really believe in men and women. I'm actually for an open free society
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:38.760]  I actually believe in real culture, but I'm not going to be conquered by weaponized cultures brought into dominate me by cold-blooded
[02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:46.520]  mega corporations led by crazy Satanist George Soros Nazi who literally has a hard on for any prosperous country and is a
[02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:51.080]  literal parasitic demon with his demonic devil worship or son Alexander
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:56.920]  And so I just cannot culturally and spiritually die giving into them feels like death already
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:52:58.920]  So fighting them feels like life
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:03.320]  So as bad as things get it's the most alive I've ever been as I get closer to the truth
[02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:08.840]  And this is a pivotal moment actually in US history in world history. It's the internet
[02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:15.320]  This is the alex jones moment in in history and by that I don't mean that it's about your your personal
[02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:21.480]  Circumstances, but about what you stand for they smell the spirit. They smell the enemy. Yes. Yes
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:27.000]  We're looking at the mass decentralization of information control and that is what terrifies them
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:33.160]  I see two possible futures now alex one a future where you and us and the patriots are victorious
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:37.400]  Where cnn becomes obsolete because they have destroyed their own credibility
[02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:41.720]  NBC news has destroyed their credibility and a new golden age with big challenges
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:43.960]  But at least we're we're meeting the challenges
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:49.480]  I agree. We're in a crossroads and and actually I see a future where info wars right here
[02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:54.760]  This is a key national infrastructure for truthful information and reporting
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:54:01.000]  That tells the truth that challenges the the narratives of the status quo and that fights for individual human freedom
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:07.560]  Regardless of your skin color regardless of your race regardless of you know your gender all those things and that future
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:08.840]  We can make it happen
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:13.400]  But there's another dark future where we're overrun where lester holt
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:19.560]  Is the propagandist in chief he becomes the the gubbles of he is their number one guy right now
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:26.040]  Yeah, and and cnn people and so on. I mean they will enslave humanity for a thousand years if they can manage it
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:33.080]  They are what they're they are marching in the bootsteps of the third rike. They're trying to create a new fourth rike
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:37.000]  online the very same mega bags that funded hitler own them
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:39.560]  Well, absolutely and look who they protect
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:46.920]  They protect organizations that were literally part of the third rike such as ig farbin, which was brought IBM into
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:52.360]  Bay yeah, IBM was part of the holocaust. They ran the computing punch card systems to enslave jews
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:58.120]  They're the history people need to know the history. You're telling people the real history and so are you something like this?
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:00.040]  I don't
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:04.840]  It's the fighting spirit. They're scared of that anybody has they know I can ignite that kind of the opposite npr like you do
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:07.640]  People you know they're big or bad. They're evil
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:13.160]  But the power you have is so incredible don't be intimidated by their evil and think you better shut up
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:19.880]  They they want the devil goes about like a lion seeing who he can devour you've got to stand up and they'll move on
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:22.040]  Well, that's the thing
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:25.880]  They they want you to be afraid to speak the truth because of social engineering pressure
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:33.960]  They they know that if you say so look self-censorship is the demon here people self-censored themselves now on twitter on youtube
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:37.160]  I can't even tell you how many people I've heard from who are video creators who say
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:43.560]  That they themselves stop talking about you on youtube because they saw what happened with other people getting banned
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:47.720]  Just mentioning the name alex jones now is enough to get you banned
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:51.880]  On twitter even so if you give into that you just lost the whole beachhead instead, that's right
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:54.360]  Everybody's saying alex jones then they fail
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:56:01.640]  And and in in this way, you know you and what is happening to you has become bigger than you it has become the
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:08.360]  Rallying cry for internet freedom that frankly is a basic human right and a human dignity with you
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:11.720]  But now they've miscalculated. So what do they do now that it blew up in their face?
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.240]  Well, they just they say the feds rated us today that that's their next thing
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:20.600]  Well, yeah, and and now they have to they have to engineer an event where you end up
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:26.360]  Arrested and that's what they're trying to do and that's that's I mean you're smart because you you see this in advance
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:32.840]  And you're counteracting it right up front and they will fail and by the way if they try something like that the outcry
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:34.200]  Will be
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:37.720]  Monumental it will be well i want to be clear though you saw this coming months ago
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  You've been more pressing than I have
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:44.760]  Mike it's up to listeners if the listeners spread the videos the articles that are on info wars.com
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:49.720]  If they tell the truth about obvious the democrats are like they're going to kill us with no proof
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:51.800]  I mean it's obvious when it happens they staged it
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:56.280]  It's two plus two equals four if people spread the word they will back off and not do it
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:59.240]  That's why they were going to be platform us when the terror attack came
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:02.440]  Now because we talked about it. They had to do it early
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:07.480]  I believe I think the evidence shows and that's why they're panicked right now because things aren't going the way they want
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:11.800]  And I also pray by the way, alex not only for for our universal freedom
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:18.600]  But I pray for the upcoming victims of whatever false flag they're going to carry out because these globalist evil demonic
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:22.440]  Creatures they will murder human beings in order to silence you
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:27.800]  I mean everybody think about how evil that is they will kill people to shut you down
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:34.040]  We'll be back in just a few minutes and then one more segment with mike then roger stone's coming in with mike adams the co-host

[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:24.440]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:33.160]  They just give me a number when I was
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:43.480]  Number 13 ship identification devices implanted into their body got a long line of heartache. I carry it. Well
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:52.840]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell George sardos
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:01.560]  Bad luck when info wars dot com right now redirects to the top videos in the next hour
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:03.560]  It's going to go up with our great crew
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.040]  The video I did warning of the false flight. It's imminent guaranteed 100 clear
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:13.400]  It's like, you know watching a storm roll in and in late summer and knowing it's going to collide with
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:18.360]  Another front and give you thunderstorms. I mean it's on we're going to have those videos owes up
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:21.720]  They have silenced us ahead of the big false flag. Here's what
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.240]  Teddy Roosevelt spoke about in Paris
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:31.640]  In 1910 when he gave a speech on April 23rd the man in the arena people ask, what is our destiny?
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:34.040]  It's being in the arena
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:35.800]  It is not the critic who counts
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:38.280]  Not the man he points out out the strong man stumbles or
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:43.480]  Where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs the man who was actually in the arena
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:48.040]  His face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errors
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:53.160]  Who comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:58.760]  But who does actually strive to the deeds who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotions
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:04.360]  To spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:08.280]  And who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:14.920]  So that his place shall not be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
[03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:17.400]  And that's you asked my in game. That's it
[03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:23.880]  And there are far too many cold and timid souls right now in america who are seeing their freedoms
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:26.200]  eroded by the hour
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:30.520]  And they are they have not yet joined the fight for human freedom. They wonder why they feel so dead
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:34.760]  It's because they didn't commit. That's right. Well, let me guess mike. I bet you're more alive than ever been
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:40.440]  Yeah, well, that's true. I mean there's more at stake and I can barely sleep four hours now
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:44.200]  I'm bouncing off the walls. Well, think about five years ago when I came on your show
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:50.440]  You know, I was this like happy vegan guy, right? Right and today it's like we're fighting for everything
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:56.600]  Our very survival a right to exist and there's so much at stake and for whatever reason
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:01.000]  God has put people like you and I and others in this position
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:09.400]  To to even have this desperate voice to call for human freedom to call for the the most important protective
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:15.000]  Right and the enemy wants to shut down because it's the truth and I can keep going but thank god for dredgerport.com
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:18.840]  He's the only guy when dom Chomsky came out and said we were being censored. It was wrong that linked to it
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:22.200]  He's the only guy when lester holt said jones wants to kill me. I'm scared
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:27.960]  What an outrageous crazy lie. Yeah, he linked to what I actually said. So thank god for dredgerport.com
[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:30.840]  well, we you know look and thank god that
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:34.840]  We again, we're mature enough to know how they run these plans
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:39.640]  So I was mentioning off air like we built our our video platform
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:43.160]  We started it almost a year ago because we saw this coming
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:47.160]  You know it launched on july 4th and thank goodness that's there and there are others out there
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:51.960]  You know like bit shoot and others that that have the potential to be alternative platforms
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:04:00.200]  And you know what part of this process alex is that these these facebook's and and youtube's and twitter's they're murdering their own
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:05.640]  credibility they're they're killing themselves just like the nfl hollywood lost third fourth their audience
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:08.120]  Exactly this full commitment
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:10.600]  They don't even want to do it. They're just forced to do it
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:15.480]  Well, right and but but they're announcing to the world that you cannot find
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:21.720]  Speech on twitter that jack dorsi himself does not like and actually it's not just jack dorsi
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:23.320]  It's his own
[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:27.160]  internal lynch mob staff his staff is a lynch mob to him
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:32.120]  Telling him to ban you and that's what he's responded to so he has given in to the lynch mob
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:35.240]  And that is happening in every tech company all around silicon valley
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:40.280]  Yes, that was saying don't give in a lynch mob and I was at cruise at twitter stop it that he's banned our feed
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:47.000]  Their message was we are in control. We control the set. We'll be right back with mike adams and roger stone together
[03:04:47.080 --> 03:04:52.280]  That's the first spread the live links in fours.com only you can stop the love. It's only you
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:57.960]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue

[03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:26.600]  25 and info wars launches the last of america's counter globalist probes in a freak mishap
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:32.520]  Info wars.com and alex jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:39.640]  Which freezes his life support systems and returns alex jones to earth 25 years later later
[03:06:40.120 --> 03:06:48.040]  Transdimensionally over the spacetime continuum through full specs where people are extremely lazing the social engineers are there laughing
[03:06:48.040 --> 03:06:52.200]  What we envisioned 100 years ago 20 years ago is now real
[03:06:52.840 --> 03:06:59.640]  While the society unravels men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men and women run around frantic not knowing how to be women
[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:06.040]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed
[03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:13.800]  It's fulfilling to be involved. It's fulfilling info wars tomorrow's news. We're not gonna make america great again
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:17.800]  It was never that great
[03:07:19.480 --> 03:07:22.280]  We have not reached greatness
[03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:25.720]  We will reach greatness
[03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:28.760]  When every america
[03:07:29.240 --> 03:07:31.240]  Is fully engaged
[03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:33.640]  We will reach greatness
[03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:36.520]  when discrimination
[03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:44.040]  And stereotyping against women 51 of our population is gone
[03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:51.240]  Welcome back to the alex jones show fourth hour. This is mike adam's co-hosting with roger stone
[03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:55.960]  This is the first never had the honor of sitting here and hosting with roger stone roger
[03:07:55.960 --> 03:07:59.080]  It's great to actually meet you in person. We've never met before. It's great to be with you
[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:05.000]  I admire a lot of your work and i'm uh, you know health and natural supplement aficionado myself
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:10.600]  Uh, that's great. Long history of um, chinese medicine. I go to acupuncture
[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:15.800]  Prophylactically. I practice tai chi. I've used uh, chinese
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:22.280]  Herbalistic medicine for a good 30 years. Well, I did not know that about you. That's that's that's great to hear
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:27.240]  Um, we have to keep our longevity up because we're all under such attacks and and on that topic
[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:29.400]  You know, you are under intense
[03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:31.240]  assaults you could say by
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:37.800]  Robert Mueller who I think is running a a horrific illegal witch hunt against not just you but against america
[03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:43.400]  He's he's running it against this country. But what are the latest developments or concerns on your part?
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:47.640]  Well, it's a it's a horrific experience because it really is it's an inquisition
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:52.760]  Uh, Robert Mueller has no no oversight from anyone
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:58.840]  The courts have ruled that um his appointment is legal because he has the oversight of
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:03.240]  Acting attorney general in this matter rod rozenstein and the president
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:08.920]  But since both of them are at a minimum witnesses in the matter that he's investigating and perhaps more
[03:09:10.120 --> 03:09:12.120]  There's an inherent conflict of interest there
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:17.960]  As i'm sure you have read they have trotted dozens of my friends before the grand jury
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:21.800]  In desperate search of some crime, but they've been unable to find one
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.600]  multiple sources tell me that
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:27.400]  That the crime of defrauding the united states
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:33.160]  Is what they have in mind, but there's no evidence of that because let me say it for the nine thousandth time
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:35.880]  right, uh, I never received anything
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:42.520]  From the russians or wiki leaks or anyone else including allegedly hacked emails
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:48.360]  I never passed anything on to down from because well, you don't receive anything. There's nothing to pass on
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:54.440]  It's a false narrative. It's a threadbare narrative constantly pushed by the dorks at msnbc
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:10:00.680]  But the thing is roger and this is what's horrifying about our current situation is they don't need a factual crime
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:05.320]  They don't need any evidence to smear you even to lock you up
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:08.680]  Even to pull what they did with paul maniforte on you
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:13.320]  All they need is to convince or sufficiently threaten someone who has been close to you
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:18.280]  To fabricate some false claim against you and then they could use that to take away your liberties
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:23.560]  I mean we are living in a society now where the truth no longer matters to the deep state
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:26.120]  And they have too much power. No, you're absolutely right
[03:10:26.200 --> 03:10:33.320]  So in this lawsuit against me by this obama controlled front group, which I got dismissed several weeks ago
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:36.120]  They lay out the same
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:38.120]  threadbare false narrative yet again
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:40.680]  the russians
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:43.320]  Hacked the dnc. First of all, there's no proof of that
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:48.920]  Uh, and they gave the allegedly hacked emails to roger stone
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:53.480]  Who passed them on to wiki leaks or they gave them to wiki leaks who passed them on to stone?
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:58.280]  Who passed them on to trump and when they're pressed in court for their evidence?
[03:10:58.520 --> 03:11:02.840]  They point to a fake news clipping and say see here it is. Here it is. It's in writing. Here it is
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:07.400]  Right circular logic right, but but let's but let's equate this to what's going on here at info wars
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:14.440]  Because I think it's really important the effort to silence me the effort to incarcerate me and to take me off
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:21.160]  Uh info wars is part of the very same effort to silence alex jones
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:23.720]  And shut info wars down
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:26.440]  This is part and parcel of a grander scheme
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:30.600]  Why I think it's because we've been extraordinarily effective
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:37.320]  I think it's because we are the tip of the spear and because alex jones has been in the forefront of exposing
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:40.760]  the globalist plan for one world government
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:46.200]  And the uh anordinate amount of chinese communist influence in this country and the fact that
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:49.800]  Our major institutions are being sold to them one by one
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:54.280]  Uh apple being the single worst uh transgressor
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:11:59.800]  And therefore they want to shut me up. They want to shut jones up. They want to shut info wars down
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:03.880]  It's all same part of the same plan. They're willing to do anything
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:07.400]  I mean anything lawless things violent things to make that happen
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:13.720]  You know alex and I are both convinced that they are going to stage some kind of huge
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.800]  Attack some real violence. Yeah, this is a precursor on alex. This is this is a precursor. There's no question
[03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:24.440]  So I haven't asked you though. What do you think is the most likely scenario that they would run?
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:31.560]  Well, uh, I think it's kind of obvious that an attack on some news organization or some reporter
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:35.160]  on some prominent news person
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.320]  Uh, perhaps somebody will mount an attack on lester hole
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:47.000]  But it won't be alex jones. It won't be info wars. It won't be anyone affiliated with us because we don't believe in violence
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:50.360]  Violence would be counterproductive to where we are right now
[03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:53.320]  I subscribe to the views of dr. King
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:13:00.680]  I'm for civil disobedience if necessary, but i'm for peaceful protest right in massive numbers
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:03.320]  Peaceful protest brings change. We've seen it
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:09.720]  But it's no matter how many times you say peaceful protests and that you you find violence abhorrent
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:16.360]  They will take those two words protest and violence and they'll put them together and they'll say roger stone called for violent protests
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:21.000]  Right, so it's so dishonest. I mean one of the things that really aggravates me is that the
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:24.040]  sovereign poverty law center, which is a hate group
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:28.200]  I've just publicly declared them a hate group. By the way any financial scam
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:32.520]  Morris d's is just coining it taking it out of the country. He's a criminal
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:36.520]  No, let's just say it. Uh, that's a financial scam is what that is
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:41.880]  He was one of the progenitors who first understood direct mail fundraising back in the 60s
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.560]  Uh, and his whole southern poverty law is a fraud folks
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:51.000]  And if you're giving 25 dollars stop because it's a scam and all they're doing is pocketing your money
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:55.560]  Uh, they have recently declared the proud boys to be a hate group
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:14:00.040]  Right, right. I've addressed the proud boys groups. They renounce violence
[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:08.200]  They don't renounce self-defense. That's right. If they're attacked, they will respond. That's my position. That's Alex Jones's position
[03:14:08.280 --> 03:14:09.480]  but now
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:15.160]  Just having spoken to one of their groups or just having have friends who are in that organization
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:20.440]  You're called a terrorist. It is outrageous. The proud boys is not a hate group
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:23.240]  They are not white supremacists. That is a lie
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:30.360]  But but this is the thing they accuse you of the things that they are the splc in my view as well is a hate group
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:37.880]  They are spreading hatred that could in invoke violence and yet they accuse you of exactly the irony is one good tax audit
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:44.840]  Which cut them down. That's a financial scam. It's a fraud. They're there and they are enriching themselves
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:49.880]  While claiming to oppose hate and extremism. They are the haters
[03:14:49.880 --> 03:14:56.920]  They are the extremists. They are the con men. Morris D's is a con man. This whole thing is a financial fraud
[03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:01.800]  And and by the way, I'm going to add one other thing to the potential false flag theory here
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:08.520]  I think that given the the importance of 3d printed guns right now and the ghost gunner
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:12.840]  Uh technology where you can you can mill out your own ar-15 lower
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:16.360]  I think the perfect storm of a false flag would be
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:21.080]  For them to frame up somebody who's an alice shown supporter who 3d printed a gun
[03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:25.080]  Who attacked cnn and who voted for president trump and who bought your book?
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:29.400]  I mean, that's like the the ultimate dream of what they want to say. Yeah, there's no doubt
[03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:35.000]  They're gonna find a copy of stones rules in the alleged shooters apartment right in the basement
[03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:39.240]  Where he lives with his parents. Uh, look, this is a fraud folks. We got 10 seconds

[03:20:34.840 --> 03:20:39.000]  With the mainstream media doing everything they possibly can to shut down info wars
[03:20:39.480 --> 03:20:41.960]  With this across the board purge
[03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:50.440]  Uh on social media of the info wars message. It's more important than ever that you go to the info wars dot com store and support us
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:55.480]  This is our lifeblood. This is what keeps us moving. We don't have any big
[03:20:56.360 --> 03:21:00.200]  multinational corporate sponsors writing enormous checks to underwrite
[03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:04.920]  The important work that's done here at info wars and therefore we can only depend on you
[03:21:05.480 --> 03:21:11.000]  And right now at the info wars dot com site. We have some of the most incredible specials. We've ever featured
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:15.240]  Uh, for example, brain force plus at 40 off
[03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:20.600]  Super male vitality and super female vitality at 50 off
[03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:25.160]  secret 12 at 40 off interestingly
[03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:31.240]  Winter sun at 40 off people assume you only need winter sun in the winter time
[03:21:31.240 --> 03:21:35.560]  And it's not true when it's hot outside and you spend more time in the air conditioning
[03:21:35.880 --> 03:21:38.520]  You're getting less sunlight and therefore less vitamin d
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:43.480]  The winter sun can be of enormous assistance right now 40 off
[03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:46.200]  survival shield x2
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:55.000]  At 40 off one of my all-time favorites silver bullet. It's interesting because the the colloidal silver formula
[03:21:55.960 --> 03:22:00.680]  Which has an electronic distilling process and therefore smaller molecules
[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:04.280]  Allows for greater absorption in the silver bullet
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:09.480]  Uh product in my opinion the very best colloidal silver product on the market today
[03:22:10.040 --> 03:22:14.600]  Available at the info wars dot com store. We need your support folks. Please go to the store
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:19.720]  The auto ship program is the best because when you lock in on a product
[03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:22.840]  That you really like that really works for you
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:29.960]  You don't have to remember every month to reorder and a small store of it is put aside
[03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:36.040]  Uh so that you're never without you're never in a position where they're out of your favorite product
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:41.080]  So please go to the info wars dot com store now and support us in the fight for freedom
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:43.000]  Let me just add to that roger because you know
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:47.800]  My background is as a as a nutritionist and a food scientist and for those of you who are fans of info wars
[03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:49.880]  If you have dark skin color
[03:22:49.880 --> 03:22:52.760]  If you're african-american if you are latino
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:56.760]  You're absorbing less sunlight than those of us who have more fair skin
[03:22:56.760 --> 03:23:00.120]  And and many of you if you have an indoor job
[03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:05.560]  You can be so chronically deficient in vitamin d and your doctor will never tell you right never tell you
[03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:07.640]  Go get your vitamin d tested
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:13.960]  You'll find probably in many cases is so low if you're not supplementing that you need to supplement to bring that up to a
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:19.880]  Normal range and even even you know fair skin people who work indoors a lot and you know here you and i are
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:24.680]  Inside you know, we'd probably rather be outside somewhere frankly, but here we are
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:29.560]  So we have to supplement as well, but yeah, I'd be tougher to get much wider than I am so
[03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:35.880]  So you're you're absolutely right, but people say a winter sun. I only need that in the winter. It's actually not true
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:41.000]  It's year-round. Yeah, there's no question what I like about the info wars products is the way they take
[03:23:42.120 --> 03:23:43.960]  ancient proven
[03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:45.320]  Chinese
[03:23:45.320 --> 03:23:50.040]  Herbalistic principles and ingredients and then they they merge them with some of cutting-edge
[03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:58.280]  Nutraceuticals to produce some of the most effective products out there at prices that are far lower than you can find anywhere else
[03:23:58.520 --> 03:24:03.160]  That's what's crazy about it. And I know we we're not going to spend this whole segment plugging here
[03:24:03.160 --> 03:24:08.120]  But just as one more note, you know, we've looked into retail distribution of nutritional products
[03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:10.520]  If you go into retail like Whole Foods
[03:24:11.320 --> 03:24:13.320]  You have to give Whole Foods
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:17.240]  Something like 60 percent off your selling price
[03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:19.800]  Which means that then Whole Foods makes some money
[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:24.520]  But you have to cheapen your product to get it into that store and not just Whole Foods
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:28.200]  But many others but by selling direct info wars is able to put more
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:33.880]  Ingredients in the product because they don't have a middleman. Yeah, not only that, but you're not getting filler
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:40.120]  You're not getting an inferior ingredients. You're getting the very best quality stuff. Look, I have been
[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:46.520]  Using alternative medicine. I've been using herbals and all natural supplements for a good 40 years
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:48.520]  I've never had the success
[03:24:49.080 --> 03:24:51.720]  I've had with the info wars products anywhere else
[03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:56.920]  And the price is right. You're not going to find this kind of quality at these kind of prices anywhere else
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:00.760]  So folks go to the store now and we need we need you to have our back
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:05.880]  It's this is a segue to the economic warfare that they are carrying out against info wars
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:12.840]  All of the bands of the key infrastructure, you know, the the the mail chimp being taken away discuss comment engine
[03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:18.520]  The Shopify payments ban of one of their smaller stores. All of these things Roger are
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:23.720]  Attacks on key business infrastructure and if you look at what's happening in society today
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:31.800]  These lynch mob liberals are essentially asserting that those who support president trump or who are conservatives have no right to speak
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:34.440]  No right to engage in business
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:39.640]  Not even a right to go eat at a public restaurant without being harassed by an angry violent lynch mob
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:44.920]  Now think about that. They're saying that your kind are not welcome here. We've heard that before
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:49.240]  We heard that against black people in the 50s and 60s and 70s
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:55.240]  And it's people like martin luther king jr. Who stood up against that and said that we judge people by the content of their character
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:00.040]  Not the color of their skin and we have to return to that kind of civil rights movement right now
[03:26:00.680 --> 03:26:02.680]  I apologize for taking
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:07.320]  I could not agree more. I mean look people are often shocked when they they ask me
[03:26:07.320 --> 03:26:13.240]  Who are your political heroes? Well, some of them, you know ronald reagan blight eisenhower. Yes, richard nixon
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:19.240]  Adam clayton powell jr. People say what what what how could that be because he stood for civil rights
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:24.440]  We need to go back to that what where all people are treated equal under our current system
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:29.480]  That's not what this revolution is about. They are trying to silence people three weekends ago
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.360]  I was in an italian restaurant a sunday afternoon with my
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:37.160]  My grand with my grandchildren my children my wife my entire family. It's rare
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:40.120]  We all get together for dinner because my kids are so active
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:47.320]  Two activists decide they want to come up to the table and start calling me a trader calling me a russian agent
[03:26:47.480 --> 03:26:52.920]  Wow and much worse and i'm like really on sunday afternoon when i'm trying to have dinner with my family right
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:56.120]  You want to pick on me pick me on the street. You'll regret it
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:27:00.520]  Oh, but they claim they're tolerant and they're inclusive and they're polite and progressive
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:07.080]  Yeah, and they demonstrate that by badgering you in a public place calling and calling you obscene names in front of children
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:14.760]  It's it's despicable, but it's art and parcel of the left, but they're losing. That's why they are so damn hysterical
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:18.200]  They're losing it's it's a it's almost mass mental illness. I mean
[03:27:18.840 --> 03:27:23.800]  We seriously have to call it that look. I don't want to dwell on this issue because I know I wanted to ask you about the
[03:27:23.880 --> 03:27:28.680]  The manifold trial. What do you know about the latest developments? I believe that's gone to a well
[03:27:28.680 --> 03:27:34.440]  I have one interesting observation and that is at trial both in the drawings
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:37.880]  And is described in a number of the stories
[03:27:38.600 --> 03:27:41.080]  Manafort is wearing a suit and tie
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:44.120]  But no socks
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:49.560]  Now because he's taken back to prison every night during the time that he's on trial
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:52.600]  Even though he's been convicted of nothing yet. It's kind of odd
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:55.080]  He's not allowed to have a belt
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:28:01.400]  He's not allowed to have shoelaces because you could commit suicide with those. I'm not sure how they allow him a tie
[03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:03.960]  But he is allowed to have
[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:06.280]  Prison issue socks, which are white
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:11.800]  Except for Manafort refuses to wear white socks with a suit and that's why he's barefoot
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:15.080]  So so despite his garish choices
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:20.920]  Of wardrobe because I've been a critic of his expensive wardrobe not that he doesn't have the right to buy it
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:23.080]  But that his taste is not mine
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:27.560]  And he refuses to wear white socks with a suit. So he has been redeemed in my eyes
[03:28:28.120 --> 03:28:33.080]  Uh, I don't know about the efficacy of a strategy in which he offers no defense
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:35.400]  This is odd to me
[03:28:35.400 --> 03:28:40.440]  But that is what his lawyers have chosen as I understand the jury is out. I believe and we wait
[03:28:40.600 --> 03:28:45.000]  So there could be a decision as early as today or tomorrow. Very possible. You're here on the alex jones show
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:50.040]  Uh, please we'll be right back with more of alex jones
[03:28:50.040 --> 03:28:52.840]  Mike roger stone

[03:33:17.480 --> 03:33:26.760]  Government cover-ups you want answers? Well, so does he it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[03:33:31.320 --> 03:33:36.600]  All right, we are here live on the fourth hour of the alex jones show today a rare joining of
[03:33:37.320 --> 03:33:39.560]  personalities here roger stone and mike adams
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:44.920]  Bringing it in for you again for another segment. We were just chatting during the break about how
[03:33:44.920 --> 03:33:53.080]  Unbelievable it is that we find ourselves in the situation that we're in today the the assaults on the basic freedoms that we have enjoyed so long
[03:33:53.480 --> 03:33:59.080]  Being americans in this country the economic sabotage the lawlessness of federal prosecutors
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:03.800]  Uh, you you were just telling me just astonished that you never could have predicted this roger. What are your thoughts?
[03:34:04.040 --> 03:34:09.800]  No, I mean if you told me two three years ago that we'd have less civility in our country rather than more
[03:34:09.800 --> 03:34:16.120]  I would never believe it. Look. I'm a hard-edge partisan. Okay. I'm a real conservative. I'm a libertarian conservative
[03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:23.160]  My views on on some issues are are not orthodox right-wing conservatism
[03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:29.960]  And I have many friends who are democrats. I have many friends who are liberals, but I hear from them less and less
[03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:33.000]  Uh, and I see there's a there's an attire
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:38.360]  Movement backwards where you can't go out on the street. You can't walk through an airport
[03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:43.560]  You can't walk through a restaurant. You can't walk down the street in manhattan for example
[03:34:43.880 --> 03:34:47.640]  Without somebody wanting to get in your face and call you names
[03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:53.720]  That's what's astonishing about this is this complete lack of civility by people who themselves claim to be
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:56.280]  The good people in society
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:02.840]  But they they they are filled with so much hatred while they demand that you be banned for hate speech in the case of alex
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:10.360]  But it's also economic sabotage and I believe you said earlier you're facing as much as potentially what two million dollars in legal bills
[03:35:10.760 --> 03:35:16.360]  Or more look this threatens to destroy me financially, which is part of the plan. You see they wear you out
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:21.080]  Uh, I you can find stories online that say roger stone is worth 20 million dollars
[03:35:21.640 --> 03:35:25.720]  Folks, I am not worth 20 million dollars not even close. I'm not a wealthy man
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:32.200]  It threatens to destroy me to bankrupt my family. I've had to set up a legal defense fund stone defense fund dot com
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:34.200]  There's the address
[03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:39.720]  Anything you send will be put to my legal defense. I met with a very high powered
[03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:44.520]  Criminal defense attorney last week who I would like to retain
[03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:49.320]  Uh, and he told me my defense will cost a minimum of two million dollars a minimum
[03:35:49.800 --> 03:35:54.840]  So I have I have a lawsuit against me by the democratic national committee
[03:35:55.320 --> 03:35:57.720]  Me donald trump jr. The trump campaign
[03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:05.000]  Vladimir putin julien assange wiki lakes, right the republican national committee. It's it's a farce
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:11.560]  Uh, I have the house that I have the senate intelligence committee and the senate judiciary committee investigating me
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:14.440]  I have robert moeller and his gum shoes
[03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:18.040]  poking into every nook and cranny of my life
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:21.560]  interviewing people who work for me asking me asking questions like
[03:36:22.680 --> 03:36:25.640]  How's his relationship with his wife? How's he along with his kids?
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:30.920]  Where's his money come from? Does he smoke marijuana? Have you seen him drunk? Does he drink a lot?
[03:36:31.320 --> 03:36:35.720]  Uh, does he have girlfriends? Does he have boyfriends? Uh, what what's his social life life?
[03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:41.720]  I mean, what do you have it has nothing to do with rushing collusion and and and they have unlimited federal money
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:45.080]  To come after you but now you have to go into
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:46.840]  debt
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:51.560]  Essentially to defend yourself against charges that are completely bogus to begin with just to prove your innocence
[03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:57.720]  I had set aside a small amount of money, which is almost all derived from my book sales. I've written five books
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:01.160]  That was supposed to pay for my grandchildren's college education
[03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:04.600]  I've had no choice but to liquidate it and use it to pay for lawyers
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:13.480]  They seek to destroy me financially, which is why I asked people to go to stonedefensefund.com and send a generous contribution
[03:37:13.800 --> 03:37:16.440]  I have no choice but to turn to my friends and supporters
[03:37:16.440 --> 03:37:21.240]  I am not wealthy and Robert Muller has a big old target on my back now
[03:37:21.480 --> 03:37:25.800]  He's having trouble finding evidence of a crime because there is no crime
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:29.400]  Uh, and uh, he doesn't like it when you expose what he's doing
[03:37:29.480 --> 03:37:34.440]  But trust me I will do that because people need to know about the abuses of this process
[03:37:35.080 --> 03:37:40.200]  In the grand jury when people who are associated with me are asked questions and they don't like the answer they cut them off
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:46.360]  Uh, it's an abusive process, but for the prosecutors to think that they will not be named
[03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:49.880]  And that their own ethical problems will not be brought to the fore
[03:37:50.120 --> 03:37:53.640]  Then they don't understand this process at all. The reason this is so disturbing
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:38:00.040]  I think to a typical person hearing this is that this same kind of strategy could be run against anyone
[03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:05.160]  If you are targeted and selected by the deep state, they can make your life a living hell
[03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:10.040]  They can bankrupt you. They can force you to sell assets to sell a house. I mean look what they did to
[03:38:10.520 --> 03:38:15.080]  General Flynn. It's like a great patriot. Exactly. They can they can destroy your life
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:17.960]  But they are backed by an unlimited federal government
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:23.880]  With an unlimited budget that they confiscate from the taxpayers and and of course democrats want them to take even more
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:26.120]  And I think that the feeling out there
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:28.120]  I mean I feel this too
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:32.840]  That if they come after you they could come after me or anyone else for any reason
[03:38:32.840 --> 03:38:37.320]  Well, just like just like see just like these just like the censorship
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:42.040]  Um, uh, uh blitzkrieg against alex jones and info wars
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:44.600]  He's just the test case
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:50.680]  If they are successful in silencing alex jones and shutting down info wars and that's exactly what they have in mind
[03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:53.960]  Who's next shone hannity?
[03:38:54.040 --> 03:38:55.560]  Tucker carlson
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:38:56.840]  Laura ingram
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:00.680]  Mike savage rush limbaugh all these patriots that I revere
[03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:03.640]  They need to understand that they are next on the hit list
[03:39:03.960 --> 03:39:09.640]  Alex jones is merely the test case and what's being done to him is outrageous and now mike
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:16.600]  Is absolutely clear. We can't say this enough times. This is what the mob would call a setup. Yes. Yes
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:20.680]  You get out front and you say jones is advocating violence against the media
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:25.720]  Then someone in the media will be attacked or hurt or killed and then they will say jones did it
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:31.720]  It was jones who did it right a lie. It's a it is a it is a vicious lie. It is a smear
[03:39:32.040 --> 03:39:34.680]  So we cannot be clear here. Let's say it one more time
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:40.280]  We renounce violence against members of the media or anyone else violence is counterproductive
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:43.160]  It is not what we believe in and if there is violence
[03:39:43.400 --> 03:39:48.200]  It will be a false flag that is falsely blamed on alex jones and the people here at info wars
[03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:50.120]  What does the president need to do right now?
[03:39:50.120 --> 03:39:56.280]  I mean, I mean if you were to say to president trump and you know, you've known him for a very long time and had many conversations with him
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:39:58.760]  If he were here right now
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:00.760]  What I mean
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:08.440]  Call up you would have to appeal to call call up your deputy attorney general for antitrust and tell him to bring an immediate action against facebook
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:09.800]  twitter
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:11.160]  etc etc
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:17.880]  For monopolistic and antitrust practices. Yes, and that would end this censorship. That's the fastest and cleanest way to do it
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:24.360]  What about the muller investigation? He should terminate mr. Mueller who has his own problems regarding 9 11
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:26.680]  The anthrax investigation
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:29.400]  The uranium one the whitey bulger matter
[03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:35.640]  He's got quite a colorful past if he thinks that they're putting me on trial and we're not going to talk about his track record boy
[03:40:35.640 --> 03:40:37.640]  They were very wrong
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:42.440]  Well, uh, but he so he should terminate mr. Mueller first. He should terminate mr. Rosenstein
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:49.560]  He has grounds Rosenstein is hiding the use of multiple FISA warrants for political purposes
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:54.840]  Rosenstein is a criminal who should be prosecuted. Uh, he should fire at Rosenstein
[03:40:54.920 --> 03:40:56.760]  He should then fire sessions
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:02.360]  He should then terminate mr. Mueller and then he should order his new attorney general or his acting attorney general
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:08.600]  To review the activities of those gentlemen and and I would add to the president that those actions if he took them
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:13.000]  Would probably set off massive left-wing violent riots across america
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.240]  I would add that we the people have your back
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:18.280]  We the people will help stop the violence
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:25.960]  We will help support lawfulness and civility in society if the left wants to start a 25 city riot and try to burn down this country
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:31.640]  Guess what we're going to stop them from a defensive posture not an aggressive posture. We do not start violence
[03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:38.040]  We help defend our nation and end violence and lawlessness. I do think that the president has the support of our military
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:41.960]  I do think the president has the support of our men and women in uniform
[03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:48.280]  Uh, and I think if if there is illegal unlawful violence, the president has the authority to stop it
[03:41:48.520 --> 03:41:50.520]  But that is precisely what they have in mind
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:58.360]  We don't start problems, but we will defend ourselves. I think that's the key message you see is heading to a martial law scenario
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:01.480]  I mean if if some of those actions are taken
[03:42:02.120 --> 03:42:07.400]  Wouldn't we have to declare martial law at some level in order to stop the left-wing riots and violence?
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:12.760]  Well, oh boy, that is a slippery slope. Yeah, that really that really disturbs me. Look, I
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:18.280]  Understand the dynamic around president trump. I saw this when I worked for ronald reagan
[03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:21.240]  When we elect an outsider president
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:28.280]  First they try to defeat you when they can't defeat you they try to co-opt you and that's precisely what's going on today
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:30.600]  All right, we'll be back with roger stone
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:36.440]  This is mike adams also co-hosting here on the alex jones show a lot of breaking analysis right here

[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:26.600]  We're not gonna make America great again. It was ever that great
[03:47:30.280 --> 03:47:33.080]  We have not reached greatness
[03:47:34.440 --> 03:47:36.440]  We will reach greatness
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:41.560]  When every american is fully engaged
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:44.440]  We will reach greatness
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:47.240]  When discrimination
[03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:53.400]  And stereotyping against women 51 of our population is gone
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:59.400]  Wow, I marvel at that. Uh, perhaps
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:06.600]  That's Andrew Cuomo's campaign slogan for 2020. Uh, we can't make America great again because it was never that great to begin with
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:13.560]  Wow, unbelievable. Let's see how voters like that some breaking news. Uh, for those of you who missed it this morning
[03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:17.080]  I'm here with mike adams roger stone on the alex jones show
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:23.640]  Uh, I'm sure many of you saw the reports this morning that the fcc had shut down alex jones
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:32.200]  Flagship radio station. Uh, this was reported by the hill. Uh, we can show the original story here on the sky cam
[03:48:32.840 --> 03:48:35.320]  Here is the correction just recently
[03:48:36.040 --> 03:48:42.280]  Issued by the hill. We now know the truth the fcc targeted a small pilot
[03:48:42.760 --> 03:48:45.240]  pirate radio station here in austin
[03:48:45.240 --> 03:48:48.920]  Uh, that broadcast the alex jones show
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:54.200]  Hardly our flagship station. In fact, I don't think this station that they refer to
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:48:56.680]  Has been on the air for over a year
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:49:00.600]  And the fines referred to in the first story
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:07.480]  Were over a year ago. So we have some correction there mike to the fake news. This is extraordinary
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:10.520]  Of course kudos to the hill for correcting the story
[03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:16.440]  But they deserve blame for running the fake story in the first place and by the way most of the other media will never
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:22.680]  Correct this story and this brings up the most important point here. They are faking the news every day against alex jones
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:27.240]  They are faking it. They are making it up. They are lying deliberately. These are not mistakes
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:34.040]  These are deliberate engineered scripted lies and word games to try to blame alex jones and blame info wars
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:41.160]  And the purpose of that as you know roger is because a false flag is coming go to info wars dot com right now
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:46.120]  There's a an emergency video on the home page of the website a false flag is coming
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:49.720]  And we know because we've seen the playbook. We've seen history all of us
[03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:56.440]  We know that this false flag is being engineered to blame alex jones to make him
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:49:59.800]  The fall guy for whatever violence is going to be carried out
[03:49:59.800 --> 03:50:04.120]  It is so obvious roger that this is this is coming the playbook is right on in the open
[03:50:04.280 --> 03:50:07.880]  Do they think we're that stupid that we don't see this coming you just said that you know
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:11.480]  You had the very the best phrase yet fall guy exactly right
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:15.320]  This is an attempt to blame jones for something he has nothing to do with
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:21.000]  I have seen the willful distortions of what he actually said last night on on text
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:26.040]  I went back and forth with somebody at cnn very high up at cnn with whom I have a good relationship
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:32.120]  Uh about sandy hook because alex jones has never said the things about sandy hook that are ascribed to him
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:35.080]  They're taken out of context. They're taken partially
[03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:41.160]  Uh, but it is as soon as you bring up his name left winger scream sandy hook sandy hook
[03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:46.440]  Like it's almost uh, uh, uh, it's it's really like a visceral
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:49.240]  Uh ingrained
[03:50:49.240 --> 03:50:57.320]  Piece of falsehood, I guess is no other way to put it. It's like a a a a rambling mound of zombies
[03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:03.560]  Have been programmed with microchips right to spout sandy hook sandy hook and attack alex jones on the street
[03:51:03.560 --> 03:51:08.040]  I mean, it's it really is insane. It's like we're we're living through the walking dead
[03:51:08.520 --> 03:51:12.120]  But they they they have voices and they are spouting nonsense
[03:51:12.120 --> 03:51:17.320]  But you know a little bit of satire there on that part, but this is real this this
[03:51:17.320 --> 03:51:22.360]  This false flag that's coming is real. I'm convinced of it. No, and you heard about it here folks
[03:51:22.360 --> 03:51:25.560]  So go back you'll be able to go back and look at this video later
[03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:32.040]  When it is revealed that everything we predict comes to pass. Let's let's let's say today's date. What is what is the date today?
[03:51:32.040 --> 03:51:38.040]  I think is the 16th august 16th 2018 roger stone mike adams on the record today
[03:51:38.520 --> 03:51:40.520]  What other event happened aretha franklin?
[03:51:40.840 --> 03:51:43.960]  She passed away god bless aretha franklin by the way
[03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:49.000]  Uh prayers to her family, but that's what's happening today. We know this false flag is coming
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:54.520]  We are on the record saying that they're going to try to blame alex jones and take down his voice and his
[03:51:55.080 --> 03:52:01.240]  infrastructure his entire operation by killing people the the globalists or the deep stator whoever's running it
[03:52:02.280 --> 03:52:06.840]  I mean roger. I I can't even believe that this is happening in america
[03:52:07.080 --> 03:52:09.080]  This was not the america that I know
[03:52:09.080 --> 03:52:13.960]  It is hard to believe uh the the blatant disregard for the constitution the fact that the
[03:52:14.760 --> 03:52:19.480]  Trump justice department is still under the total control of barack obama
[03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:27.320]  That because of either the mental feebleness or the fact that he's compromised jeff sessions is not running the justice department
[03:52:27.560 --> 03:52:30.840]  We have a rogue. Just department run by rod rozenstein
[03:52:31.080 --> 03:52:36.840]  By the way who cleared manifor personally as the us attorney of all these crimes that he's on trial for
[03:52:36.840 --> 03:52:40.440]  Almost 10 years ago amazing little kind of side factoid there
[03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:48.200]  Uh, it is it is uh vitally important that people ask me every day. How can we change this?
[03:52:48.600 --> 03:52:53.080]  What is the president going to do? He needs to fire rod rozenstein?
[03:52:53.240 --> 03:52:58.600]  He needs to terminate uh, mr. Sessions and he needs to close down the witch hunt
[03:52:58.840 --> 03:53:05.240]  This is an inquisition in which robert muller is playing the role of tork mada and roger
[03:53:05.240 --> 03:53:11.480]  While these prosecutions or attempted prosecutions are going on these these secret investigations that are corrupted and illegal
[03:53:11.800 --> 03:53:13.800]  Look at what's not being investigated
[03:53:14.280 --> 03:53:18.920]  Where is lock her up? Where are the investigations into the clinton foundation?
[03:53:18.920 --> 03:53:22.680]  What about barack obama funneling money to iran to build nuclear weapons?
[03:53:23.160 --> 03:53:26.440]  Money laundering on an international scale cargo planes full of cash
[03:53:26.680 --> 03:53:33.000]  No, that's the irony people keep yelling to me. You're a trader. You're a trader. No the traders are barack obama selling weapons to isis
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  Bill clinton selling
[03:53:35.320 --> 03:53:40.840]  Missile guidance technology to the chinese. Yeah, they they are the criminals
[03:53:41.160 --> 03:53:46.920]  And until we get an honest justice department until we have a real attorney general committed to the rule of law
[03:53:47.240 --> 03:53:52.200]  This is never going to get corrected the uranium supply to russia linked companies
[03:53:52.360 --> 03:54:00.120]  Yes, uranium one scandal robert muller was involved that where where's the investigation of james comey leaking a secret classified information
[03:54:00.120 --> 03:54:06.280]  Where's the investigation of hillary's email server? Yeah, there's a double standard here that I think the american people are finally on to
[03:54:07.160 --> 03:54:09.720]  That rules and laws are only for trump supporters
[03:54:10.360 --> 03:54:16.360]  And that members of the deep state and the two party duopoly that have virtually ruined this country are allowed to operate
[03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:23.560]  With impunity against the law folks. I want to take this opportunity to remind you once again that freedom isn't free
[03:54:23.560 --> 03:54:31.320]  Uh, and we survive here. We thrive here at info wars only because of your loyal patronage at the info wars dot com store

[03:54:58.840 --> 03:55:01.320]  survival shield in my opinion the very best
[03:55:01.880 --> 03:55:07.320]  Uh, natural iodine you can find on the marketplace today at 40 off
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:14.520]  Your purchase of these products is the only thing that keeps info wars thriving
[03:55:15.400 --> 03:55:17.400]  surviving expanding and fighting
[03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:20.600]  Without your support. We are nothing
