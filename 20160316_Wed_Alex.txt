[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.680]  well he first came into government under the bush 41 mr. new world order
[00:32.680 --> 00:37.560]  administration he's one of these Rockefeller Republican slash Democrats
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.560]  Merrick Garland nominated the Supreme Court he's already a senior federal
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.160]  judge already confirmed by Congress so Obama claims they can fast-tracking and
[00:47.160 --> 00:53.880]  guess what he's known to be extremely anti-second amendment isn't that a
[00:53.880 --> 01:02.160]  surprise for everyone none of us saw that coming today did we no so we'll be
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.560]  breaking it down Washington Times headline Merrick Garland has a very
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.280]  liberal view of gun rights now if you use the proper definition of liberal that
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.560]  means he's for total citizen right to keep bare arms like this country started
[01:17.560 --> 01:24.160]  out in but instead liberal means less rights in the new 1984 upside-down world
[01:24.160 --> 01:28.840]  we have Joel Scowzen of the World Affairs brief joining us on the geopolitical
[01:28.840 --> 01:33.360]  situation with North Korea Russia the pullout in Syria and more in the second
[01:33.360 --> 01:36.560]  hour I had other guests on the day but I've cancelled them because I want to
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.760]  cover the big mega massive win in the latest super Tuesday event last night
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.480]  with Donald Trump and how the media is trying to spin that in the latest attacks
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.520]  that is all coming up other good news Texas can sue feds over BLM land grab
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.720]  but they're taking people's property thousands of acres on both sides of the
[01:56.720 --> 02:03.800]  Red River in in Oklahoma and in Texas that had been in some families hands for
[02:03.800 --> 02:10.720]  over a hundred years and they're taking their houses you actually own it you have
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.320]  full title you paid property tax on it and they put a sign on it saying road
[02:15.320 --> 02:22.200]  closed and you try to go to your house men with machine guns show up this is
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.920]  the aggressive hateful anti-American posture of the occupied illegitimate
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.200]  federal government that lawlessly opens the borders brings people in but then
[02:31.200 --> 02:35.840]  tells you that you have no rights people say well then support the Bundy's
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.800]  let's have a war with them we're gonna win through the courts and taken back
[02:39.800 --> 02:46.680]  Congress and the states and suing these people and if a shooting war does start
[02:46.680 --> 02:50.920]  it's not gonna start it's some federal refuge where the public thinks people
[02:50.920 --> 02:55.680]  taking something over it'll start when they're killing ranchers who try to go
[02:55.680 --> 02:59.880]  to their hundred-year-old ranch house and if they want to start an election or
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.640]  concord like that that's their problem I'm trying to stop that but yes we have
[03:04.640 --> 03:09.920]  an occupied federal government it is lawless it is foreign the general
[03:09.920 --> 03:12.960]  public hasn't figured that out yet they're starting to get it they're
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.880]  starting to get it the globalists want to have physical confrontations because
[03:17.880 --> 03:23.080]  they can spin and misrepresent that a lot of people say oh you know you can't
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.440]  beat the helicopters the troops the surveillance will get crushed in a war
[03:26.440 --> 03:32.320]  with the feds we won't get crushed militarily in a war with the feds
[03:32.320 --> 03:38.560]  because they're not feds we will get crushed in an information war with them
[03:38.560 --> 03:43.120]  and then lose the physical war if the public isn't aware that this is an
[03:43.120 --> 03:50.280]  occupying force like the V.C. French in World War 2 these are collaborators now
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.400]  does that mean everybody in the system is an enemy no statistically there's
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.600]  probably more feds that know what's going on than the general public because
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.280]  they're in the middle of it they either though shut up get out or join with it
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.080]  and they are recruiting leftists in the last 50 60 years to fill up key
[04:09.080 --> 04:20.720]  positions who are serious vitriolic hard-core committed zealots to carrying
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.040]  out globalist operations they're the types that blow up Oklahoma city building
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.640]  blaming on the patriots so they've got hardcore cadres that are sworn enemies
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.000]  of this country sworn enemies of the family sworn enemies of Christianity
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.280]  why they side with radical Islam but the average FBI agent the average person
[04:40.280 --> 04:44.680]  the military the average person the federal marshals the average cop I've
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.520]  just studied it is more awake and is not support what's happening so that's why
[04:48.520 --> 04:51.720]  we just shouldn't have a dumb war with them we should have an info war and
[04:51.720 --> 04:57.200]  destroy the enemy by exposing that they are an actual hijacking criminal

[08:24.480 --> 08:31.880]  well we knew it was coming and Obama has nominated Merrick Garland a Bush era
[08:31.880 --> 08:44.240]  neocon from Bush 41 he argued against DC Heller on the federal bench and said
[08:44.240 --> 08:51.000]  that he would have reheard the case of the petitioners to overturn it of course
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.600]  that's the six-year-old ruling saying that you cannot have complete gunbands
[08:54.600 --> 09:00.200]  in Washington DC Chicago and other areas and still those cities basically
[09:00.200 --> 09:06.200]  refused to comply with the ruling just like Obama lawlessly orders the
[09:06.200 --> 09:12.480]  borders wide open and lawlessly orders refugees brought in and they're given
[09:12.480 --> 09:17.440]  new social security numbers and fake names and citizens are thrown out of
[09:17.440 --> 09:26.560]  section 8 housing and the radical jihadis are put into their place that's
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.160]  happening in Germany that's all over mainstream news and we've confirmed
[09:30.160 --> 09:34.760]  it's happening here in the United States and we have our investigative
[09:34.760 --> 09:40.840]  reporters in the field as we speak to actually show it happening to talk to
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.040]  the victims and more because one thing is to say hey they admit they won't tell
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.440]  governors where these refugees are going or how many there are but another
[09:49.440 --> 09:58.080]  thing to see it for yourself and I point that out because they claim they're
[09:58.080 --> 10:00.840]  doing all this for our safety and our security while they do everything they
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.360]  can to undermine our safety and our security heaven help us this Merrick
[10:05.360 --> 10:12.080]  Garland is a globalist operative par excellence horrible he's anti free
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.040]  speech he's pro-surveillance state he helped write up a bunch of the garbage
[10:17.040 --> 10:23.240]  rulings on torture you name it but you know he's getting chosen because he's
[10:23.240 --> 10:31.280]  anti gun anti right of self-defense what a monstrous creature and they're
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.040]  saying because he's already a federal judge right below the Supreme Court
[10:36.040 --> 10:41.920]  level it was a chief judge for the District of Columbia appeals court
[10:41.920 --> 10:49.080]  again trying to bring back in the gunband he is the perfect person for
[10:49.080 --> 10:52.080]  them to put in there and they're saying since he's already approved by
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.760]  Congress that he can be fast-tracked and placed by Obama and Obama's talking
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.440]  about an emergency appointment claiming that there's an emergency in the court
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.120]  because it's deadlocked four to four so it's a major constitutional crisis the
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.080]  Republicans have a right not to even consider him they should not they're
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.240]  talking about making a deal now because Obama said you can't deny this man you
[11:15.240 --> 11:19.840]  know he's a Republican yeah he's another Rockefeller Republican that's what
[11:19.840 --> 11:23.640]  George Herbert Walker Bush in the 70s when he was running for Congress called
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.680]  himself famously Iraq a fellow Republican from Connecticut nothing against
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.360]  Connecticut but man don't come down to Texas and wear cowboy boots and start
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.080]  talking like this and going to boy and give in Texas a bad name we don't like
[11:38.080 --> 11:44.720]  it we're tired of it so we'll be breaking all of that down Obama just shows
[11:44.720 --> 11:48.720]  Merrick Garland of the Supreme Court Republicans still won't confirm him the
[11:48.720 --> 11:54.000]  Washington Post says even though he's a Republican yeah I don't like go what
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.240]  John Boehner or a Rudolph Giuliani that type of guy that's exactly the type of
[12:03.240 --> 12:11.320]  individual that this guy is and I tell you he's just as bad as Kagan he's just
[12:11.320 --> 12:17.800]  as bad as super mayor her both anti-gun effect he's worse he championed keeping
[12:17.800 --> 12:22.720]  the gun ban in place and then tried to overturn it on record I mean he is a
[12:22.720 --> 12:28.360]  direct enemy of the Second Amendment physically in the courts trying to
[12:28.360 --> 12:34.520]  annihilate it he is for the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms to
[12:34.520 --> 12:41.040]  complete the power monopoly of the state he is a general of victim disarmament he
[12:41.040 --> 12:48.560]  is a master of enslavement he is a king of making individuals defenseless while
[12:48.560 --> 12:56.400]  he sits behind armed guards at federal courthouses in short he is a tyrant and
[12:56.400 --> 13:05.080]  a parasitic bug-eyed monster neocon warmongering piece of filth and an enemy
[13:05.080 --> 13:12.680]  of the Republic in every sense every single one of those anti-gun judges knows
[13:12.680 --> 13:21.720]  full well they're delivering this country into the arms of despotism and
[13:21.720 --> 13:25.600]  there's no surprise there's a huge push to bring down the Second Amendment as
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.040]  well now that's the bad news we'll flesh it out more today the good news is
[13:32.040 --> 13:38.680]  Trump wins big takes Florida Illinois North Carolina Missouri and I saw he and
[13:38.680 --> 13:42.160]  his sons with tears in their eyes we got to pull up some of his victory speech
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.920]  last night because they understood this pushing past the threshold he totally
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.560]  dominated and the spin was oh some of the states weren't winter take all so you
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.720]  know he's still not the clear leader but pundits that were being honest said
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.000]  look any other time by now the entire Republican leadership would say
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.120]  everybody else should drop out get behind Donald Trump and then that should
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.560]  have happened the last you know two rounds ago but they're not they're now
[14:09.560 --> 14:13.920]  just saying no we're going to take it at the convention we're going to steal it
[14:13.920 --> 14:19.440]  and everybody from the Pope to George Soros to the Chinese Communist are back
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.080]  in the news and all these Arab state dictators and in the royalty of Saudi
[14:25.080 --> 14:31.120]  Arabia the fact of the royalty of Saudi Arabia doesn't like Donald Trump is
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.960]  just another total certification he's our man and in the stack I have an
[14:34.960 --> 14:38.680]  article we put out yesterday that had been out for two days no one seemed to

[15:05.760 --> 15:10.240]  got so many feathers in his cap you can't even see him there's so many
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.560]  feathers and sure he said some incendiary things I don't agree with that is pure
[15:16.560 --> 15:22.160]  meat and potatoes for some of the warmongering neocon voters out there but
[15:22.160 --> 15:28.320]  in policy he says no war with Russia pull out of Syria don't back ISIS things
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.800]  like that that's why they hate his guts so let's go over some of the stack most

[35:23.240 --> 35:28.960]  lesson that's what this planetary tyranny is and they're not bringing this
[35:28.960 --> 35:34.840]  in to create order they're bringing it in to create total control towards the end
[35:34.840 --> 35:40.120]  of the age of man and the rise of the merger between humans and machines in
[35:40.120 --> 35:47.200]  their own words Google Ray Kurzweil all of them that's the plan every day you

[35:59.640 --> 36:03.680]  already see technologically developed and set up that's all just an extraction
[36:03.680 --> 36:09.560]  grid to suck the resources and technology and raw material up into the
[36:09.560 --> 36:16.720]  high-tech government corporate reservations that are a breakaway
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.520]  civilization now I've sent that emergency transmission out for the day I'm not
[36:20.520 --> 36:24.400]  gonna go off on a jag about it I just had to say it again because you know that
[36:24.400 --> 36:28.040]  you know the whole show there's a world government it's run by a handful of
[36:28.040 --> 36:32.680]  families and a coterie of billionaires that support them they have an agenda
[36:32.680 --> 36:40.960]  they have a plan they have a worldview they have a a cosmology and we aren't
[36:40.960 --> 36:49.960]  part of the big club to quote the late great George Carlin now let me go ahead
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.440]  and first tell you that I'm gonna put this headline up from Business Insider
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.800]  you can go anywhere you want and read hundreds of different studies going back
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.000]  well over a hundred years when I say hundreds is really thousands of studies
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.440]  on it we'll put it on screen from Business Insider dealing with iodine and
[37:06.440 --> 37:13.240]  it breaks down the fact that quote how adding iodine to salt resulted in a
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.280]  decade's worth of IQ gains for the United States you read the article it
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.600]  boosted when I started putting it in in the 30s 15 points in the Midwest in a
[37:22.600 --> 37:30.200]  federal study within just a decade okay 15 points after an ionized salt was
[37:30.200 --> 37:35.440]  introduced now the IQ since the 70s has dropped again and what's the magic
[37:35.440 --> 37:42.080]  number 10 to 15 points wow take iodine out IQ drops again wow put water in
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.240]  gasoline in your car it's gonna sputter and conk out I mean this this is not
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.160]  rocket science it's you must have it it's a key element they have all these bad
[37:51.160 --> 37:57.480]  mimicers of it chlorine bromide bromine list goes on and on fluoride in the
[37:57.480 --> 38:03.920]  water in the food everywhere this blocks part of it draws it out sucks it out you
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.840]  may go through a big toxic effect you may get an upset stomach or intestines in
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.960]  a couple weeks in fact most people will because it will in my experience once
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.960]  happened to me turn my thyroid back on life changing in full watch life comm
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.000]  survival shield nation I nine X2 the best out there and we discovered this
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.280]  because I got an iodine about four years ago it's five years ago for a bunch of
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.400]  reasons and you couldn't really find good stuff that wasn't bound you couldn't
[38:31.400 --> 38:34.520]  find good stuff that didn't give you stomachache because it was all just
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.400]  basically tied into a bunch of other garbage it was ocean based this is deep
[38:38.400 --> 38:45.920]  earth pure white turns purple and blue on paper not red because real iodine is
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.560]  purple and blue and all I know is give it a shot your support in the broadcast
[38:49.560 --> 38:56.360]  try it for yourself few drops in water every day take it slow because it's

[39:13.880 --> 39:17.560]  don't know to eat fresh fruits and vegetables or they have bad absorption in
[39:17.560 --> 39:21.560]  their guts because their intestines are so dead and there's no flora to break

[40:50.320 --> 40:53.680]  covers up they're screaming Allah Akbar but once they get to court it has to come
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.200]  out because they go yeah I do it and I'll do it again just what white jobs

[41:08.480 --> 41:14.280]  a Canadian or look like a Saudi Arabian whack job to you man hunting Brussels
[41:14.280 --> 41:19.240]  after raid link to Paris attacks refugees defy EU entering Macedonia from
[41:19.240 --> 41:24.760]  Greece just pouring across screaming credible video as Sweden tumbles in
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.200]  school performance government admits poor performance caused by mass
[41:28.200 --> 41:33.680]  immigration yeah I mean at my alma mater they got 230 something people out of
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.880]  Syria and Iraq just last year but they told the state that 200 had been brought
[41:37.880 --> 41:44.720]  in nationally by Obama no it's 200 each school here where I live total cover up
[41:44.720 --> 41:49.160]  on that this is the anti-refugee party that won big victory in Germany the
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.680]  alternative for German party was surging popularity amid Europe's refugee
[41:52.680 --> 41:59.400]  crisis so that's just some of what we're going to be covering on that front
[41:59.400 --> 42:06.080]  today and of course the new nominee for the Supreme Court to be fast-tracked
[42:06.080 --> 42:11.840]  he's the federal judge over DC who tried to defeat DC heller that allows some
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.840]  gun ownership and then tried to overturn it in rulings so he is the
[42:15.840 --> 42:21.160]  consummate man trying to kill the Second Amendment who believes in DC total gun
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.960]  bans and the media is having a debate about whether he's anti-gun or not to
[42:25.960 --> 42:29.560]  keep conservatives in the dark going well he was a first appointed by George
[42:29.560 --> 42:34.960]  Herbert Walker Bush so can't we trust him because you know like John Boehner
[42:34.960 --> 42:42.280]  says he wants Paul Ryan to run now as the as the due sex to defeat Trump but I
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.640]  have the ruling I have his statements on how you wanted to overturn DC Heller he
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.620]  wrote in his opinion that's who's coming for your guides Obama said he
[42:53.620 --> 42:57.120]  nominate somebody conservatives could never say no to see that mind game
[42:57.120 --> 43:03.440]  all right let's go ahead and talk to somebody in my fellow state formerly in
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.640]  Texas FEMA region 6 Michael in Texas you're on the air on Donald Trump go
[43:08.640 --> 43:14.680]  ahead good morning hey buddy hey I just I've been listening to you for four years
[43:14.680 --> 43:21.760]  Alex and you know I just can't believe you fell for the Rothschild script you
[43:21.760 --> 43:26.160]  know they're putting on a show they don't like him the Rothschild's always fun
[43:26.160 --> 43:33.320]  fun both sides the Pindar Evelyn won't allow him to take office to stop their
[43:33.320 --> 43:38.080]  agenda remember how the Rothschild's manipulated the British stock market
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.400]  during the Napoleon British War they control all the stock markets they
[43:42.400 --> 43:46.160]  control the gold exchange they control every government on earth other than
[43:46.160 --> 43:52.840]  Putin because now he's okay but well now let me talk just for a second and then
[43:52.840 --> 43:59.480]  you can come back the Rothschilds don't always fund both sides in major wars in
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.720]  Europe they did and the Rothschilds are kind of the archetype of the
[44:02.720 --> 44:06.520]  international banker and what's turned into globalism and I've made films about
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.920]  it I've exposed it I've talked about it I've covered it and we covered the whole
[44:10.920 --> 44:17.400]  situation with Jean-Claude von Damme coming out and saying this so Trump is
[44:17.400 --> 44:20.640]  different but because they'll act like they're against a candidate sometimes
[44:20.640 --> 44:25.080]  but they won't line up a bunch of money against them and pull out the stops and
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.000]  send mobs of people against them Trump could turn against us Trump has some
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.880]  problems but they legitimately I mean I'm smart enough to decipher this and
[44:35.880 --> 44:41.560]  break this down and I can look at it and I can tell you that Trump is not a fake
[44:41.560 --> 44:46.520]  hope and change guy like Obama who they acted like was anti-establishment and
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.880]  there's just not proof of it the Federal Reserve is giving money against him the
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.480]  Pope is against him the Chinese government's against him the Japanese
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.120]  government's against him Saudi Arabia's against him the former president of
[44:57.120 --> 45:04.400]  Mexico's against him this fear is palpable and is real and Trump symbolizes
[45:04.400 --> 45:11.080]  grassroots awakening and resistance so regardless it's a sign of the awakening
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.040]  and of incumbents being in trouble and of people looking for real mavericks even
[45:16.040 --> 45:24.160]  if they don't totally agree with them so just to throw out these terms I don't
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.160]  think proves the case against Trump go ahead well then we're we're soon gonna
[45:29.160 --> 45:32.720]  find out I mean Obama already came out and said he's never gonna get the
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.760]  presidency so you know they're blatant and in what they're doing now you've
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.480]  already mentioned that it's just all the shams talking us in yes I understand
[45:42.480 --> 45:48.080]  everybody hates them but that's all part of the sham so really so so Obama coming
[45:48.080 --> 45:53.440]  out saying Trump's disqualified I'm God I say who can run for president that's
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.320]  not the arrogance of Obama and the media when they tell us our kids don't belong
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.120]  to us that's not meant to wake us up it's meant to break our will when they
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.280]  tell us we didn't build our business that is it meant to to make us angry it's
[46:06.280 --> 46:09.840]  meant to break our will get to understand they're targeting the younger
[46:09.840 --> 46:15.080]  generation and I I disagree with you I appreciate your call Michael look and
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.280]  you're allowed to disagree with me I'm not mad at you for that and you know
[46:18.280 --> 46:24.960]  maybe I'm wrong but I don't think so because they are legitimately coming
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.280]  after Donald Trump and they don't like the things he stands for which is
[46:29.280 --> 46:35.200]  nationalism and not selling America out he's against TPP he's against NAFTA and
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.040]  get he's against globalism he's against internationalism he's against farm
[46:39.040 --> 46:42.280]  bureaucrats running our lives
[46:42.400 --> 46:48.360]  Jim in FEMA region for what former state of UN Jim North Carolina all right go
[46:48.360 --> 46:53.440]  ahead sir I'm against you and Trump mainly because you won't push cop and
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.240]  court reform you say that we can win in the courts we cannot win in the courts
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.880]  most of us don't have a pot to piss in and when to throw it out so we sure can't
[47:02.880 --> 47:06.480]  afford any freedom all right well let's just stop right there because I don't
[47:06.480 --> 47:10.760]  know what you're talking about so many people will call me and say you don't
[47:10.760 --> 47:13.640]  talk about this you don't talk about that and then I don't I even miss what
[47:13.640 --> 47:18.240]  you're saying what are you talking about with the courts when in the courts we
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.720]  can't win in the courts take what went on the Ferguson they had to get sued by
[47:22.720 --> 47:28.760]  the Department of Justice because they would not reform and that only happened
[47:28.760 --> 47:34.440]  after the town burned down now as far as who to support I support sick
[47:34.440 --> 47:40.720]  temper tyrannous violence the tyrants that's the only way these people get off
[47:40.720 --> 47:43.640]  their hind end and do what they're supposed to do you mean death to
[47:43.640 --> 47:51.640]  tyrants yes most definitely well here's the deal and their minions well a lot
[47:51.640 --> 47:54.760]  of the people always talking about violence I don't see him carrying out
[47:54.760 --> 47:58.160]  they're usually cheerleading for everybody else to carry out violence I'm
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.440]  trying to do everything I can to stop violence their funding black lives matter
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.800]  that has some real beasts but run by very bad people and they're funding the
[48:06.800 --> 48:09.880]  whole establishment right wing movement for police state and they're gonna
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.840]  collide the two together and out of that have the synthesis of what they want
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.320]  the courts have problems and the system has problems but people in Ferguson
[48:20.320 --> 48:23.240]  should get politically involved and run for office and they're now doing that
[48:23.240 --> 48:28.360]  or do things like move out of the town but I don't just sit there and look at
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.040]  Ferguson and then say that you know one side's right or the other side is wrong
[48:32.040 --> 48:37.120]  there were problems on both sides in that situation so there's a reason the
[48:37.120 --> 48:41.520]  establishment wants us to have violent confrontations they believe they can
[48:41.520 --> 48:49.320]  spin that and win that okay what's going on in Chicago is because of and you've
[48:49.320 --> 48:55.080]  covered it very well I feel El Chapo being funded by our government this is
[48:55.080 --> 48:59.200]  going on in many cities they've got the courts they've got the cops we cannot
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.080]  beat them and then they dump the drugs on the streets yes but not all cities are
[49:03.080 --> 49:10.240]  like Chicago most major cities are most major cities are most definitely like
[49:10.240 --> 49:17.640]  Chicago and when I think most major cities are as corrupt as Chicago oh most
[49:17.640 --> 49:22.120]  definitely especially when it comes to the cops in the courts that that's how
[49:22.120 --> 49:27.400]  they police you for profit is well there's no doubt that there's no doubt
[49:27.400 --> 49:30.920]  that there's a lot of revenue generation going on there's no doubt we've got big
[49:30.920 --> 49:35.360]  problems in our whole political system but that is a reflection of the
[49:35.360 --> 49:40.240]  decadence of the American people and the laziness and the fact that we let
[49:40.240 --> 49:45.880]  corruption get into place and all I know is the system wants a violent civil
[49:45.880 --> 49:50.240]  war out of which they bring basically a communist dictatorship with globalist
[49:50.240 --> 49:56.160]  offshore that administer it and so I want to try to stop that and bring back a
[49:56.160 --> 50:00.720]  real alternative to it and have good cities and good states form coalitions
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.840]  try to roll back corruption and bring back prosperity and I think that really
[50:05.840 --> 50:09.960]  is the answer to this but it starts with us individually don't you agree that the
[50:09.960 --> 50:15.120]  corruption is a manifestation of the decadence of the American people no I
[50:15.120 --> 50:20.400]  do not it's a manifestation of the corruption of the establishment well I
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.760]  think the fish rocks from the head but it's a confluence of that sir I mean I
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.680]  mean a lot of the public are really evil servile lazy creatures negative
[50:29.680 --> 50:35.120]  negative our crime is low Jones you know that that's FBI number that's not me
[50:35.120 --> 50:41.320]  saying that that's the fed well it's true that compared to the 1990s it's low the
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.080]  US has someone of a high crime rate compared to places like Switzerland but
[50:45.080 --> 50:48.560]  I would I would say that a lot of that's victimless now because of the Second
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.040]  Amendment it's a complex sociology question but I'm not gonna argue with
[50:54.040 --> 50:57.000]  it we have a very corrupt government all I know is the globalist want a civil
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.120]  war are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army ranger have

[54:36.240 --> 54:42.520]  go to more of you in a moment because I've really studied history I've studied
[54:42.520 --> 54:46.840]  sociology anthropology I've studied the technocracy I've read the books and the
[54:46.840 --> 54:53.720]  writings of the technotronic leaders of the world and I know what their admitted
[54:53.720 --> 54:57.240]  battle plan is and they're so arrogant they said the public so stupid they
[54:57.240 --> 55:00.920]  they're very public about it and now they're they're rolling it out in pop
[55:00.920 --> 55:06.200]  culture the world without humans how great it'll be they're teaching us to
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.000]  hate each other they're teaching us not to stand up for each other and they're
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.040]  teaching us to be divided and conquered and they give the police
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.240]  directives and the bureaucrats directives to eat out our substance so that
[55:18.240 --> 55:21.960]  we then hate them and then that becomes another divide and conquer program as
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.080]  well let me say it this way to the last caller everyone's having their water
[55:27.080 --> 55:31.200]  poisoned everyone's having deadly vaccines pushed on them everyone is
[55:31.200 --> 55:35.160]  having weaponized television aimed at them I don't care if you're black white
[55:35.160 --> 55:41.480]  what color you are if you're a cop a auto plant worker or a farmer you are
[55:41.480 --> 55:46.160]  under attack and the illusion is you can join different parts of this system and
[55:46.160 --> 55:54.600]  be a winner it is a metric scientific mathematical algorithm of tyranny that
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.960]  is extremely sophisticated that can even predict the future now I told you
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.800]  that 18 years ago that's been mainstream news for two years now we know
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.120]  what we're talking about we told you not having gut flores the number one cause
[56:08.120 --> 56:11.480]  of cancer now the federal government comes out with all the top research
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.520]  facilities and says yes it's true they've known all along they're targeting
[56:16.520 --> 56:22.560]  the gut it is a very small group a few thousand people are in on the whole deal
[56:22.560 --> 56:29.800]  okay and through compartmentalization they're rolling it out and so it doesn't
[56:29.800 --> 56:35.080]  help us if let's say all two million police in the country got shot in the
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.200]  back of the head there would just be anarchy and all sorts of problems and
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.560]  they just bring in foreign trips before you talk about killing people you better
[56:43.560 --> 56:47.800]  talk about educating them and if you come over all creepy you come over all
[56:47.800 --> 56:50.600]  angry you come over all weird they're not gonna listen if you come over with
[56:50.600 --> 56:53.760]  light in your eyes and say listen there's a globalist takeover here's the plan
[56:53.760 --> 57:00.040]  people listen they know the truth so all I'm saying is I'm trying to save

[57:19.280 --> 57:24.840]  chills folks it's the devil okay and the churches aren't gonna tell you it is an
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.680]  alien force not of this world attacking humanity like the Bible and every other
[57:29.680 --> 57:35.000]  ancient text says and you can read the Bible it's hiding in plain view folks
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.120]  it's not of this world I don't know exactly what it is or what it's doing
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.440]  but this is not human intelligence okay it's not human intelligence we're
[57:43.440 --> 57:50.120]  facing I refuse to fight with everybody all the stupid racist white people the

[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.040]  North Carolina you're on the air welcome thanks Alex first off I want to say that
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.680]  you got some of the best news out there informationally but there's three or
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.960]  four big reasons I had to vote against Trump number one that comes off the top
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.960]  of my head is the torture comments we can't we can't torture people and he
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:09.200]  reversed that and he reversed that yeah and I hope he sticks to reversing it you
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.720]  know also the Richard Haas he's buddies with Richard Haas well he met with him
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:22.000]  he met with him yeah that's all concerning yes and and also I feel
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.360]  like a big wall you know would just trap us in I believe we got a there's no
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.520]  doubt the wall statements of stunt I mean I mean Mexico has got really great
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.960]  tunnelers and builders and a wall is a joke you need to have a wall in here is
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.000]  just a slowdown you know vehicles and things obviously Mexico has one with
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.740]  Guatemala but what you really have is right on the border you go after folks
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.640]  but you also go after employers and we can bring in guest workers all that but
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.000]  we don't bring in guest workers you know with degrees to get rid of folks that
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.040]  have college degrees here so we have no middle class right right right also I
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.640]  feel like he hasn't talked about in the wars as much as I'd like him to I'm
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.080]  big on that you know personally you know he's tried to stop the wars and so
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.760]  we're not gonna have all these useless wars but we have wars we're gonna win
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.280]  them I hear you I hear you why do you think the establishment is so against
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:24.800]  him then well I think he might be genuine but those things that that I don't
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.720]  like about him I think might be just personal mistakes of him so quietly I
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.040]  kind of hope that he'll win over you know Cruz or anybody else as far as the
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.360]  Republican nominee goes you know but I couldn't vote on him I had to I had to
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.480]  vote on Rand you know I almost voted I thought I was an independent but I forgot
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:52.560]  to change it I almost was gonna go vote on Bernie as a vote against Hillary and
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.880]  you know I don't think he's gonna win but that's kind of you know I've always
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.520]  been feeling it from him I get it I get it you know for me it's the massive
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.480]  attack on Trump the Federal Reserve giving money to defeat him I mean that
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.560]  tells you what you know and I'm people that know him he is his own guy and
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.160]  that's what they hate he isn't part of the oligarchy club now he could be bad
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.160]  the point is we know the globalists are bad so I say throw a wild card in there
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.120]  I appreciate your call mark let's talk to Joe in New York what's your view on

[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.040]  funding a uprising to take over the state and local governments that the feds
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.280]  are going to come in and federalized police we don't need that because the
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.680]  feds are run by foreign interest this is a stealth takeover under the strong
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.600]  cities initiative of the UN sir and so Trump is up there sound like Mr. Law in
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.880]  order because it's so fashionable to shoot cops in the back of the head he's
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.480]  saying hey let's support the cops I found if you just do that in general then
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.160]  the police will actually come over the side of the people most cops I found are
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.160]  not bad people the media that starts it a 7-eleven shopper in Washington state

[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:21.920]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.840]  network and what is the Empire it is a global private banking consortium that
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.080]  controls currency and credit that is trying to establish a planetary world
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.400]  government with computer systems monitoring every human action and taxing
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.800]  all but basically not just human behavior but in the final equation
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.560]  controlling all life on the planet playing God that is the technocrats own
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.720]  admission now Joel Scalzen editor of world affairs briefs can be with us for
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.480]  the balance of the hour getting into the nuclear trigger in North Korea where
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.840]  he believes they will try to start World War three in the future he believes it
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.240]  still five years out four years out why does he think the Russians are pulling
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.640]  out of Syria all the sudden where is that going Trump 2016 the dirty tricks
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.720]  Trump there's a new article out at info wars.com is saying that they'll be
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.600]  rioting if they steal the nomination from him at the RNC the RNC says they're
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.360]  gonna do it really a time of the scales coming off the ice we also have loaded
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.560]  phones with people that quote disagree with Alex Jones about supporting Donald
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.960]  Trump I support Trump because the federal reserves against him the Pope's
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.320]  against him the communist Chinese are against him the Japanese corrupt
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.120]  governments against him the Saudi Arabian governments against him the
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.880]  British leaderships against him you have the former Mexican president against
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.840]  him they're against him because he's a nationalist and he isn't part of the
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:51.120]  inside crew does that mean I trust him no but he is his own man they've got
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.720]  articles out about how he's quote a man in his castle runs things himself
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.520]  doesn't listen to basically anybody that's what scares them so bad and they've
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.560]  got the whole establishment against him now John Boehner the neocon the rhino
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.200]  chief says I want Paul Ryan the new speaker to run against him they are
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:19.080]  desperate this is a real panic by the elite because it's giving a stage to
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.840]  constitutional populism and a revolt against tyranny in my view we'll get
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.120]  Joel's take but first I get a lot of calls about this people asking on the
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.520]  street police officers asked me this too they say well are you for the police or
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.600]  are you against the police or callers will say you're against the police state
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.120]  but you say you know that the police aren't your enemy police are individuals
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.680]  as well just like the military is or school teachers because a school teacher
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.920]  in a school might get caught being a child molester does that mean all the
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:55.240]  other teachers or child molesters the policies police are being given the
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.840]  militarization the draconian programming is a problem it's meant to cause a
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.920]  reaction of fear by the public then the cops get scared and the answer is get
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.160]  more totalitarian this is a program and the White House admits they've got
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.920]  black lives matter out attacking you know promoting their their their founding
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:22.160]  inspiration is in Cuba a cop killer to start the destabilization of the country
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.400]  so the central government run by foreign interest can come in and take over the
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.520]  states and locales and they call it the strong city's initiative of the UN they
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.600]  have the UN monitoring in Texas and Arizona in New York and DC they're
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.520]  establishing offices and it isn't a UN takeover the globalists the Rockefellers
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.840]  created the UN to transfer power to just like TPP so this is part of a larger
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.320]  plan I don't want civil unrest I don't want a civil war if they activate the
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.680]  socialists to start burning down cities I don't want people to go out and join in
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.560]  in it or fight them you got to defend yourself you're gonna be called terrorist
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.120]  when you do you come to burn down my house I'm gonna you know defend myself so
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.440]  people are like all the cops are revenue generating the cops are out of control and
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.640]  you know why are you for them I'm not the globalist or waging war against
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:17.680]  humanity and against the nation-state and against the rule of law and so I say
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.120]  if anybody's trying to kill you you have a right to defend yourself I don't care
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.160]  who they are but to make the revolution against tyranny about the police the
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.120]  lowest level when in my experience out of all of government the military
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:38.240]  officers are the most away the mid-grade officers and the special forces then
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.920]  the regular military I say the army and the Marines are the most away Navy
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.240]  statistically from talking to them aren't as away but more than general public
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.680]  then I talked to feds I talked to local police I talked to all over the country
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.120]  they are more awake than the general public because they're in the middle of
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.400]  it we need to try our best to not run around a camouflage and talk about a
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.600]  war with them but to wear suits and ties to get elected local office to go
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.160]  speak out to get involved to support good cops and go after bad cops legally
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.760]  and lawfully as defenders of the Republic we're the champions of freedom
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:16.520]  we're Americana we we carry the ideas that founded the great nation that's why
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  we're the enemy and all the federal training manuals and the police and the
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.200]  feds except for the political cadres know we're right now and are joining us
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.440]  and are ready to wake up and are ready to take action that's why they want to
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.640]  start a civil war a light soft civil war where they go we got to have police
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.840]  state because the black lives matter and the Patriots and that's why they
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.240]  engineered the tragedy that happened in Oregon we told you where that was going
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.400]  Joel Scousen told you now I don't know his complete views on this but for me
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.880]  this is common sense we're having a major effect politically we're going to
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.480]  win the long-term fight for liberty we may lose battles and things are gonna
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.160]  get a lot worse before they get better this is a this is a this is the devil
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.520]  we're fighting folks it is spiritual make no mistake the churches are pretty
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:10.640]  much captured but we need to not be lured into a civil war because that's meant
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.040]  to destabilize the country further and then bring in the multinational global
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.680]  system later now Joel Scousen I want to get into Trump I want to get into what's
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.720]  happening overseas we'll do all of that but I want to talk about the the geo
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:29.480]  engineering that we see not of the planet but but political geo political
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:35.040]  engineering domestically with these battle lines the future battle space
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.400]  they're trying to set up if we look at the lines of divide and conquer we can
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.240]  see the future strategy can you speak to this if you agree disagree augment and
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:51.240]  what we need to do to try to really promote liberty and freedom as the true
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.760]  birthright of Americans it is and not some alien evil program
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.920]  well Alex I agree with what you said about police unfortunately you know the
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.360]  police abuse and aggressiveness in terms of use of lethal force has grown
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:17.240]  exponentially I'm afraid that the number of a good policeman versus bad
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.280]  policeman has been disbalanced and because of the bringing in more
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.120]  mercenaries more military people into the police forces and then arming them
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.600]  with SWAT teams I mean when you have DE agents coming in with with face masks on
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.880]  and won't reveal their names and they come in with a SWAT type thing to to go
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.760]  into a nurse's office you know to confiscate all the computers there's
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.560]  no need for that and unfortunately the judges are not calling the police to
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:51.200]  account almost every time that a policeman you know is is guilty of
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.000]  excessive use of force they get a justifying statement from the police
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.920]  investigation as and if it gets into the courts unless there's evidence
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.520]  videotape evidence showing the abuses massive and unjustified it's very very
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.720]  difficult to to get police to be prosecuted and it needs you know we
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.120]  could get a we could swing this pendulum the other way if you get some judges to
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.320]  actually sanction the police very very strongly you know for excessive use of
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.480]  force it would put a chilling effect on the use of force and then you wouldn't
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.880]  have this kind of bravado talk that goes on in the locker room in the police
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.400]  force about taking down people racial epithets and other types of things you
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.440]  know the good guys in the cops they can't compete with those loudmouth guys
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.160]  and so they tend to go into the background especially when the police
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.240]  chiefs generally you know police chiefs in every major city of the United States
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.120]  are corrupt they are owing to the establishment for their position and
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:53.440]  they don't justify yes the good cops who are you agree that we're seeing an
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.640]  awakening in the police I mean I'm certainly seeing it and so all I'm
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.120]  saying is the police seem to know upholding the Constitution doing the
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.600]  right thing standing up for what's right and also pointing out the larger
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.320]  globalist program I have found is a way to have police actually get it and in
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.880]  some cases repent of what they've been sucked into do you see what I'm saying
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.480]  yeah I do see what you're saying I'm trying to point out though that they
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.200]  don't have a voice you know the loudmouth people just like in public
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.800]  schools you know it's the guys with the hyper attitudes that control the peer
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.680]  pressure and in a police force and things the soft-spoken mild manner people
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.680]  who don't want to use excessive force they don't get upset and yell and
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.080]  scream at the other guys it's the reverse they try to object to what's going on
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.960]  and they get crucified by their fellow officers as a weenie you know as somebody
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.160]  who's weak so I'm saying they don't have the same power of voice as the strong
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.800]  men type you know sure what about warning the police though of the plan to
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.360]  overthrow local government I mean that's clearly a globalist plan when do you
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.160]  think they're they're planning to try to implement this because clearly they
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.880]  wouldn't be going to all this work if they weren't planning something
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.640]  absolutely right they are planning it but I've long said Alex that I don't
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.080]  think that they're going to foment a civil war prior to a war you know World
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.360]  War 3 is coming and they're gonna hold all their cards all this stuff is
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.800]  preparation I mean once war starts they can literally shut down this country
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.560]  take away civil liberties start throwing people into all of this is the
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.960]  preparation for that we'll get to it at the bottom of the hour and and get into
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.320]  the geopolitical because that's why you're here but let's let's let's look
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.400]  at Trump and the open Federal Reserve coming out against him with money
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.920]  Soros panicking the Pope I mean I want to list it all again in your expert
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.800]  opinion I mean you're a really smart guy from a Marine Corps officer fighter
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.240]  pilot bomber of Vietnam you know your your of course your uncle wrote the
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.880]  naked communist and pretty much launched so much the liberty movement we see
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.560]  today so you're a insider when it comes to all this understanding it you've
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.280]  tried to lead the charge in DC to get real conservatives elected led some of
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.320]  the biggest national groups on that front so saying that for new listeners
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.800]  I mean I know who you are you're a top expert on strategic relocation looking
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.360]  at that where are we geopolitically in the world what's happening with the
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.080]  Trump situation and all these foreign interest weighing in and what do you
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:27.880]  expect them to do at the convention and beyond Alex we are seeing virtual
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.160]  political warfare now erupting in the United States against Donald Trump as I
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.840]  had long projected in my world affairs brief the establishment intended not to
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.840]  elect Hillary Clinton but to give us a controlled Republican and then Mitt you
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.440]  know just as Mitt Romney entered the and threw a curveball to the
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.480]  establishment in 2012 or actually 2008 2012 and even though he'd been over
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.280]  backwards to police he said they didn't want him they didn't have enough dirt on
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.560]  him he's become much more of a shill for the establishment lately than even he
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:07.000]  was in 2012 it's like Nick Richard Nixon after being crucified over Watergate
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.280]  spent the rest of his life bending over backwards trying to get into the good
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.480]  graces of the globalists that's how I see Mitt Romney but Donald Trump as you
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.960]  very well put out is his own man that's both a plus and a negative for
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.720]  conservatives I mean he truly is a populist he's got a marvelous ability
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.680]  to read the pulse of the nation and say look there's a lot of problems and I'm
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.640]  gonna go out against it unfortunately not being schooled in and true
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.880]  conservative ideology or libertarian ideology makes the mistakes and he
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:41.760]  will make mistakes but we can tell by the fervor with which the establishment
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.560]  was out to get Donald Trump including I think rigging the vote in Ohio to get
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.920]  John Kasich elected I mean you don't go with a 15-point change in the polls in
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:56.680]  a week's period of time without manipulation occurring and that's what
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:00.600]  happened to get Kasich they're headed for a broker convention that's the only
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:04.560]  where they're gonna stop Donald Trump now but I think Donald Trump was gonna
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.560]  get at least a thousand delegates I don't think Kasich is gonna get hardly
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.600]  anymore Cruz is going to be the main challenger to Trump but they don't want
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.840]  Cruz either you know that's the point is that they don't have it they can't just
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:24.000]  stop Trump and hand it to Cruz because Cruz is not controlled as well he has
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.040]  that social conservative point of view on against abortion and against gay
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.560]  marriage that they cannot tolerate because it's clear they've been holding
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.720]  their nose hoping he'll knock Trump out but they don't like him either that's
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:42.080]  right now Kasich can't get there and John Kasich doesn't have any charisma he
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.440]  just just a spoiler correct yeah he's just there's a spoiler he's just there
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.760]  to take votes away and they had to I think manipulate the election the
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.440]  electronic voting machines in in Ohio to get him that way and it probably will
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.880]  work as I pointed out in the world affairs brief they can stop him from
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.720]  getting the 1237 but even if he's close even if he's with a hundred if they
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.960]  deny him there's going to be a revolution in the party against the
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.840]  establishment you know Marco Rubio after he bowed out yesterday said we need a
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:17.440]  new establishment in the Republican Party as if he were the one to lead a
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.560]  new establishment I mean which is a he said totally you know bought out to the
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.120]  establishment but there is no way the establishment is going to allow some
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.880]  pseudo establishment unless it's in the guise of a Paul Ryan it's very telling
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:37.280]  that Ryan and Romney did file papers with the FPC in January in order so that
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.840]  if there is a broken convention and they're asked to save the party that
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.480]  they would be in a legal position exactly and of course as you know Boehner
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.520]  came out today the former speaker and said Paul Ryan should run so they're
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.800]  wow do you think they're they're that reckless I mean they're saying they're
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.960]  going to do it they're preparing the public they're in the New York Times
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.480]  saying we're going to steal it we're going to take it we're going to broker
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.880]  it and actually put a Paul Ryan in in front of the entire popular vote with no
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.440]  delegates they're really that crazy yeah they're desperate I mean this is true
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:14.160]  political warfare we're seeing remember that Paul Ryan has come out as well
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.720]  today's in saying just like Romney's denying you know I'm not going to run for
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.360]  president in no way but the fact that they filed for it means that they are
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:27.080]  holding open that possibility and it will have to be a massive draft movement
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.600]  but you know look at it you've got two-thirds of the Republican Party
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.880]  behind Trump or Cruz both of those are going to be disenfranchised in this
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.320]  convention couldn't those two make a deal and actually join forces I think they
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.480]  could you know it's been a little bit they poisoned the water a little bit by
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.200]  some of the bad blood that's gone through the you know calling him lying Ted and
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.680]  and Ted attacking crew but you know Cruz is very very magnanimous he's able to
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:57.200]  turn around at a at a buttonhole and say yeah I accept this guy I think they
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.960]  could make a deal with Cruz and I'll tell you a Trump-Cruz combination would
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.520]  probably be unbeatable in terms of the Tea Party Republicans absolutely for
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.240]  those that don't know I mean getting into your pedigree it's pretty
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.120]  amazing you headed up some of the real national conservative groups that
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.440]  actually tried to save the country earlier and warned of all this 30 years
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:18.600]  ago 20 years ago you've been in the conventions you know you've run
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.360]  national chairmanship of some of the biggest organizations out there so you
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:28.320]  know the inside baseball what do you expect to see then at the convention and
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.640]  then if he gets past that what will Hillary try there's the whole
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.680]  assassination card but then doubling back to the inside baseball what do you
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.640]  expect them to be coming to Trump and saying and doing I know he did meet with
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.040]  the head of the CFR but then after that the CFR head actually came out and made
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.400]  bad comments about him so I'm told from a little bird that meeting didn't go so
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.960]  well I don't think it did either I mean Trump is generally cordial
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.640]  he really isn't very savvy about the conspiracy issues that we're dealing
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.960]  with the ultimate globalist control of both political parties and he did meet
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.000]  with Richard Haas the head of the CFR and he even said you know I'm going to
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.560]  name Richard Haas as one of my foreign policy advisers which threw up a lot of
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.680]  red warning flags with conservatives as it should but I think he was just being
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.040]  nice Haas did not reciprocate he came out and continued to attack the CFR as
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:29.840]  dead and set against Trump as president what I think conservative is not to get
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.240]  too excited about is the concept of free delegates it's true that all the people
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.080]  have dropped out included Ruby all those delegates are now free on the first
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.520]  ballot to vote any way that they want but I can tell you that the state
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.680]  Republican Party chairmen ships are all establishment Republicans even in the
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.080]  conservative states like Utah and Idaho and that means that they will pick
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.520]  establishment delegates to go to that was about to say we've seen that with
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.640]  with Ron Paul in multiple states and at the convention where they just ignore
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.040]  the delegates that already pledged and claim there for somebody else and even
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.520]  in Nevada they shut down the convention when it looked like Ron Paul delegates
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.320]  were going to get elected to go to the convention they will not tolerate this so
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  I don't have any confidence that once you open up the convention that they're
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.240]  going to vote their conscience as conservatives said they're not going to
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.160]  vote their conscience most of them are going to be like superdelegates in the
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.120]  Democratic Party very much controlled by the head party leaders anything be done
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.400]  about this I don't think so you know the Republican Party is controlled by the
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.760]  establishment at the RNC level they they write the rules at the convention and
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:44.040]  they're going to direct this broken convention now let me just say I think
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.960]  it's still a toss-up whether or not they're going to allow Trump to get
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.720]  the nomination or not remember if they don't if they if they deny Trump and
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.520]  Cruz they're going to have a rebellion in the party and there's going to be an
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.160]  independent movement Trump himself may run as an it's going to destroy the
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.840]  Republican Party and they're going to hand the election to Hillary if they
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.120]  allow Trump to go through and get the nomination they're going to hand the
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:15.600]  election to Hillary in other words I don't see any way of escaping the fact
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.600]  that we're going to get a Hillary Clinton now that's a major change for
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.120]  the establishment they're not gonna let Trump yeah so they're now switching you
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.560]  said two years ago they're gonna go with the Republican they were clearly doing
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.360]  that they were getting ready to indict her they needed to but now they're
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.400]  they're stopping that I guess they're gonna just try to move to try to get a
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:38.080]  Hillary in is the plan steal it from the Republicans even mr. Connellus said we
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.040]  don't care we're gonna drop them like a hot rock we're gonna let Hillary in again
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.640]  the arrogance why do they even admit it when it's gonna politically hurt him so
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.960]  bad unless they want to kill the Tea Party movement taking over the Republican
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.280]  Party it's kind of like bombing an oil well that's on fire to knock the fire
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:57.680]  out they're so desperate they're willing to blow up the party taking over the
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.680]  country and blow up their own power because they are so bought and paid for
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.960]  and are really minions of the globalist yeah I think that's absolutely accurate
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.120]  it's very sad to say but they would rather blow up the Republican Party than
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.080]  let a Trump win or a Cruz win win now the only caveat to this of this Hillary
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.880]  winning of either or whether Trump gets the nomination or they deny it to him
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:26.280]  if they do not do and give a Paul Ryan somebody I don't think Romney would work
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.160]  and Romney has created so much bad blood he's got such an establishment stamp of
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  on him now for having how did they get him to do that he didn't do that four
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:42.680]  years ago it just so nasty well you know I've watched Romney since then and he's
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:48.840]  had several big party meetings at his home he's been lavished as you can be a
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.960]  broker you can be an influence to the party you know this is something you
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.240]  brought up I think last week when you talked about the dichotomy of Mormons
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:01.120]  you have conservative Mormons like myself who are died in the world
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.760]  constitutionalists and libertarians and you have these mainstream Mormons like
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.640]  or clear on the other side like Harry Reid or Brent Scowcroft Henry Kissinger's
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.880]  advisor you have you know Mitt Romney the dichotomies explained by the fact that
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.520]  you know the Mormons to a large extent came from a persecuted background
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:24.000]  frankly it was an anti-federal government background because the trouble
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.200]  government did not protect oh this is this is important stay there only be a
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.760]  few minutes on this then shift gears into geopolitics and the Russians in
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.640]  World War three with North Korea and the Russians threatening to quote invade
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.160]  North Korea they don't stop threatening to nuke everybody Joel Scowze and the

[01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:02.680]  network. In a rather bizarre statement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.560]  has said that the U.S. didn't lose a single person in Libya which is to say
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.520]  the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.760]  Christopher Stevens now Libya is perfect isn't it Clinton said Libya was a
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.000]  different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person we didn't
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.120]  have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.480]  NATO Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11th
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.920]  2012 of the diplomatic special mission compound and CIA annex in Benghazi the
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.920]  left ambassador Christopher Stevens foreign management officer Sean Smith
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:44.200]  and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead there's even a movie
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.840]  out about it called 13 hours and this isn't the first time Hillary has had a
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.160]  selective memory but what difference doesn't make you can find more reports

[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:21.200]  it's a sophisticated shell operation a bait and switch where they're really
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:25.960]  attacking him because they know that we'll then supporting no folks they
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.560]  have a dossier on him they know he makes his own decisions he could be evil and
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.400]  they'd still be against him because they want to run someone that's how these
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:39.280]  globalists operate where they're all in the shadows the political parties attack
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.480]  each other we're gonna go back to Joel Scowze in the World Affairs Brief.com

[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:03.200]  shut down drudge world that daily because they're scared to death folks more

[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:15.440]  states to the fact that we're already pretty much in the beginnings a proto
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:21.000]  world government it's game over they want to just slide this thing in under

[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.720]  censor us all right I'm gonna go back to Joel Scowles and Joel let's get into the
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.840]  Russia situation and more but you were getting you were getting into I guess a
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.000]  comment a few weeks ago where I said so many people fighting the New World
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.920]  Order and the grassroots most effective informed people I run into our
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:53.760]  Mormons but then I look to DC and I see Harry Reid I see you know some of these
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.600]  folks and I was saying what is the dichotomy what is the paradigm there and
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:01.000]  you got interrupted by the break breaking that down because so many founders of
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.920]  the anti-New World Order movement who really did the original research in the
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.280]  40s and 50s were Mormons I mean I'd say probably the majority of them and then
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:13.920]  you now see Mormons helping bring in the New World Order at the top so what's
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:19.360]  happening there well it starts in the historical background of Mormons being
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.320]  a persecuted religious minority in the United States they didn't get help from
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.240]  the federal government they moved they were driven out of Missouri and Illinois
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:34.120]  to the and they colonized the Great Salt Lake area which was just a vast desert
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:39.680]  made it blossom as a rose and they even fought a war against the Mormons under
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.720]  President Buchanan the Mormon War where they took up arms against the federal
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.280]  arena guerrilla campaign to stop the army from coming in and occupying Utah so
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:53.760]  the background of Mormons is extremely conservative it's very much pro-constitution
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.400]  their modern scriptures and the Doctrine and Covenants talk about the
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:03.800]  Constitution being inspired of God and so there's this basic background so I
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:10.920]  would say prior to 1950s over 95% of Mormons were very very very conservative
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.160]  and we even had a president of the church Ezra Tav Benson one of the
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.560]  champions of the conservative movement in the United States under the Eisenhower
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.720]  administration as an apostle he was secretary of agriculture but there was a
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:30.080]  war going on at that time between a few liberals that got into the church higher
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.920]  leadership from Canada who were socialists attacking apostle Benson there
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.520]  was kind of a little men in war going on after Benson became the prophet and
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.280]  after he died the church kind of defaulted into a mode of seeking acceptance
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.040]  in the world kind of as a backlash to all of the anti-mormon stuff that was
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:55.120]  going on and it's still going on to a certain extent the point is the Mormons
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.200]  you know view them so look we're good people we're family oriented we have
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.360]  family values we have health values we need to be accepted as mainstream people
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:08.680]  and not persecuted and so there was this bend over backwards to try to gain
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.280]  acceptance in the world mostly happening during the leadership of Gordon
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.240]  B. Hinckley we had many interviews with Mike Wallace and other people a time
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.840]  magazine US News wrote favorable articles about the church and its wealth
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.320]  private welfare system and so the Mormons in general who were still
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.400]  generally conservative said wow this is great to be accepted as establishment
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:37.200]  people as mainstream people and it kind of was an intoxicating thing what's
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.120]  there have always been a few Mormons who have been liberals who have been
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.720]  tended towards socialism as there isn't any Christian denomination because you
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.720]  know you can interpret Christ as being for the people and for the poor and
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.760]  therefore you can misinterpret that as it's okay for government then to give
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:01.240]  welfare and you know to the poor which in doctrine the Mormon church doesn't
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:08.440]  believe in but unfortunately because of this leadership in the past 15 20 years
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.120]  trying to gain acceptance in the world they have padded on the back any Mormons
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.120]  who have made it in the political realm who have made it like Mitt Romney or Harry
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.440]  Reid so it's a classic takeover to the World Council of Churches like we've
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:25.640]  seen other denominations Protestants and others going along with the system as
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.560]  well it's just a takeover well it's not a takeover in the sense that you have a
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:34.000]  lot of true anti-christians getting in and communist even got into the name
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.400]  World Council of Churches and National Council of Churches it is a willing
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:43.720]  submission or willing suppression of your anti-government past in the Mormon
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.880]  Church because you so desire to be accepted by the world that's the danger
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.600]  in other words I'm not saying that the leaders are actually bad people they're
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.960]  not they haven't sold out to the new world order they just simply want they
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.440]  are trying to coexist with the federal government said I have a war with it but
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.320]  the federal government itself has been taken over by multi-nationals now
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.440]  speaking of war physical war geopolitically you're an expert on this
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.840]  where are we right now Russia comes out and says North Korea you keep threatening
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:17.080]  to nuke Seoul you keep threatening to nuke you know Manhattan Kim Jong-un we
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:21.240]  may have to invade of course they have a small border with North Korea unprecedented
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.040]  statement but that is indoctrin that if you're being attacked or threatening
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.840]  nukes you know they said it's unacceptable they're foreign ministry
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.320]  now all the sudden Putin two days ago announces the pullout except for the
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.640]  two bases they already had of their main force offensively with a ceasefire
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.040]  what's the inside baseball on this Joel Scousen well this is a very important
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.480]  thing to understand remember that North Korea is full of bluster they are
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.200]  claiming much more than they can possibly have they do have missiles that can
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.520]  reach California they do not have missiles that we can reach New York so
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.240]  they're bluster about we can nuke New York is false they have not tested a
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:06.000]  single long-range nuclear missile with a warhead as Russia and China have as the
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.080]  United States has there's never been a test they've had ground tests of nuclear
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:13.920]  but that doesn't mean that they have miniaturized nuclear weapons sufficient
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.640]  to put on a missile to be able to launch deep into the United States that
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.080]  isn't even a viable strategy for North Korea because if they did so acting
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.040]  alone without Russian China they would get annihilated by the United sure I
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.360]  understand that it's bluster what is it to hold people hostage for more aid more
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.840]  money certainly but you've always said though if there's a nuclear exchange on
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.320]  the Korean Peninsula you got one day to get out of US cities you believe that
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.720]  will be the detonator for World War three yes I believe that it's a trigger
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.240]  bend but I don't think it's one day I think it's about a week in other words
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:52.280]  if you see an actual invasion and I don't think it will start nuclear even
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.520]  with North Korea there are no dong missiles the intermediate range missile
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.880]  that's the one that they might use to soften up but I don't think they'll
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.840]  start nuclear they would start conventional remember both North Korea
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.280]  is a client state of Russia and China particularly China now and they don't
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:13.160]  want to be viewed as starting the war nuclear they want to wait and induce a
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:17.560]  US nuclear retaliation in North Korea and the way you do that you have an
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:22.160]  overwhelming invasion of the South and the only way you can stop a two million
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.360]  man army versus a quarter million man army and 15,000 US troops is to use
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.360]  tactical nuclear weapons and then China can come out say oh you started it you
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.480]  know you had first use of nuclear weapons then they can justify their
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.040]  long-plan preemptive nuclear strike on the United States military which is the
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.440]  way they went so they will not allow North Korea to go off the reservation
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.760]  until Russia and China are ready and that's why I still say it's into the
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.160]  next decade sure is that why Russia and China though have been making the
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:58.520]  strongest threats ever to North Korea that's right a lot of it remember they
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.560]  do have direct control over North Korea Kim Yong-um is a young immature person
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.800]  he's not actually running the country he's the front man but it's very important
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:12.360]  to understand that the motive here and letting Russia and letting Kim Yong-um
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:18.000]  bluster so much is they want to keep the West off guard the you the North
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.600]  Koreans will be threatening every year every six months every three months and
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.320]  even occasionally doing small attacks in North Korea so the US will not know
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.640]  when the real attack is coming everything looks like a bluff it's kind of
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.680]  like the sky is falling every month and so you just say ho hum it's like the
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.320]  Pentagon threatened and did drills over a hundred times to invade Panama so they
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.440]  stood down when the real invasion came that's exactly right and that's the game
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.360]  that the Russians and Chinese and the North Koreans are using but there will
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.880]  not be any separate North Korean attack and that's why we have all these urban
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:53.320]  warfare drills here is preparing the military and the public so when they
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:57.440]  order the real attack oh we already saw a hundred drills exactly this is a long
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.720]  term strategy you're going back to Sun Tzu in China and feigning weakness and
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:06.440]  and doing many multiple feints but you know what's happening in Syria with
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.520]  Russia is the most important story everybody was caught off guard including
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.680]  the globalist because Russia just out of the blue Monday says we're withdrawing
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:19.080]  from Syria and by Tuesday half of their aircraft had flown out and by Wednesday
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.400]  another half of the aircraft and so people say what's going on here and even
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:31.480]  I was caught unawares I think the excuse that Putin gave that mission
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:34.560]  accomplished that we've really accomplished what we had here is not
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.800]  true terrorism is not it has been diminished certainly the Assad regime
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.320]  the Syrians with Hesbillars sure so what's behind that he goes in out of the
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  blue then then he pushes them back some but hasn't as you said defeated them and
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:53.920]  then suddenly pulls out wasn't the Saudi threat to invade with Turkey a month
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:57.520]  ago that finally had Russia say look we're gonna go ahead and pull out of
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:03.080]  here into clear victory no that was a bluff the Turkish invasion and has
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.040]  not and is still ongoing as aimed at the Kurds and the Saudi invasion really
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.000]  was a lot of hype created by Hal Turner his new Super Station 95 still a
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  disinformation outfit as it was when he worked for the FBI but you know they
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.720]  claimed that there was 350,000 troops masked in an exercise there were not
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.200]  those were the total numbers of troops that all the shirts let me ask you this
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.920]  question then let me ask you this key question why do you think or if we don't
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:35.920]  know yet why do you think put in suddenly pulling out I think it's because of
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.360]  budgetary reasons I think it's very expensive to run that war they needed
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.840]  combat experience they got that combat experience but this was bleeding them out
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:49.040]  about so it's basically they had a budget and it's a giant war game that's
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.240]  right now that said they've got all their infrastructure set back in they can
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.880]  fly back in in two days just like they left and so if this thing gets out of
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:03.280]  hand again it's odds it looks good we did a peace deal we believe NATO and
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.960]  everybody's we even pulled out and then you kept attacking and boom they're
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.280]  only an hour away right back into their bases that's right and it provides them
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.840]  a lot of cover he needs good press and Putin is getting a lot of good press the
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:20.360]  peace talks are going forward Assad by the way is much strengthened not only in
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.120]  the ground troops area but his Air Force has been replenished and strengthened
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.680]  by Putin and so expect that the Assad the Syrian Air Force will continue the
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:34.160]  airstrikes as needed you're saying is this is another victory for Putin
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.280]  absolutely Putin is not a good guy eventually he's a planning on tacking
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.280]  the West with China but he's got several years of building and construction to go
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.320]  on he's not in a hurry that's why he didn't retaliate against Turkey when they
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:51.720]  shot down one of the aircraft he's not ready to take on NATO and so this is a
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.880]  major so you really think the Russians really plan on a sneak attack against the
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:59.840]  angle American establishment I mean I mean I know the globalists are digging
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.600]  in like never before they believe it's coming but I mean this is just so
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:08.480]  crazy what are they gonna do to push Russia into that well it's you know
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.320]  first of all the major aspect that they've been working on all these years
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.040]  is creating an image of the West is the bully of the world we're still doing
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:21.040]  that the West is hated and so Russia is continuing to cultivate where the good
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.360]  guy we're coming up against the globalists we're stopping their juggernaut
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:28.560]  around there the Russians and Chinese will attack when they're ready and I'm
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.800]  not sure the US is capable of provoking them into it but certainly they
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.280]  continued neocon agenda the warfare which sadly you know I'm afraid I know
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:43.240]  Ted Cruz would continue in that having all those neocon advisors Trump may do
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.920]  that as well with this right stay there I want to come back with Joel Scowls and

[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:12.040]  got people have been holding for 45 minutes over from the last hour 50
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.680]  minutes who disagree with me they want to go after Donald Trump I want to just
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:19.640]  hear why and then get Joel Scowse's comment maybe Joel can go five minutes
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:25.240]  the next hour as we get to five or six of these but separately when you look at
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.400]  the will of elites throughout history try to conquer the world they'll destroy
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.040]  their own empires and try to do it the only difference is nuclear weapons now
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:41.240]  today and other weapons that could destroy our planet so I just hope and
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.680]  pray that we can get out of globalism real quick question I'm gonna call Joel
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:51.840]  as world government gets sold as a good thing as they start announcing it they
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:55.720]  are having the problem that you and your uncle and myself and Ron Paul and Barry
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:01.200]  Goldwater and countless others John Burt society forever warned of this we've
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  been proven right we were going off their own documents it's not like we just
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:08.600]  kind of got it right we're dead on our credibility surging the system wants to
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.000]  censor us but that's not gonna work at least short term how are they gonna get
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.600]  this world government in because from all my research aren't they about 15
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:21.320]  years behind so they're trying to rush this doesn't doesn't rushing things
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:26.840]  mean you'll probably only fall apart quicker well they can't afford to let
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.000]  things fall apart right now and that's why I'm not predicting as good me and
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.360]  economic collapse because they would get the blame they would know to the hour
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.400]  that the Fed pulled the money supply and created the atmosphere for economic
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.960]  collapse I believe the way that they get this remember there's a lot of
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:48.640]  resistance to this slow move into globalism look at the Brexit movement
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.280]  in England they're gonna have real trouble keeping England from bolting you
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.760]  know in the European they have the liberal mayor of London who's like a rockstar
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.280]  saying we want out of the EU I mean it's just incredible yeah even the
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.200]  economists and other people are coming out or the telegraph not the economists
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.260]  which is a globalist organization but the telegraph is coming out against the
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:13.160]  EU and against the sovereignty so that's why they're gonna have a third
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:18.400]  world war remember this is a very crucial thing they cannot they want it they
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.440]  are behind they want this war now but they can't get it now they have to wait
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:27.240]  until Russian China attack they can't directly provoke the war otherwise it
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:30.200]  looks right to you as they've got to have world government just like they set
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.760]  up the League of Nations after World War I stage World War II set up the
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:37.200]  players wound up the Japanese and Hitler and didn't controlling folks but set
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.280]  them up had their codes had spies inside manipulating them that's been
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:46.080]  declassified now World War III finally brings in the final world government so
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:49.200]  it never happens again Joel and then what do they do once their world
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.400]  governments in place what's their end game but let me first of all answer the
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.520]  key way in which they're going to get global government remember you talk
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.800]  about nuclear war destroying the world in fact it won't destroy the world they
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.040]  know that Russian China is only planning on attacking US military and
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.080]  communication targets and then try to blackmail the West into submission they
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.640]  don't want to destroy the world it's going to be a limited preemptive nuclear
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.920]  strike against missile fields and military no I understand and the global
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:17.920]  throw out the secret weapons but let me ask you this question but what the first
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.720]  remember the globals then have the excuse if the US military is being taken
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.120]  out we're defenseless we have to join a militarized global government in order to
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.400]  prosecute this war that's how we get into the global government and then all
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.680]  right absolutely but we're going to break we'll take a few calls on the side
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.440]  but let me just ask you this question then Putin I know for a fact I mean does
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.720]  watch clips of the show is aware of what we're doing that they have a lot of TV
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.640]  shows in Russia now that basically you know talk about the new world order
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.760]  global government I know you'll say he's doing that for credibility but if the
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:50.040]  Russian government's pretty smart you know you're smart they're smart too they
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.960]  play third-dimensional chess don't they because we're exposing and others are
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.760]  credible people that you know go back 50 something years in the fight don't they
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:05.760]  understand that they're being set up they know the theory they've read my
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:09.560]  material they have people who read you know your material they think but they
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.600]  they it's in their DNA they've got to take down the West remember there are
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.440]  three global predator centers the new American or the Anglo-American globalist
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:23.240]  the Russians and the Chinese and they're all separately I think there's all
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:27.520]  basically a satanic promise given to each of them that they're gonna win it's in
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:32.680]  their DNA that's right so it's down to the three predator you know generals to
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:36.760]  fight it out to be given the power over the world government and to be they
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:40.000]  can make God on earth that's what the elite breakers all of them that's the
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.440]  promise everyone's being given join this live forever get away with everything

[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:41.440]  all right I got loaded phones here and our guess has to leave in about five
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.040]  minutes but I'll come back and take the rest of them too but let's go to Jeremy
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:48.680]  J. West, Steven, Switchblade and others, Joel Scalzen, Editor-in-Chief of World
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:52.640]  Affairs Brief.com is our guest you're not going to find better information I
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.040]  don't think out there that's what we have him on routinely we appreciate him
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:01.160]  joining us Jeremy in Kansas you say you're against Trump tell us why yes so
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.720]  listen here's the situation it's definitely an authentic populist uprising
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:11.360]  on both controlled party sides for Trump on on the right and for Bernie on the
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:16.320]  left at the same time we know about controlled opposition and just because a
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:19.920]  so-called elite are against something doesn't mean that it's good and
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.160]  actually what it actually looks what's going on is that Trump is meant to play
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:30.640]  the role of a pseudo-fascist stalking horse on the right to get Hillary
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.280]  Clinton elected I went out and spoke to the Bernie supporters and they don't
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.280]  want to vote of most of them don't want to vote for Hillary Clinton and yet some
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.840]  of the rhetoric that's coming out from Trump makes them freak out emotionally
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:47.080]  and they'll will likely a lot of them will vote for Hillary over
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.080]  sure well I've had Trump's advisor on and he agrees and now Trump's been
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:54.800]  changing that so so I get your points let's get Joel's take Joel well you
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.360]  know I don't he makes a very good points they're all correct except I don't
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:05.480]  believe that he's a control manchurian candidate look Donald Trump won't even
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.920]  control himself to the extent of writing his own speech and stick to his own
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:13.480]  script he simply cannot do anything but speak off the cuff you simply cannot
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:17.920]  control a person like that so I don't think he is control and that's why I
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.200]  think the establishment is against him that said I don't think that he will do
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.880]  everything right I don't even think he may follow through sure is it fair to
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.400]  say he's a wild man yeah he's a wild card and but let me tell you this he would
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.080]  set back the globalist agenda four years if he got elected because they
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.800]  simply would be scrambling to get him to do what they want he would do maybe 30
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:42.360]  percent of it and it would set back and they don't want their agenda set back
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.960]  another four years yeah their systems like a Swiss watch see he would be sand
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:50.600]  in the gears big-time Jeremy thanks let's go to New York let's talk to Jay in
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:58.120]  New York you're on the air go ahead sir yes hello I I listen to your program
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:02.840]  almost every day and I also found a mr. Scousen's
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:09.600]  strategic relocation to be extremely helpful when purchasing my home I do
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:16.600]  need to fully disagree thank you for getting this book thank you for the
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:22.280]  support but what do you disagree with us on what I disagree with you is that I
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.480]  don't believe you are doing the full extent of the fight against globalism if
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:37.040]  you continue to not acknowledge John B. Wells and Cara van to midnight and his
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:44.840]  work on exposing the various aspects of what's happening in the geopolitical
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.480]  world ma'am ma'am I appreciate your call you know I said we're taking calls on
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.120]  Trump I've had John B. Wells on my show probably ten times he's a nice guy I
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.760]  don't get involved in people in their fights with other folks other radio
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.160]  hosts I can barely cover the news and my and have my family in my life I'm I can
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.440]  grown-up world here okay so so my show is in high school where it's about this
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:12.080]  host or that host or personalities it's about trying to stop World War 3 Joel
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.240]  Scousen and we're taking more calls after he's gone got about 30 seconds closing
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.120]  comment thanks for joining us well I want to just say I'm a big fan of John
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:22.920]  Wells he's had me on several times we've talked about globalism he's very much in
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:28.160]  favor of stopping the globalist agenda so I don't see how you know the caller
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:32.440]  can make a statement that you or I or opposing or not supporting John B. Wells
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.640]  I think he does a great job yeah I think you do a great job too Alex and I can
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.160]  tell you that from listening to your show as we came on today I I think you've
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.360]  got the right idea about Trump you've got the balanced approach he is going to
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:51.120]  stop the globalist agenda to a certain extent he's not totally reliable but
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.680]  he's not a controlled candidate and he listens to the people I've seen him
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:59.720]  change thank you Joel great interview we'll be back Joe Biggs here with info
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:06.320]  wars.com picking a fight Obama taps DC judge for Supreme Court slot defies
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:12.960]  GOP vow to block President Obama named federal appeals judge Merrick Garland on
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:18.440]  Wednesday as his pick to succeed Antonin Scalia on the US Supreme Court
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.280]  setting up a showdown with Republicans who have vowed to block the choice it's
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.520]  not a responsibility I take lightly Obama said of his choice during a Rose
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:32.240]  Garden ceremony Senator Mike Lee of Utah member of the Senate Judiciary
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:36.080]  Committee told Fox News minutes before the announcement that neither he nor
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:41.280]  his colleagues would support the nomination or allow it to go forward now
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:45.600]  with the death of Antonin Scalia we might also have the final kill to the
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:50.460]  Second Amendment because Merrick Garland has extremely liberal views on gun
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:55.480]  rights Obama is bringing in someone to finally finish it off say to you for
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:06:01.560]  more reports info wars.com I'm Joe Biggs thousands of years ago there was a
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.720]  basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:11.920]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:17.080]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:22.560]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:27.520]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:32.400]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:37.080]  journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with antroplex
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:43.560]  antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:49.120]  basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body discover
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:53.240]  why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:56.720]  back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life comm with
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:01.920]  anthroplex brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:07.360]  joins us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force I've
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.080]  been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.440]  here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.880]  make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.360]  brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:27.320]  being everything just kind of clears up four and a half stars people really love
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:29.840]  it read about it find out why third-party
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:33.880]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.280]  best organic based systems that will blow your socks off I haven't pulled it all
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.960]  night or like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.720]  brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:49.760]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:58.400]  game-changing products at info wars life comm or call 888-253-3139
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:14.320]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:21.760]  we're teleprompter free we're makeup free at least when I'm on stage up here
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:28.080]  at the newsroom it is a stage though the whole world is a stage each of us
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:32.280]  players upon it wrote Shakespeare I get asked that all the time they say is
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:41.560]  what you do an act and that's a complex question about 60% of the time I'm
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:47.760]  being a hundred percent totally serious I guess another 20% of the time I'm
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.080]  being satirical or joking around it's pretty clear when I'm being satirical
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:55.560]  and maybe another 20% of the time at least some days I'm making jokes or
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:09:00.080]  screwing around on some other complete subject
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:07.080]  that's on a day when I'm screwing around most days is about 98% serious and I'm
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:14.320]  always telling the truth about serious issues I'm covering I'm always trying to
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:22.160]  tell you the absolute crystallized condensed truth because the problem is
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:26.600]  truth is such a big giant subject things are so complex if you omit things
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:31.880]  it's almost a lie even though you're not trying to subjects are so big I'll
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.640]  hear a rebroadcast sometimes and you know wish that I would have added
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:41.120]  something else the difference is I'm trying to tell the truth mainstream
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:44.280]  media is trying to dumb you down and trying to confuse you most of the time
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.960]  and then when they do tell the truth occasionally even the mainstream
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.120]  reporters get demonized and that's why they don't do it too often on key
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.360]  subjects and mainstream media tells the truth about a plane crash or you know a
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:01.520]  car fire or you know who got elected most of the time but on key political
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.000]  issues they'll lie like all these democratic operatives caught starting
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.800]  fights and posing as Trump supporters videos up on info wars.com now I want
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:18.600]  to keep going to these folks that are mad at Trump and telling us why the toll
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  free number is 800-25-99231 but when I'm done with this raft of calls it's
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.120]  just gonna be open phones I would hope you'd want to comment on the new
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:30.680]  Supreme Court nominee who is the biggest anti-gunner in the federal court
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:39.360]  system they tried to overthrow DC Heller before that he tried to stop it so
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.880]  he's the guy that brought the case to overturn it and failed we're gonna get
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:50.040]  into that a huge huge huge huge deal just absolutely out of control so we're
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:54.280]  gonna be breaking that down we're also gonna be looking more at the campaign we
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.800]  have this new story by Kurt Nemo Obama selects Second Amendment foe for
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.560]  Supreme Court expected to overturn Scalia's ruling on Second Amendment if
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:10.640]  confirmed and I had my stack on him and so much has been moved see if I can find
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:17.480]  it it even has his ruling guys I had it was it had green marker on it I'm sure
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.000]  it's here in the stacks I'll just cover this once I find it at the bottom of the
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.520]  hour so I'm gonna go back to calls where he makes a statement about how DC
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.920]  Heller was horrible and he'd overturn it and he'd go back to what DC had I mean
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:37.080]  that is total gunman that is what he believes in total gunman
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:42.040]  meanwhile Boehner is backing Paul Ryan trying to draft him to run for president
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:46.960]  and just come into the convention with no delegates and have the Republican
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.560]  Party order the delegates just to hand it all over to him just very brazen
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:59.320]  extremely naked on that front also Fox News GOP debate canceled after Donald
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:07.080]  Trump backs out of John Kasich Ted Cruz fall suit so that's beginning to unfold
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:12.560]  as well now I want to get to other callers on other subjects now so I'm
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:19.360]  trying to race through Steven and switchblade and Wes and Rick and Jason
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:25.120]  and then I'm going to just open the phones up in general as I said on these
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.640]  subjects why do you think Russia pulled out of Syria I agree with
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:33.480]  Calvin's analysis is dead on what do you think about the North Korea situation
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.560]  what do you think about these unprecedented attacks to now arrest
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:43.240]  Trump if people attack him and are violent at these demonstrations this is
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:48.240]  now a direct attack on free speech also have a science stack that I want to get
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.960]  to but briefly please don't forget that we are listeners supported I want to

[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.040]  even more light on the power of true nascent iodine and folks from our
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.960]  research for the only ones that have this pure of an iodine we've talked about
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.480]  how an iodine was taken out of the food supply and how populations gained as
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:38.680]  much as 15 points when it was added back the salt in the 1990s look it up for
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:45.920]  yourself now the newest iodine discovery is being revealed how iodine that's a
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:52.200]  type of this in 1990s is 1900s works with the gut to promote optimum health as
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:56.640]  info wars and dr. group have told you for over 20 years the gut is the root of

[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.880]  this research is clear iodine is key because the thyroid regulates it and
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.320]  the pineal gland and so much more survival shield x2 nascent iodine is
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.880]  extracted from 200 million year old salt crystals deep in the earth and

[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.400]  would just add the caveat to that that fluoride attacks the thyroid it's one
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.200]  of the bad halogens it attacks the pineal it attacks all of your
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:35.080]  endocrine systems it suppresses it so from my research and when I've

[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:54.840]  the great state of Florida where Donald Trump dominated last night and Marco
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:59.880]  Rubio the Feringa ambassador stepped down and he said whoever won that would be
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.080]  the nominee now he's not saying that so Steven go ahead what do you think of
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:09.600]  Trump yeah first of all I want to say be on a tangy tangerine 2.0 and rebound
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:15.200]  from the longevity and then secret 12 act to super male brain force prostigarten
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.640]  silver bullet I use them all they're phenomenal they work by info thank you
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:27.040]  brother thank you guys for putting those out there as far as Trump I'm glad he's
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:31.160]  put out a lot of stuff that's turning things up it's obviously establishment
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:35.640]  hates them however I look at things deeper I look at things from a spiritual
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.640]  standpoint not just the natural or political one and as far as I can see
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.000]  based on the only one who has right judgment that's Almighty God in his
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.480]  word Donald Trump is a spiritual and moral failure and I have four reasons why
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.960]  number one is use of eminent domain what's the difference between him doing
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.560]  that and the BLM doing what they're doing well one does it through the courts
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:04.600]  the other does it by force but they're both using the government secondly the
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.680]  casinos Bible says that he that make a case to be rich at an evil eye and it
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:14.160]  will chill out the innocent certainly planned parenthood while he has come out
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.760]  for defunding it because of abortion he believes that that's only a small part of
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.520]  what they do and they do a lot of good things for women's health either that is
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.040]  head in the sand or he's ignoring on purpose what they're all about which is
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.360]  abortion and everything that goes with that they're eugenics they were founded
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.360]  for that reason but frontly to work mile of maple this man is an unashamed
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:42.880]  adulterer I hear you guys say he's a good family man now it's Roger Stone said
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:48.040]  that I'm just floored by that because the Bible says in Proverbs 6 that who so
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:52.280]  committed adultery with the woman lack of understanding he that do it that
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:57.240]  destroys his own soul a wound in the center shall he get hold on hold your
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:03.240]  horses who very good call you raise a lot of legitimate points I hear what
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.880]  you're saying and that's how the globalist you know could be defeated by
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.000]  their own master is they think they're all gonna get the power and then and then
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.480]  not the system but something else brings in the strong man to overthrow much of
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:22.600]  what they've done and who knows what comes out of that I hear you I hear you my
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:29.280]  gut tells me that Donald Trump overall is good you know King David was a man
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.760]  after God's own heart he had his best friend killed sending him into a certain
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.600]  death mission so you'd have his wife because she was so luscious and my
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.960]  issue is he later really repented of it he wasn't like he knew he could just
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:47.360]  repent and get out of it he literally repented later so you know I really think
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:52.680]  at the end of the day get to read the Bible in its full context King David
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:58.560]  committed adultery and so so was King David good but Donald Trump's bad because
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:02.480]  he likes women I mean you know he's not in there with little kids like a bunch
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.800]  of these Congress people and so I'm sorry I'm just not on some high horse and I'm
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.040]  not saying you are and I'm glad that you're the best guy around and you know
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:15.000]  can control you know yourself and everything and I get it it's just that
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.240]  you know I've been a good boy too but the point is is that I can sure got
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:23.160]  stuff running through my head and so I just you know thank God for creating
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:26.320]  women that's all I can say how do you respond to that in 30 seconds we're
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:33.360]  going to break well what I say is that yes David repented that's my issue it's
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:37.400]  not that there's not forgiveness but there must be repentance I don't hear
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:42.880]  Trump renouncing they talk about him you know coming out against Duke what
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:48.200]  about what he's done personally he needs to repent I don't see any evidence of
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.760]  that whatsoever he's done ashamed of what he's done you know I got to be honest
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:57.400]  with you it's refreshing that he's not a hypocrite and then and then you know

[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:34.120]  after lightsaber mistaken for a gun and I see these articles all the time where
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:39.800]  you'll have an eight-year-old with an orange and in a lime green or purple
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:49.200]  Nerf gun in their own backyard and the police will come and take it away and
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.240]  sometimes write tickets saying it scared someone when no crime was committed
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:56.720]  or the school hears about it and suspends you because you played with a
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:03.720]  Nerf gun at home so imagine someone has a green lightsaber you know that you buy
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:09.360]  it target and some moron thought it was a weapon because they were so hysterical
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:13.200]  as a social justice warrior they wanted to be hysterical about something and and
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.000]  call 911 so a New York college that went on lockdown over a report of a gun on
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.840]  campus says the weapon turned out to be a lightsaber indeed you are powerful
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.360]  students and staff members at Farmingdale State College on Long Island

[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.840]  with big yellow stains on their pants with police investigated a report that
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:42.160]  someone was assembling a rifle in the school parking lot college spokeswoman
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:48.640]  Catherine Coley says the rifle is actually a Star Wars toy Farmingdale State

[02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:02.320]  and SWAT teams the MRAPS to save everyone from the lightsaber indeed you
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:12.240]  are powerful oh man I've seen police called for like a Transformers gun and
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:19.720]  it showed her on the news was an inch long but these same trendy see cops with
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:28.080]  guns they go ooh the state I like it this is a cult they're taking over their
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.200]  cult of weakness and watching television to being pathetic and I don't put them
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.920]  down with pleasure I put them down so when they're listening they understand
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:41.160]  how slack-jawed and pathetic they are so they hopefully wake up to stop doing it
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:50.200]  switchblade the word scared me arrest him it's like Lynch Hall Lynch Lynch I
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:27:00.240]  saw a Halloween party I'm scared sorry switchblade in Texas go ahead yes
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:04.720]  thank you for that I'll be very quick here let's see basically about three and
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.240]  a half points on why I cannot support Trump although I do agree with you he's
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:13.160]  not establishment one he basically came out and said you know we have a lot of
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:15.760]  problems with this government we have a lot of corruption in this government I
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:19.120]  know because I participated in that corruption I have a real hard time
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.320]  swallowing that's all he said he said it's a corrupt system you got to do it
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:25.840]  and I'd try to end it where you have to literally pay these people to leave you
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:29.520]  alone that's an illustration of what he actually I know it's just horrible to
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.520]  have somebody openly you know just admit that it's a corrupt system yeah
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:38.680]  correct but then he also said I know because I bought politicians so you
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:43.120]  can trust me I can't swallow that no he's saying the system is buying him it's
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.320]  legal he doesn't like it so I understand what he's saying you try to get a nice
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:52.360]  tie made in the US it costs like 50 bucks you have it made in Mexico for five
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  dollars and then you try to sell the tie believe me we've done it for $60 to make
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.320]  $10 no one buys it you sell it for 35 from Mexico that costs five and you make
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.720]  30 bucks you sell it for 60 when it costs 50 you make 10 it's the regulations and
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:15.840]  everything is designed to shut us down I understand that but that's also I mean
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.440]  what's wrong with him being honest there's nothing wrong with him being
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:24.280]  honest I just have a hard time believing that he would do anything to fix anything
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.120]  other than what's good for Donald Trump everything Donald Trump has done in his
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:33.600]  life has been for Donald Trump and on top of all of that you've got his constant
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:37.120]  remark well not constant but his repetitive repetitive remarks against
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:41.080]  free speech whenever he's you know voicing his opinions on various things
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:46.240]  like the phones or the quote unquote I've said I think he's wrong because he
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.440]  doesn't even know how to use a computer from what I'm told let's just say he's
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:52.400]  less tech savvy than I am and I'm not on a scale I want to send him about a three
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:58.040]  trims about a you know point five and he's like let him in they got warrants
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:02.160]  let him have the terrorist info now that he understands it's a larger issue he's
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:05.200]  moved away from that so there are some pitfalls there and I hear what you're
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.720]  saying then he reiterated at the Chicago which granted those protesters were in
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:13.920]  the wrong protesting it's a right protected well let me just say something
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:17.400]  it's not a protest when you go to somebody else's political event and try to
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:21.280]  disrupt it and run into people so I mean listen the weathermen thought they
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.800]  were protesters you know bombing people so a bunch of George Soros people coming
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:30.560]  to your event but I have these people come and try to shut me down so what
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:34.480]  about my free speech you see I mean I've gone out and had rallies before I
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:38.440]  were gonna have a rally here and people go book the time where I'm going but then
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:41.800]  tell me I can't be there you know so there's a lot of other stuff going on
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:46.600]  out there hey I hear you let's not have Trump the fellow Reserve agrees with you
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:55.840]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.160]  now that Trump has over 50% of delegates needed to meet their arbitrary
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.640]  finish line the establishment is doubling down on their arrogance these folks
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:12.080]  are competing to join us they're competing to become the president of
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:17.560]  the United States and so they are looking but to do that to vote for them
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:21.760]  I mean my point is this is it look listen no they're not that's RNC chair
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:26.280]  previous explaining to a shocked CNN reporter that the voters in an election
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:31.000]  don't matter the candidates are auditioning to join the establishment
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.400]  Hurley-Hoglin an unfound GOP delegate echoes RNC chair previous telling CNBC
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:40.680]  that media has created the perception that voters choose the nominee he
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:44.800]  questioned why primaries and caucuses are even held also today former Speaker
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:48.560]  John Boehner says he wants the nomination handed to Ryan saying they all had a
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:52.560]  chance to win and none of them won Trump however has won 64 percent of state
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:56.560]  elections and the wheels are coming off the establishment's rigged system for

[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:11.480]  hello boys and girls I have a special message for you from the president of
[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:18.840]  the United States. In the councils of government we must guard against the
[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:23.600]  acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:27.080]  military industrial conflict and we are as a people
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:34.000]  inherently and historically opposed to secret societies the secret oaths and a
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:41.280]  secret proceedings. There has been an attempt that perhaps you know now on
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:46.840]  the life of president Kennedy. The initial attack on the destroyer Maddox on August 2nd
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:55.040]  was repeated today. Psychological warfare operations went into high gear.
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:02.360]  Retaliation for this unprovoked attack on the high seas our forces have struck
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:06.960]  the bases used by the North Vietnamese patrol craft. It would allow the president
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:11.960]  to wage war in Vietnam.
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:31.840]  In 1976 flight 455 which took off from Venezuela bound for Cuba suddenly
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.040]  exploded. All 73 passengers and five crew members aboard it died after the
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:40.040]  plane crashed near Barbados.
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:52.440]  William Colby has been missing since April 27th. His canoe was found washed up
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:59.040]  on the banks of the Waikomiko River April 28th.
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.040]  You don't have to tell you things are bad everybody knows things are bad.
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.040]  I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  are I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:21.040]  All right what is the trilateral commission? An organization founded in 1973 by David
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:27.040]  Rockefeller. The really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:33.040]  this country to work to erase national boundaries and create an international
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:39.040]  community and in time bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.040]  calling the shots. I understand he was tapped for skull and bones.
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:47.040]  Tapped for it? Sir he found its skull and bones.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:50.040]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.040]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.040]  all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.040]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel built-in radios and I won't say
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:05.040]  anything just leave us alone. Well I'm not going to leave you alone.
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:07.040]  I want you to get back.
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:12.040]  We have got the fight stand up. It's not going to be easy. Well I'll show you this.
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:16.040]  We can and we will and we must prevail.
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:25.040]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:29.040]  All right folks I'm going to go to some calls here in a few minutes and I've got
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:32.040]  to get through these anti-Trump calls because in the first hour if you just
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:35.040]  joined us I said hey you're anti-Trump tell me why and we'll do it.
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.040]  And it's gone pretty good. Some people made some good points.
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:40.040]  Others have just brought up reasons to criticize me.
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:44.040]  I don't like Trump because such and such because you did this.
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:49.040]  Fine. I'm just trying to gauge where you're coming from here.
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.040]  Look at this headlines from Breitbart. It's up on infowars.com.
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.040]  It's up on drudgerport.com.
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:59.040]  Activist plot largest protest of the century.
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:03.040]  MoveOn.org and the White House they won't go protest all the wars they're launching
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:06.040]  after all Obama's got a peace prize.
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  But they will go out and protest free speech.
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:15.040]  And then notice in the photo here stop hate.
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.040]  They link arms and run into you and go scares ass coming through
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:23.040]  then just run men women and children over.
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.040]  And then just punch you right in the face and the media goes can you believe
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:33.040]  the Trump people and cited violence how dare them.
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:36.040]  And even a few people fought back against the social justice warriors.
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:40.040]  Just you know the social justice warriors they've been taught if you're a libertarian
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.040]  a veteran a conservative a Christian you deserve to die.
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:45.040]  If you're white you deserve to die.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:49.040]  You know we play those clubs that's what's taught at the universities.
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:55.040]  We have as low IQ low information people that just show up all full of themselves
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:01.040]  and they show somebody threatened to kill Trump with a machine gun.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:03.040]  He goes and tries to attack him says he wants to be a martyr.
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:09.040]  They put him on CNN as a hero to create more of these people.
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:15.040]  Anti-Trump groups threaten the largest civil disobedience action of the sensory.
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:19.040]  We'd have free speech events to counter these people these people are true trash.
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.040]  There are a bunch of thugs that want to run into people.
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:30.040]  Back in Germany in 1938 they'd be wearing brown shirts with little to be technical 1933 with little
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:35.040]  because those useful idiots gotten rid of right after that with little fanfare and almost no news media attention.
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.040]  Some of the same radical groups.
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:39.040]  Yeah I want my reporters focusing on these people.
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.040]  We just send our reporters out to follow Trump.
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:43.040]  That's where the action is.
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:48.040]  It's about First Amendment not even about Trump with little fanfare and almost no news media attention.
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:53.040]  Some of the same radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trump's Chicago rally last week
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:56.040]  are plotting a mass civil disobedience movement to begin next month.
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:00.040]  They intend to march across the east coast in order to spark a fire.
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:05.040]  That'll be a bunch of radical Muslims, black lives matter, socialist communists, red flags,
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  just beating people up basically and going in going you're white, you're scum,
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:14.040]  much of white guys saying it to you and you're just like I'm just here at a grocery store buddy getting a cup of coffee.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:18.040]  Doesn't matter. I'm better than you. I'm a bully.
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:24.040]  They intend to march across the east coast in order to spark a fire that quote transforms the political climate in America.
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.040]  An operation calling itself Democracy Spring.
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:32.040]  Remember, remember Al Gore said we need a Arab Spring in America.
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:42.040]  In Democracy Spring is threatening drama in Washington with the largest civil disobedience action of the century.
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:49.040]  They won't do it against the Federal Reserve or the IRS persecuting people or you know all the toxins and vaccines.
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:53.040]  No, no, you'll just do it against free speech because MSNBC told you so.
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:57.040]  The radicals believe this will result in an arrest of thousands of their own activists.
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:02.040]  We will demand that Congress listen to the people and take immediate action to save our democracy.
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.040]  Yes, by banning free speech and we won't leave until they do or until they send thousands of us to jail.
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:12.040]  The website for Democracy Spring declares channeling rhetoric from the Occupy movement.
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:15.040]  Sorrow is funded again.
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:24.040]  And they want to switch all the angry Bernie Sanders people who are going to be mad at Hillary over to Trump.
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:35.040]  Move on to Orore has been playing a prominent role in organizing the anti-Trump activists including last week's shutdown of the billionaire's rally at the University of Illinois in Chicago Pavilion.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:40.040]  Because they want to support democracy. They want to ban your free speech. They're such good people.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:46.040]  That's normally called a oxymoronic statement.
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:51.040]  Meanwhile, here is the report from the Legal Times DC gun case.
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:41:08.040]  Rehearing denied, the circuit was 6-4 with Judge A. Raymond Randolph, Judith Rogers, David Taddle, and Merrick Garland stating they would have granted the petition for a rehearing to overturn DC Heller.
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:11.040]  He was against it at the time and tried to overturn it.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:23.040]  The very guy out there trying to overturn one of the most important pro-second amendment cases in our history and he is now nominated to the Supreme Court and the media is spinning it that he's a conservative.
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:26.040]  He's even worse than John Boehner.
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:31.040]  George Herbert Walker brought him in. So he must be good, huh?
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:34.040]  Talk about comedy.
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:40.040]  Apple says US founders would be appalled by DOJ order.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:47.040]  The DOJ admits they've got thousands of phones they want to break into. They can go in through the hardware in the phone but it takes time.
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.040]  They can also go right to the ISPs and providers and get where everybody went.
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:58.040]  So it's a red herring and most stuff has back doors. They just want to sell the idea that they're breaking in things to keep you safe.
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:03.040]  So that's all fraud and they do want to have universal encryption keys.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:09.040]  And the federal government's a giant sieve so it'll proliferate out to all the criminals including those in government.
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:15.040]  It's just a fact. They're everywhere. Criminals are everywhere. Private sector, public sector, you name it.
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:28.040]  So it is wrong what they're doing to Apple but Apple runs the most oppressive factories reported in the world with suicide nets, forced abortions and forced drugging and 16, 17 hour days.
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:36.040]  And no parental care, no nothing.
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  You get hurt, you're off the job, that's it. How can we compete with this?
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:50.040]  Why don't they bring Apple back to the United States and it go up in price of few dollars but it actually create jobs like Donald Trump's talked about.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:56.040]  But they are one of the most oppressive and anti-liberty groups giving money to take our guns, money for open borders.
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  They are probably one of the most evil corporations around. They censor people they don't agree with.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:08.040]  They're very, very centralized and just to hear them in U.S. say today, Apple Inc.
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:15.040]  charged Tuesday that a court order forcing the tech giant to assist the federal government in unlocking the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorists.
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:19.040]  Said Farooq was based on non-existent authority asserted by the Justice Department.
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:28.040]  According to the government short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the court can order private parties to do virtually anything with Justice Department.
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.040]  I can dream up just Apple lawyers arguing the new court document. I agree.
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:38.040]  It's an interest servitude. Make us a program, break your encryption so we can get into the front end of this.
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:43.040]  Make your product obsolete.
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:50.040]  But for them to then talk about the Constitution of the Founders, when they're there butchering it, stinks to high heaven.
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.040]  Here's another one to show what the politically correct just department's doing.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:44:00.040]  They don't go after the IRS persecuting people. They reward them. They don't care about the drugs being shipped in on government aircraft.
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:07.040]  No, they want the NFL to not ask the sexual preference of players.
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:14.040]  Because it's just all an agenda to take away all your basic rights but then give you the right to not be asked what your sexual preference is.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:18.040]  Foe rights or rights that don't matter.
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:25.040]  Look, they got surveillance blimps, forced inoculation, you know, forced GMO, fluoride in your water, everybody dying of cancer.
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:31.040]  But you've got a tranny potty for the fifth grade.
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:39.040]  Yeah, world government's here, total enslavement, but we're going to teach your five-year-old how to have sex.
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:41.040]  That's how they operate.
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  Meanwhile, China, Russia planning space attacks on US satellites. You know what, let's go to some of your calls.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:49.040]  But I'm giving each person a minute. We're going to go to Kentucky.
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:57.040]  Then we're going to go to Canada. We're going to go to Florida. We're going to go to Vermont and North Carolina and other places.
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:01.040]  Jason in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:03.040]  Yes, sir. Can you hear me?
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.040]  Yes. Would you like me to talk to you like Hillary did when she was in Kentucky?
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.040]  No, but.
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:10.040]  How you doing there? Don't know.
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:23.040]  Go ahead there. How'd you like some possum? How'd you like some possum stew and some moonshine?
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:31.040]  It's funny, but I just want to say I agree with Trump about 90% of what he said.
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:39.040]  But honestly, after what happened in Chicago with our whole protesting or demonstration where you want to call it,
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:45.040]  I honestly believe he is a plant for Hillary Clinton because by him doing what he did.
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:47.040]  The way he blamed Bernie people?
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:55.040]  Not only just that, but just this whole handling of that only benefited Hillary Clinton to win not only Illinois.
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:00.040]  And believe me, I hate Bernie Sanders and I hate Hillary Clinton 10 times more.
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:05.040]  But that's why I just can't support Trump anymore because that benefited Hillary Clinton.
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:11.040]  I really don't think that Trump is established when this is all a big scam.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:15.040]  The danger is he is his own person as a wild man, a true Trump card.
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.040]  But we'll find out. Speaking of this, I meant to play it because I just covered this article.
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:25.040]  Anti-Trump groups threaten largest civil disobedience ever to shut down free speech because they're social justice warriors
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:30.040]  and they want Martin Luther King quotes off the walls at Oregon State because it's hateful.
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:33.040]  He didn't include gay people.
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:37.040]  He just said, our children live together of all races, colors and creeds.
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:41.040]  Oh, well, it's exclusionary like the word mother and father. So you got to have it pulled down.
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.040]  This isn't a cult of control freaks.
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:48.040]  But meanwhile, Donald Trump says there'll be civil unrest if they steal the election from him.
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:51.040]  So could this be the plan for the Civil War?
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:53.040]  Let's go ahead and go to the club.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:59.040]  We'll win before getting to the convention, but I can tell you if we didn't and if we're 20 votes short
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:08.040]  or if we're 100 short and we're at 1100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 because we're way ahead of everybody.
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically.
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.040]  I think it would be, I think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots.
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:19.040]  You know, I'm representing a tremendous, many, many millions of people.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:24.040]  In many cases, first time voters. These are people that haven't voted because they never believed in the system.
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:31.040]  They didn't like candidates, et cetera, et cetera, that are 40 and 50 and 60 years old and they've never voted before.
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  That's right. They hate the fact he's bringing populist voters in who are out of the system.
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:36.040]  And then some will say, well, voting's a fraud.
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:43.040]  Well, only if you have cruddy candidates and there's election fraud, but they have trouble stealing an election if it's a landslide.
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:47.040]  They're scared for real and we're forcing them out in the open.
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.040]  This is a big victory for Liberty.
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.040]  Rick in Florida. Let's go to Florida and talk to Rick. Go ahead.
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  Good afternoon, Alex. Nine-year listener. Good to be with you.
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.040]  My beef with you is this. Why can't you ask Donald Trump about building seven?
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:05.040]  He builds buildings in Manhattan for a living. You're the father of the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:08.040]  Ask him if he accepts the NIST report from 2008.
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:13.040]  Ask him if NIST won't release the computer modeling that they can't use to come up with their cockamamie theory.
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.040]  Ask him about-
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:16.040]  Well, as everyone knows, hold on just a second.
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:21.040]  My job is to cover up false flags and to make sure nobody knows that 9-11 was a staged event.
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:25.040]  I'm being sarcastic. I meant to ask him about that.
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:28.040]  I meant to ask him about the 28 pages and that was actually on my list.
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:32.040]  And I meant to ask about the Federal Reserve and I got that message to him.
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:35.040]  It looks like he's becoming on soon and I will ask those questions.
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:41.040]  So there you go. But at least he's brought up the 28 pages and the fact that Bush wasn't a hero.
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:45.040]  That's a big first step. Or is he worse than the Bushes, actually?
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:50.040]  Because he goes part of the way. I mean, isn't that a good thing he did?
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:54.040]  Absolutely. But can I hold your feet to the fire if you fail to ask him about building 7?
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  Hold on. I may not now. I may not now. I may not now.
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:01.040]  Because I'm not going to be bullied here.
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:07.040]  Okay. I mean, people call me all the time and they say you're covering up the Federal Reserve's private because they just learned it.
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:09.040]  And I've been talking about it for 25 years.
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:15.040]  So, I mean, come on, man. I make films about 9-11. I cover it. I get into it.
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:17.040]  Trump's come out and said they're covering up 9-11.
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:23.040]  How am I in Trump bad when we're two people getting folks to talk about it?
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.040]  Softball questions that he could knock out of the park for a grand salami.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:29.040]  Ask him about building 7. He fills buildings.
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:36.040]  Well, hold on. I heard you do that. Just you're so accusatory, like I'm David Rockefeller. Listen.
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:40.040]  If you're a new listener and we don't just have an anti-Trump call after an anti-Trump call,
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:42.040]  the first hour, open the phones up for these people to call in.
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:47.040]  And what about half of you seem so mad at me?
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:52.040]  So, see, you have a platform here to bring up Building 7, which I'm the great dawn of covering up.
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.040]  I'll agree with you. That's my job. I'm the guy that exposed it first.
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:59.040]  And so, I'm a bad person.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:06.040]  You know, I would say it's your responsibility to go out on the campaign trail and ask Donald Trump about that.
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:11.040]  You know, you've ruined it for me. I was planning to ask. I'm not going to ask you that now. Sorry.
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:13.040]  What do you say to that now, Rick?
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:17.040]  I'm still going to listen. I'm a nine-year listener by all the nutraceuticals,
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.040]  beyond Tandy, Kangerine, Accio, FX, Nathan, and I.
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.040]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.040]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:29.040]  Listen, I hear that you're fired up and stuff, but don't ruin it for me.
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  That's actually on the list of stuff, okay?
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.040]  So, just let me enjoy myself a little bit here.
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:38.040]  I mean, believe me, there's stuff all the time, like before an interview,
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:41.040]  and the most important thing I want to cover, and then after, I didn't do it.
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:45.040]  But believe me, believe me, I'm going to get into, you know, all of it with Trump.
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.040]  And believe me, he wants to get into it, too.
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:52.040]  So, I hear you, Rick, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:51:19.040]  We're going to come back. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. It's quite a Wednesday Transmission.

[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:10.040]  The sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:15.040]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost $32 for an 8-pack

[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:23.040]  And if saving money in a clean shave isn't incentive enough,

[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:36.040]  Did I say captain? The fourth hour.
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:42.040]  I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy.
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:49.040]  Scalia dies, Garland decides, and the Supreme Court is his reward
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.040]  for being a champion of evil.
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:57.040]  As the wheels are coming off the globalist oligarch party,
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:54:59.040]  they're unmasking their intentions.
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:01.040]  We will look at Boehner and the GOP delegates,
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:05.040]  hoping we're talking about how they will throw out the election
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:10.040]  and make the nomination a selection, a royal coronation.
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:13.040]  How are we any different from North Korea if they do this?
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:15.040]  See how far are we falling?
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.040]  And we'll look at the metrics from last night's election where Trump dominated.
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:26.040]  All this and more coming up in T minus about five minutes with the one,
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:29.040]  the only David Knight from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.040]  I'm your host Alex shows. He's welcome to continue with these callers.
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:36.040]  David, 70 year old vet on everything.
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:41.040]  Frank and Marilyn Trump skipping the Republican debate on Fox,
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:43.040]  Vincent and Vermont, Social Security and immigrants.
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:45.040]  Brian was talking about Eric Blair in 1984.
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:47.040]  Vincent wants to talk about Russia.
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:49.040]  I'm going to get a few of those now.
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:55.040]  You heard a caller earlier who was almost frothing that I bring up building seven.
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:58.040]  And yes, I'm going to try to get into all that.
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:03.040]  But at the same time, you heard him then say,
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:05.040]  No, these are the most amazing products ever.
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:07.040]  Go do the liver cleanse.
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:09.040]  I'll be honest, it's easy to do.
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.040]  I've only done it once.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  I started it and quit it a few months ago because I'm a lazy blob.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:15.040]  I mean, I love exercising.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:17.040]  I don't like taking vitamins and stuff.
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.040]  And every time I make myself do it, my life gets better.
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  I'm going to do the liver cleanse with the liver shield, the oxy powder,
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.040]  the apple cider vinegar.
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.040]  It's up on info wars life.com.
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:29.040]  They expanded it to even fancier one.
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:30.040]  That's confusing.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:32.040]  Even my mother, someone had that changed.
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  All you need is the apple cider vinegar, the oxy powder, the liver shield.
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:41.040]  And then the olive oil on the sixth day before you go to bed and the epsom salts.
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:45.040]  There's a couple little capital to those and boom, it opens up your gallbladder.
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:46.040]  And it is spectacular.
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:48.040]  It doesn't work just one piece alone.
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:52.040]  And that happens about 12 to 24 hours later, generally the next morning,
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:54.040]  about six, eight hours later.
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:56.040]  But it took me about a day and a half.
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:57.040]  Just try it for yourself.
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.040]  It's amazing.
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:01.040]  Just do not drink while you're doing it.
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:03.040]  Obviously, your liver is wide open when it's happening.
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:05.040]  And then after I did it, people said, watch, you drink one beer.
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:06.040]  It has a huge effect.
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:08.040]  It's like, wow, my tolerance is gone.
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:09.040]  And then it came back.
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:11.040]  I mean, it really is amazing.
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:12.040]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:16.040]  All about the great products, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:21.040]  Let's go to Brian and Cam, you're on the air.
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:23.040]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:24.040]  Hey, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.040]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:30.040]  I know you're a big fan of Eric Blair, the author of 1984.
[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:31.040]  Yes.
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  And I just finished the book.
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:33.040]  I just finished the book.
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:37.040]  I read it in 2002, but I just finished it like in the last 48 hours.
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:43.040]  And I guess I want to just ask you whether or not you thought that Eric Blair had this
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:49.040]  insight that we're often talking about, this advanced insights, because the book is just
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.040]  so dead on.
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.040]  It's what's happening today.
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:55.040]  It's almost like a blueprint of your radio show.
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.040]  I mean, he knew what was going on.
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:58.040]  This is the 1940s.
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:04.040]  And I just wondered if you could share perhaps your thoughts on whether or not he was part
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:08.040]  of this cabal, this illuminous group of people.
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:09.040]  Yes.
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:10.040]  I ought to do a video about who was Eric Blair.
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:14.040]  I can't do it in 50 seconds, but I'm sure David Knight is going to come in the next
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:15.040]  five minutes.
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.040]  I bet he can give you his take.
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:21.040]  Eric Blair came from an elite family that was inside the Wedgewoods and others and the
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:23.040]  Galtons and all the rest of them.
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:24.040]  So he knew a lot.
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:26.040]  He was a member of the secret police basically in India.
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:29.040]  Then he was a communist, fought the Spanish of the war.
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:32.040]  Then he was a propagandist in World War II of the OSS.
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:34.040]  And he wrote the book to tell you what was coming.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.040]  That's why it's so real.
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.040]  That's why it's so powerful.
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:39.040]  But no, he was against him.
[02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:40.040]  He was definitely a defector.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:45.040]  He died one year after 1984 came out in 1949.
[02:58:45.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  Stay with us, David Knight, 70 seconds away.
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:16.040]  Welcome back.

[02:59:50.040 --> 03:00:01.040]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:10.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:12.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:16.040]  I'm David Knight, your host in this final hour of The Alex Jones Radio Show, the fourth
[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:23.040]  hour on this Wednesday, March 16, 2016, the day after probably the second biggest day of
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:24.040]  the primary season.
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:28.040]  And that was, of course, the beginning of the Winner Take All elections.
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:32.040]  We had five states and one territory yesterday.
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:34.040]  They're still sorting out the delegates in Illinois and Missouri.
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.040]  But we're going to take a look at the metrics and what that tells us.
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:41.040]  But we're also going to take a look at what the establishment is telling us.
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:45.040]  The establishment is telling us they don't care what the metrics say.
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:47.040]  They don't care who you voted for.
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:49.040]  They don't care who has a plurality.
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.040]  They've got a line they've drawn in the sand.
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:52.040]  They have some rules.
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.040]  They're going to go to this convention.
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:57.040]  The final four that we had are now the final three.
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:01.040]  But there's still only one candidate who has a winning record.
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:04.040]  Donald Trump has won 64% of the states.
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:07.040]  Ted Cruz has won 24%.
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:10.040]  You have John Kasich, who has won a single state.
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:13.040]  Of course, if you're watching the news, you think that somehow he's a contender.
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:15.040]  He's not a contender.
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:16.040]  Let me tell you something.
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:21.040]  John Kasich is trying to make a case for how he's going to have a path to the nomination.
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:25.040]  And he talks about the big states that he thinks he's going to win in the future.
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:27.040]  The first one he talks about is Pennsylvania.
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.040]  Here's the dirty truth about John Kasich.
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:37.040]  Pennsylvania is on his critical path, he says, to having a rigged convention.
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:44.040]  Using the arcane rules of the GOP, using new rules with the GOP convention to try to win.
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:49.040]  But the reality is, is John Kasich couldn't even bother, or wasn't competent enough,
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.040]  to get the paperwork in time into Pennsylvania to legitimately get on the ballot.
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:57.040]  But of course, for John Kasich as part of the GOP establishment,
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.040]  this old-time establishment man who only just recently has become Mr. Rogers, you understand.
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:04.040]  He was never Mr. Nice Guy.
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.040]  He was always the whip, the guy that knocked heads around.
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:11.040]  Even when he became governor, he was threatening people.
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:13.040]  Okay, but now he's Mr. Rogers.
[03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:16.040]  Okay, but he's going to change the rules if he gets a chance.
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  And he's going to get himself on the ballot even though he missed the deadline.
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:23.040]  That's what we're looking at now.
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:25.040]  We're going to look at what John Boehner said.
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.040]  We're going to look at what another delegate has said.
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:32.040]  We're going to go back and look again at what the RNC chair,
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:34.040]  Reince Priebus has said in the past.
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:39.040]  Folks, the wheels are coming off the globalist oligarch party.
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.040]  And we should help them in that.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:43.040]  There's going to be a revolution one way or the other.
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:45.040]  And we're going to talk about what's going to happen with this.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:49.040]  When or lose, Donald Trump has begun a revolution.
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:51.040]  I think that's a very healthy thing.
[03:02:51.040 --> 03:02:52.040]  And we're going to look at history.
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  We're going to look at the future as well with this.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:59.040]  I want to also take a look at this new Supreme Court nominee.
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:02.040]  They said that he was with the DC Circuit Court of Appeals
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:04.040]  that immediately rung a bell with me.
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:07.040]  I said, oh, that's the Circuit Court of Appeals
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:12.040]  that is going to be hearing these edicts coming out of Obama and his EPA
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:16.040]  trying to shut down the coal and oil industry
[03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:19.040]  as part of the climate change agenda that they have.
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:25.040]  And they're trying to enact it by fiat, by executive order, by bureaucratic legislation.
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:29.040]  Remember that we said when Scalia suddenly died
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:34.040]  that the most important thing that was immediately coming up was this very case
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:38.040]  that is going to be coming before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:43.040]  It was expected that the Supreme Court was going to overturn a favorable decision,
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:48.040]  favorable to EPA, favorable to Obama, favorable to the climate change agenda
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:53.040]  to shut down our climate, our fuels, rather.
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:56.040]  They expected that to be shut down five to four.
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.040]  With Scalia dying, they said it's probably going to be a four-four decision
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:02.040]  and the lower court decision will stand.
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:05.040]  So the EPA regulations will likely move forward.
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:11.040]  Now, isn't it interesting that this guy who is at the crux of this power
[03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  to push the climate change agenda is now being offered as a Supreme Court appointee,
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.040]  perhaps as a perk once he enacts Obama's climate change agenda.
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:28.040]  We're also going to talk about the fact that his path to power has come through Chicago
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:35.040]  and through heading up the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing, just like Eric Holder.
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:38.040]  You want to get a powerful position in the administration?
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:40.040]  You cover up the Oklahoma City bombing.
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:43.040]  You make sure nobody sees what's going on there.
[03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:46.040]  And then you pass the climate change agreement for them
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:50.040]  when Scalia drops dead at a remote ranch. How's that?
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:52.040]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[03:05:20.040 --> 03:05:24.040]  That's RNC Chair Priebus explaining to a shocked CNN reporter
[03:05:24.040 --> 03:05:27.040]  that the voters in an election don't matter.
[03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:31.040]  The candidates are auditioning to join the establishment.
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:35.040]  Hurley Hogland, an unbound GOP delegate, echoes RNC Chair Priebus
[03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:40.040]  telling CNBC that media has created the perception that voters choose the nominee.
[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:43.040]  He questioned why primaries and caucuses are even held.
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:47.040]  Also today, former Speaker John Boehner says he wants the nomination handed to Ryan,
[03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:50.040]  saying they all had a chance to win and none of them won.
[03:05:50.040 --> 03:05:53.040]  Trump, however, has won 64% of state elections
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:56.040]  and the wheels are coming off the establishment's rigged system.
[03:05:56.040 --> 03:06:18.040]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:39.040]  and enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species
[03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:43.040]  that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:49.040]  This winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:25.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:29.040]  I'm David Nutt on this Wednesday, March 16th, 2016,
[03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:33.040]  day after a very significant day in the primary process.
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:37.040]  And of course Donald Trump won a great deal of delegates yesterday.
[03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:39.040]  We had Marco Rubio dropout.
[03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:41.040]  That was foreseen.
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:45.040]  But of course the establishment is not taking this lying down.
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.040]  We're going to take a look at what they're doing now.
[03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:50.040]  The wheels as I said in the last segment are really coming off the establishment
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:52.040]  and they are pulling off the mask.
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:57.040]  And they're making it very clear to us that they really don't care about the election process.
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:08:59.040]  We played that clip before.
[03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:02.040]  We're going to play it again today of Reince Priebus,
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:05.040]  the Republican National Committee chair,
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:10.040]  telling an amazed CNN reporter, Alison Camarato,
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:12.040]  is that no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:14.040]  You don't understand this isn't an election.
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:17.040]  They're trying to join us.
[03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:20.040]  They're going to join us as our nominee.
[03:09:20.040 --> 03:09:23.040]  We talked about that and it's like, that's really creepy.
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:26.040]  Well, if there was ever any doubt about our interpretation of that,
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:28.040]  now John Boehner has made it clear.
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:30.040]  We've had another GOP delegate make it clear.
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:32.040]  You can see this at the top of the Drudge Report.
[03:09:32.040 --> 03:09:36.040]  Absolutely amazing what they are saying.
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:41.040]  They are not only desperate, but they are blatant in showing people
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:43.040]  that this has always been a selection process.
[03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:45.040]  They've always been able to control it in the past.
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:49.040]  And that's why I would say that the way I look at Donald Trump is,
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:53.040]  he's really our illegal alien in the GOP.
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:56.040]  He's our illegal alien in the GOP.
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:00.040]  And when I say that, what I mean is that you have to understand
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:05.040]  that the open borders, not fundamentally about wages or many other issues,
[03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:10.040]  it's fundamentally about bringing in a different culture,
[03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:15.040]  trying to balkanize a system, trying to destroy the nation-state.
[03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:19.040]  So we have here in the West, nation-states in Europe,
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:22.040]  that can stand in the way of the globalist agenda.
[03:10:22.040 --> 03:10:28.040]  And so what Donald Trump has done is he is now the key weapon
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:30.040]  against this globalist agenda.
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:32.040]  And that's why I support him.
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:34.040]  I'm going to take some more of the calls that are still hanging on here.
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:38.040]  I know some of you have been hanging on for a very long time to talk to Alex.
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:43.040]  I'm going to take those calls. You can tell me why you don't support Trump.
[03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:45.040]  I'm first going to tell you why I do.
[03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:49.040]  Because I've had people, had somebody last night send me a tweet,
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:53.040]  say, you're a sellout. You support Trump.
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:55.040]  Well, I haven't sold out.
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:10:59.040]  And we need to start understanding what's really involved here.
[03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:02.040]  So I want to talk about that. Before I do, I think it's key also
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:07.040]  that there's not going to be a, this next debate has been canceled.
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:11.040]  And of course, after Trump canceled, Kasich backed out.
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:15.040]  Kasich said he would only join the debate with the participation of Trump.
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:20.040]  You know, because he and Cruz and Fox News don't really disagree on anything.
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:22.040]  You know, they're all part of the establishment.
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:24.040]  They don't really have anything to talk about, I guess.
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:30.040]  And I had sent out some tweets last night directing them at Donald Trump.
[03:11:30.040 --> 03:11:32.040]  Of course, I didn't have anything to do with that decision.
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:36.040]  Somebody tweeted back to me and said, well, he's already said he's going to go to APAC.
[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:39.040]  On the same day. So it looks like he's not going to be doing that.
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.040]  It's like, good. I think that's great.
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:44.040]  But I sent out a tweet. I said, you know, if a tree falls in the forest
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:47.040]  and nobody hears it, did it make any sound?
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:52.040]  If Fox News has a debate without Donald Trump and nobody watches it, does it matter?
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:55.040]  Did anybody hear it? Would anybody watch it? Of course they wouldn't.
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:12:01.040]  Nobody is going to watch a debate between Kasich and Cruz.
[03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:03.040]  Who cares? Who cares?
[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:06.040]  These guys are so incredibly irrelevant.
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:12.040]  Now, as I point out, and this is Fox making this, this is Fox 13 GOP presidential debate
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:14.040]  and Salt Lake City is canceled.
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:19.040]  And the very last phrase, the very last sentence on the article says,
[03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:22.040]  Ted Cruz would have been the only candidate on stage.
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:24.040]  Well, they could have still had a debate.
[03:12:24.040 --> 03:12:28.040]  You know, Ted Cruz could have debated himself on the trade treaties.
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:32.040]  He could have debated himself on whether or not Snowden is a trader or not.
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:36.040]  He could have debated himself on whether or not we should audit the Fed, you know.
[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:42.040]  Ted Cruz has taken so many different positions on so many different issues.
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.040]  He is really the John Kerry of the GOP.
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:52.040]  And I got to say that, you know, I disagree with Joel Scowzen when he was on talking to Alex.
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:55.040]  I'm not a fan of Ted Cruz.
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:02.040]  And if Donald Trump were to pick Ted Cruz, then that would be a bridge too far for me.
[03:13:02.040 --> 03:13:08.040]  I would have to say that of all the disingenuous people and, you know, everything about this guy,
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:14.040]  his, you know, stabbing Ben Carson in the back and the other things that he's done is
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:16.040]  he's proclaiming his piety everywhere.
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:18.040]  He is a stench to me.
[03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:21.040]  I know that we had a caller who called in and said, you know, Alex,
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:28.040]  I make my decisions based on moral calculations and I'm not happy with the life of Donald Trump,
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:29.040]  so I won't vote for him.
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:30.040]  I understand that.
[03:13:30.040 --> 03:13:31.040]  I understand that.
[03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:33.040]  He made not only that, but there's other issues as well.
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:34.040]  There's eminent domain.
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:36.040]  There's crony capitalism that he's been a part of.
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:42.040]  There's his authoritarian position on surveillance, on torture, on so many different other issues.
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:45.040]  When I look at this, I say, yeah, that's right.
[03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:46.040]  I disagree with him.
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:47.040]  But you know what?
[03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:49.040]  I disagree with everybody else on those issues as well.
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:52.040]  I see a candidate out there that is saying that we should stop eminent domain.
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:59.040]  I see a Ted Cruz out there saying that we should allow a foreign Canadian corporation to take
[03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:02.040]  the property of people for the Keystone Pipeline.
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:03.040]  Okay.
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:08.040]  It's like eminent domain to the multinational corporate level.
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:09.040]  Okay.
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:10.040]  That's Ted Cruz for you.
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:15.040]  And so, you know, I don't, I see all these guys supporting crony capitalism.
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:18.040]  I see them all trashing the Constitution.
[03:14:18.040 --> 03:14:19.040]  Let me tell you something.
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:23.040]  If you support the War on Drugs, you're trashing the Constitution.
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:27.040]  Are there any of these candidates who have spoken out against the War on Drugs?
[03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:30.040]  And Bernie flirted with legalization of pot and that sort of thing.
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:31.040]  Okay.
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:36.040]  But I'm talking about the principle that the government can tell you what you can take
[03:14:36.040 --> 03:14:37.040]  and what you can't.
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:39.040]  I mean, that is absolute tyranny.
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:43.040]  Is it any surprise to us that the government thinks that it can force us to take vaccines?
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:48.040]  If it can tell you you can't take a medicine, and I'm talking about prescription drugs too,
[03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:50.040]  because we got the FDA, it's not just the DEA.
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:55.040]  If they can tell you which drugs you can take when you're sick and which you can't,
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:59.040]  even when you are a terminally ill patient, they won't allow you to make that decision
[03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:00.040]  for yourself, for your children.
[03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:05.040]  Then of course, they're not going to let you make the decision about a vaccine that they're
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:08.040]  going to force you to take because you don't own yourself.
[03:15:08.040 --> 03:15:09.040]  You're a slave.
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:10.040]  You're their property.
[03:15:10.040 --> 03:15:11.040]  You're their cattle.
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:12.040]  You're their chattel.
[03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:16.040]  So that's one aspect of it.
[03:15:16.040 --> 03:15:20.040]  Of course, the other part of it is that we have a constitutional amendment, and I've mentioned
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:21.040]  this many times.
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:27.040]  One day, I'm going to do a show, and I'm going to make the whole hour about this one thing
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:32.040]  because I've mentioned many times that we have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol,
[03:15:32.040 --> 03:15:37.040]  but we don't have a constitutional amendment to allow them to prohibit anything, marijuana,
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:40.040]  heroin, cocaine, the latest cancer drug.
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:43.040]  There's no constitutional amendment that gives them authority to do that.
[03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:46.040]  Why did we need a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol?
[03:15:46.040 --> 03:15:47.040]  Everybody agreed on that.
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:51.040]  Both parties, the entire nation, because they read the Constitution in those days and they
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:52.040]  cared about it.
[03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:56.040]  Why did we need a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol, but we don't need a constitutional
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:15:58.040]  amendment to prohibit the rest of this stuff?
[03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:02.040]  Or to force you to buy health insurance because that's where this all ends up.
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:04.040]  Or to force you to take an injection.
[03:16:04.040 --> 03:16:05.040]  Okay?
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:09.040]  So, one day, we're going to have a show here, and I'm going to ask people, just like we're
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:11.040]  going to take some of these calls about Donald Trump.
[03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:16.040]  I'm going to ask you to give me your opinion on this because I bring this up all the time,
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:20.040]  and what I hear is crickets, crickets.
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:21.040]  Nobody cares.
[03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:22.040]  Nobody cares.
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:25.040]  Nobody says, hey, David, you're full of beans.
[03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:27.040]  You don't understand the Constitution.
[03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:30.040]  We don't need a constitutional amendment to prohibit marijuana.
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:34.040]  We needed one for alcohol, sure, but we don't need one for alcohol, for marijuana.
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:36.040]  Nobody says, I'm wrong on the issue.
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:38.040]  Nobody wants to argue it with me.
[03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:40.040]  They just don't care.
[03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:41.040]  They just don't care.
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:42.040]  That's what I can't stand.
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:48.040]  I can't stand the apathy about the rule of law, about our individual liberty.
[03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:50.040]  That's what I can't stand about the war on drugs.
[03:16:50.040 --> 03:16:51.040]  I don't take the stuff.
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:57.040]  I would like to have the option if I get sick to use it medicinally, but I don't take pot.
[03:16:57.040 --> 03:16:59.040]  I don't oppose the war on drugs because of that.
[03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:04.040]  I oppose it because of the profit prisons where we've locked up the greatest proportion
[03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:11.040]  of people we've ever had in the world, in our country, and when we allow them to start
[03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:13.040]  the UN war on drugs.
[03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:14.040]  Understand that too, folks.
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:15.040]  I mentioned that too.
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:17.040]  Nobody else ever calls me about that either.
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:21.040]  You realize, because I didn't realize this one for a long time, the UN created the four
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:25.040]  schedules of drugs and even put the drugs in the schedules for us.
[03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:29.040]  And then 10 years later, Richard Nixon enacted it and said, oh, it's my war on drugs.
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:30.040]  No, it's not.
[03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:31.040]  It's the UN's war on drugs.
[03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:32.040]  It's the UN agenda.
[03:17:32.040 --> 03:17:34.040]  He made it in 1961.
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:38.040]  He called it the war on drugs and made it an agenda in 1971.
[03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:45.040]  So why is it that conservatives are so hardcore on supporting a UN agenda that destroys our
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:48.040]  property rights with civil asset forfeiture?
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:49.040]  Why is that?
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:50.040]  I don't understand.
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:51.040]  I'm getting off on that.
[03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:52.040]  It's one of my hobby horses.
[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:53.040]  Sorry about that, folks.
[03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:54.040]  I want to talk about the election.
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:17:55.040]  I want to talk about Donald Trump.
[03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:57.040]  I want to take your phone calls here.
[03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:00.040]  I said Trump is our illegal alien in the GOP establishment.
[03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:02.040]  Let me explain that to you.
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:05.040]  I'm going to begin this and we'll continue it on the next segment.
[03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:10.040]  In our lifetime, we've seen the debates, the political debates focused on things like
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:13.040]  that are really issues without a difference.
[03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:18.040]  They're a distinction between the parties, but they're really not a difference.
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:21.040]  Things like, how should we be taxed and how much should we be taxed?
[03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:25.040]  Who's going to get the tax money and how much tax money are they going to get?
[03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:28.040]  Who are we going to start the next war with?
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:33.040]  Those are the types of things that are typically fought back and forth in the primary debates
[03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:35.040]  and in the main general election debates.
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:40.040]  Then we also have the more divisive issues that really get us fighting against each other
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:42.040]  and get people to turn up at the polls.
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:46.040]  Stuff like issues like abortion, marriage, racism, feminism.
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:48.040]  Those are the things that make us mad.
[03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.040]  That gets us to turn up.
[03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.040]  Do they ever talk about individual liberty?
[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:52.040]  No.
[03:18:52.040 --> 03:18:57.040]  The only issue about individual liberty that they ever talk about is the Second Amendment.
[03:18:57.040 --> 03:19:01.040]  That's the only time it is even brought up.
[03:19:01.040 --> 03:19:05.040]  The rest of the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Constitution is a dead letter.
[03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:08.040]  It's never debated by the Democrats, by the GOP.
[03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:11.040]  I kind of had an epiphany as I'm looking at Donald Trump,
[03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.040]  and I disagree with him on so many of these issues.
[03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:15.040]  Of course, Rand Paul was still there.
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:19.040]  It's like, okay, well, I disagree with him on all these issues on imminent domain,
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:22.040]  crony capitalism, the authoritarian positions that he's taken on these things.
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:25.040]  But at least he's coming at me and telling me what he believes.
[03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:28.040]  He's got a Ted Cruz who's going to stab you in the back.
[03:19:28.040 --> 03:19:33.040]  Ted Cruz is going to scream about the neocons, as National Reviews said.
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:39.040]  He uses it as a dog whistle while he puts these neocons as his closest advisors
[03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:41.040]  and thinks you're not going to notice it.
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:43.040]  He's still screaming about the neocons.
[03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:45.040]  He's a warmonger himself.
[03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.040]  He thinks you don't notice it.
[03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:49.040]  He's a banker family himself.
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:52.040]  Goldman Sachs, CFR, the North American Union.
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:55.040]  Canada, so at least we have somebody coming out.
[03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:58.040]  So I'm going to break this down a little bit more when we come back. Stay with us.
[03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:06.040]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote
[03:20:06.040 --> 03:20:09.040]  goes to bat for you by in term life insurance.
[03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:12.040]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:12.040 --> 03:20:17.040]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:19.040]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:23.040]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price
[03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:27.040]  competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him
[03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:30.040]  for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:34.040]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:40.040]  experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:42.040]  for almost anyone.
[03:20:42.040 --> 03:20:43.040]  How about you?

[03:21:26.040 --> 03:21:54.040]  We shop, you save.
[03:21:54.040 --> 03:22:20.040]  We shop, you save.
[03:22:20.040 --> 03:22:46.040]  We shop, you save.
[03:22:46.040 --> 03:22:58.040]  We shop, you save.
[03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:01.040]  Hi there, are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:04.040]  Have you ever asked yourself how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:07.040]  Does your story go something like Stacy's story goes?
[03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:08.040]  Here's Stacy now.
[03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:16.040]  My husband and I went and visited a resort, and they kind of attacked us, and they kept sending more and more people,
[03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:19.040]  and so we finally said yes, and we bought this timeshare, and then we were stuck in this timeshare
[03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:22.040]  that we couldn't get rid of, and we tried all different ways.
[03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:26.040]  They made it seem like it was this really great deal, and when we said no originally,
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:29.040]  then they brought the price down, and then when we still said no,
[03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:32.040]  they brought it in the manager, and they brought the price down even lower,
[03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:35.040]  and they started breaking out in different ways to make it look like it was this really awesome deal.
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:37.040]  In reality, it wasn't an awesome deal at all.
[03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:40.040]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.
[03:23:40.040 --> 03:23:44.040]  It's an attorney-based program with a free consultation.

[03:23:54.040 --> 03:24:09.040]  That's 805873948.
[03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:11.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:13.040]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:14.040]  We're going to be going to our callers.
[03:24:14.040 --> 03:24:15.040]  Hang on.
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:18.040]  Vincent in Vermont, David in Arizona, Frank in Maryland.
[03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:26.040]  These are people who wanted to call and say why they did not like Trump or to take Alex or me to task for supporting Trump.
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:27.040]  I'm going to go to you guys.
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:38.040]  I want to briefly state why I have changed my position on Trump and try to get people to understand really what is at stake here.
[03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:44.040]  Before we do, and it's interesting, one of the callers that was on the last hour was absolutely livid with Alex
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:52.040]  because he supported Donald Trump and because he had not asked him a question about building 7.
[03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:53.040]  I don't know.
[03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:55.040]  I guess the guy is a long-time listener.
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:25:00.040]  I'm sure that as wound up and as angry as he was, it was probably because he was waiting so long.
[03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:02.040]  And I'm sorry you guys have waited a long time.
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:05.040]  You're going to wait a little bit longer, but I promise I'll get you on.
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:09.040]  But even with that, even as upset as he was, he said, yeah, yeah, I use your products.
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:10.040]  They're all really good.
[03:25:10.040 --> 03:25:12.040]  They've really changed my life.
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:14.040]  And you know, that really is true.
[03:25:14.040 --> 03:25:18.040]  We do have Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine back in stock.
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:24.040]  I just want to let you know because it not only changes your life, but it also, these products, doing things to help your health.
[03:25:24.040 --> 03:25:26.040]  It also supports our operation.
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:27.040]  That's how we fund our operation.
[03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:30.040]  I want to read you some of the reviews that we have on our website.
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:31.040]  You can go there.
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:38.040]  You can see what people say about how the products have affected them, not just the caller who was angry with Alex about Donald Trump.
[03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:40.040]  This is Rocky from New York.
[03:25:40.040 --> 03:25:41.040]  He said X2 is great.
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:43.040]  I feel a difference after about two days.
[03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:44.040]  I felt more focused, clear-minded.
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:46.040]  It was like I was in the zone.
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:47.040]  It really does work.
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.040]  It is a must-buy.
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:50.040]  Here's another one from SIG in Branson, Missouri.
[03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:56.040]  It says, my started thinning, I guess my hair started thinning in my late 40s.
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:25:58.040]  Now my hair is thickening and is more healthy.
[03:25:58.040 --> 03:25:59.040]  I feel better overall.
[03:25:59.040 --> 03:26:02.040]  Notice I am dragging if I forget to take it.
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:04.040]  This is the best of all similar products in the market.
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:06.040]  Do not waste your money on others.
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:10.040]  Again, you can go look at the reviews we have on InfowarsLife.com.
[03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:14.040]  Listen to the callers who are even angry with us and like our products.
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:16.040]  You can find that at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:21.040]  Survival Shield, Nascent Idyne, Survival Shield X2 is now back in stock.
[03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:26.040]  Now, real briefly, because I want to get to these callers, I want to continue with what I was saying.
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:34.040]  That is, the fact that we've had these debates where we've been offered issues that are distinctions but not differences, really,
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:37.040]  on some of the core things like war and money.
[03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:39.040]  They don't really offer us a distinction, a difference.
[03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:41.040]  Then they have their divisive issues, okay?
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:43.040]  Abortion, marriage, racism, feminism.
[03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:47.040]  Then they have one issue regarding our liberty.
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:49.040]  And that, of course, is the Second Amendment.
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:52.040]  So that's something that we can get excited about, that we can fight for.
[03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:55.040]  But they never discuss the rest of the Bill of Rights, okay?
[03:26:55.040 --> 03:26:58.040]  Think about the last presidential election.
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:04.040]  That was really, whether you realize it or not, that election, forget all the rest of the stuff that was talked about.
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:09.040]  That election was to set up the government control of healthcare.
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:12.040]  If you couldn't see it then, you've got to be able to see it now.
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:20.040]  You know that Mitt Romney with Ted Kennedy had enacted Obamacare in Massachusetts is exactly the same thing.
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:22.040]  People were saying it during the election.
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:26.040]  A lot of people weren't listening because they were so charged up about some of these other issues.
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:29.040]  Abortion, marriage, racism, feminism, they thought it was going to make a difference.
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:31.040]  And let me tell you something.
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:35.040]  This is one of the reasons why a lot of evangelicals are voting for Donald Trump.
[03:27:35.040 --> 03:27:39.040]  Because they have, since the 1980s in Ronald Reagan for 35 years,
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:42.040]  they've been thinking if they get the right guy in at presidency level,
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:45.040]  that it's going to make a difference on their social issues.
[03:27:45.040 --> 03:27:47.040]  And it hasn't, has it?
[03:27:47.040 --> 03:27:50.040]  It hasn't. It's not an effective strategy.
[03:27:50.040 --> 03:27:56.040]  You need to change hearts, Christians, using the power of the gospel in Jesus Christ,
[03:27:56.040 --> 03:27:59.040]  and not by condemning homosexuals to death.
[03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:03.040]  Not by getting up and screaming about that and then introducing Ted Cruz, okay?
[03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:05.040]  That's the video. We're going to talk about that at some point.
[03:28:05.040 --> 03:28:08.040]  But, you know, that's not the way you change hearts and minds.
[03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:11.040]  And you can't do it yourself, really, okay?
[03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:13.040]  It's going to take God. It's going to take the power of Christ.
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:18.040]  And you can put on all, you can, you know, put on all this white paint and everything,
[03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:20.040]  you know, white wash supplicors, okay?
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:23.040]  Painted tombs, that's what Jesus said.
[03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:28.040]  You can take the tomb with the death inside and you can put all this ornamentation on it, okay?
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:31.040]  But you're putting lipstick on a pig, but it's worse than that.
[03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:36.040]  It's just putting white paint on a tomb of death, okay?
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:38.040]  So, it isn't working.
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.040]  What you're doing isn't working social conservatives.
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:44.040]  The things that you're so passionate about isn't working.
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:48.040]  The last presidential election, whether you realize it or not, the rest of the stuff was a distraction.
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:53.040]  You know, you get Republicans and Democrats and Planned Parenthood moves on, okay?
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:57.040]  The bushes that you guys supported all the time, you didn't realize, did you?
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:02.040]  That every generation of bushes has been intricately linked with Planned Parenthood.
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:06.040]  Founders, financiers of Planned Parenthood, okay?
[03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:08.040]  Never bothered to do your research, did you?
[03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:09.040]  Okay?
[03:29:09.040 --> 03:29:10.040]  Now, it hasn't worked.
[03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:12.040]  You've been fooled.
[03:29:12.040 --> 03:29:16.040]  And the last election was about government control of healthcare.
[03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:18.040]  We would have gotten it whoever got in there.
[03:29:18.040 --> 03:29:22.040]  Many people say, oh, you know, we got, we got Obama care because Romney didn't win.
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:25.040]  No, the fix was in, the fix was in.
[03:29:25.040 --> 03:29:28.040]  The midterm elections that we had the last time.
[03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:31.040]  You thought they were about open borders, didn't you?
[03:29:31.040 --> 03:29:34.040]  You thought that you elected the GOP to fix the open borders.
[03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:35.040]  That's what they ran on.
[03:29:35.040 --> 03:29:37.040]  They said, well, we're going to undo Obamacare.
[03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:39.040]  We're only going to undo the open borders.
[03:29:39.040 --> 03:29:43.040]  No, they didn't because they're part of the establishment.
[03:29:43.040 --> 03:29:46.040]  Both parties, elites want the same thing.
[03:29:46.040 --> 03:29:47.040]  That's what you have to understand.
[03:29:47.040 --> 03:29:49.040]  When we come back, we're going to break it down.
[03:29:49.040 --> 03:29:55.040]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.040 --> 03:30:03.040]  Now that Trump has over 50% of the delegates needed to meet their arbitrary finish line,
[03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:06.040]  the establishment is doubling down on their arrogance.
[03:30:06.040 --> 03:30:09.040]  These folks are competing to join us.
[03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:13.040]  Yes, but they're competing to become the president of the United States.
[03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:18.040]  And so they are looking for voters, tall voters to vote for them.
[03:30:18.040 --> 03:30:20.040]  The point is this, right?
[03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:21.040]  No, they're not.
[03:30:21.040 --> 03:30:25.040]  That's RNC Chair Priebus explaining to a shocked CNN reporter
[03:30:25.040 --> 03:30:28.040]  that the voters in an election don't matter.
[03:30:28.040 --> 03:30:31.040]  The candidates are auditioning to join the establishment.
[03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:34.040]  Hurley Hogland, an unbound GOP delegate,
[03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:38.040]  echoes RNC Chair Priebus telling CNBC that media has created the perception
[03:30:38.040 --> 03:30:41.040]  that voters choose the nominee.
[03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:44.040]  He questioned why primaries and caucuses are even held.
[03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:47.040]  Also today, former Speaker John Boehner says he wants the nomination handed to Ryan,
[03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:50.040]  saying they all had a chance to win and none of them won.
[03:30:50.040 --> 03:30:53.040]  Trump, however, has won 64% of state elections,
[03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:56.040]  and the wheels are coming off the establishment's rigged system.
[03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:58.040]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:58.040 --> 03:31:00.040]  Our listeners, over the past two years,
[03:31:00.040 --> 03:31:05.040]  tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[03:31:05.040 --> 03:31:08.040]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months,
[03:31:08.040 --> 03:31:12.040]  needed to get my digestive system working correctly again,
[03:31:12.040 --> 03:31:14.040]  so I stumbled on the X2.
[03:31:14.040 --> 03:31:18.040]  When we look at a product like survival shield nascent iodine X2,
[03:31:18.040 --> 03:31:22.040]  it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:31:22.040 --> 03:31:24.040]  I needed the deep talks, basically.
[03:31:24.040 --> 03:31:27.040]  I started taking X2 first for about seven days,
[03:31:27.040 --> 03:31:29.040]  and then I did the deep clings.
[03:31:29.040 --> 03:31:32.040]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:31:32.040 --> 03:31:34.040]  What do you have to lose?
[03:31:34.040 --> 03:31:36.040]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty,
[03:31:36.040 --> 03:31:40.040]  and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life
[03:31:40.040 --> 03:31:43.040]  and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:47.040]  I noticed a significant change in my digestive flow.
[03:31:47.040 --> 03:31:49.040]  I was really more natural.

[03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:20.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.040 --> 03:33:21.040]  I'm your host.
[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:26.040]  Yeah, everything there is a season turning, and we are in a season of turning right now.
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:29.040]  We may be coming into the fourth turning.
[03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:32.040]  That's a book. We'll talk about that some other time.
[03:33:32.040 --> 03:33:34.040]  I've mentioned that book before.
[03:33:34.040 --> 03:33:36.040]  If you don't know about what I'm talking about,
[03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:42.040]  and of course we had a caller at the end of the last hour talking to Alex about 1984
[03:33:42.040 --> 03:33:47.040]  that he had just read, yeah, the clock is striking 13 right now, folks.
[03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:53.040]  Things are not right in this country, and we are at a crossroads to make a big decision,
[03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:55.040]  and we have an opportunity right now.
[03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:59.040]  As I said before, Trump is our illegal alien inside the GOP establishment.
[03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:02.040]  I'm going to break down what I mean by that right now.
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:06.040]  As I mentioned before, in the last presidential election, we didn't really have a choice.
[03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:09.040]  We had, we get the choice of persons.
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:12.040]  Do you like this guy, Obama, or do you like this guy, Mitt Romney?
[03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:20.040]  Mitt Romney is this old fighting whitey kind of persona, you know, and Barack Obama is this young hip black guy.
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:22.040]  Okay, that's one of the choices that we could choose.
[03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:25.040]  I don't think it could get you fired up on some of these cultural issues.
[03:34:25.040 --> 03:34:29.040]  But the reality is that that presidential election was about Obamacare.
[03:34:29.040 --> 03:34:33.040]  It was about government control of healthcare, and it would have come to us as Obamacare.
[03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:35.040]  It would have come to us as Romneycare.
[03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:41.040]  Romneycare had already been done by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts with the mandate, with all the rest of the stuff.
[03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:47.040]  And in the last election, the midterm election, people said, we don't like Obamacare.
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:49.040]  We don't like the mandates. We don't like the open borders.
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:51.040]  We're going to elect the GOP.
[03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.040]  The GOP said, we're going to fix it. We're going to fix it.
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:55.040]  The GOP won. Nothing happened.
[03:34:55.040 --> 03:34:58.040]  Okay, see, you didn't get Obamacare because Obama won.
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:01.040]  You weren't going to get that one way or the other.
[03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:08.040]  And you thought that when you elected the GOP people, they were going to do something about what they've been talking about.
[03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:12.040]  But you don't understand. That was never an option.
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:18.040]  Did you ever see any plan about what they were going to do in place of Obamacare?
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:22.040]  How they were going to shut it down or what they were going to replace it with or how they were going to modify it?
[03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:27.040]  No, you never saw the plan because they never planned on doing anything.
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:30.040]  You understand that? You understand that?
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:36.040]  There was no plan because they never had any intention of changing Obamacare.
[03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:41.040]  Now, I thought it was interesting in the next of the last debate, the last debate that I watched,
[03:35:41.040 --> 03:35:47.040]  the one that was Donald Trump debating Fox News and the other three candidates,
[03:35:47.040 --> 03:35:51.040]  where they had their PowerPoint presentations and everything to come after Donald Trump.
[03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:55.040]  And yet they never talked about his new healthcare initiative,
[03:35:55.040 --> 03:35:59.040]  even though he had just put it out that week and couple of days earlier.
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:01.040]  I mean, they could have picked that apart, couldn't they?
[03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:02.040]  Well, they didn't.
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:08.040]  And the reason they didn't was because he has a plan to get rid of Obamacare.
[03:36:08.040 --> 03:36:11.040]  It's a seven point plan and it is a free market plan.
[03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:14.040]  And there wasn't anything that they could find wrong with it, folks.
[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:17.040]  I've looked at it. It's a great plan. You should take a look at it.
[03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:20.040]  It's a free market solution.
[03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:22.040]  It makes things better, okay?
[03:36:22.040 --> 03:36:25.040]  It replaces the mandate with a choice.
[03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:29.040]  It gives you the information to make choices, okay?
[03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:33.040]  By opening up transparency about what it costs at different doctors, at different hospitals.
[03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:37.040]  It gives you the flexibility and the competition of a marketplace
[03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:41.040]  by saying that insurance companies can compete across state lines.
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:46.040]  They want to tell you that we have to have free trade for globalist purposes, okay?
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:48.040]  That we have to have free trade with China.
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:50.040]  We've got to have free trade with Mexico.
[03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:52.040]  We've got to send our jobs and factories abroad.
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:57.040]  But we can't have free trade within the United States when it comes to insurance policies.
[03:36:57.040 --> 03:36:58.040]  There can't be any competition.
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:00.040]  Do you understand what's going on?
[03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:05.040]  Do you understand how they're rigging this game for their multinational corporations
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:07.040]  for the guys that they work for in Washington?
[03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:09.040]  And so Donald Trump, when he's talking about it, says,
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:12.040]  we're going to allow him to compete across state lines.
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:16.040]  Of course, little Marco Rubio is sitting there constantly talking over him,
[03:37:16.040 --> 03:37:18.040]  saying, you keep repeating state lines.
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:20.040]  You keep repeating state lines because he kept interrupting him.
[03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:24.040]  He wouldn't let him even talk about that one aspect.
[03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:27.040]  And of course, Fox News didn't want to ask any questions about it
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:29.040]  because it's a free market solution.
[03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:31.040]  It would have health savings accounts.
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:33.040]  It would give you incentives to save money
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:35.040]  because if you would save the money,
[03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:39.040]  then that would be money that you would keep in your health savings account
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:41.040]  and could eventually pass on to your children or something.
[03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:43.040]  It gives you an incentive to save.
[03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:45.040]  It gives you the tools to save information.
[03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:47.040]  It creates a competitive marketplace.
[03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:50.040]  It takes away the mandate and replaces it with a choice.
[03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:52.040]  But they don't want to talk about that
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:55.040]  because the GOP doesn't want to get rid of Obamacare.
[03:37:55.040 --> 03:37:57.040]  They never had a plan.
[03:37:57.040 --> 03:37:59.040]  And they don't want to talk about the plan
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:01.040]  when somebody comes up with a free market plan.
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:04.040]  They never planned on changing it.
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:05.040]  Understand that.
[03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:07.040]  That's what that election was not about.
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:09.040]  You thought it was about that and you're angry
[03:38:09.040 --> 03:38:10.040]  because it didn't do anything.
[03:38:10.040 --> 03:38:11.040]  It was never about that.
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:13.040]  You need to understand what this election is about.
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:15.040]  It's about open borders.
[03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:17.040]  That's not principally about cheap labor, okay?
[03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:20.040]  It's really about balkanizing the nations
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:23.040]  and destroying the cultures and the nations
[03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:25.040]  that can oppose the globalists
[03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:27.040]  who are trying to enact their agenda.
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:29.040]  You understand that?
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:31.040]  The nations, America and the West
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:33.040]  need to be taken down.
[03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:36.040]  Their cultures, their nations need to be destroyed.
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:38.040]  You need to balkanize them.
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:40.040]  Bring in people who aren't going to assimilate
[03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:43.040]  or bring them in quickly enough so that they won't assimilate.
[03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:45.040]  Bring in the Muslims who are not going to assimilate.
[03:38:45.040 --> 03:38:47.040]  They're going to self-balkanize.
[03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:50.040]  They're going to isolate themselves in little ghettos.
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:52.040]  They're not going to get involved with the culture at large.
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:54.040]  Then they're going to get angry
[03:38:54.040 --> 03:38:56.040]  because they're poor inside of a rich nation
[03:38:56.040 --> 03:38:58.040]  and there's going to be a fight.
[03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:00.040]  That's the purpose, okay?
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:02.040]  And if you bring enough people in from a country
[03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:04.040]  that doesn't speak your language, has a different culture
[03:39:04.040 --> 03:39:07.040]  and you bring them in in sufficiently large numbers,
[03:39:07.040 --> 03:39:10.040]  they will self-ghettos as well.
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:13.040]  Now, they will engage to a larger degree
[03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:16.040]  with the culture, but it's about destroying the cultures,
[03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:18.040]  about destroying the nations.
[03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:20.040]  Then you want to make sure that you migrate
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:22.040]  from production to countries with cheap labor.
[03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:24.040]  That's what they call free trade.
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:26.040]  That's not free trade, folks.
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:28.040]  That is managed trade. It's a managed economy.
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:31.040]  And I've got an article here about Ted Cruz
[03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:34.040]  who last June was going on radio shows
[03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:37.040]  pushing back against Senator Sessions.
[03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:39.040]  Senator Sessions, the only senator
[03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:42.040]  who took the time to look at the TPP
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:45.040]  this trade treaty, okay, this abomination,
[03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:48.040]  he took the time to read through this thing,
[03:39:48.040 --> 03:39:51.040]  he created not a PowerPoint presentation
[03:39:51.040 --> 03:39:53.040]  because he didn't do it on a computer screen,
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:56.040]  but he basically had a presentation with charts
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:39:58.040]  and all this kind of stuff.
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:00.040]  He stood up before the Senate, gave his presentation,
[03:40:00.040 --> 03:40:02.040]  and of course, Ted Cruz comes out and goes,
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:04.040]  no, it's not a living document.
[03:40:04.040 --> 03:40:06.040]  It's not going to destroy our sovereignty.
[03:40:06.040 --> 03:40:09.040]  He likes the TPP, but he doesn't say why, okay?
[03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:12.040]  We've got Senator Sessions explaining why.
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:14.040]  He read it. He says, this is what it says,
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:16.040]  and this is what it will do.
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:19.040]  And then Ted Cruz as a so typical of Ted Cruz
[03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:22.040]  comes in and says, no, it's not going to do that.
[03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:23.040]  I've looked at it, I know better.
[03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:25.040]  I don't have to give you an explanation.
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:28.040]  See, whenever it is something that is convenient
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:30.040]  for Ted Cruz's personal ambition,
[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:32.040]  he just makes a pronouncement like he does
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:33.040]  with natural born citizen.
[03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:34.040]  Oh, I'm a constitutional lawyer.
[03:40:34.040 --> 03:40:36.040]  I've argued before the Supreme Court.
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:39.040]  I've looked at this, I'm qualified, shut up and sit down.
[03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:41.040]  He's not going to tell you why
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:43.040]  he's qualified as a natural born citizen.
[03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:45.040]  So he does the same thing with a globalist agenda.
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:47.040]  All right, now, if you don't understand
[03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:49.040]  that this is about open borders
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:52.040]  to destroy the countries that can oppose the globalist.
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:55.040]  If you don't understand that this is about
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:57.040]  migrating production to cheap labor countries,
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:00.040]  but more importantly to manage the economies
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:02.040]  of these same countries so they can destroy them.
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:04.040]  And then in a positive way,
[03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:07.040]  the climate change treaties will fund this global government.
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:09.040]  They will give it a mission.
[03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:11.040]  They will give it a reason for existence.
[03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:13.040]  We need to have a world government
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:15.040]  because we've got world climate change.
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:18.040]  And we need to have a global carbon tax.
[03:41:18.040 --> 03:41:20.040]  If you don't understand those three things,
[03:41:20.040 --> 03:41:22.040]  you don't understand what this election is about.
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:24.040]  And let me tell you something, the only candidate,
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:26.040]  and the reason why they're fighting him tooth and nail,
[03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:30.040]  the only candidate who opposes that is Donald Trump.
[03:41:30.040 --> 03:41:34.040]  He's the only candidate who has been authentic on this issue.
[03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:37.040]  He has opposed that for 35 years.
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:41.040]  He has opposed the economic globalism for 35 years.
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:43.040]  He's authentic on that issue.
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:45.040]  So if you don't understand that,
[03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:47.040]  then you're going to lose your country.
[03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:49.040]  You're going to lose the West.
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:51.040]  And then the only way you're going to get back
[03:41:51.040 --> 03:41:53.040]  the Constitution at some point in the future
[03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:57.040]  is with a violent revolution against a global world government
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:01.040]  that has all of the tools that Eisenhower warned us about.
[03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:03.040]  All the artificial intelligence,
[03:42:03.040 --> 03:42:06.040]  the autonomous killing robots, nuclear bombs, you name it.
[03:42:06.040 --> 03:42:08.040]  You're going to fight a war against that institution
[03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:10.040]  if you lose this political battle.
[03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:13.040]  And so that's why I say Donald Trump is our illegal alien
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:15.040]  in the GOP establishment.
[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:18.040]  He is there to do to their political establishment
[03:42:18.040 --> 03:42:20.040]  what they are trying to do with the open borders
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:23.040]  with the trade treaties to us, okay?
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:27.040]  Now, this political situation that's coming up,
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:30.040]  this political war that has already begun.
[03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:35.040]  And again, let's play that clip of Reince Priebus, okay?
[03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:38.040]  We've played this clip before. Let's play it one more time.
[03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:40.040]  Let's keep it in mind.
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:43.040]  You asked a question in a way that I think is a little bit...
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:47.040]  These folks are competing to join us.
[03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:49.040]  I mean, that's what's happening, right?
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:52.040]  So they're competing to join the Republican Party
[03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:56.040]  as our nominee depending on what the delegates decide to do
[03:42:56.040 --> 03:42:59.040]  or who wins the requisite amount of delegates
[03:42:59.040 --> 03:43:02.040]  or whoever that is joins... joins...
[03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:04.040]  That's what they're doing, though.
[03:43:04.040 --> 03:43:07.040]  They're competing to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
[03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:10.040]  They're competing to become the president of the Republican Party.
[03:43:10.040 --> 03:43:12.040]  You don't understand. They're trying to join us.
[03:43:12.040 --> 03:43:14.040]  She thinks there's an election.
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:16.040]  To vote for them. I mean, that point is this, right?
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:18.040]  No. Let's stop that because they keep on going.
[03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:20.040]  This goes on a long time and he's kept...
[03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:23.040]  No, no, no, no, no. You're not listening to me, Priebus says.
[03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:26.040]  I mean, he's the chair of the RNC. You're not listening to me.
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:29.040]  She says, yeah, kind of, but there's an election going on.
[03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:31.040]  No, no, no. You don't understand.
[03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:33.040]  They're trying to join us.
[03:43:33.040 --> 03:43:35.040]  Now they're being a lot more open about this.
[03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:38.040]  Here's this article today. We choose the nominee, not the voters,
[03:43:38.040 --> 03:43:41.040]  says a senior GOP official.
[03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:45.040]  This is somebody who was interviewed on CNBC today.
[03:43:45.040 --> 03:43:49.040]  He says, and this person is Curly Hoglin or Haglin,
[03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:52.040]  an unbound GOP delegate from North Dakota.
[03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:55.040]  He goes on CNBC's Squawk Box and he says,
[03:43:55.040 --> 03:43:58.040]  the media has created the perception that voters choose the nominee.
[03:43:58.040 --> 03:44:00.040]  See? That's what...
[03:44:00.040 --> 03:44:02.040]  Alison Camarado, CNN is confused.
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:06.040]  Well, wait a minute. We're having an election and voters are choosing the nominee, right?
[03:44:06.040 --> 03:44:09.040]  No, no, no, no, no, no, says Priebus.
[03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:11.040]  And this guy, who was an unbound GOP delegate,
[03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:13.040]  he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:16.040]  The media has created that perception that voters are choosing the nominee.
[03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:18.040]  No, that's the conflict here.
[03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:21.040]  You people in the media are lying to the public and you've been doing it a long time.
[03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:23.040]  You've been telling them there's this thing called an election.
[03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:28.040]  No, it is a selection. It is a coronation that's going on.
[03:44:28.040 --> 03:44:30.040]  Okay? And he even goes on.
[03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:33.040]  He questions why we even hold primaries and caucuses.
[03:44:33.040 --> 03:44:37.040]  Yeah, they're useless because we're the ones who are deciding.
[03:44:37.040 --> 03:44:39.040]  They're trying to join us.
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:40.040]  Okay?
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:45.040]  Hogland is one of 112 Republican delegates who are not required to cast their support for anyone candidate
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:48.040]  because their states and territories don't hold primaries or caucuses.
[03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:50.040]  And he goes on and says this.
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:55.040]  He says, at the convention, we could introduce Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney
[03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:58.040]  or it could be other candidates that have already been in the race
[03:44:58.040 --> 03:45:00.040]  and are now out of the race like Huckabee or Santorum.
[03:45:00.040 --> 03:45:03.040]  All those people could eventually become a candidate on the floor.
[03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:08.040]  People will say, hmm, oh, and that's actually, that's not the same guy.
[03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:11.040]  That's another unbound delegate from North Dakota.
[03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:13.040]  Because see, they all think like this.
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:16.040]  You know, it's not just Ryan's previous, the chair.
[03:45:16.040 --> 03:45:20.040]  It's not just one delegate or two delegates.
[03:45:20.040 --> 03:45:21.040]  They all think that way.
[03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:24.040]  They don't really care what you think.
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:26.040]  And it doesn't matter.
[03:45:26.040 --> 03:45:27.040]  Rule 40 doesn't matter.
[03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:31.040]  Remember, they enacted rule 40 so they could keep Ron Paul from being nominated
[03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:33.040]  so they could keep Ron Paul from making a speech.
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:39.040]  It was very important that Ron Paul not be allowed to speak at the last GOP presidential nominating convention.
[03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:41.040]  So they passed a special rule to shut him up.
[03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:42.040]  That's the way they operate.
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:49.040]  We saw the thieving actions of Mitt Romney and his staff rigging the elections
[03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:52.040]  and state after state, anybody that was paying attention, I got very angry.
[03:45:52.040 --> 03:45:56.040]  And I got very angry, quite frankly, that Ron Paul wouldn't stand up and call him out on it.
[03:45:56.040 --> 03:45:59.040]  Now, I'm telling you, Donald Trump will call him out on it.
[03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:02.040]  And his supporters will call him out on it because we had it.
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:03.040]  We had it with these guys.
[03:46:03.040 --> 03:46:08.040]  And he goes on to say, the rules are still designed to have a political party to choose its nominated convention.
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:09.040]  That's just the way it is.
[03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:11.040]  I can't help it. Don't hate me because I like the rule.
[03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:12.040]  I love the rules.
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:14.040]  Okay, no, he writes the rules.
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:21.040]  They wrote rule 40 just before the convention and it said you had to win eight states in order to be nominated.
[03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:28.040]  Now, only two people have won eight states. Cruz has won just barely eight states at this point.
[03:46:28.040 --> 03:46:30.040]  Donald Trump has won way more than that.
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:35.040]  Donald Trump has a win-loss record of 21 wins and 12 losses.
[03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:38.040]  Ted Cruz has eight wins, 25 losses.
[03:46:38.040 --> 03:46:45.040]  And then we have the great hope of the establishment, John Kasich, who's had one win and 32 losses.
[03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:47.040]  Okay, he's won 3%.
[03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:50.040]  Okay, Ted Cruz has won 24%.
[03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:54.040]  Donald Trump has won 64% of the states that are out there.
[03:46:54.040 --> 03:46:56.040]  Now, what do they need in terms of remaining delegates?
[03:46:56.040 --> 03:47:00.040]  Well, Trump needs to win 54% of the remaining delegates.
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:04.040]  Cruz needs to win 76% of the remaining delegates.
[03:47:04.040 --> 03:47:06.040]  That's getting kind of not possible, isn't it?
[03:47:06.040 --> 03:47:10.040]  And Kasich needs to win 99%.
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:14.040]  Okay, and it's going to change a little bit because they haven't allocated the delegates from Illinois and Missouri.
[03:47:14.040 --> 03:47:22.040]  And of course, it's going to change to Trump's advantage because he's going to win more of the delegates in those two states because he won them.
[03:47:22.040 --> 03:47:24.040]  Now, there are 21 states that are remaining.
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:26.040]  11 of them are winner-take-all.
[03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:30.040]  That means that 52% of the states remaining are winner-take-all.
[03:47:30.040 --> 03:47:36.040]  So all this stuff about your proportional delegates, all this stuff about doing this stuff at convention and everything,
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:38.040]  okay, that may or may not happen.
[03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:43.040]  But I just want you to understand the arrogance of these people who think that you don't count, that the elections don't count.
[03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:45.040]  This is the way it's been for a long time.
[03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:48.040]  This is why we've said elections are totally rigged.
[03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:57.040]  And the person who has been able to climb over the fence to sneak into their country is Donald Trump, our illegal alien in the GOP.
[03:47:57.040 --> 03:48:00.040]  Good for him. Good for him. He's breaking this up.
[03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:08.040]  And the GOP is going to be either, there's going to be either a hostile takeover of it or it is going to crash and burn and we're going to create a new party.
[03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:13.040]  Now, John Boehner, they floated Paul Ryan. These other guys are floating Paul Ryan.
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:15.040]  They're talking about Paul Ryan.
[03:48:15.040 --> 03:48:17.040]  And John Boehner floats his name.
[03:48:17.040 --> 03:48:20.040]  He says, if we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, this is John Boehner.
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:22.040]  And of course, where's John Boehner from?
[03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:24.040]  He's from Ohio, okay?
[03:48:24.040 --> 03:48:36.040]  And I just, when I saw him making this pronouncement today, I thought, is this, is he just filled with hubris after he just helped to rig the Ohio election for John Kasich?
[03:48:36.040 --> 03:48:42.040]  You know, they can make up a two or three percent lead of somebody.
[03:48:42.040 --> 03:48:46.040]  If it's narrow in an area, they can turn it into a big victory, okay?
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:51.040]  The reason they haven't been able to do it is because Donald Trump has been getting record turnout.
[03:48:51.040 --> 03:48:54.040]  That's the only reason they haven't been able to rig these state elections enough.
[03:48:54.040 --> 03:48:56.040]  They've rigged them. Believe me, they've rigged them.
[03:48:56.040 --> 03:49:00.040]  They've done point shaving and they've done stuff like I believe they've done in Ohio.
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:06.040]  I don't have any evidence of that. I'm just going by my gut feeling. I'm going about what I've watched for my entire life.
[03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:17.040]  And I'm telling you, with what we saw yesterday, with what we saw in Ohio and with John Boehner crowing about how they're going to make their own appointment, I'm telling you, he thinks they rigged the election, I think.
[03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:21.040]  He says, if we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I'm for none of the above, said Boehner.
[03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:25.040]  They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:30.040]  And of course, Paul Ryan has come out and said, no, no, I'm grateful, but I would not accept the nomination.
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:34.040]  You heard that before, didn't you, when it was all about the Speaker of the House stuff.
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:38.040]  Now, I've said I'm going to give these guys a chance to weigh in and I've talked a long time.
[03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:41.040]  Let me go right away to Vincent and Vermont. Go ahead, Vincent.
[03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:43.040]  Yeah, hi. Can you hear me?
[03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:45.040]  Yes, go ahead. You're on.
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:56.040]  All right, I think personally, Donald Trump's only way of winning is to pull out of the Republican primaries and go all in independent,
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:50:00.040]  pulling somebody maybe like Jesse Ventura for his VP.
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:07.040]  And that might sound crazy, but then that gives Donald Trump an opportunity to move himself more to the center.
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:13.040]  And nobody's going to kill Donald Trump or assassinate him if Jesse Ventura is the vice president.
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:15.040]  That's for darn sure.
[03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:19.040]  Well, I don't know, you know, I would just say because they're afraid of Jesse Ventura as a president.
[03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:25.040]  Yeah, I don't know. I think it will be. It'll either be a hostile takeover of the GOP or I think you will run as an independent.
[03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:33.040]  But look, the GOP has ballot access and I've worked with third parties and I know how difficult it is to get on the ballot as an independent or as a political party.
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:39.040]  And that's why it's a lot better to try to take over the GOP than it is to try to go the independent route.
[03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:45.040]  I mean, that is a smart way to go and I'm glad that he's doing it. They absolutely hate that he's there.
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:47.040]  Thanks for, thanks for calling.
[03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:53.040]  Hang on. We're going to come right back with Vincent closing comments with David in Arizona and with Frank in Maryland. We'll be right back.
[03:50:53.040 --> 03:51:10.040]  My name is Don Whisken. In 1994, I lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass surgery. In 1977, my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:10.040 --> 03:51:20.040]  He suffered a heart attack. In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed. 21 days later, my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:25.040]  He waited too long. In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:33.040]  What did I do? I took a seven herb formula I now call Extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginko, buloba, hawthorn, milk, thistle and valerian.
[03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:41.040]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, Extendivite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood and improve your immune system.

[03:53:58.040 --> 03:54:18.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and in this final segment we're going to try to get to these three callers who have held over.
[03:54:18.040 --> 03:54:30.040]  There's a lot of products there just as you heard the caller who talked to Alex about Building 7 even though he's really upset with Alex about not bringing that topic up with Donald Trump.
[03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:35.040]  He said these products have changed his life. Go to our website. Go to InfowarsLife.com.
[03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:41.040]  Look at the reviews there. Look at what other people have said about how these have changed their lives, how they have used them.
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:53.040]  Again, we have Supermail Vitality back in stock. We've got Survival Shield X2 in stock and of course there's been a lot of news that has come out this last week about the importance of gut health and iodine plays a big part in that.
[03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:59.040]  Again, InfowarsLife.com. Real quickly, Vincent and Vermont, finish up with a point that you want to make.
[03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:11.040]  Alright, I'll just be real quick. I just want to confirm for Alex that it's a Social Security office and there was a non-English speaking person there getting his Social Security card with an interpreter.
[03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:20.040]  And when they filled out his application, the lady gave him his card and the interpreter was shocked and was like, you already got the Social Security card?
[03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:24.040]  And she was like, yeah, it was already in the computer. We're just printing it out for him.
[03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:33.040]  And I thought that was amazing. They make it easy. When Kasek says in his first 100 days he's going to put through amnesty, okay, that's a big dog whistle to everybody.
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:39.040]  Come on in. Get in the country. We're going to close the doors later. Maybe. Who knows? I don't know.
[03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:44.040]  Thanks, Vincent. Let's go to David in Arizona. David. Thank you, David.
[03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:57.040]  I just understood the nature that you wanted the freedom to centers calling in. God help us. And I'm a Trump supporter. I believe in him.
[03:55:57.040 --> 03:56:09.040]  And if he's real, he's the last chance America's got. You know, I'm 70 years old. It's taken me a long time to get where you and AJ are at.
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:16.040]  You guys are wise beyond your years. Well, we're always learning. And you know, I agree with you. I don't think Donald Trump is perfect.
[03:56:16.040 --> 03:56:23.040]  No man is perfect. Okay, he's got flaws in his life. And he disagrees with me on issues. At least he's up front about it.
[03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:28.040]  I have no illusion that somehow he's going to magically change and become libertarian, okay?
[03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:33.040]  But at least we can have an honest discussion about that. And with him being honest and up front about where he is on these issues,
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:38.040]  it makes it easier to have that honest discussion with an individual, even if they disagree with you.
[03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:44.040]  And so I'm not looking at him for being as being perfect. And I agree with you. You know, I don't know. Have you ever voted before?
[03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:46.040]  Are you a new voter?
[03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:50.040]  No, no, I voted for John Kennedy.
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:57.040]  Oh, okay. Okay. So you've been voting a long time and you're probably not happy with what you've been getting. Are you?
[03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:11.040]  Oh, absolutely not. I was 75th Rangers sent to Vietnam TTY for two years, Special Operations, after I was trained at the Classified School of America.
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:19.040]  So I was the only, at the time, the only enlisted man 19 years old to go there for a year.
[03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:25.040]  Wow. You have experienced it on one end of it that I have not experienced it on. That's truly amazing.
[03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:31.040]  I'm at the very center of things with Vietnam and the college. That's amazing.
[03:57:31.040 --> 03:57:40.040]  My innocence started dying in Vietnam. I just, I'm shocked. There's obviously a treasonous agenda to totally destroy America.
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:41.040]  Yes, yes.
[03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:50.040]  I love this country and I can't believe that people are supporting so many people are supporting it. Trees and tyranny, aid and comfort to our enemies.
[03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:53.040]  These are capital offenses against America.
[03:57:53.040 --> 03:58:03.040]  I agree with you, David. And I got to go to the other caller and I would just sum up and say, you know, because they have been sold the idea that they're going to somehow be safe and prosperous if they give this up.
[03:58:03.040 --> 03:58:12.040]  And I hear the music coming in real quickly. Frank and Marilyn, just got a few seconds. Go ahead. Give us your, hey, got 20 seconds.
[03:58:12.040 --> 03:58:23.040]  Yeah, here in Maryland, I'm considering Trump. But the delegates here are going to libel from Trump. He's in the lead now and they're going to try to give it to Cruz.
[03:58:23.040 --> 03:58:30.040]  Anyway, I know it's ideal though. He's giving up their bait to get to A-PAC. He's courting them, it sounds like.
[03:58:30.040 --> 03:58:38.040]  Yeah, that's something we have to watch. But of course, he's talked to a Jewish group before and said, hey, you don't support me. You're not thinking this through because you can't own me.
[03:58:38.040 --> 03:58:42.040]  Join us tonight for the Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
