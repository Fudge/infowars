[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  It's Friday, March 17th, 2023, I'm your host Alex Shells, we've got a big broadcast
[00:12.720 --> 00:38.320]  on Friday, March 17th, 2023, I'm your host Alex Shells, we've got a big broadcast on Friday,
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.880]  we've got a live Friday transmission and I wanted to be here for the whole broadcast
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.740]  today, but I've had some family issues come up and I've got to attend to, but I'm going
[00:46.740 --> 00:49.580]  to be in and out of the office here today during the broadcast.
[00:49.580 --> 00:54.260]  Oh, the destroyer's going to be hosting with Roger Stone, co-hosting in the first hour,
[00:54.260 --> 00:58.200]  they're coming up in about five minutes or five minutes, exactly.
[00:58.200 --> 01:06.840]  And then in the second hour, Martha Chansley, mother of Jake or Jacob Chansley, the J6 Q
[01:06.840 --> 01:14.440]  We'll be joining us and I'm going to take something that I'm going to air right before
[01:14.440 --> 01:19.960]  she comes on because I'm going to issue an apology to Jacob Chansley for the way I handle
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.560]  things in hindsight then at the time, because I knew he was innocent.
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.560]  I knew he was being set up.
[01:24.560 --> 01:29.080]  I was a little mad at him when he came on the show, I think two days after.
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.840]  But in hindsight, I could have done a better job, so I'm going to talk about that coming
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.840]  up.
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.840]  So it gives him go for him, free Jake.
[01:38.840 --> 01:46.760]  He saw Elon Musk come out just last week and say, free the Q shaman.
[01:46.760 --> 01:49.520]  That's what he's known as, not Jacob Chansley.
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.840]  And we're all Jacob Chansley because they let him in, they brought him in, he thanked
[01:52.840 --> 02:00.360]  the police, they thanked him and that was not allowed to be seen by the jury and he's
[02:00.360 --> 02:05.560]  spending four years in prison when the left runs around burning down whole cities and
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.600]  then gets bailed out by the now vice president Kamala Harris.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.600]  So that's coming up now.
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.240]  That's in the second hour.
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.800]  World War Three, the election to Sanis Trump, the poison shots.
[02:23.800 --> 02:32.880]  What's happening with J six, all of it with Roger Stone, with Owen Shroyer coming up in
[02:32.880 --> 02:33.880]  the first hour.
[02:33.880 --> 02:41.480]  And as I said, Martha Chansley, mother of Jake Chansley, a six political prisoner,
[02:41.480 --> 02:48.080]  AKA the Q shaman in the second hour today.
[02:48.080 --> 02:51.920]  And they have launched this fundraiser.
[02:51.920 --> 02:58.800]  The goal is $55,000, which is nothing for legal bills.
[02:58.800 --> 03:00.960]  And he's raised $20,000.
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.720]  I really want to raise that money today and I know I come to the well.
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.240]  I come to the audience constantly and we had James O'Keefe on yesterday, relaunching
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.240]  his new O'Keefe media group and I'm just here supporting if you choose so.
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.360]  And then I'm supporting this kind of supporting that person, this lady.
[03:18.360 --> 03:20.240]  I'm just trying to do the best job I can.
[03:20.240 --> 03:21.480]  You choose where you want to support.
[03:21.480 --> 03:22.480]  You choose what you want to do.
[03:22.480 --> 03:24.880]  We don't keep info wars afloat, which really needs your support.
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.000]  We won't be here infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,

[03:55.800 --> 03:56.800]  people in the fight.
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.600]  And you realize that support is you who are the foundation of the superstructure and the
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.600]  whole building.

[04:03.200 --> 04:04.200]  You're not even the dog.
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.880]  You're the whole dog, the whole tail, the fur, the skin, the brain, the eyes, the guts,
[04:08.880 --> 04:10.480]  the bones.
[04:10.480 --> 04:11.480]  You are everything.
[04:11.480 --> 04:15.720]  So I'm very humbly thankful to all of you, but you also realize what's done to Alex Jones
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.320]  today, what's done to the Q shaman today can and will be done to you tomorrow.
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.360]  The Justice Department just announced yesterday.
[04:23.360 --> 04:29.880]  They're planning at least a thousand new indictments and arrests to throw people under their federal
[04:29.880 --> 04:34.200]  prisons there in their district of Mordor, Satan on the Potomac.
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.080]  So very dark times for the Republic, but the world's waking up and the globalist recorded
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.280]  rats are being forced out in the open.
[04:41.280 --> 04:43.080]  And that's why they're so incredibly dangerous.
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.080]  All right.
[04:44.080 --> 04:45.640]  Thanks for joining us on this Friday edition.

[04:55.480 --> 04:56.480]  That's how we override the tyranny.

[05:15.960 --> 05:19.960]  The way it makes your gums feel what it does to your mouth is insane.

[05:24.800 --> 05:28.160]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.

[05:29.160 --> 05:33.880]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.

[06:53.040 --> 07:00.320]  hour she recently got chased away from a turning point USA event by a bunch of radical leftist
[07:00.320 --> 07:04.480]  and Tifa members and they're they hunt her down and they say find the info wars girl
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.160]  find the info wars girl and really she hasn't even worked here in years but I guess her
[07:09.160 --> 07:14.320]  most impactful work was here so they just call her that and then fourth hour host Jay
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.560]  Dyer I'm back on the war room with Jerome Davidson at five o'clock and the great revenge
[07:19.560 --> 07:25.940]  of the CIS podcast at six so loaded guest schedule today I'm looking forward to speaking
[07:25.940 --> 07:32.560]  with all our guests including Roger Stone who I hear you got a little nice love letter
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.360]  from Hunter Biden's lawyers this morning Roger do you want to do you want to let us
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.800]  know about the love that Hunter Biden feels for you.
[07:40.800 --> 07:46.040]  First of all Owen it's great to be back with you feels like the old days at the original
[07:46.040 --> 07:54.920]  war room the real war room where we were colleagues and turned out an enormous amount of important
[07:54.920 --> 08:00.360]  information for the American people and I miss I miss those days and miss everyone at info
[08:00.360 --> 08:08.480]  wars but you've carried on a great tradition this is now the second time that Hunter Biden's
[08:08.480 --> 08:15.160]  lawyers have threatened me by letter in the first letter which was several weeks ago from
[08:15.160 --> 08:23.240]  Abby Lowell who's an extraordinarily expensive high powered Washington attorney also very
[08:23.240 --> 08:31.840]  capable by the way essentially urging me to preserve all the documents in my possession
[08:31.840 --> 08:39.120]  pertaining to Hunter Biden's laptop which would be none whatsoever other than of course
[08:39.120 --> 08:45.120]  news stories because everything I know about Hunter Biden's laptop I know from one of two
[08:45.120 --> 08:51.080]  places I read about it at the New York Post or actually the New York Post or Breitbart
[08:51.080 --> 08:58.400]  News or I read the extraordinary report put out by the Marco Polo Foundation which I think
[08:58.400 --> 09:07.680]  anyone can go online and get it Marco PoloUSA.com I believe it is it's about I don't know four
[09:07.680 --> 09:14.920]  inches thick it's extraordinarily detailed today I got a second letter this is a cease
[09:14.920 --> 09:22.320]  and desist letter instruct me to stop talking about the contents of the laptop which are
[09:22.320 --> 09:30.120]  completely mapped out in great great detail and documented in the Marco Polo report I'm
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.640]  not going to discuss the content of the letter beyond that because I haven't had a time to
[09:34.640 --> 09:41.240]  digest it with my attorneys but oh and this is a this is yet again an attempt to silence
[09:41.240 --> 09:50.120]  any discussion of the deeds of Hunter Biden as detailed in the laptop and in my case it's
[09:50.120 --> 10:00.480]  a continuation of warfare in other words it's bad enough that I lost my home my car my savings
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.960]  most of my insurance it's bad enough that my wife has struggled through stage four cancer
[10:05.960 --> 10:14.280]  under those circumstances it is bad enough that I already still have 11 pending totally
[10:14.280 --> 10:21.840]  frivolous totally baseless totally groundless but heavily sensationalized lawsuits against
[10:21.840 --> 10:29.000]  me but now I have Hunter Biden's extremely expensive and nasty lawyers threatening me
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.280]  because they don't want me to come on oh I don't know info wars or on my own show stone
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.640]  zone dot live stone zone dot live every day at five o'clock to talk about what can be
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.800]  seen in the public forum in the public realm which has all been fully published it seems
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.240]  to me a rather foolish strategy but again if people want to help me fight legal action
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.360]  against Hunter Biden's laptop pardon me against Hunter Biden's lawyers they can go to stone
[11:00.360 --> 11:08.040]  defense fund dot com I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it Roger I'm a little confused because
[11:08.040 --> 11:11.480]  this was in the news today as well Hunter Biden files counterclaims against computer
[11:11.480 --> 11:15.400]  repairmen overhandling of infamous laptop so so as you were mentioning he's dealing
[11:15.400 --> 11:21.600]  with the lawsuits as well but I'm confused here Roger because first the story was there
[11:21.600 --> 11:27.440]  is no story the laptop doesn't exist it's Russian disinformation and then after the election
[11:27.440 --> 11:34.000]  was finished now the laptop is real and the contents however are irrelevant what is relevant
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.680]  is the people that were talking about it when they were telling us it was fake do I have
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.960]  this right yeah I think that's exactly right oh and this is a classic tactic of the left
[11:43.960 --> 11:51.080]  let's not focus on the actual emails from the DNC or from Hillary Clinton as published
[11:51.080 --> 11:57.760]  by WikiLeaks let's only focus on how that information became public the false narrative
[11:57.760 --> 12:04.440]  continued to be repeated in the media still today that the Russians hacked the DNC and
[12:04.440 --> 12:11.080]  somehow gave that information to WikiLeaks a claim for which there is no proof or evidence
[12:11.080 --> 12:18.480]  whatsoever in fact the head of crowd strikes the private company that made that claim publicly
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.520]  admitted in his sworn testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that neither
[12:23.520 --> 12:30.600]  he nor the DNC had any evidence of any of that happening but what better way to distract
[12:30.600 --> 12:37.120]  from the evidence of corruption Hillary's personal involvement in dirty tricks and so
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.720]  on and the doings of the Podesta brothers as revealed in those emails rather than to
[12:43.720 --> 12:51.200]  kick up a dust storm about how the information became public as far as I know and I'm not
[12:51.200 --> 12:57.400]  an attorney I stress that but basically everything that I have read leads me to believe that Hunter
[12:57.400 --> 13:05.000]  Biden gave this laptop to our pear shop man John Paul MacIsaic MacIsaic has a signed service
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.560]  agreement that stipulates that if the laptop is not picked up and paid for after the requested
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.600]  work has been conducted that it reverts to the property of the lot of the repair shop
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.720]  owner so I believe it became his property he did what every upstanding citizen would
[13:24.720 --> 13:32.560]  do he turned it over to the FBI so I don't know now the FBI did nothing for 15 months
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.640]  with it it's a separate question but I think this lawsuit is frivolous any lawsuit against
[13:38.640 --> 13:45.160]  me would be equally frivolous I only know about the laptop what I have read about it
[13:45.160 --> 13:51.000]  and as far as the contents of the laptop first of all Hunter Biden is a public figure but
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.760]  secondarily the published material put out by the Marco Polo Foundation which I believe
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.440]  to be accurate and genuine is shocking to say the least you can get that yourself by
[14:03.440 --> 14:10.480]  the way by going to Marco Polo USA dot com it is available to the public well and there's
[14:10.480 --> 14:17.120]  so much to unpack here one I believe Hunter Biden is going into court proceedings right
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.920]  now because of his baby with the stripper that he impregnated and didn't want anything
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.840]  to do with he's he's involved in legal action there apparently there was some issues with
[14:28.840 --> 14:33.280]  the childcare payment so that's nice to know that he's got money to sue Roger Stone but
[14:33.280 --> 14:39.720]  not pay for his child that he doesn't want you to know about and of course the obvious
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.680]  wrongdoing here is not from Roger Stone it's that if any legal action should be taken right
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.120]  now it would be against the Bidens we just found out that the Bidens were taking money
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.960]  from the Chinese as many as four Biden family members taking money from the Chinese in 2017
[14:55.960 --> 15:00.920]  while they were investigating Trump we now know that the contents of the laptop were
[15:00.920 --> 15:08.160]  real how do you fathom this how do you fathom the fact that you're having legal action taken
[15:08.160 --> 15:13.400]  against you for doing nothing wrong nothing illegal but the actual crime family the Bidens
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.480]  receiving money from the Chinese and the alleged activities we see on this laptop nefarious
[15:18.480 --> 15:25.920]  as they are no legal action against the Bidens yeah it's the two tiered justice system that
[15:25.920 --> 15:32.520]  we seem to live under look I think that this whole attack on me and others is the brainchild
[15:32.520 --> 15:41.560]  of a Hollywood lawyer screenwriter named Kevin Morris this guy has actually written out a
[15:41.560 --> 15:49.000]  unabomber like chart that has my one of my personal attorneys Tyler Nixon who's been
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.800]  on the show many times I'm in the chart well this guy sounds this guy sounds extremely
[15:53.800 --> 15:56.880]  stable Roger first break folks don't go anywhere
[15:56.880 --> 16:03.280]  the most banned man in America Alex Jones
[16:03.280 --> 16:14.360]  I want you all to know something Alex Jones was right Alex is right about far more than
[16:14.360 --> 16:28.440]  a decade think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two imagine
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.760]  being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades Alex Jones called
[16:32.760 --> 16:39.840]  this years ago years ago Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax not for a second you
[16:39.840 --> 16:45.800]  are one of the great thinkers of this you are a martyr to the First Amendment the government
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.440]  beers Alex Jones that's why the globalist hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate
[16:51.440 --> 17:04.640]  worldwide tyranny I'm a huge believer in information I watch for wars every day and follow
[17:04.640 --> 17:11.520]  Alex Jones closely you know why he can put you ahead of the curve and he's been demonized
[17:11.520 --> 17:14.080]  as a conspiracy theorist think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or
[17:14.080 --> 17:20.400]  two imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades Alex
[17:20.400 --> 17:29.400]  has been right on for over a decade this is reality is stranger than fiction the revolution
[17:29.400 --> 17:41.720]  the media continues to misrepresent what I've said he may be America's best known conspiracy
[17:41.720 --> 17:48.120]  theorist Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country bigger than any of the networks

[19:55.000 --> 20:05.040]  and we say no to your war leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[20:05.040 --> 20:20.480]  it's alex jones
[20:20.480 --> 20:27.040]  filling in for alex today roger stone is with me we're talking about he's now received
[20:27.040 --> 20:32.280]  i believe roger your second cease and desist from the loving hunter biden lawyers they
[20:32.280 --> 20:36.920]  love you so much but folks you need to understand something the fate of info wars the fate of
[20:36.920 --> 20:43.480]  roger stone is your fate and when i hear what roger has gone through really the last five
[20:43.480 --> 20:48.880]  plus years before even this hunter biden laptop scandal and then the scandal becomes how they're
[20:48.880 --> 20:55.680]  suing people that talk about it you have to understand this is now their plan is to sue
[20:55.680 --> 21:01.760]  all their political opposition out of existence they did the test run with alex and info wars
[21:01.760 --> 21:05.840]  you saw the result now they go for roger stone they go for donald trump they go for tucker
[21:05.840 --> 21:10.840]  carlson they go for fox news they're coming for everybody but again roger the one the
[21:10.840 --> 21:16.080]  one thing that stands out to me about this which is just i can't even fathom it i'm just
[21:16.080 --> 21:20.960]  i'm at a loss for words how is it that legal action is being taken against roger stone
[21:20.960 --> 21:26.400]  and not hunter biden i mean of all the things i'm watching the news last night roger and
[21:26.400 --> 21:31.840]  you know how much coverage i saw of the four bidens getting millions of dollars from the
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.680]  chinese how about none how about not a single minute now if it was donald trump who got
[21:37.680 --> 21:42.440]  a penny from russia or china or anywhere else it'd be the top news story for the entire
[21:42.440 --> 21:47.560]  week but when it's the bidens nobody blinks an eye and now they come after you roger
[21:47.560 --> 21:54.840]  stone for talking i mean outside of just this impacting you and your life what do you think
[21:54.840 --> 21:57.520]  about this how do you react how do you respond to this
[21:57.520 --> 22:06.720]  uh... it boggles the mind i mean paul maniforte went to prison did a hard time solitary confinement
[22:06.720 --> 22:12.840]  uh... he was even incarcerated prior to being found guilty of any crime uh... for lobbying
[22:12.840 --> 22:19.680]  for the ukraine without registering a foreign agents registration act registration it's
[22:19.680 --> 22:26.600]  abundantly clear based on what i read in the uh... hunter biden uh... laptop files published
[22:26.600 --> 22:32.720]  publicly uh... and in the new york post uh... that hunter biden acted on behalf of foreign
[22:32.720 --> 22:39.200]  companies and governments but he never filed such a registration we know that tony podesta
[22:39.200 --> 22:45.080]  brother of john podesta hillary clinton's uh... campaign manager in in his own right
[22:45.080 --> 22:51.080]  a heavy-duty uh... washington democrat lobbyist who represents the largest telecommunications
[22:51.080 --> 22:59.080]  company in china also uh... failed to register on behalf of ukraine no action uh... was taken
[22:59.080 --> 23:06.640]  uh... against him so uh... it is uh... really uh... extraordinary that if you are a truth
[23:06.640 --> 23:14.400]  teller uh... as garret ziggler is uh... by the way is an amazing young man uh... very
[23:14.400 --> 23:22.160]  uh... precise very organized uh... very credible who has taken on the enormous project of taking
[23:22.160 --> 23:30.320]  the entire laptop uh... file uh... and laying it out in a very readable uh... format with
[23:30.320 --> 23:37.080]  explanations and footnotes and photographs and so on uh... he is subjected to harassment
[23:37.080 --> 23:45.040]  by hunter biden's uh... lawyers who are a threatening the tax status of his foundation
[23:45.040 --> 23:51.640]  uh... he's never advocated the election of or uh... or vote for or against any candidate
[23:51.640 --> 23:58.200]  or party there's no violation there he's entitled to publish this material uh... and then secondarily
[23:58.200 --> 24:04.640]  to somehow come up with the diluted claim that i was involved in this information becoming
[24:04.640 --> 24:12.080]  public which is categorically falls and now issue issuing a cease and desist letter saying
[24:12.080 --> 24:18.240]  that i can't speak about it in public uh... it is really it's quite extraordinary but
[24:18.240 --> 24:24.120]  it is par for the course we have a two-tiered justice system uh... i may not agree with
[24:24.120 --> 24:29.320]  everything alex jones says but he certainly has a first amendment right to say it for
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.800]  that uh... they're trying to destroy him uh... they're trying to uh... bankrupt him uh...
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.640]  they're trying to close down info wars which has been uh... a beacon of truth now uh...
[24:40.640 --> 24:47.080]  throughout uh... you know the trump years and even before uh... look at this way that
[24:47.080 --> 24:52.080]  where could i go today right now to tell people that hunter biden's lawyers are threatening
[24:52.080 --> 24:58.920]  me if there was no info wars i mean look i i do a show stonezone dot live sometimes
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.040]  the war rooms is one of the great tragedies of the western civilization you and i run
[25:04.040 --> 25:09.480]  at the same time so folks have to watch one of us in rerun but that's okay uh... but
[25:09.480 --> 25:15.200]  if there was no info wars i would not be able to put out the clarion call and tell people
[25:15.200 --> 25:21.000]  of this harassment so it's important that people support info wars people go to the
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.720]  to your product page if you're not if you're not interested in buying something today there
[25:25.720 --> 25:30.920]  are many great products that i love there's a there's a button there you can make a contribution
[25:30.920 --> 25:37.440]  uh... alex jones is a fighter he's a warrior uh... i've never seen law fair at this level
[25:37.440 --> 25:43.680]  uh... and he deserves your support well it must be nice to be the biden's receiving millions
[25:43.680 --> 25:50.040]  of dollars from overseas so they can just sue whoever they want you know i wish i had
[25:50.040 --> 25:55.960]  uh... a gigantic fun to just sue whoever i want and threaten and harass whoever i want
[25:55.960 --> 25:59.600]  roger i guess that would be a nice thing actually i take that back i'm not even sure i would
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.560]  want that i'm not even sure i would want to do that but the point is this is what the
[26:04.560 --> 26:10.920]  biden's are doing to you and and again when the house g o p oversight committee yesterday
[26:10.920 --> 26:15.720]  releases the document showing for biden family members receiving millions of dollars for
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.240]  the chinese communists and nobody covers this while they were doing their fraudulent trump
[26:20.240 --> 26:26.960]  russia collusion investigation i mean that's the whole story right there and so i'm just
[26:26.960 --> 26:33.720]  i i i'm just at a loss here i guess i'm talking myself in circles no media coverage no i guess
[26:33.720 --> 26:37.280]  at this point i i shouldn't expect anything from the media i mean is that how fallen we
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.800]  are as a nation state that the biden crime family can just do whatever the hell it wants
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.560]  nothing from the fb i nothing from the department of justice nothing from the american media
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.320]  and they can just criminally harass whoever they want
[26:50.320 --> 26:54.760]  uh... it underlines the importance of alternative media because you're absolutely right uh...
[26:54.760 --> 26:56.600]  you're not gonna see anything about this
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.800]  on network television you're not going to see it certainly at cnn or msnbc
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.520]  uh... you're not going to see it in the washington post of the new york times of the wall street
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.560]  journal you're not going to see it in the so-called legacy media
[27:09.560 --> 27:13.360]  uh... these uh... outlets have been protecting joe biden
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.160]  since uh... before he was nominated
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.240]  uh... and if it weren't for the info wars in the
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.040]  uh... or tucker carlson for example
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.680]  uh... there be no alternative coverage i must say
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.240]  uh... we got about a minute and a half but i have never seen a public assault
[27:30.240 --> 27:33.920]  on a public figure like the assault on tucker carlson
[27:33.920 --> 27:36.800]  uh... and he's standing up to it in a way
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.720]  that is really inspirational he is he is a man of steel
[27:40.720 --> 27:46.520]  he is a true patriot a man of enormous integrity and the attacks on him
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.040]  for simply revealing the truth and documenting it with video
[27:51.040 --> 27:53.320]  uh... it's breathtaking it really is
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.160]  well and i'll tell you too just to follow up on that before the break here
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.960]  when i see what you have done roger in your not just your career but
[28:03.960 --> 28:08.360]  in in more recent years dealing with the persecution and the attacks and the lies
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.800]  you've gone through
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.480]  uh... working with alex jones saying that you mentioned tucker carlson
[28:13.480 --> 28:16.800]  and some other people that have been inspiring to me growing up
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.640]  i've got to tell you as somebody that looks at all this and just says
[28:20.640 --> 28:23.680]  you know i can only human folks and sometimes i look at all this i look at
[28:23.680 --> 28:24.480]  i'm like
[28:24.480 --> 28:25.880]  just get out
[28:25.880 --> 28:28.760]  uh... just get out these people are going to destroy your life they're going
[28:28.760 --> 28:31.800]  to ruin you just get out just go out to the country
[28:31.800 --> 28:33.880]  work for the rest of your life just get out
[28:33.880 --> 28:37.360]  but i see inspirational figures like you and i say why would i give up if
[28:37.360 --> 28:41.800]  roger stone hasn't given up well how can i give up if alex jones hasn't given up
[28:41.800 --> 28:43.320]  why why would i give up
[28:43.320 --> 28:45.000]  and then i remember
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.520]  the freedom the prosperity and i believe the country united states of america is
[28:49.520 --> 28:51.720]  worth fighting for roger stone
[28:51.720 --> 28:54.080]  is with us here on the alex jones show
[28:54.080 --> 28:57.760]  let's get into the trump campaign on the other side of this break with the great
[28:57.760 --> 28:59.800]  roger stone

[29:03.240 --> 29:06.920]  globalist are in deep trouble but they're striking back with all their deep
[29:06.920 --> 29:11.480]  state operatives to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like

[31:05.040 --> 31:05.880]  you know why?
[31:05.880 --> 31:07.080]  He can push ahead of the curve
[31:07.080 --> 31:10.720]  and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist
[31:10.720 --> 31:12.240]  think about how frustrated we are
[31:12.240 --> 31:14.160]  if you've been awake for a year or two
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.920]  imagine being like an Alex Jones
[31:15.920 --> 31:18.120]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades
[31:18.120 --> 31:21.280]  Alex has been right on for over a decade
[31:21.280 --> 31:22.680]  this is reality
[31:22.680 --> 31:24.240]  it's just man-kiss
[31:24.240 --> 31:26.800]  truth is stranger than fiction
[31:26.800 --> 31:29.000]  the revolution of peaceful information is coming
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.160]  and when it comes time
[31:30.160 --> 31:31.840]  you people are going to be brought to punishment
[31:31.840 --> 31:33.840]  you're lying to the public, it's disgusting
[31:33.840 --> 31:36.440]  the media continues to misrepresent
[31:36.440 --> 31:37.600]  what I've said
[31:37.600 --> 31:40.320]  he may be America's best known conspiracy theorist
[31:40.320 --> 31:44.320]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country
[31:44.320 --> 31:46.320]  bigger than any of the networks
[31:46.320 --> 31:48.320]  the biggest megaphone in the country
[31:48.320 --> 31:50.320]  we're going to get fired up about the real things
[31:50.320 --> 31:52.320]  the things that matter
[31:56.320 --> 31:58.320]  Burn in Hell, New World Order
[31:58.320 --> 31:59.320]  ladies and gentlemen
[31:59.320 --> 32:02.320]  info wars has proven itself the last 28 years
[32:02.320 --> 32:04.320]  to be over the globalist target
[32:04.320 --> 32:06.320]  and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants

[32:58.320 --> 33:12.320]  here at infowarshow.com
[33:29.320 --> 33:32.320]  Well, Roger, it's pretty clear at this point
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.320]  that the deep state is going to do anything
[33:35.320 --> 33:38.320]  they possibly can to keep Trump from running
[33:38.320 --> 33:40.320]  and of course the
[33:40.320 --> 33:43.320]  lawfare is their go-to tactic
[33:43.320 --> 33:44.320]  right now
[33:44.320 --> 33:46.320]  this is from Axios
[33:46.320 --> 33:48.320]  looming Trump charges threatened to inject chaos
[33:48.320 --> 33:50.320]  into his 2024 campaign
[33:50.320 --> 33:52.320]  now let me ask you this historically
[33:52.320 --> 33:54.320]  first, Roger
[33:54.320 --> 33:56.320]  at any other time
[33:56.320 --> 33:58.320]  in US history
[33:58.320 --> 34:00.320]  if there was a phenomenon like this
[34:00.320 --> 34:02.320]  where a presidential candidate was being
[34:02.320 --> 34:04.320]  politically persecuted
[34:04.320 --> 34:06.320]  then it would be viewed as just that
[34:06.320 --> 34:08.320]  political persecution
[34:08.320 --> 34:10.320]  trying to interfere with a campaign
[34:10.320 --> 34:12.320]  interfere with an election
[34:12.320 --> 34:14.320]  but that's not the narrative now
[34:14.320 --> 34:16.320]  the narrative now is Trump must go down
[34:16.320 --> 34:18.320]  Trump should not be able to run
[34:18.320 --> 34:20.320]  what do you attribute that to
[34:20.320 --> 34:22.320]  how are they able to get away with this
[34:22.320 --> 34:24.320]  clear political persecution
[34:24.320 --> 34:26.320]  so that Trump could be president again
[34:26.320 --> 34:28.320]  I mean, even a decade ago
[34:28.320 --> 34:30.320]  the media would be calling this out
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.320]  for what it really is
[34:32.320 --> 34:34.320]  what has happened, Roger Stone?
[34:34.320 --> 34:36.320]  What you see here I think is the palpable
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.320]  fear of the
[34:38.320 --> 34:40.320]  two-party duopoly
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.320]  who simply do not want
[34:42.320 --> 34:44.320]  to face Donald Trump at the polls
[34:44.320 --> 34:46.320]  again
[34:46.320 --> 34:48.320]  and therefore the Russian collusion
[34:48.320 --> 34:50.320]  hoax failed
[34:50.320 --> 34:52.320]  the Ukrainian
[34:52.320 --> 34:54.320]  impeachment
[34:54.320 --> 34:56.320]  failed
[34:56.320 --> 34:58.320]  there's still two ongoing investigations
[34:58.320 --> 35:00.320]  one into January 6
[35:00.320 --> 35:02.320]  one into his handling of
[35:02.320 --> 35:04.320]  classified or secret
[35:04.320 --> 35:06.320]  government documents
[35:06.320 --> 35:08.320]  we don't know the outcome of those either
[35:08.320 --> 35:10.320]  but to charge him
[35:10.320 --> 35:12.320]  now on this
[35:12.320 --> 35:14.320]  extraordinarily
[35:14.320 --> 35:16.320]  minor matter the statute of
[35:16.320 --> 35:18.320]  limitations of which I believe has run out
[35:18.320 --> 35:20.320]  anyway really shows you
[35:20.320 --> 35:22.320]  the desperation
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.320]  of the establishment not to run
[35:24.320 --> 35:26.320]  against Donald Trump so
[35:26.320 --> 35:28.320]  in one breath they say
[35:28.320 --> 35:30.320]  he's damaged, he's disgraced
[35:30.320 --> 35:32.320]  he's virtually in exile
[35:32.320 --> 35:34.320]  he'll be crushed
[35:34.320 --> 35:36.320]  he can't possibly win an election
[35:36.320 --> 35:38.320]  and then they say oh my god
[35:38.320 --> 35:40.320]  we don't want to run against that guy again
[35:40.320 --> 35:42.320]  and what's interesting
[35:42.320 --> 35:44.320]  and I think this is absolutely key
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.320]  we saw this after the raid
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.320]  at Marlago
[35:48.320 --> 35:50.320]  is that the American people
[35:50.320 --> 35:52.320]  rally to Donald Trump
[35:52.320 --> 35:54.320]  when he's under attack
[35:54.320 --> 35:56.320]  if they bring charges against him
[35:56.320 --> 35:58.320]  in any of these matters
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.320]  it will simply turbo
[36:00.320 --> 36:02.320]  charges campaign for the Republican
[36:02.320 --> 36:04.320]  nomination and ensure
[36:04.320 --> 36:06.320]  that he is the Republican nominee
[36:06.320 --> 36:08.320]  now perhaps
[36:08.320 --> 36:10.320]  in a misguided
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.320]  political judgment that's actually
[36:12.320 --> 36:14.320]  what they want I mean Jimmy Carter
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.320]  and his advisors actually wanted
[36:16.320 --> 36:18.320]  to run against Ronald Reagan
[36:18.320 --> 36:20.320]  they thought he would be the easiest candidate
[36:20.320 --> 36:22.320]  to be when in fact he was the
[36:22.320 --> 36:24.320]  strongest candidate against Carter
[36:24.320 --> 36:26.320]  this mistake was repeated
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.320]  by Hillary Clinton and her advisors
[36:28.320 --> 36:30.320]  they actually wanted to run against
[36:30.320 --> 36:32.320]  Donald Trump in 2016
[36:32.320 --> 36:34.320]  he had no political experience
[36:34.320 --> 36:36.320]  they saw him as a caricature
[36:36.320 --> 36:38.320]  as a cartoon character
[36:38.320 --> 36:40.320]  they didn't understand the strength of the
[36:40.320 --> 36:42.320]  America first message
[36:42.320 --> 36:44.320]  so perhaps in some
[36:44.320 --> 36:46.320]  perverse way
[36:46.320 --> 36:48.320]  they believe that this persecution
[36:48.320 --> 36:50.320]  will
[36:50.320 --> 36:52.320]  ensure his nomination
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.320]  because they believe I think falsely
[36:54.320 --> 36:56.320]  that he is easily beatable
[36:56.320 --> 36:58.320]  in a general election
[36:58.320 --> 37:00.320]  what will the economy be like
[37:00.320 --> 37:02.320]  in November of 2020
[37:02.320 --> 37:04.320]  I don't even want to imagine actually
[37:04.320 --> 37:06.320]  but they're obviously
[37:06.320 --> 37:08.320]  working in small margins here
[37:08.320 --> 37:10.320]  they're obviously walking a tightrope
[37:10.320 --> 37:12.320]  because
[37:12.320 --> 37:14.320]  I mean they know
[37:14.320 --> 37:16.320]  they charge Trump
[37:16.320 --> 37:18.320]  or arrest Trump that
[37:18.320 --> 37:20.320]  things are just going to start coming apart at the seams
[37:20.320 --> 37:22.320]  and I think people that
[37:22.320 --> 37:24.320]  may have even been anti-Trump
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.320]  in the past will come out and say this is ridiculous
[37:26.320 --> 37:28.320]  this is out of control this is clear corruption
[37:28.320 --> 37:30.320]  I hate Trump
[37:30.320 --> 37:32.320]  but he's not the problem
[37:32.320 --> 37:34.320]  that this country has he has not been
[37:34.320 --> 37:36.320]  in government for decades like Joe Biden
[37:36.320 --> 37:38.320]  this is completely out of control
[37:38.320 --> 37:40.320]  they have to be aware of that but at the same time
[37:40.320 --> 37:42.320]  they also feel like
[37:42.320 --> 37:44.320]  if we don't get rid of Trump
[37:44.320 --> 37:46.320]  let's say put Trump behind bars then
[37:46.320 --> 37:48.320]  he's going to continue to be a threat to us
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.320]  so how do they balance this
[37:50.320 --> 37:52.320]  Roger I mean that's clearly what they're trying to do
[37:52.320 --> 37:54.320]  is this balancing act of
[37:54.320 --> 37:56.320]  well we do want to
[37:56.320 --> 37:58.320]  destroy him completely putting him behind bars
[37:58.320 --> 38:00.320]  whatever because he's a threat to us
[38:00.320 --> 38:02.320]  but also we realize
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.320]  that the more we do that the stronger
[38:04.320 --> 38:06.320]  he'll actually get and
[38:06.320 --> 38:08.320]  perhaps more importantly than Donald Trump
[38:08.320 --> 38:10.320]  the more
[38:10.320 --> 38:12.320]  aggressive the people would get
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.320]  against the deep state tyranny
[38:16.320 --> 38:18.320]  well first of all to be very clear
[38:18.320 --> 38:20.320]  we're not advocating violence against
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.320]  the government or any kind of uprising
[38:22.320 --> 38:24.320]  if Donald Trump is arrested
[38:24.320 --> 38:26.320]  that's not what either one of us are saying
[38:26.320 --> 38:28.320]  but I do think it will
[38:28.320 --> 38:30.320]  awaken a lot of voters and a lot of Americans
[38:30.320 --> 38:32.320]  who may be
[38:32.320 --> 38:34.320]  unclear about what's going on in the country
[38:34.320 --> 38:36.320]  secondarily
[38:36.320 --> 38:38.320]  I think they might be looking at this
[38:38.320 --> 38:40.320]  from both a short term and a long term
[38:40.320 --> 38:42.320]  point of view in other words
[38:42.320 --> 38:44.320]  politically from a short term
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.320]  they may realize
[38:46.320 --> 38:48.320]  that it charges against Donald Trump on any matter
[38:48.320 --> 38:50.320]  will turbo charge
[38:50.320 --> 38:52.320]  his campaign for the nomination
[38:52.320 --> 38:54.320]  if Donald Trump has
[38:54.320 --> 38:56.320]  any kind of charges filed against him
[38:56.320 --> 38:58.320]  it'll be the worst possible
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.320]  day of Governor Ron DeSantis's life
[39:00.320 --> 39:02.320]  we've already
[39:02.320 --> 39:04.320]  seen this phenomena in the wake
[39:04.320 --> 39:06.320]  of the raid on Mar-Lago
[39:06.320 --> 39:08.320]  and therefore I think opposition
[39:08.320 --> 39:10.320]  to Trump within the party
[39:10.320 --> 39:12.320]  will virtually collapse
[39:12.320 --> 39:14.320]  if their charges
[39:14.320 --> 39:16.320]  filed against him now they may believe
[39:16.320 --> 39:18.320]  that these do him in a general election
[39:18.320 --> 39:20.320]  they didn't think he would win the last
[39:20.320 --> 39:22.320]  two elections either
[39:22.320 --> 39:24.320]  and of course
[39:24.320 --> 39:26.320]  this is the democrat party that has
[39:26.320 --> 39:28.320]  rejected
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.320]  every presidential election that they've lost
[39:30.320 --> 39:32.320]  in the 21st century
[39:32.320 --> 39:34.320]  so that is ironic
[39:34.320 --> 39:36.320]  but all facts aside
[39:36.320 --> 39:38.320]  don't let the truths get in the way
[39:38.320 --> 39:40.320]  of a democrat lie
[39:40.320 --> 39:42.320]  Roger is Joe Biden the worst president
[39:42.320 --> 39:44.320]  you've ever seen
[39:44.320 --> 39:46.320]  it appears that way
[39:46.320 --> 39:48.320]  I mean I never thought I'd say that
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.320]  you know prior to this
[39:50.320 --> 39:52.320]  I would have said that Barack Obama
[39:52.320 --> 39:54.320]  was the worst president in my lifetime
[39:54.320 --> 39:56.320]  prior to that I would have said Jimmy Carter
[39:56.320 --> 39:58.320]  Jimmy Carter
[39:58.320 --> 40:00.320]  if we read the press reports
[40:00.320 --> 40:02.320]  lies near death
[40:02.320 --> 40:04.320]  in a Georgia hospice
[40:04.320 --> 40:06.320]  the more I read
[40:06.320 --> 40:08.320]  I've read a couple of his books now
[40:08.320 --> 40:10.320]  I don't think he was a bad man
[40:10.320 --> 40:12.320]  I think he was a patriotic American
[40:12.320 --> 40:14.320]  in fact I think he was a good man
[40:14.320 --> 40:16.320]  he just wasn't a good president
[40:16.320 --> 40:18.320]  but I think he was a decent person
[40:18.320 --> 40:20.320]  a man of faith
[40:20.320 --> 40:22.320]  I think he was a patriotic
[40:22.320 --> 40:24.320]  American
[40:24.320 --> 40:26.320]  Barack Obama is now
[40:26.320 --> 40:28.320]  in his third term
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.320]  but when you look at
[40:30.320 --> 40:32.320]  gas prices for example
[40:32.320 --> 40:34.320]  who in their right mind would think
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.320]  that turning on the rushing gas pipeline
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.320]  which Donald Trump had turned off
[40:38.320 --> 40:40.320]  but turning off
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.320]  the keystone pipeline in the United States
[40:42.320 --> 40:44.320]  which Donald Trump had turned on
[40:44.320 --> 40:46.320]  that that would benefit
[40:46.320 --> 40:48.320]  the United States
[40:48.320 --> 40:50.320]  who would possibly think that
[40:50.320 --> 40:52.320]  oh and I went to a supermarket the other day
[40:52.320 --> 40:54.320]  to buy a steak
[40:54.320 --> 40:56.320]  well it wasn't really a steak
[40:56.320 --> 40:58.320]  and it was $7
[40:58.320 --> 41:00.320]  this was not enough
[41:00.320 --> 41:02.320]  to sustain a grown man
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.320]  so the food prices
[41:04.320 --> 41:06.320]  if you can find the items you're looking for
[41:06.320 --> 41:08.320]  we have a shortage of chicken wings
[41:08.320 --> 41:10.320]  going on here in Florida
[41:10.320 --> 41:12.320]  that's hard to believe
[41:12.320 --> 41:14.320]  then you add into that
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.320]  the inflation
[41:16.320 --> 41:18.320]  the fact that there's 370,000
[41:18.320 --> 41:20.320]  homeless veterans in this country
[41:20.320 --> 41:22.320]  but we're shipping billions
[41:22.320 --> 41:24.320]  of dollars to Ukraine
[41:24.320 --> 41:26.320]  President Biden tells him
[41:26.320 --> 41:28.320]  we're not going to give them Abrams tanks
[41:28.320 --> 41:30.320]  then we give them Abrams tanks
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.320]  then he says we're not going to give them
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.320]  certain fighter jets
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.320]  I believe those fighter jets are on the way
[41:36.320 --> 41:38.320]  and they'll be asking
[41:38.320 --> 41:40.320]  for billions more
[41:40.320 --> 41:42.320]  as they walk us right up to the precipice
[41:42.320 --> 41:44.320]  of World War 3
[41:44.320 --> 41:46.320]  this is the most dangerous time
[41:46.320 --> 41:48.320]  ever in American history
[41:48.320 --> 41:50.320]  and if you are
[41:50.320 --> 41:52.320]  the Iranians or the Chinese
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.320]  and you see nothing but weakness
[41:54.320 --> 41:56.320]  from this administration
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.320]  well, weakness is provocative
[41:58.320 --> 42:00.320]  I think the Chinese
[42:00.320 --> 42:02.320]  just as the Russians
[42:02.320 --> 42:04.320]  did not invade
[42:04.320 --> 42:06.320]  Ukraine during the Trump presidency
[42:06.320 --> 42:08.320]  Trump's been very candid
[42:08.320 --> 42:10.320]  he told Putin directly
[42:10.320 --> 42:12.320]  said this publicly
[42:12.320 --> 42:14.320]  that he would launch an attack on Moscow
[42:14.320 --> 42:16.320]  if that happened
[42:16.320 --> 42:18.320]  and he's also said
[42:18.320 --> 42:20.320]  I'm not sure whether Putin believed I would do it
[42:20.320 --> 42:22.320]  but even if he thought there was a 10% chance
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.320]  that I really would do it
[42:24.320 --> 42:26.320]  it kept him from launching
[42:26.320 --> 42:28.320]  an invasion into Ukraine
[42:28.320 --> 42:30.320]  that's the whole point of leadership
[42:30.320 --> 42:32.320]  now as this administration
[42:32.320 --> 42:34.320]  demonstrates
[42:34.320 --> 42:36.320]  nothing but weakness
[42:36.320 --> 42:38.320]  in Afghanistan
[42:38.320 --> 42:40.320]  it is a clear sign
[42:40.320 --> 42:42.320]  to the Russians and to the Chinese
[42:42.320 --> 42:44.320]  that there are no consequences
[42:44.320 --> 42:46.320]  for their actions
[42:46.320 --> 42:48.320]  but Roger, Ari Melber told me
[42:48.320 --> 42:50.320]  Joe Biden is the best president of his life
[42:50.320 --> 42:52.320]  Ari Melber
[42:52.320 --> 42:54.320]  Roger, I know you respect him a lot
[42:54.320 --> 42:56.320]  MSNBC host

[44:06.320 --> 44:08.320]  so yeah you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters
[44:08.320 --> 44:10.320]  in the United States
[44:10.320 --> 44:12.320]  he doesn't care
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.320]  that's not his job
[44:14.320 --> 44:16.320]  he's not the president of the United States
[44:16.320 --> 44:18.320]  he's a puppet operating for the globalists
[44:18.320 --> 44:20.320]  so the autocrats
[44:20.320 --> 44:22.320]  cannot be appeased
[44:22.320 --> 44:24.320]  they must be opposed
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.320]  autocrats only understand one word
[44:26.320 --> 44:28.320]  no
[44:28.320 --> 44:30.320]  no no
[44:30.320 --> 44:32.320]  exactly and that's why we say no
[44:32.320 --> 44:34.320]  to your vaccines

[44:44.320 --> 44:46.320]  we say no to you getting us into war
[44:46.320 --> 44:48.320]  war three
[44:48.320 --> 44:50.320]  you're right we stand against autocrats

[45:38.320 --> 45:40.320]  they are nothing but distractions
[45:40.320 --> 45:42.320]  you guys censored Harvard education doctors
[45:42.320 --> 45:44.320]  you silenced those voices
[45:44.320 --> 45:46.320]  what we wanted to do in Davos is
[45:46.320 --> 45:48.320]  to reset but
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.320]  as soon as we start exposing the great reset
[45:51.320 --> 45:59.320]  the soon as these globalists start going to prison

[46:55.320 --> 47:23.320]  and experience these powerful products for yourself
[47:23.320 --> 47:25.320]  you know I gotta tell you quickly here
[47:25.320 --> 47:27.320]  brownerstone with us
[47:27.320 --> 47:29.320]  last night I did a deep dive
[47:29.320 --> 47:31.320]  to try to understand
[47:31.320 --> 47:33.320]  where Joe Biden is getting
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.320]  this idea
[47:35.320 --> 47:37.320]  that fighting a war
[47:37.320 --> 47:39.320]  with Russia is
[47:39.320 --> 47:41.320]  a good thing
[47:41.320 --> 47:43.320]  and it turns out that he really thinks
[47:43.320 --> 47:45.320]  he's gonna be some sort of a Dwight Eisenhower
[47:45.320 --> 47:47.320]  or FDR type
[47:47.320 --> 47:49.320]  and his campaign staff
[47:49.320 --> 47:51.320]  is basically saying yes encouraging this
[47:51.320 --> 47:53.320]  and so
[47:53.320 --> 47:55.320]  it's a dangerous thing and last night
[47:55.320 --> 47:57.320]  I'm doing a deep dive
[47:57.320 --> 47:59.320]  and I'm looking at these democrat think tanks
[47:59.320 --> 48:01.320]  and these democrat roundtables
[48:01.320 --> 48:03.320]  and they're all saying the same thing
[48:03.320 --> 48:05.320]  we need to fully support Ukraine
[48:05.320 --> 48:07.320]  give them whatever they need to win this war
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.320]  and folks it's an unwinnable war
[48:09.320 --> 48:11.320]  for Ukraine the only way Ukraine wins
[48:11.320 --> 48:13.320]  would be if the US
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.320]  and NATO and the rest of the world
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.320]  decided to get involved and fight a world war over it
[48:17.320 --> 48:19.320]  and I'd rather not do that
[48:19.320 --> 48:21.320]  and I'll continue with Roger Stone here in a second
[48:21.320 --> 48:23.320]  and I do want to ask him some other questions
[48:23.320 --> 48:25.320]  but first ladies and gentlemen I gotta tell you
[48:25.320 --> 48:27.320]  I've tried something new today
[48:27.320 --> 48:29.320]  and I put a half scoop
[48:29.320 --> 48:31.320]  of the ultimate bone broth
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.320]  into my coffee today
[48:33.320 --> 48:35.320]  a half scoop this is my cup of coffee
[48:35.320 --> 48:37.320]  so you can have an idea of how much coffee we're talking
[48:37.320 --> 48:39.320]  my goodness
[48:39.320 --> 48:41.320]  the flavor explosion
[48:41.320 --> 48:43.320]  unbelievable
[48:43.320 --> 48:45.320]  and I'm somebody that I just drank coffee black
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.320]  I don't like putting sugar or creamer or anything in there
[48:47.320 --> 48:49.320]  so I got a little experimental today
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.320]  there was a
[48:51.320 --> 48:53.320]  ultimate bone broth canister
[48:53.320 --> 48:55.320]  in fact I got one right here
[48:55.320 --> 48:57.320]  that was sitting out next to the coffee machine
[48:57.320 --> 48:59.320]  and I'm thinking well what is this doing here
[48:59.320 --> 49:01.320]  I'm going to put a half scoop in my coffee
[49:01.320 --> 49:03.320]  amazing
[49:03.320 --> 49:05.320]  amazing so I'm getting
[49:05.320 --> 49:07.320]  the primal human nutrition
[49:07.320 --> 49:09.320]  ultimate bone broth
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.320]  plus chocolate flavored
[49:11.320 --> 49:13.320]  from infowarstore.com
[49:13.320 --> 49:15.320]  I'm getting that primal nutrition
[49:15.320 --> 49:17.320]  in my coffee today
[49:19.320 --> 49:21.320]  tell ya
[49:21.320 --> 49:23.320]  that was the right move
[49:23.320 --> 49:25.320]  so you can get your ultimate bone broth
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.320]  plus at infowarstore.com
[49:27.320 --> 49:29.320]  it's not actually for coffee
[49:29.320 --> 49:31.320]  but it can be
[49:31.320 --> 49:33.320]  and it's working great for me today

[49:53.320 --> 49:55.320]  at infowarstore.com
[49:55.320 --> 49:57.320]  all right Roger I want to kind of conclude here
[49:57.320 --> 49:59.320]  with the Biden stuff
[49:59.320 --> 50:01.320]  what are you hearing
[50:01.320 --> 50:03.320]  who's really running the Biden White House
[50:03.320 --> 50:05.320]  because we don't ever hear from Joe Biden
[50:05.320 --> 50:07.320]  I mean it's really actually incredible
[50:07.320 --> 50:09.320]  the tiny amount of exposure
[50:09.320 --> 50:11.320]  Biden has to the media so that shows you
[50:11.320 --> 50:13.320]  Joe he's an embarrassment
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.320]  they know he can't talk
[50:15.320 --> 50:17.320]  same thing with Kamala Harris
[50:17.320 --> 50:19.320]  we get maybe 30 minutes to an hour
[50:19.320 --> 50:21.320]  of public exposure from Joe Biden
[50:21.320 --> 50:23.320]  a week that is
[50:23.320 --> 50:25.320]  Donald Trump would do that before lunch
[50:25.320 --> 50:27.320]  when he was president
[50:27.320 --> 50:29.320]  so who's really running the White House
[50:29.320 --> 50:31.320]  and who is putting this idea into Biden's head
[50:31.320 --> 50:33.320]  that if we just give as much
[50:33.320 --> 50:35.320]  military and money support to Ukraine
[50:35.320 --> 50:37.320]  as possible they'll win
[50:37.320 --> 50:39.320]  when really it's just a black hole
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.320]  you know I think this is the de facto
[50:41.320 --> 50:43.320]  third term of
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.320]  Barack Hussein Obama
[50:45.320 --> 50:47.320]  there's actually an interview
[50:47.320 --> 50:49.320]  you can find with him which he said
[50:49.320 --> 50:51.320]  he's often dreamed about a third term in which
[50:51.320 --> 50:53.320]  he doesn't have to leave his basement
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.320]  that he can have a microphone
[50:55.320 --> 50:57.320]  hooked up to earphones of whoever
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.320]  is the acting president and give
[50:59.320 --> 51:01.320]  directions I think that's pretty much what
[51:01.320 --> 51:03.320]  is happening it's not incidental
[51:03.320 --> 51:05.320]  that Jake Sullivan
[51:05.320 --> 51:07.320]  Susan Rice
[51:07.320 --> 51:09.320]  the new chief of staff all of these
[51:09.320 --> 51:11.320]  people are veterans of the
[51:11.320 --> 51:13.320]  Obama administration so
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.320]  Joe Biden I think is a
[51:15.320 --> 51:17.320]  figure head president
[51:17.320 --> 51:19.320]  his wife Dr. Jills in charge of trying
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.320]  to keep him looking
[51:21.320 --> 51:23.320]  alert but he's
[51:23.320 --> 51:25.320]  an embarrassment I don't think he is
[51:25.320 --> 51:27.320]  making any of the decisions that doesn't
[51:27.320 --> 51:29.320]  mean like Woodrow Wilson
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.320]  where they would put a pen in his
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.320]  hand and then his wife would move
[51:33.320 --> 51:35.320]  the hand he's probably signing the documents
[51:35.320 --> 51:37.320]  in that way but I don't think he is
[51:37.320 --> 51:39.320]  running the country I think Barack
[51:39.320 --> 51:41.320]  Obama is now again
[51:41.320 --> 51:43.320]  just historically speaking
[51:43.320 --> 51:45.320]  has there ever been a president
[51:45.320 --> 51:47.320]  that does less
[51:47.320 --> 51:49.320]  than Joe Biden and it's odd to say
[51:49.320 --> 51:51.320]  because of all the things that are
[51:51.320 --> 51:53.320]  going on it's hard to believe that he's doing
[51:53.320 --> 51:55.320]  so little with all the developments but I mean
[51:55.320 --> 51:57.320]  really my guess is right now let's
[51:57.320 --> 51:59.320]  see it's 1151 here central time
[51:59.320 --> 52:01.320]  1251 on the east coast
[52:01.320 --> 52:03.320]  where Roger is at he's probably already
[52:03.320 --> 52:05.320]  jet set it off to a vacation
[52:05.320 --> 52:07.320]  in his beach front mansion just like
[52:07.320 --> 52:09.320]  he does every Friday has there ever been
[52:09.320 --> 52:11.320]  a president that
[52:11.320 --> 52:13.320]  does nothing I mean like he doesn't do
[52:13.320 --> 52:15.320]  anything oh I could sit here and list off
[52:15.320 --> 52:17.320]  10 things that he should have had a press
[52:17.320 --> 52:19.320]  conference a conference on
[52:19.320 --> 52:21.320]  five places he probably should have gone
[52:21.320 --> 52:23.320]  and been there in person and he's 0 for 10
[52:23.320 --> 52:25.320]  0 for 5 has there ever been
[52:25.320 --> 52:27.320]  a president
[52:27.320 --> 52:29.320]  that has so little time
[52:29.320 --> 52:31.320]  in front of the American people
[52:31.320 --> 52:33.320]  well I think we have to only
[52:33.320 --> 52:35.320]  look at our modern presidents
[52:35.320 --> 52:37.320]  meaning presidents during the time
[52:37.320 --> 52:39.320]  you know when we had mass media
[52:39.320 --> 52:41.320]  will slow woodrow Wilson was
[52:41.320 --> 52:43.320]  virtually incapacitated
[52:43.320 --> 52:45.320]  from through most of his presidency
[52:45.320 --> 52:47.320]  through a stroke but we didn't know
[52:47.320 --> 52:49.320]  that what I think you're really asking
[52:49.320 --> 52:51.320]  oh and it says there ever been a president
[52:51.320 --> 52:53.320]  who has been so protected
[52:53.320 --> 52:55.320]  by the mass media
[52:55.320 --> 52:57.320]  so that it is not apparent that he's
[52:57.320 --> 52:59.320]  not doing anything let me give you
[52:59.320 --> 53:01.320]  an obvious example
[53:01.320 --> 53:03.320]  it is disgraceful
[53:03.320 --> 53:05.320]  that he has not gone to east Palestine
[53:05.320 --> 53:07.320]  Ohio my grandson
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.320]  my oldest granddaughter
[53:09.320 --> 53:11.320]  and my only great-grandson
[53:11.320 --> 53:13.320]  lived miles from where
[53:13.320 --> 53:15.320]  that toxic spill took place
[53:15.320 --> 53:17.320]  and the conflagration
[53:17.320 --> 53:19.320]  that was a controlled
[53:19.320 --> 53:21.320]  burn it was clearly not
[53:21.320 --> 53:23.320]  controlled the child
[53:23.320 --> 53:25.320]  still has a fever
[53:25.320 --> 53:27.320]  a rash chronic
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.320]  diarrhea oh no
[53:29.320 --> 53:31.320]  no folks don't worry the water
[53:31.320 --> 53:33.320]  the air it's all perfectly safe
[53:33.320 --> 53:35.320]  it took Donald Trump to go there
[53:35.320 --> 53:37.320]  and show leadership
[53:37.320 --> 53:39.320]  it gave Donald Trump to go there and give
[53:39.320 --> 53:41.320]  people hope and inspiration
[53:41.320 --> 53:43.320]  but the president acts like
[53:43.320 --> 53:45.320]  it never happened
[53:45.320 --> 53:47.320]  he still has no plans
[53:47.320 --> 53:49.320]  to go there and then when his
[53:49.320 --> 53:51.320]  environmental protection agency director does go there
[53:51.320 --> 53:53.320]  he admits that he wouldn't let
[53:53.320 --> 53:55.320]  his own children drink the water
[53:55.320 --> 53:57.320]  I think it is the perfect
[53:57.320 --> 53:59.320]  example of where Joe Biden
[53:59.320 --> 54:01.320]  is derelict in his duties
[54:01.320 --> 54:03.320]  as president
[54:03.320 --> 54:05.320]  it's truly I mean clearly
[54:05.320 --> 54:07.320]  the handlers and Kamala Harris
[54:07.320 --> 54:09.320]  as well have realized
[54:09.320 --> 54:11.320]  that the less the people
[54:11.320 --> 54:13.320]  see of Joe Biden the better same thing
[54:13.320 --> 54:15.320]  with Kamala Harris they might have thought
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.320]  at one point in time she would be immediate darling
[54:17.320 --> 54:19.320]  we found out real quickly the
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.320]  cackling hyena is not
[54:21.320 --> 54:23.320]  so warming to the
[54:23.320 --> 54:25.320]  American people so they pretty much just keep both of them
[54:25.320 --> 54:27.320]  silent I mean that seems to be
[54:27.320 --> 54:29.320]  the initiative here is
[54:29.320 --> 54:31.320]  make sure Joe and Kamala are
[54:31.320 --> 54:33.320]  never seen by the American people
[54:33.320 --> 54:35.320]  nobody needs to see this embarrassment
[54:35.320 --> 54:37.320]  alright one more thing for you Roger
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.320]  one of your favorites Eric Swalwell
[54:39.320 --> 54:41.320]  I know you're a big fan
[54:41.320 --> 54:43.320]  he was recently on MSNBC he says
[54:43.320 --> 54:45.320]  violent republican rhetoric
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.320]  put a target on the backs of all law
[54:47.320 --> 54:49.320]  enforcement oh geez the irony
[54:49.320 --> 54:51.320]  if you're hearing defund the FBI
[54:51.320 --> 54:53.320]  you don't distinguish between
[54:53.320 --> 54:55.320]  an FBI agent and a police officer
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.320]  really Eric you think people are that dumb
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.320]  like you I guess you consider it
[54:59.320 --> 55:01.320]  as law enforcement and the deep state
[55:01.320 --> 55:03.320]  so the same party that
[55:03.320 --> 55:05.320]  for years chanted
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.320]  defund the police and then actually
[55:07.320 --> 55:09.320]  did defund the police the same
[55:09.320 --> 55:11.320]  liberal media and the same democrat party
[55:11.320 --> 55:13.320]  that put a target on police backs
[55:13.320 --> 55:15.320]  that resulted in hundreds thousands
[55:15.320 --> 55:17.320]  of them being attacked and hospitalized
[55:17.320 --> 55:19.320]  many ambushed and killed
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.320]  are now saying it's Republicans
[55:21.320 --> 55:23.320]  that want to defund the police
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.320]  and they're saying that if you say defund
[55:25.320 --> 55:27.320]  the FBI that's the same thing
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.320]  Roger your response
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.320]  Eric Swalwell for
[55:31.320 --> 55:33.320]  two and a half years insisted that I
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.320]  was a traitor that I was a
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.320]  Russian spy that I had worked
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.320]  with Russian intelligence to subvert
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.320]  the 2016 election
[55:41.320 --> 55:43.320]  it was a vile lie
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.320]  no evidence to support that
[55:45.320 --> 55:47.320]  was ever produced by anyone
[55:47.320 --> 55:49.320]  including in the Soviet style
[55:49.320 --> 55:51.320]  show trial that I was put through
[55:51.320 --> 55:53.320]  where I was charged with lying about
[55:53.320 --> 55:55.320]  Russian collusion in voluntary
[55:55.320 --> 55:57.320]  testimony Russian collusion
[55:57.320 --> 55:59.320]  that never actually happened and then
[55:59.320 --> 56:01.320]  we learned that the guy who was infiltrated
[56:01.320 --> 56:03.320]  by the Communists
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.320]  was none other than Eric Swalwell
[56:05.320 --> 56:07.320]  the Eric Swalwell
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.320]  penetrated a Russian
[56:09.320 --> 56:11.320]  pardon me a Chinese woman spy
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.320]  who then penetrated
[56:13.320 --> 56:15.320]  his office why is this significant
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.320]  well because as a member
[56:17.320 --> 56:19.320]  of the House Intelligence Committee
[56:19.320 --> 56:21.320]  at the time he
[56:21.320 --> 56:23.320]  had access to classified
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.320]  national documents
[56:25.320 --> 56:27.320]  and secrets Eric Swalwell
[56:27.320 --> 56:29.320]  is a disgrace to the US
[56:29.320 --> 56:31.320]  house and frankly it's not
[56:31.320 --> 56:33.320]  enough in my opinion just to throw him
[56:33.320 --> 56:35.320]  off the House Intelligence Committee
[56:35.320 --> 56:37.320]  given his active involvement
[56:37.320 --> 56:39.320]  with a Chinese spy
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.320]  I think he should be expelled by the
[56:41.320 --> 56:43.320]  entire house
[56:43.320 --> 56:45.320]  Roger
[56:45.320 --> 56:47.320]  final 60 seconds with you
[56:47.320 --> 56:49.320]  here
[56:49.320 --> 56:51.320]  where's your barometer of hope
[56:51.320 --> 56:53.320]  that we're going to finally root out this corruption
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.320]  and save this country because it's really
[56:55.320 --> 56:57.320]  it's reaching levels unseen
[56:57.320 --> 56:59.320]  unimaginable
[56:59.320 --> 57:01.320]  my faith is entirely
[57:01.320 --> 57:03.320]  in Jesus Christ
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.320]  I'm living proof that Jesus Christ can do
[57:05.320 --> 57:07.320]  anything but people ask me
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.320]  what's your strategy so I'll tell you my strategy
[57:09.320 --> 57:11.320]  prayer is my strategy
[57:11.320 --> 57:13.320]  I don't believe the Lord will let
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.320]  this great nation founded on
[57:15.320 --> 57:17.320]  Christian principles be destroyed
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.320]  I'm not the person I was 10 years ago
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.320]  even 5 years ago
[57:21.320 --> 57:23.320]  and is only through the power of prayer
[57:23.320 --> 57:25.320]  that America will be saved
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.320]  God bless you Owen, God bless you
[57:27.320 --> 57:29.320]  for what you're going through
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.320]  and I ask everybody out there in the
[57:31.320 --> 57:33.320]  Infra Wars Universe to pray
[57:33.320 --> 57:35.320]  for America and yes

[57:37.320 --> 57:39.320]  to help us in this struggle
[57:39.320 --> 57:41.320]  God bless you
[58:09.320 --> 58:11.320]  flip it up or rub it down
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.320]  Alex Jones was right
[58:13.320 --> 58:15.320]  think about how frustrated we are
[58:15.320 --> 58:17.320]  if you've been awake for a year or two
[58:17.320 --> 58:19.320]  imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.320]  who've been awake for like decades
[58:21.320 --> 58:23.320]  Alex Jones called this years ago
[58:23.320 --> 58:25.320]  years ago
[58:25.320 --> 58:27.320]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax
[58:27.320 --> 58:29.320]  not for a second
[58:29.320 --> 58:31.320]  you are one of the great thinkers of this
[58:31.320 --> 58:33.320]  you are a martyr to the First Amendment
[58:33.320 --> 58:35.320]  the government, beers
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.320]  Alex Jones
[58:37.320 --> 58:39.320]  that's why the globalists hate me
[58:39.320 --> 58:41.320]  is because I'm exposing their corporate
[58:41.320 --> 58:43.320]  worldwide tyranny
[58:51.320 --> 58:53.320]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life

[59:45.320 --> 01:00:05.320]  and I'm going to get them right now.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.320]  the Woke Banks
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.320]  and the Liberal Leftist Democrat Banks
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.320]  that fund all their projects, all their startups
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.320]  all their green new bullcrap
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320]  that all went broke
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320]  and bankrupt and now got bailed out
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.320]  but then all the other people that actually suffered
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320]  that weren't doing corrupt business deals
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.320]  they're going to take the loss
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320]  wow is this big
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:45.320]  let's not forget about the SVB Epstein Connection
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.320]  weeks before the Silicon Valley bank collapse
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.320]  several executives sold off
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320]  large shares of stock
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.320]  while mainstream media
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.320]  tells its audience to invest in them
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.320]  on March 9th
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320]  the day before the collapse
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.320]  Israel's two largest banks
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320]  pulled up to $1 billion out of SVB
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  while Peter Thiele's founders fund
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.320]  withdrew millions
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.320]  and advised their clients to do the same
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.320]  the next day
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320]  there was a run on the bank
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.320]  and Silicon Valley bank collapsed
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  is this evidence of a controlled demolition
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320]  or a hasty one
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.320]  the day before the collapse
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.320]  a U.S. judge ordered
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  J.P. Morgan Chase
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.320]  to turn over documents in a lawsuit
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320]  accusing them of aiding in Jeffrey Epstein's
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.320]  sex trafficking operation
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.320]  the team behind this lawsuit
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.320]  was the same team
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320]  who successfully exposed the involvement
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320]  of Deutsche Bank
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  and they subpoenaed several other banks
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.320]  they believe were involved in sex trafficking
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.320]  including Silicon Valley bank
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320]  and Bank Lumie
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.320]  the Israeli bank that drained
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320]  $1 billion out of SVB
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.320]  the day before it collapsed
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  whatever the reason
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320]  the U.S. government's response
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320]  threatens to collapse the world economy
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.320]  the FDIC
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320]  insures up to $250,000
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.320]  for each depositor
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.320]  but now they are going to cover all
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  depositor losses
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.320]  and they don't have enough to cover the $175
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320]  billion of SVB losses
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320]  let alone the trillions of dollars
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320]  to be lost on the near horizon
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.320]  as banks across the world
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  begin to break
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320]  the systemic risk among
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.320]  GSIBs
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320]  global systemically important banks
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  is that they are so deeply connected
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.320]  that when one falls
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.320]  they will all follow
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320]  much of the world's economy is already collapsing
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  due to the actions of the U.S.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.320]  government and the Federal Reserve Banking System
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.320]  and much of the world
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.320]  has been preparing for the end of the U.S.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320]  dollar as a world reserve currency
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.320]  after all the smaller banks die
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320]  the people will be left
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320]  with the central bank
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.320]  and their solution is the CBDC
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320]  CBDC stands
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320]  for central bank digital currency
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  with CBDC
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320]  there are no more options
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320]  everyone's account is run directly through
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320]  the central bank system
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  as the financial system gets more
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320]  controlling and more invasive
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320]  it's a little bit like bringing up a corral
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320]  around us
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  and CBDC's central bank digital currencies
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  and vaccine passports or digital IDs
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.320]  are sort of the last
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  shutting of the gate
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.320]  it's hard for many people to imagine
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320]  the risks here because we're so used to living
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  with
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.320]  financial transaction freedom
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.320]  and we don't understand that
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320]  when this gate closes on us
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.320]  we literally will be sitting
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320]  in a system where the central banks
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.320]  believe that our assets belong to them
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320]  and they can dictate
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  where we can spend money and what we can spend money on
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320]  if you don't behave
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.320]  you can have your money turned off
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320]  there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.320]  which are located in cities
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320]  being considered
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320]  for the 15-minute city model
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  of the World Economic Forum
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  this is where it's all headed
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  and there isn't much pushback in the Federal Government
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320]  Utah Senator Mike Lee
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  introduced the No CBDC Act
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  last September
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320]  which will likely go nowhere
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320]  but we the people have much more sway
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.320]  over our local governments
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  an Oklahoma House Committee
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.320]  unanimously passed a bill
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  to protect Oklahomans
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  from being forced to adopt a CBDC
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.320]  it's time for
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  we the people to unite with our neighbors
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  and local communities
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  and prepare to liberate ourselves
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320]  from the central bank system
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.320]  recall our corrupt county officials
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  and start looking into
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320]  local barter and trade systems
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.320]  because central bank digital currency
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320]  is coming at us quickly
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  and it equals financial enslavement
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320]  reporting for Infowars
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.320]  this is Greg Rees
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.320]  we have a new toothpaste
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.320]  that my dad a retired dentist
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.320]  and oral surgeon developed
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.320]  Dr. Jones natural's tumor toothpaste
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.320]  that just came into stock
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.320]  and I gotta tell you I got samples of this month's ago
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320]  and it is amazing
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320]  the way it makes your gums feel
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320]  what it does to your mouth is insane
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.320]  we know turmeric is an antioxidant
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.320]  and anti-inflammatory
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.320]  and does such great things for the body
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.320]  then you add that with tea tree oil
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.320]  and a bunch of other essential oils
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.320]  it is just dynamite
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.320]  it is so good to detox
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.320]  and attack inflammation in your mouth
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.320]  I want to challenge everybody
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.320]  to try the new toothpaste
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320]  at infowarsstore.com

[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320]  the new toothpaste
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320]  you could not stand for that
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.320]  the cross
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.320]  was a solution
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.320]  but it rose again
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320]  wise men follow him
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.320]  but it rose again
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320]  wise men follow him
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320]  thank god for the runigins
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.320]  we are now into hour number 2
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.320]  on this Friday
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320]  hour 17, 2023 transmission
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320]  and martha chansley
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.320]  mother of jake chansley
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.320]  the j6 prisoner
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320]  aka kyushelman
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320]  is joining us live
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.320]  by the head of a tando and shroyer
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320]  and her give sin go
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320]  free jake
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.320]  elon must last week said free him
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320]  immediately
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320]  he is absolutely innocent
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320]  we have them leading into the capitol
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320]  leading him around taking selfies
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320]  and telling everybody to get out of the building
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320]  i was mad at him at the time
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320]  and others who didn't realize
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.320]  they had been set up and if it came off
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.320]  like i was blaming jake for what happened
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.320]  or that he was a bad person
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.320]  i was upset by how we got set up at the capitol
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  and since we have learned
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.320]  he is a loving smart good person
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.320]  who has a lot of charisma
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.320]  put in jail for 4 years
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.320]  doing absolutely nothing now they want to charge a thousand more people
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.320]  they have already charged 990 something people
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.320]  this is the beta test
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320]  to say the american people are terrorist
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.320]  and start just throwing us in jail
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.320]  for even peaceful protesting
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.320]  ray epps isn't in trouble
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320]  for saying he orchestrated the attack on the capitol
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.320]  to congress
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320]  but jake as his mother calls him
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.320]  jake chansley is
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.320]  so give sin go
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.320]  free jake and i really appreciate her
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320]  i apologize that in my anger
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320]  at the time at the system
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320]  if i was a mean to a jake
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320]  you know hindsight is 2020
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.320]  and we really need to free him
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.320]  what happened to him is absolutely wrong
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.320]  of course he is not in his baddest shape
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320]  some of the folks that actually got murdered that day
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.320]  none of them were police
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.320]  five of them were citizens
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  but this is a form of living death
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.320]  for us all as this tyranny
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.320]  begins to take over
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  so we need to hear from his mother
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.320]  and
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320]  from somebody who has also been a political prisoner
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320]  and who can parallel all the things that are happening right now
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.320]  pete santilly with
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320]  owen shroyer
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.320]  i intended again to be here today
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320]  but i had some emergencies come up
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320]  so i can only be here for a limited time
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.320]  but i want to invite martha chansley
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320]  and as soon as we get jake free obviously
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320]  in studio we'll fly him down here
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.320]  and i believe he will be freed
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  if we don't free him then it means our country is doomed
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320]  i think he's carrying the coal mine
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320]  we have the trump appointed judge
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320]  that allows doj to hide

[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.320]  shortly gonna be joined by martha chansley
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.320]  and you know pete
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  if there's anybody that can provide
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.320]  hope that has the experience
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.320]  of being a political prisoner
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320]  long time political prisoner
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320]  it's you
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320]  and while i've spent a couple
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.320]  short stints in jail cells
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.320]  because of political persecution i feel
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  lucky that i'm not
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320]  in the situation that jake of chansley
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.320]  or other january 6 defendants
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.320]  are in
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.320]  because this is what happens in corrupt
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  countries this is what happens when corrupt
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  political parties take over
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320]  they arrest, they disappear
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  their political opposition
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  and so pete
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320]  before we get into this situation with jake of chansley
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.320]  looking at the larger issue
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320]  hundreds of january 6 defendants
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  rotting away in jail cells being tortured
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320]  being tormented
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  we do see some signs of hope
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.320]  we have been able to communicate with them
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.320]  we've even seen
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320]  some of their smiling faces
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.320]  saying the national anthem
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.320]  and pray
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.320]  what type of messages for hope
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.320]  would you give these defendants
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  that i'm sure some days
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  feel hopeless
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320]  the same level of
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.320]  hope that i had
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.320]  that the truth would set us free
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320]  when i was behind bars
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.320]  we knew that the truth was
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320]  that we did nothing wrong
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.320]  we didn't break the law we as defendants
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  then you know
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  i don't like to go back
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.320]  oh it's old news it's bunny ranch news
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320]  no it was actually a microcosm
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.320]  of what's going on today
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.320]  i was actually
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  i don't just say this i was
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.320]  blessed with the opportunity
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.320]  to go behind the scenes
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.320]  and have access to tens
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320]  of thousands of pages of discovery
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.320]  and what we discovered
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.320]  was in fact the criminals
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320]  were the people in the U.S.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.320]  government that have been perpetrating
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320]  what we're seeing here on January 6
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.320]  they do their
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.320]  surveillance months in advance
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  they reverse engineer
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.320]  an indictment and i'll probably say that a couple
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.320]  times throughout the
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.320]  the conversation reverse engineering
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320]  meaning that months in advance
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320]  they knew that there was going to be some sort
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.320]  of an uprising or a protest
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320]  so the FBI began
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320]  early on recruiting people
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320]  to inform and so on and so forth
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  then they start their social media influence operation
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.320]  weeks
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.320]  in advance of January 6
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  so they're trying to lure people in
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320]  then they've got their operatives
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.320]  this thing was not spontaneous
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.320]  that took place on January 6
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.320]  it was actually manufactured
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320]  by the same people that
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.320]  trapped and manufactured
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.320]  and ran an influence operation factor
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.320]  of the bunny ranch thing so here's the hope
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320]  that everybody should have
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  will set us free
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.320]  I know
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.320]  first hand that there are
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320]  whistleblowers internally right now
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  that are chomping at the bit
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  to come forward and expose
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  the truth in the Proud Boys
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320]  trial right now which will essentially
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.320]  if this truth comes forward
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.320]  that all of the frontline
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.320]  breaches
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.320]  were through facial
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320]  recognition identified as feds
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.320]  as military personnel
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.320]  as joint terrorism
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.320]  task force team members
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.320]  there's a small group of people
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.320]  that had access to all of that facial recognition
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.320]  and if called upon
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.320]  to testify
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.320]  they will testify truthfully
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.320]  that the majority of the people at the frontline breach
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.320]  where you see Ryan Samsell breaking the barricades down
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.320]  it was done by federal
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.320]  agents
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.320]  now some of that started to come out in court
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.320]  and this is public
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.320]  knowledge because
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320]  the status attorney for
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.320]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.320]  was actually hitting
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.320]  the FBI agent
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  and I say hitting
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  under cross examination
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.320]  starting to reveal some of the truth
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.320]  about this facial recognition
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.320]  them being very selective about
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.320]  who they prosecuted
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.320]  in that crowd initially
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.320]  so they started to identify that doors open
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.320]  I'm hoping that these whistleblowers
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.320]  will be able to come forward
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.320]  following all of these cases
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.320]  go away
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.320]  now this is what happened in the bunny ranch trials
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.320]  now of course
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.320]  I lost 619 days of my life
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.320]  through the process but ultimately
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.320]  when the government perpetrates
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.320]  misconduct
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320]  outrageous government misconduct
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320]  a judge cast a dismiss
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.320]  the case and in the case of the proud boys
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  trial it was
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.320]  jinx violations with basically
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.320]  withholding material that they were going to present during
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.320]  eye witness
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.320]  a testimony on the stand
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.320]  it's called jinx material
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.320]  there's something called giglio material
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.320]  that has to do with confidential informants
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.320]  and then
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.320]  they also have braiding material
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.320]  which is exculpatory information
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.320]  all of this has been withheld
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.320]  from not just the proud boys
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320]  but every single January 6th defendant
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.320]  well and I just got to say
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.320]  I'm grateful
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.320]  for Pete Santilli
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.320]  you're a motivational factor
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.320]  for myself
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  and you know just kind of quickly as an aside here folks
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320]  as we're talking about this
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.320]  you know info wars and alex specifically
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.320]  are kind of going through some stuff right now
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.320]  and I don't
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.320]  care to talk about it it's alex's story
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320]  to tell if he decides to tell it
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320]  but all I
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.320]  would ask is that you continue to pray for info wars
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320]  you continue to pray for alex
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.320]  yes obviously the financial support is key
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.320]  but that's not even what I'm talking about now
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  so just know that
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320]  the men
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.320]  that have been waging their lives
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.320]  their treasure their blood
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.320]  their sweat their tears against this tyranny
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320]  you know this I feel like
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320]  Pete we're kind of getting into the final
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.320]  phases here I kind of feel like the maker break
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.320]  is in the near future
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.320]  is freedom
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.320]  truth prosperity and justice
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.320]  going to win the day
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.320]  for America or is it over
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320]  is that it is it it for
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.320]  individualism is that it for self-government
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.320]  is that it for prosperity is that it for
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.320]  freedom I mean this is what it feels
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.320]  like right now and when you can just
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320]  put away your political opposition silence
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.320]  them disappear them that's dangerous
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.320]  we have a new toothpaste that my dad
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.320]  retired dentist and oral surgeon developed
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.320]  Dr. Jones natural's
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.320]  tumor toothpaste that just came
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.320]  into stock and I got to tell you
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.320]  I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320]  the way it makes your gums feel
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320]  what it does to your mouth is insane
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.320]  we know turmeric is an antioxidant
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.320]  and anti-inflammatory and does such
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.320]  great things for the body then you add
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.320]  that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.320]  essential oils it is just dynamite
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.320]  it is so good to detox
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.320]  and attack inflammation in your mouth
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.320]  I want to challenge everybody to try
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.320]  the new toothpaste at
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.320]  Dr. Jones natural's tumor

[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:27.100]  Playing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:34.020]  San Tilly. He has the proof. DC Gulag, political prisoner and decorated army special forces
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:39.220]  soldier Jeffrey McKellop reveals extent of government agents at J6 Capitol protest. It
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.580]  was a complete setup with audio from the Gateway Punnett. Pete, I know you were alluding
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:47.780]  to that earlier if you want to expand. And then there's this and really I kind of want
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:53.020]  to get your take on this. Biden's DOJ tells court more than 1000 people could still face
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:59.600]  charges in connection with January 6. Now, I've been warning people that this was their
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:06.060]  plan all along. I've said it on air how they're essentially going to keep all of these folders
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:11.460]  as potential arrests from January 6 forever. Like consider it like a blackmail type of
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:15.380]  campaign with certain media members that were there, certain individuals that were there.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.500]  Maybe they went into the Capitol. Maybe they didn't. But guess what? Now they've got these
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.540]  charges and you step out of line, they can send you a little reminder. Hey, you know,
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:26.740]  we got you in the Capitol in January 6. You haven't been charged yet. Would you like to
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.380]  see these papers? Would you like to have these served? Oh, no. Well, maybe you should shut
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:34.580]  up about covering that story you're covering. If you don't think that could potentially
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:40.100]  be going on, then you have no idea what country you live in. But upon seeing this, even though
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:46.460]  I've felt that way and warned that that is the case for a while, why would they be promoting
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:51.980]  that? Why would they be telling the public that that's a potential or is this a save
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:56.820]  face campaign as they're losing the narrative and losing the momentum saying, hey, well,
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:02.140]  wait a second, though, we've still got more people we want to charge. How do you see this,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:07.100]  Pete? I know exactly how to see it because they did the same thing to us. And what they
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:11.940]  do is they'll kind of put the rumors out there because they're listening, but they want to
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:17.660]  see who's talking. They're continuously listening. A lot of people may have gone, quote unquote,
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:23.700]  you know, dark because they went in and took a selfie in the rotunda, but they got quiet
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.820]  or basically they're putting it out there. They're floating it out there to cause some
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:36.420]  fear, cause people to talk. They did the same exact thing to us. We had 28, I think, total
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.100]  defendants and they said that they were going to round up thousands of people that went
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:49.460]  to the Malier National Wildlife Refuge. It was all a rumor and they, again, they have
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:57.180]  very sophisticated surveillance technology. They're listening. Now, right now it's a race
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.740]  to get this information out and here's the information we're talking about. A lot of
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:07.700]  stuff that I haven't been able to even make public because we want it to come out in court.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:13.980]  We want them to be shocked that we know the truth. We want shock in the courtroom and
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:21.700]  bring them to their knees because here's the truth. It was really not just a color revolution.
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:28.900]  We're talking about the military being involved. Some of the military personnel that had to
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:38.260]  kill orders came from a 30-mile away, Quantico, Virginia, off-site location. The FBI deployed
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:46.500]  those military personnel and special forces operators into DC. Now, if you have US military
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:52.460]  active duty, they've got a little known technique that they use, which is they put them under
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:24:00.180]  the supervision of the FBI and they skirt posse combatanas. But we had military personnel,
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.060]  some of whom may have thought, because they were compartmentalized, that they were participating
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.780]  in something completely different. Maybe they were briefed and told that there were terrorists
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:14.220]  that were going to be on the ground. And in fact, guess what? There were Ukrainian Nazis
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:20.300]  on the ground January 6th, one of whom was pictured with Jacob Chansley. So as you can
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:26.740]  imagine, even Jacob Chansley, you've got to figure, actually, Babbit was surrounded by
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:32.420]  these operatives, a large number of whom were in the military, joined terrorism task force,
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:38.340]  special forces operators, and all under the purview and supervision of the FBI. Without,
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:43.140]  listen to this, congressional oversight and capital police oversight. There were just
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.980]  rogue operators out there. Now, we're going to be connecting here and I want to kind of
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:58.460]  set the stage, the front face, for their benefit, a false narrative, the front face
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:04.020]  of the January 6th, so it's the most beautiful patriotic event that I had ever been to.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.580]  Now, I say, it was the largest civil rights march in US history.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:14.300]  It was. And, you know, someone who is an activist and has been, in fact, I know somebody that
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:19.380]  went to high school with Jacob Chansley. So I started asking questions. Now, who is
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:25.020]  this guy? He's a little bit eccentric. He's got the horns and there was a lot of attention
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:31.580]  placed on him. But that's who he is. As far as eccentricity, I knew him to be. And I was
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:38.740]  told this by John Ritzheimer, who just so happened to be a co-defendant in the Bundy
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:43.300]  Ranch trials. But John Ritzheimer went to high school with Jacob Chansley. He said, he's
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:48.020]  a great guy. He will give you, because I was asking about the shirt. It was freezing out
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:52.340]  there. He said, you know what? He probably, because of his character, gave his shirt to
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:59.500]  somebody who was called. He's that kind of guy. Warm, genuine and activist, making his
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.980]  point. But certainly not a violent person. This was told to me by somebody that knew
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:11.340]  him for many years and a fellow activist that was out at protests. So the truth about Jacob
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:17.780]  Chansley, what they do is they get their imagery on. They had cameras. This was a false flag
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.860]  operation. They knew while in advance it was all scripted. They knew that their operatives
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:25.820]  were going to be in there provocaturing and causing other people to do things that they
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.580]  normally wouldn't do. Well, guess what? The cameras are there for the mainstream media.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:34.740]  And guess what else? Another operation that was going on is all the documentary film crews
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:39.820]  that were out there. Those documentary film crews were Intel operatives and they were
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:45.940]  the ones to get the appropriate images, cherry picking, the violence and anything that they
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:52.260]  could use for the benefit of propagating this false narrative that people went there to
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:58.940]  perpetrate insurrection. Well, I'll tell you what, the truth is now coming out and I have
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:07.380]  and I'm proud to announce that I'm joined and this is an exclusive for Infowars. Alex
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:14.020]  mentioned something in his pre-recorded message that maybe he, and I'm not going to put words
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:19.900]  in his mouth. He can go back and listen to it, but I do believe that even I judged Jacob
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.500]  Chansley. I didn't know who he was. I had to find out a little bit more about him. I
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.660]  don't know him personally, but through my conversations with his mother, people who
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:36.460]  know him, and of course, the videos that we've recently seen, we now know, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:41.940]  that Jacob Chansley, as he went into the Senate and he was being escorted by law enforcement.
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:46.980]  Now, from what I understand, and he was saying this right from the very beginning, he was
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:52.260]  offering to help. He didn't want bad things to happen inside the Capitol and he offered
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:58.860]  to help the police. That's why he was not just being escorted. He was actually part
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:03.860]  of law enforcement to help tamper the crown down and to de-escalate. He offered to do
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.660]  that. They accepted his offer and that's why he was standing there in and out of the Senate
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:13.740]  Chamber to de-escalate. And then when they asked him to leave, guess what? He left and
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:22.340]  he left peacefully. But that truth never made it to the judge, never made it to even the
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:28.420]  prosecution and the defense. I think the defense attorney originally, as they typically do,
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:35.620]  I'm going to let Martha Chansley speak to this. And is she joining us next segment, Pete?
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:42.020]  Come on in. She's going to join us next segment. We have an exclusive message from Jake, from
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:47.620]  the Gulag for our Info Wars viewing audience. Okay, so this is coming up on the other side
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:54.020]  of this break and I want to even expand on what Pete was saying there because, folks,
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:59.300]  I mean, you're talking about agents literally giving this guy a tour of the Capitol.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:09.580]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones. I want you all to know something. Alex Jones
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:16.100]  was right. Alex is right about far more of what's wrong. Alex has been right on court
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:27.220]  over a decade. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:30.980]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:36.980]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax,
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:43.220]  not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:50.820]  First Amendment. That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate

[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.420]  your destiny, our children's destiny, and that war is something that we can win, but

[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:05.980]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:10.780]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:16.300]  at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:21.220]  been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:27.660]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:31.900]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:37.300]  you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:41.060]  spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.860]  viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:50.380]  and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:54.620]  our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com. If just 1% more of you
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:33:00.100]  took action at InfowarsStore.com, our funding process will be over. Please take action now.
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:26.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:38.060]  Folks, the setup was on. Imagine you go to the Capitol, you're walking around, and then
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:45.140]  a bunch of government employees, police officers, feds, whoever say, oh, here, we're going to
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:49.060]  lead you around the Capitol. Here, look, come over here, lead a prayer over here. Here, look,
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:53.420]  lead a prayer over here. Hey, come over here, come over here. And you follow them around.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:58.940]  They're like an escort. And by the way, they tried to do that to Alex Jones, folks. I mean,
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.140]  look, quite frankly, like people think that something that's going on behind the scenes,
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:07.620]  folks, we're so discombobulated half the time. I'm lucky my head is screwed on straight.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:12.500]  And so we were so discombobulated that day that the government agents that were trying
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:17.900]  to lead us, the same way they led Jacob Chansley, the same people that tried to escort us, they
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:23.300]  escorted Jacob Chansley, basically just fell out because we were so discombobulated, discoordinated,
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:27.060]  trying to figure out what we were going to do that day that it didn't work out. But for
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:33.820]  Chansley, he wasn't so fortunate. He did have the government employee escort around the
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:40.260]  Capitol into and out. And then all of a sudden he ends up in jail for being in the Capitol.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.780]  We had a government escort. That was the situation. And so Pete Santilli joins us once again here
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:52.780]  with Martha Chansley, the mother of Jacob Chansley, January 6th prisoner. Pete, let's
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:59.580]  go ahead and let you host this segment. Thank you so much, Martha. First of all, I want
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:06.460]  to say thank you for the honor of having this conversation because you and I, I would say,
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:13.700]  began talking maybe a year ago. And I shared with you the experiences that I had. But thank
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:20.900]  you for the honor of helping lay out the truth because it's been a hard slog to get the truth
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:26.540]  out about Jacob Chansley. And what he was involved in was one of the most beautiful
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:32.900]  patriotic events on January 6th. And it was hard to get that truth out, hasn't it been?
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:38.700]  Yeah, it has been hard to get it out. And thank you so much for having me, Pete.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:47.060]  You know, Martha, I want to, first of all, I wanted to make sure that, and these voices
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:54.620]  are tampered down, obviously, to keep a very powerful influencer. Can we call him eccentric?
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:36:01.580]  He can stand out and he's a very, very articulate person. I've heard him on the stage, extremely
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:06.540]  wide awake. He has an awesome, powerful presence. That's why you would want to keep somebody
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:11.500]  like him in a box like he is right now. So I want to use this opportunity right out of
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:17.820]  the gate. So I want you to speak to our listening audience. And right now, until he's relieved,
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:22.660]  that did a little bit. But I want you to be his voice, his microphone, right now on his
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:29.860]  behalf. And you tell our listening audience what message you can convey on his behalf
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:35.300]  to the audience.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:42.980]  Well, as far as what's recently taken place, you know, we're, he's, he's very happy that
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:51.140]  this information has come to light because this is the very thing that he said happened.
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:37:00.540]  So it is definitely vindicating to say, look, this is what I said happened. And now you
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:06.580]  can see, here's the proof, here's the, here's the film. And let's revisit that because I
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:12.060]  remember you told me that right from, right from day one. And, and I told you from a defendants
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:16.540]  perspective, I knew I was innocent. I didn't break the law. So I was listening to what
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:22.540]  you were saying, like, and I heard very clearly that when I was, I was actually kind of shocked
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:31.300]  when you said he was offering, I say shocked in that they allowed him to, but he was offering
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.580]  to law enforcement to help de-escalate the crowd inside the building. I heard that a
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.820]  year ago, I think. And guess what? That's come out, hasn't it? It's never been made
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:46.340]  public until recently. But what you said in the beginning, what Jake tried to tell people
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:51.660]  is now we have documenting the documentary proof of that. And his attorney knew that
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:56.860]  part of the story as well. But he said that right from day one. He wanted to help law enforcement
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:01.300]  because he didn't want violence. He's not a violent person, is he?
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:08.460]  He is not a violent person. No, he's very peaceful, loving and kind. And as you mentioned
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:12.220]  before, yes, he would give you the shirt off of his back.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:17.980]  I heard that, as I said, I know somebody who went to high school with him. And that was
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:25.180]  the conversation. You know, another thing that we were all hoping for. And I was there.
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:29.460]  I was hoping that something would have happened that maybe Mike Pence would have said, that's
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:34.180]  it, enough is enough. Maybe him and President Trump were working. There was a lot of uncertainty,
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:40.860]  but we held a lot of hope. So the words that you hear for, like if it was me, and I had
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:47.220]  horns, and I wouldn't go shirtless. It was too cold anyways. But he's a much more courageous
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:52.180]  man than I am. But the words he was speaking, like, this is it, let's go, let's do this.
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:56.780]  Because we were thinking that something spectacular was going to happen.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:03.860]  And also, I knew that the patriots that were there with Kevlar helmets and body armor and
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:08.580]  all that stuff, they were there to protect the crowd from Antifa. There was a mixed bag
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:13.860]  and we weren't going to be afraid to go to Washington DC. So that whole mixed bag of
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:19.180]  stuff, if you listen, and I'll throw back to you so you can speak to this, if you listen
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:25.500]  to Jake's words and he said, man, this is it, we're going to do this. I mean, they convert
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:31.220]  that to like he was conspiring to do bad things. When in fact, we held out hope that something
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:35.940]  truly historic was going to happen on that day. And that's why we were there, we were
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:41.900]  present. Can you speak to that? He held out a lot of hope for his country. He's a Navy
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:48.740]  veteran. Is he not? He is a Navy veteran. Yes. So speak to some of that as to what
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:52.980]  he may have told you. He was, you know, hoping may have happened. I know it's real positive
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:40:01.940]  stuff. Well, he was hoping what we all were hoping is that Pence would have not signed
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:08.060]  that. That he would have said, look, we need to investigate. We need to find out what's
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:16.580]  going on. That's right. That's not what took place. I will also say myself, I was thinking
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:23.820]  to myself being, no, Jacob Chance Lee is a Navy veteran. I'm a Marine Corps veteran.
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:28.980]  I was hoping that the military at some point would get involved because everybody knows
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:33.420]  that now we now know that January 6th was part of the military too. We now know this
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:38.500]  and it's going to come out in court. But I digress and set that aside. I was hoping
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:43.500]  something spectacular like that may have happened. And then, so when I saw the stuff
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:49.900]  like with the smoke and it was so awkward and it was so completely the opposite of the reasons
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:53.540]  why we're there, I thought it was kind of, I'm like, this is kind of stupid right now.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:58.700]  What's going on with the smoke and why are the police firing into the crowd? So now I'm
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:04.500]  going to throw back to you again. What do you remember about what he said? You've been
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:09.540]  very consistent. When he went inside, he didn't want stupid things to happen. He didn't want
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:14.420]  our house to be vandalized. He wanted people to be peaceful. And in fact, he's been on
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:20.540]  the record saying so. Our commander and chief said, go home. Let's go home. He took charge
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:29.460]  of the situation. Did he not? Yeah, I thought he did. And he, as you mentioned before, and
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:36.860]  I've mentioned too, that he volunteered to help the police to de-escalate and help get
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:47.220]  people out. So like there's actual video out there that you hear him saying, let's respect
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:54.540]  the blue. I think he said, respect the blue, the men and women in blue is what he said,
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:59.660]  as they're escorting everybody out. And then you see other video of him standing outside
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:05.180]  that door where people were trying to go in. Did you see that one as well? And he's telling
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:14.660]  people, President Trump said he wants you to go home. It's time to go home and even
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:20.260]  read the tweet. Somebody pulled up the tweet. Donald President Trump's tweet. That's right.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:30.300]  Now, we have just about a couple of minutes here and on the other side. Let's talk about
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:35.980]  his present state. I'm understanding he's strong. Everyone wants to hear that. I want
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:41.740]  everyone to hear that. How's he doing? And what does the future hold for him? As in,
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:46.420]  how much longer could they possibly hold him and torture him in the fashion that they
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:51.780]  are? Stay right there. We'll be going to a break here and then we'll talk about that
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.300]  on the other side. Ladies and gentlemen, you're tuned in live to the special broadcast here

[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:13.180]  the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.780]  United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:24.900]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. And that's who we are.

[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:59.340]  against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:04.020]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels and coming
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:07.820]  under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:12.020]  and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill. Are you
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.780]  addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:20.740]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again,
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:25.220]  I have info words to thank for that. Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.740]  Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:35.420]  Alex Jones and under the info words team. I really do credit that as to why I'm able
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:41.940]  to get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is.
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.660]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:50.820]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people. And I really
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:59.700]  do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World is a historic
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:07.780]  book that documents the globals and their own words planned for our future. That is
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:11.860]  a hellish future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:15.780]  to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.300]  at bookstores, Amazon or infowords.com. But you will never be able to get another signed
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:25.140]  copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:29.700]  left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.780]  a signed copy at infowords.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:39.020]  to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:42.700]  You'll also know that you help keep info words on the air. I'm going to thank those of you
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:46.420]  that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:52.460]  all of you who haven't yet to go to infowords.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:57.100]  copies and go to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.300]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:16.700]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:22.820]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show. Oh, and Troy are sitting in studio for Alex.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:27.820]  We do have Pete Santilli hosting right now with the mother of political prisoner Jacob
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:35.620]  Chansley, Martha Chansley. And I can't even imagine what she is going through watching
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:41.420]  her son go through this. But both of them clearly strong. And so we are praying for them
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:44.820]  quickly before Pete takes back over folks. Remember to keep this transmission on the
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:50.700]  air by shopping at infowarstore.com. I just figured out another product hack, the ultimate
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:57.540]  bone broth plus in a cup of hot coffee. I never saw this one coming, but I am enjoying
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:03.260]  it listening to Pete and Martha talk here. A cup of coffee with a scoop of ultimate bone
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:07.380]  broth plus in it really brings out the flavor. I'm telling you, folks, give that a try. I
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:12.260]  never saw this one coming. I am going to be enjoying this in the future. Now back to Pete
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:18.860]  Santilli with Martha Chansley. Thank you, Owen. And it's amazing seeing
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:24.220]  you know, and I'm going to say even Martha as a family member, it has is a and I'm not
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:30.620]  saying of victims. Okay, we are the politically persecuted. And when I say victim, when you
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:36.380]  have the full force of the government, Martha Chansley coming upon your family. This is
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:41.100]  what you're here to represent as a tell the story because Jacob Chansley has not had the
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:48.340]  opportunity to come to the microphone. Now, of course, he went there. He was on camera.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:53.180]  We could have we have eight, nine minutes in this segment. So I don't want to consume
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:49:01.100]  too much time about the pre planning pre staging. They want to have his face is imagery with
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:05.780]  the backdrop of an insurrection because they script all of that they get all their shots
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:11.580]  set up. It's a reverse engineering of an insurrection. They wanted the insurrection before we even
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:17.740]  got to Washington DC. They lower people in. They put Ukrainian surround Jacob Chansley.
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:24.620]  I have I have a picture of a known neo-Nazi Azov battalion member who was facially recognized
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:29.900]  and he's of course with Jacob Chansley out in front of the Capitol. So so going into
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:36.900]  this, he's hopeful. We go to a great protest, a patriotic event. Awesome. And then he starts
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.700]  coming home and he's driving home. You live in Arizona. And they heard that he's wanted
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:47.380]  and he's a Navy veteran. He's a law abiding citizen. So he's like, okay, I mean, you I
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:53.380]  want you to tell, tell that story. He picked up the phone, he called the FBI and said,
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.340]  I understand you guys are looking for me. And he didn't think anything of it. This is
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:05.140]  well documented. He contacted them, didn't he? Yes, he did. Yes, he did. He called them
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:09.700]  and said, I understand that you're looking for me. And they said, I'm sorry, who are
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:20.100]  you? Who is this? It's amazing, truly amazing for somebody who was who was who was really
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:27.700]  wanted. Um, he he he had to go through some channels just to get to the right person to
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:35.500]  talk to him. People they ended up calling him back. He and he answered those three different
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:43.820]  times. He's, uh, if you see his conduct, I'm gonna I'm gonna mention this, uh, as well.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:46.860]  Because the left because they've got their insurrection narrative, of course, you got
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.980]  to stick to that insurrection narrative and you can only go by their prescripted shots
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:56.740]  and narratives and imagery and fire and, you know, and police getting that you have to
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:02.820]  go by their narrative or else. And anything that you see in the form of a documentary
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:08.660]  or in the discovery, they say that's cherry picking. Well, right there alone, is it not
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:16.220]  the most outrageous statement right there? Because the truth is in full context. Martha,
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:21.820]  you and I know that when you see the truth in full context with all of the video, that
[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:27.940]  he was not a danger to society. He was helping law enforcement and all eyes were on him.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:33.900]  He had a calm demeanor. And in fact, many instances where he said, everybody calm down. And the
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:38.660]  president said, go home. We're going home. Did he not say that? Tried to lead everybody
[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:46.180]  to go home. Absolutely. All of the above. That's what he did. Very calm, cool and collected.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:50.380]  When he read the text out there in front of the Capitol, when President Trump sent the
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:54.380]  met, sent the message out in front of that crowd, what did he refer to President Trump
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:52:01.740]  as? The Commander-in-Chief. I'm sorry, I didn't want to throw you off guard. He said our
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:08.940]  Commander-in-Chief. Commander-in-Chief, yes. Right. And then those are the words spoken
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:15.940]  of a man that is sworn in oath, a Navy veteran, somebody that's not afraid of the chaos of
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:20.980]  the war that was perpetrated upon him and everybody else there. So he was leading the
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:26.260]  charge and said, our Commander-in-Chief says, go home. That's it. We stand down and go.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:36.380]  Right. Well, you know, it's good to show that he was definitely leading his own charge.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:44.100]  You know, and also again, helping people and getting them to be calm. And look, this is
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:48.580]  what our Commander-in-Chief said. Right. This is what we need to do. We need to be
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:54.460]  respectful. Right. Right. As a leader, to suggest that. But then again, I also heard
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:58.540]  him say, you're a man of a woman of free will, you know, the United States of America. You
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:06.620]  can stay if you want. But right, this is what we should do. So, don't misunderstand. A leader.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:11.260]  He is a leader. But when he went there, he wasn't going to lead all those people. He
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:16.940]  was just going because he was supporting our President and Commander-in-Chief President
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:21.780]  Trump. And the leadership role that I'm referring to again, I don't want to give them any opportunity
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:26.220]  to take our words out of context. What I mean by leadership is, here's the message. I'm
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:32.020]  going to relay it to everybody here. Our Commander-in-Chief says this. And then people started to push
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:35.140]  back and he said, you have free will. You can do whatever you want. But this is what
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:38.460]  our Commander-in-Chief says. But you know what? It's okay to say that in front of the
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.780]  crowd. You know why? Because nobody planned to do anything other than to be supportive
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:47.220]  of our President anyway. We weren't there to do that. That's why we weren't there. That's
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:59.500]  why we weren't there because we were supporting our President and our right to peacefully
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:09.060]  protest, I guess. Right? That's right. That's right. Now, we have here and of course, I'm
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:13.540]  going to have you on my show for, I say, a longer format because there's stuff to tell
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:19.860]  and I believe that your family deserves to be honored to tell that story about Jacob,
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:25.260]  to undo the damage done by the mainstream media because they will not only steamroll
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:30.380]  their political adversaries, but they're after a different entity. And if Jacob Chamsley
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:36.780]  and your family is thrown to the woodchipper, that's the disgusting part of what's happening
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:43.020]  here. Right now, your son is not only in great spirits, from what I understand, talk about
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:47.540]  his current spirits. He's in the process of getting out and then he's still going to
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.540]  be under the thumb of the government. But I believe, Martha, that he should be walked
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:57.700]  out the back door right now just on the information that Tucker Carlson has been exposing. Now,
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:04.020]  what we know the truth to be, that even his own attorney didn't have all of that information
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:08.900]  and offered the plea agreement. Do you believe that your attorney right now, Mr. Shipley,
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:13.820]  he could appeal to some mechanism in the courts here. We've got two minutes and 30 seconds
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:19.580]  to go, but I want to get your family to support because Mr. Shipley can do something to get
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:25.500]  him to walk off the door and to help our nation start to heal. Correct?
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:37.380]  Yes. So Bill Shipley, he has already done and put the paperwork through to the court
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:48.300]  system and so now we're waiting. So we just hope and pray that, you know, let's cross
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:54.940]  our fingers that Judge Lamberth is going to say, you know what? In lieu of this information
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:56:02.380]  that's come out, Jacob should be free. But there is a process to it. We have to arm that
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:09.020]  process and I'm in agreement. It would be great to have him just say, you're free.
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:16.140]  So that's our hope and our prayer. That's right. Now, I'm going to say this because
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:22.260]  I have watched and I've tried to help and be supportive and volunteered my time to multiple
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:28.700]  teams because there's hundreds of defendants. Actually, we have right now attorneys that
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:35.820]  are working for free, but it still costs money to investigate and do filings. When you go
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.020]  up against the government in court, it costs millions of dollars to defend yourself. Somebody
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:46.380]  like Mr. Shipley and your family. Now, this gives and go. Givesandgo.com forward slash
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:52.300]  free Jake. It's really imperative. And I didn't I tell you I want to help your family and
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:57.060]  Mr. Shipley, whatever it takes, we're going to rally together because I believe that your
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:02.100]  family is great ambassadors for this message. I'm going to give you the last 30 seconds
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:07.420]  here to give that final message. Thank everybody and just stay tuned for more information to
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:14.180]  come from your family in 30 seconds. Well, thank you so much, everyone, for your love
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.140]  and support and and help. And if you if you like, you are definitely able to do that through
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:28.660]  the gifts and go free Jake. If if folks would like to help with the J six defendants, there's
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:36.540]  another fund for that as well. Good. And we will fix defense fund for the other defendants.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:41.660]  And we got 10 seconds to go. I want to thank you so much. And of course, everybody, stay

[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:59.580]  You know why he can push ahead of the curve and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:03.580]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being
[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:09.180]  like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades. Alex has been right
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:17.020]  on for over a decade. This is reality. It's just pancake. Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:20.980]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming and when it comes time, you people are going
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:24.620]  to be brought to punishment. You're lying to the public. It's disgusting. The media
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:30.020]  continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be America's best known conspiracy
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:36.500]  theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country. Bigger than any of the networks,
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:40.860]  the biggest megaphone in the country. We're going to get fired up about the real thing,
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:54.260]  the things that matter. Burn in hell, New World Order. If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:59:54.260 --> 02:00:05.500]  you are the resistance. Well, it's happened again. Alex Jones was
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:12.100]  right. Here's a video clip of Alex predicting that the big banks would be billed out, the
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:17.620]  liberal Democrat banks billed out, and then the smaller banks, the conservative banks
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:22.780]  would take the losses. Here's that prediction from Alex and then Janet Yellen admitting
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:29.180]  that's the plan following it. Go back the last six months and just grab
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:34.180]  four or five because I know I said it about a hundred times. Times that I said next they'll
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:39.580]  start collapsing regional and lending banks to consolidate them into the big six globalist
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:44.220]  banks that own the private Federal Reserve and the European Union Bank and the rest of
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:49.060]  it. And then out of that, they will call for central bank digital currencies to be rolled
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:57.660]  out. Just on Wednesday, Biden, the third administration of Obama, put out his big new national directive.
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:03.220]  In fact, I forgot to repull that from Wednesday Stack, the big quote, new cybersecurity initiative,
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:06.260]  and you read it. It's really to roll out a central bank digital currency that tracks
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:10.740]  controls everything you do. They'll try to ban all the normal cryptocurrencies that are
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:15.780]  actually independent and decentralized power. That's all announced in there. And I said
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:20.700]  on Wednesday, look for them to crash the regional banks to bring in total control.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:25.820]  We know the enemy's playbook. I said, will it be a banking collapse and the central
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:31.580]  bank digital currency casual society rollout? Will it be a cyber attack to bring that in?
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:38.020]  Will it be both? Will it be a massive new terror attack, an escalation in the war? These
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:41.780]  are all cards because I've been looking over the enemy's shoulder what they got in their
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:48.060]  hands. I don't know exactly how they're going to play the cards. I don't know when they're
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:54.020]  going to play the cards, but I know what cards they got. And that's a lot.
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:57.860]  So General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former top national security
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:03.340]  advisor to President Trump and a true patriot, will be joining us here in about 57 minutes
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:11.260]  from now. And we're going to cover the waterfront with the general commercial free for an hour
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:21.140]  straight once he gets on with us. So we're going to start with some of the banking issues
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:27.020]  we're dealing with on it. Will the deposits in every community bank in Oklahoma, regardless
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:33.220]  of their size, be fully insured now? Are they fully recovered? Every bank, every community
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:38.260]  bank in Oklahoma, regardless of the size of the deposit, will they get the same treatment
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:48.340]  that SVBBP just got or signature bank just got? Bank only gets that treatment if a majority
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:57.900]  of the FDIC board, a supermajority, a supermajority of the Fed board and I in consultation with
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:06.500]  the president, determine that the failure to protect uninsured depositors would create
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:12.460]  systemic risk and significant economic and financial consequences.
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:23.780]  So what is your plan to keep large depositors from moving their funds out of community banks
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:30.700]  into the big banks? We have seen the mergers of banks over the past decade. I'm concerned
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.020]  you're about to accelerate that by encouraging anyone who has a large deposit in a community
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:41.020]  bank to say we're not going to make you whole but if you go to one of our preferred banks,
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:50.820]  we will make you whole at that point. Look, I mean, that's certainly not something
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:58.620]  that we're encouraging. That is happening right now. That is happening because depositors
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:04.860]  are concerned about the bank failures that have happened and whether or not other banks
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:10.020]  could also fail. No, it's happening because you're fully insured no matter what the amount
[02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.860]  is. If you're in a big bank, you're not fully insured if you're in a community bank. Well,
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:22.460]  you're not fully insured and you were at signature and it just barely met that threshold. You
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:31.500]  were at signature. Well, we felt that there was a serious risk of contagion that could
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:37.540]  have brought down. Okay, so it's pretty obvious what's going on here now and as soon as they
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:43.140]  start really promoting the central bank digital currencies, that'll be the proof in the pudding.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:46.940]  They collapsed, they shorted the big banks intentionally so they could bail out the big
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:51.420]  banks and now they're going to consolidate all the smaller banks into the big banks and
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:59.260]  then roll out the central bank digital currencies with less banks to have to agree to it.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:03.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon
[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:10.500]  developed. Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock and I got to tell
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:14.780]  you I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing. The way it makes your gums feel,
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:20.020]  what it does to your mouth is insane. We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:23.740]  and there's such great things for the body. Then you add that with tea tree oil and a
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:29.380]  bunch of other essential oils, it is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:35.460]  inflammation in your mouth. I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfoolwarestore.com
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:40.500]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste and while you're at it, check out the new ashwagandha
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.580]  line of products. We have ashwagandha with black pepper extract for your libido, your
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:51.140]  testosterone in pill form and we have the pure ashwagandha root gummies as well now available
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:55.540]  at mfoolwarestore.com. They're amazing products and they fund the info war. Take action now
[02:05:55.540 --> 02:06:15.540]  at mfoolwarestore.com. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. They
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:23.380]  realize that the shots were causing the explosion of chronic disease, asthma, neuroimmune diseases
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:30.420]  like psychosis, ADHD, autism, cancer, cancer, cancer, autoimmune diseases. So they realized
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:37.820]  in 2011 they caused it all. So we're in 2009 and when our paper came out, they realized
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:44.100]  that these were the shots were associated strongly, very strongly, the chance of them
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:49.860]  not being associated. It was like being struck by lightning, one in at least a million in
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:57.020]  a p value. And so they covered this all up because of course they were liable now because
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:07.220]  for the 42 million Americans who are asymptomatic carriers of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 and other X
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:14.620]  MRVs, other manufactured mouse monkey and human viruses. The game was premeditated murder
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:20.900]  of the 42 million people you're liable for their injury. Premeditated murder. If you
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:28.020]  give somebody who already has an antibody a shot, you will get antibody dependent enhancement.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:31.940]  Oh, so they were getting rid of the people they'd already poisoned knowing that giving
[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:37.740]  them a second or third or fourth dose would kill them. Wow. Correct. Kill us, cremate
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:46.060]  us, add a mask, add a mask and isolation and you'll blame the people for COPD or any of
[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:52.860]  the other co-diseases. You never inject an HIV positive person with any vaccine. We never
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:08:00.260]  did. Never until now. You do not drive the disease causing entity through their body.
[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:05.180]  How do we know that all over the world, the people that have had the COPD vaccine are
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:11.340]  testing positive for HIV? Is that because the spike protein is from HIV? It has GP120,
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:18.700]  like a protein 120. Absolutely. It also has the monkey, mouse and manufactured X MRV.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:26.060]  So the spike protein is killing literally the 12 percent. So you're saying it's a binary
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:32.500]  weapon where they already are preloaded with it and this triggers the next phase. Correct.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:41.660]  And the more vaccines you got, especially Gardasil, because that has the toxic synthetic
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:47.020]  lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot. Prior to the COVID shot, the
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:52.860]  deadliest vaccine. We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:59.580]  all the things. Yeah, why is it particularly the athletes? Because they operate at oxygen
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:05.900]  max capacity max. They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria. This
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:12.820]  is an energy production oxygen necessary disease. So they create, that's what they're finding.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:20.740]  They turbo charge the blood clots. Correct. Wow. And a lack of oxygen. So constricted
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:26.260]  blood vessels too, because athletes are running, they're constricted, they're working so that
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.740]  the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:37.780]  products, I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:43.180]  It does all under the tongue, give you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:47.060]  vasculature. You looked at our nitric oxide. I saw it was the top rate of the latest private
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:51.100]  label. It's the best seller. You've looked at our formula. You like it? I did. And I
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:55.180]  do. Yes. I'm not a scientist like you. What is, what do these compounds do creating nitric
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:10:01.700]  oxide? What does it do? It relaxes the vasculature. So the clot will go through and not restrict.
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:21.700]  It allows it to relax. It lowers the blood pressure. Back here live in studio, the Alex
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.940]  Jones show. I'll ensure you're sitting in for Alex today. We do have another guest coming
[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:33.660]  up in studio, Savannah Hernandez. But first, this video of Alex Jones on Rogan from years
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:40.220]  ago is going viral and it's being considered one of the more powerful Alex Jones moments.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:11:07.060]  Do you remember this one in clip three?
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:12.060]  We're on this planet and Einstein's physics showed it. Max Planck's physics showed it
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:16.020]  all. There's at least 12 dimensions. And now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:20.900]  are coming on stage. It's a false hologram. It is artificial. The computers are scanning
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:27.780]  it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity is leading in to this
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:33.020]  universe. That's what they call dark matter. So we're like a thought or a dream that's
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:37.780]  a wisp in some computer programs, some God's mind, whatever. They're proving it all. It's
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:43.500]  all coming out. Now, there's like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension.
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.620]  This just turned over the most horrible things. It's what it resonates to. And it's trying
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:52.380]  to get up into the third dimension. That's just a basic level consciousness to launch
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:56.740]  into the next levels. And our species are already way up in the fifth, sixth dimension
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:12:01.980]  consciously are best people. But there's this big war trying to like basically destroy
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:06.820]  humanity because humanity has free will. And there's a decision to which level we want
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:11.860]  to go to. We have free will. So evil's allowed to come and contend and not just good. And
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:18.740]  the elites themselves believe they're racing using human technology to try to take our
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:23.740]  best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge
[02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:28.940]  with machines, transcend and break away from the failed species of this man, which is kind
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:33.140]  of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad, projecting
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:38.540]  it on themselves, set up believing, no, it's a human test about building us up. And so
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:42.540]  Google was set up 18, 19 years ago. This was, I knew about this before. It was classified,
[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:47.460]  I'm just saying I've been sourced. That they wanted to build a giant artificial system.
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:53.220]  And Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:58.780]  on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:03.180]  into the internet of science. And so all of our thoughts go into it. And we're actually
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.860]  building a computer that has real neurons in real time. That's also psychically connected
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:14.580]  to us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction powers, future
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:19.660]  prediction powers, true crystal ball. But the big secret is, once you have a crystal
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:24.620]  ball and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:30.220]  the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals, as we know,
[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:36.500]  and a true 2.0 in a very bad way, hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:41.740]  knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us, not in some PKD wirehead system where
[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:45.220]  we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were
[02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:49.620]  already wired and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:53.780]  system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:58.580]  system. There's now a human counter strike taking place to shut this off before it gets
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:02.900]  fully into place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:08.220]  where humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are in control of
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:12.140]  this AI system before humanity is destroyed. Wait a minute, humanity is only controlled
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:18.300]  with AI? How do the pedophiles get in control of AI? The pedophiles at whatever level, the
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.380]  devil, whatever you want to call it, is an interventional thing that gives them advanced
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:25.500]  technology, the fallen one that's not in this world, is giving them advanced knowledge
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:30.540]  out of constructed systems that have already been used before on other populations. What?
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:35.540]  That's Satan? What are you talking about? Explain that. You're saying something insane. That's
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:40.060]  something that the stupid preacher tells you about who's totally controlled or something
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:45.980]  you read about in the news or TV. This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:52.340]  us, to build something that absorbs us and kills us rather than the divine free will
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:56.820]  we're given to build something much better than empowers the species. So the species is
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:01.300]  now making a decision about its entire future. Where are you getting this from? That's what
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:05.500]  it is. But where are you getting it from? I know. From looking at all the data, researching
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:10.380]  and studying and watching the enemy. That's the big decision that humanity has now got
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:11.980]  before us.
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:19.660]  There it is, Alex Jones on one of the most, it might be the most, Rogan podcast of all
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:28.140]  time. You don't get commentary and breakdown like that anywhere else. All right, the Alex
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:34.260]  Jones show rolls on. Remember, we have Savannah Hernandez coming up in studio in about 20
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:40.060]  minutes. There was a gigantic terror group outside of a Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:46.700]  event the other night. The media didn't cover it. And so a bunch of men clad in black hoodies
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:52.420]  and face masks were chasing a woman around terrorizing her. And that woman was Savannah
[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:58.460]  Hernandez. We'll be right back.
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:04.100]  We now have three new game changing products that are in stock at info store.com. And one
[02:16:04.100 --> 02:16:07.940]  of our best selling products sold out for over a year. Let's now back at stock. Our
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:13.820]  prebiotic does the introduction. Such amazing things, your gut flora, your overall health.
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:18.660]  What it does is essential to read about it at infostore.com. And now the fourth toothpaste

[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:21.380]  States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:30.420]  They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's

[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:53.020]  month, I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books we didn't have for sale. But now
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:59.340]  I signed the last books and get them right now.
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:09.900]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. From the
[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:15.180]  front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:26.180]  It's the beginning of this year. We are confronted with unprecedented and multiple challenges.
[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:35.460]  We need to overcome the most critical fragmentation. And the most critical fragmentation is between
[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:47.580]  those who take a constructive attitude and those who are just bystanders, observers and
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:57.020]  even go into the negative, critical and confrontational attitude. There it is out in the open. You
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:02.700]  know, you know who he's talking about. You know who has a negative and confrontational
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:07.900]  attitude. Okay, those that are critical against the World Economic Forum in the New World
[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:12.700]  Order. You want to know who Klaus Schwab is talking about. The man that people claim doesn't
[02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:17.020]  exist. The man that the deep state and the shadow government claim isn't real. That these
[02:21:17.020 --> 02:21:21.060]  people aren't out there in Switzerland meeting together talking about how they're going to
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:26.500]  oppose people that oppose their agendas, that are satanic, that are tyrannical, that want
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:30.540]  to shut down the free world and shut down free humanity and their freedoms. He's talking
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:35.140]  about you, ladies and gentlemen. He's talking about Alex Jones. He's talking about info
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:39.940]  wars. He's talking about Bandat video. He's talking about the free world. He's talking
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:44.500]  about the United States of America. He's talking about anybody that opposes everything that
[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:50.660]  these people stand for, which is Satanism, Luciferianism and ultimate tyranny, not only
[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:55.420]  in the real world, but they want to take it into a VRAR world as well because they want
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:22:01.340]  to control your mind. What he is talking about is opposing everything that you love, everything
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:05.500]  that you stand for, everything that you've ever known because they're envisioning a new
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:10.700]  world where it's controlled by these global elites, where it's a virtual reality matrix,
[02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:14.660]  where you will owe nothing and be happy and you will just absolutely accept everything
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:20.020]  they shove down your mouth. What Klaus Schwab says out in the open is what he means. A lot
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:23.980]  of people take a look at that guy and say, oh, he's just an old man that wants to, you
[02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:28.020]  know, not be a boomer and be an old wine skin that wants to get with the times and move
[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:33.660]  us into the future. Yeah, but with the tyrannical agenda that wants to impose literal slavery
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:39.820]  upon humanity, and he says it out in the open that we need to overcome those that are critical
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:45.100]  against us, that have a negative mindset against us. This is the war you're in. Every single
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:49.740]  one of us watching right now are in this info war. Every single one of us are engaged. Every
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:54.580]  single one of us, we are all John Connor. We are all facing Skynet. We are all facing
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:59.940]  the AI takeover. We are all facing the technocracy. We are all facing the censorship. We are all
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:06.900]  facing these things that are opposing humanity and info wars.com, band.video, infowarstore.com
[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:12.820]  is literally the tip of the spear and out front and center. That is why they are so
[02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:17.180]  banned. That is why they get demonized and slandered everywhere you look in the media.
[02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:22.300]  You want to know why? Because Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all of these global elites know
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:28.260]  exactly what this network stands for, and it is to stand against them and their tyranny.
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:32.900]  This is exactly why we need to support free speech systems, because if we don't have this,
[02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:37.740]  if we don't have an alternative economy, if we don't have alternative media that is standing
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:42.580]  alone standing their ground, we will get defeated by Skynet. We will get defeated by the New
[02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:47.180]  World Order. And thank God people are waking up to the reality because of clips like this
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:55.900]  that these people are A, in existence, B, homicidal tyrannical maniacs, and C, they literally
[02:23:55.900 --> 02:24:01.620]  are opposing the free world and free humanity. This is why we need to support info wars because
[02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:06.500]  this is everything we stand for. It's bigger than Alex Jones. It's bigger than info wars.
[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:11.580]  It's bigger than me. It's bigger than you. This is about free humanity. This is about
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:16.900]  good versus evil, and God fighting the devil. You got to pick a side now.
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:21.180]  So let's take a look now at the latest with the Silicon Valley Bank, and it looks like
[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:26.340]  this could be a major pivot moment to move us into the central bank digital currencies.
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:30.500]  Kevin O'Leary, Slam's idiot manager of Silicon Valley Bank, says we should have let it fail.
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:37.860]  Yeah, they were Democrats, but they did let it fail. Now they're bailing it out and consolidating.
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:42.100]  Biden's bailout of Silicon Valley Bank helped save investment flow to sensitive Chinese aerospace
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:46.580]  and defense ventures. So the people paying Biden's millions of dollars and the Democrats
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:49.820]  all getting bailed out here, but the little guy is going to suffer.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:54.740]  George Bank and World Economic Forum look towards the end of cash. So this is definitely
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:59.900]  going to be their moment. But the problem is they would rather have four or five banks
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:03.540]  that they already know are committed to the central banking digital currency than 400,
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:07.940]  500 banks where they'd have to go to each bank and each independent bank and community
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:12.460]  bank and credit union to try to convince them to go under it. Pentagon mobilized to support
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:16.460]  tech startups after bank failure. Again, all these liberal leftist groups, the Silicon
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:20.580]  Valley Bank CEO that cashed out three and a half million dollars of stock right before
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:25.860]  his bank collapse is now enjoying his time at his $3 million mansion in Hawaii. He's
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:33.740]  a huge Democrat. So nobody's going to be looking into that. And SVB has now filed for bankruptcy.
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:38.660]  So this could be their major move, consolidate the banks, collapse all the banks, bail out
[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:42.620]  the big banks and their Democrat friends that run the banks, consolidate them. And that
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:47.300]  would make it a lot easier with less resistance to bring in the central bank digital currency.
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.180]  Here's David Sacks talking about that in clip five.
[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:55.620]  Let's discuss what would have happened if the Fed didn't step in. And by the way, just
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:59.260]  because I think the Fed did the right thing on Sunday night, doesn't mean I can't blame
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:04.900]  them for the things they did wrong in 2021. Both can be true. You know, they did the right
[02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:10.780]  thing one night. They did the wrong thing for 10 years. Any event. Well, what happened?
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:15.420]  What I saw happening on Friday with all the money flowing out of banks, I can tell you
[02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:20.100]  where those the money was going. It was going out of regional banks and it was going into
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:25.020]  top four banks because what happened in 2008, remember when they had this whole too big to
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:31.180]  fail thing, what people don't understand is they actually canonized too big to fail.
[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:35.900]  So it wasn't just this one time thing. They actually wrote it into law and they instead
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:41.900]  of calling it too big to fail, they call it systemically important bank, a Sib, S-I-B.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.180]  And there's four systemically important banks. They're the trillion dollar club. They have
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:49.700]  over a trillion dollars in assets and everybody who's below that, the kind of the regional
[02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:56.140]  banks, they're not systemically important. So what does that mean? The Fed has basically
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:59.940]  guaranteed everything in the Sibs because they've said that, listen, we can never let
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:04.180]  one of these banks go down because they'll take down the whole financial system. So this
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:08.260]  is what everyone was talking about on Friday. They're like, oh, wait a second, if the Fed
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:13.180]  is going to protect the Sibs, but not protect all these regional banks, why would I ever
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:17.940]  put my money in a regional bank? And it wasn't just SVB. SVB was done at that point. It was
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:22.340]  First Republic and it was Pac West and it was 20 other regional banks who were under
[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:26.940]  massive stress and all the money was leaving and they're going to Jamie Dimon. And I kept
[02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:32.460]  saying, you know, the person who's licking his chops over this whole thing, who doesn't
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:36.580]  want to bail out of the regional banks is Jamie Dimon because he manages JPMorgan Chase,
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:40.780]  the biggest bank. So I don't get all these like would-be populists who think they're
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:46.420]  being helpful here. All they're doing is being useful idiots for the big four banks because
[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:52.580]  without the government intervening to solve the mess that they created, all the cash should
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:57.500]  be going to the top four banks. And my view is we need a vibrant regional banking system
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:03.660]  in this country because if you don't have that, our freedom is going to be greatly curtailed.
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:08.460]  I mean, you talk about the risk of a social credit system, the easiest way to have a social
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:12.500]  credit system would be to force everyone's money into four banks and then they can just
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:16.740]  implement the system through their terms of service. And who runs these four banks is
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:20.300]  always people who are politically connected in Washington and Davos. In fact, there's
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:27.420]  a special version of the Sibs that meet in Davos called the G-Sibs, the global systemically
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:32.100]  important banks. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. It's institutionalized. The only
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:37.500]  way to push back on this is to have a diverse set of regional and community banks. And this
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:42.100]  is how you have to see. There's only two teams to be on here, Jamie. You can be on
[02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:47.100]  Team Sib or Team Regional Bank. I'm on Team Regional Bank. And I'm sorry that some people
[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:52.180]  don't like that some of the depositors of one regional bank where people they don't like,
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:29:00.700]  but we got to see the bigger picture here. What you think most banned man in America,
[02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:11.420]  Alex Jones. I want you to know something Alex Jones was right. Alex is right about
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:17.460]  far more than he's wrong. Alex has been right on for over a decade. I don't care how you
[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:23.820]  slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right. Think about how frustrated
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:28.020]  we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:33.980]  those guys who've been awake for like decades. Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:39.980]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:46.380]  of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment. The government, beers, Alex Jones. That's
[02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:58.260]  why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:05.500]  I've got some goodness. Our high quality supplements really work. And we have about an 80% reorder
[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:11.540]  rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news is around 1%
[02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:15.580]  or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to infowarstore.com and ever
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:20.060]  actually buy the products. So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:25.820]  war. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:31.300]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com
[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:35.820]  and got some of these amazing products. I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints,

[02:30:54.980 --> 02:31:02.180]  together infowarstore.com. I'm a huge believer in information. I watch info wars every day
[02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:06.300]  and follow out shows closely. You know why he can push ahead of the curve and he's been
[02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:11.140]  demonized as a conspiracy theorist. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been
[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:15.420]  awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake
[02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:26.020]  for like decades. Alex has been right on for over a decade. This is reality. Truth is stranger
[02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:30.620]  than fiction. The revolution of peaceful information is coming. And when it comes time, you people
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:34.460]  are going to be brought to punishment. You're lying to the public. Disgusting. The media
[02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:39.820]  continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be America's best known conspiracy
[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:46.340]  theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks,
[02:31:46.340 --> 02:32:00.580]  the biggest megaphone in the country. Burn in hell, new world order. I talk a lot about
[02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:06.380]  the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:10.660]  of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at info wars, people
[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:17.740]  behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:22.180]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:27.420]  five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole
[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:31.660]  info wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:36.860]  that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word.
[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:40.860]  I know you pray for us. And that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners
[02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:45.100]  never go to info wars store.com. And you never buy great products that enrich and empower
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:49.660]  your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:54.420]  actually go by products info wars store.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went
[02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:59.260]  to info wars store.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:06.260]  Thank you very much for listening to the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:38.900]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show. Owen Schreuer filling in and Savannah Hernandez
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:47.460]  in studio with me now. And I guess it's become such a common occurrence for leftist groups
[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:53.660]  clad in all black with their faces covered and weapons destroying property, intimidating,
[02:33:53.660 --> 02:33:58.260]  harassing, terrorizing people. It's such a common story now that the mainstream media
[02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:02.980]  just doesn't even cover it. And Savannah has been on the receiving end of these violent
[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:07.820]  terroristic threats for years now, most recently in California. And I asked before we went
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:12.260]  live here, Hey, has anybody asked for an interview from cable news about this? Because usually
[02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:16.780]  they would want to cover this stuff. And you said no. So do you think it's just such a
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:22.620]  common occurrence now for us to see leftists, Democrat terror groups out there that, Oh,
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:27.500]  here they are smashing up a college campus. Here they are attacking, intimidating, harassing,
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:32.420]  terrorizing women. Here they are vandalizing public property. Here they are attacking police
[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:36.980]  officers. It's just so common now that I guess we just don't even care to cover it.
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:43.060]  Absolutely. And you know, again, I just want to highlight how this is an intrusion on my
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:48.060]  first amendment constitutional right of freedom of the press, right? The video that I put
[02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:52.980]  out on my Twitter basically detailed how I go out and when I cover these types of events,
[02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:57.060]  my journalism is very neutral. It is point and shoot. I basically give the location
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:35:01.420]  of where I'm at a quick and neutral description of what's going on. And I allow the footage
[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:06.060]  to speak for itself. And for the crime of doing that time and time again, I have been
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:10.980]  hunted down by the antifa mob. And this is just a normal everyday occurrence for journalists
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:15.260]  like myself. So it's really not newsworthy, which is a very sad thing. I mean, keep in
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:20.500]  mind that Andy know suffered a blade, a brain bleed just a couple years ago. And now we
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:25.300]  fast forward to 2023. And you have journalists who are fearing for their lives. And you know,
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:30.460]  the best part about this story as well is I am a lone female who was covering this at
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:36.700]  the time. I was with a friend and they saw that he was with me. So they go up to him.
[02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:42.500]  They demand to see his phone. They demand that he tells them where I was at. He refused.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:46.780]  He ended up having to push them and run away because they were threatening violence. I
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:51.180]  went up to the police and I told them the situation. And what did the police do? They
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:55.020]  said, sorry, we can't help you. You can leave campus if you want. Keep in mind that there
[02:35:55.020 --> 02:36:01.540]  was a mob of about 100 antifa circling the campus looking for me. They had already identified
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:05.500]  me at this point. The police turned me away. And if I'm being honest with you, the police
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:12.900]  presence at UC Davis was quite frankly pathetic. And I understand that we live in a country
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:18.420]  now where police do have their hands tied post George Floyd riots, where if they enact
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:23.700]  the law, if they enforce the law, they are the ones that are going to be prosecuted.
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:28.260]  They are the ones that are going to be put in jail just like George Floyd. We've seen
[02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:33.260]  this time and time again. So I understand why the police don't want to push back. And
[02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:38.540]  that's why antifa was able to go and break down the windows. But it's really sad to see
[02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:42.900]  because after antifa broke the windows as well, I just want to give this viewpoint too.
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:47.660]  If they were really about going in and shutting down fascism and Nazism, they would have opened
[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:50.740]  the doors because they could have. They broke the windows in and they would have opened
[02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:54.820]  the doors and they would have stormed in. But they didn't because they're scared because
[02:36:54.820 --> 02:37:00.220]  they're larking. And the only thing that they really can do is intimidate young journalists
[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:04.980]  like myself and mob up on us. They don't really want to be arrested. They're not really fighting
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:11.500]  for anything. So again, two pathetic performance from the police. And I don't understand why
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:18.740]  the DOJ and the FBI are able to find, charge and imprison peaceful January 6th protesters.
[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:23.860]  I was there by the way, and it wasn't that scary, guys. I somehow got through it without
[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:30.140]  PTSD. The FBI and DOJ able to go and use all of their time and resources for that. But
[02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:33.660]  domestic terrorists are allowed to impede on my constitutional rights and nobody gives
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:34.660]  a damn.
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:39.740]  Well, and let's be clear what's going on here. This system has now made it so that leftist
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:43.980]  terror groups are allowed to operate. And that's what this is. If you're a conservative
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:47.660]  and you wave an American flag in DC, you're arrested, you're a terrorist, you're a criminal,
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:52.180]  you're going to be prosecuted. If you're a leftist terrorist that destroys property,
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:56.300]  attacks people, threatens people, harasses people, you're allowed to do that. That's
[02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:01.660]  perfectly acceptable. I mean, the video proof your eyewitness testimony is all you need
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:02.660]  to see.
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:06.580]  And let's take it a step further, too. If you're a parent who has the audacity to care
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:11.540]  about what your child is being taught in a public school and you go to the school board,
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:15.860]  the DOJ is also going to label you a domestic terrorist. So understand that it's not even
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:19.660]  like antithen protests on the streets to the audience. We already know this, but it's also
[02:38:19.660 --> 02:38:23.660]  parents who just care about their children and want to have a say in what they are being
[02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:25.900]  taught in this country's out of control.
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:31.300]  But the video that you shot where you have a group of these, I mean, these are domestic
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:35.860]  terrorists. These are criminals. Why else would they all be in the same uniform covering
[02:38:35.860 --> 02:38:40.540]  their faces, clad in black? I mean, you know, typical what you would expect from a criminal.
[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:45.380]  And there's a line of them and they're allowed to just march right up to the people that
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:49.780]  are lining up to go to this event. I mean, that is unacceptable. I mean, why did the
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:55.460]  police not step in right there? They should have been bashing skulls. Or, okay, let me
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:59.740]  just calm myself down. They should have at least stepped in between. I mean, how do they
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:05.700]  allow this? How do they let a group of thugs, a group of violent thugs walk up to a group
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.820]  of people just standing in line like that? That is ridiculous.
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:12.860]  Oh, and that's not even the worst part. They went up to the police and did that as well.
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:16.740]  And they started mobbing the police, pushing the police up against barricades. And the
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:20.020]  police just stood there and took it. And I heard through the grapevine on the ground
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:23.540]  that the police didn't want the attack to be directed towards them, which is why they
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:28.980]  were trying to remain as neutral as possible and were basically allowing Antifa to run
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:33.580]  rampant. And keep in mind, too, that there were UC Davis students who were simply curious,
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:36.700]  wanted to see what was going on so they were filming because it's not every day you have
[02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:43.820]  a mob of domestic terrorists, you know, destroying your school. The Antifa members were targeting
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:48.420]  these students. The Antifa members were throwing rocks at their political opponents that were
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:52.940]  hitting students. Where were the campus police? Where were the actual police to step in and
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:57.740]  do anything about this? And again, I've gotten to this point with police officers where I
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:01.340]  know that they're essential for society, but I am going to start calling this out because
[02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:06.140]  it's absolutely unacceptable that for the past three years, I have watched police officers
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:10.460]  arrest American citizens for defending themselves. I have watched police officers direct Trump
[02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:15.700]  supporters into a mobile BLM. I have watched police officers stand down as domestic terrorists
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:19.580]  have terrorized American citizens that are exercising their constitutional rights. This
[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:23.460]  is not the first time. This is not the second time. This is the third time where my life
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:27.340]  has been threatened or I have been mobbed or attacked and I've gone up to police and
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:30.700]  asked for help and they've turned me away. Well, and that's the problem is it's going
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:35.700]  to create a phenomenon where we cheer on defunding the police because they're the one standing
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:40.380]  in the way of justice at this point. Now, you take a look at that one video where there's
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:44.900]  a guy who comes up. I mean, this looks like a pretty strong man here. He looks like he's
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:49.180]  over six feet, probably at least 250 pounds. Looks like he hits the gym regularly and he
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:53.940]  takes on a whole mob of these fascists. But here's the problem. If you take justice into
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:59.420]  your own hands and he decided to beat the pulp out of one or 10 of these little soy boy twigs,
[02:40:59.420 --> 02:41:03.100]  then he would have been arrested. And so it's going to reach a point where we want the police
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:08.060]  to funded so that we can defend ourselves. Because at this point, if you defend yourself,
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:13.140]  you're going to be the one that goes to jail. And here's what I've noticed. They always
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:16.860]  want to go after the week. So they go after a girl who's out there reporting. They go
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.300]  after some little college students out there reporting. They show that big man. I'm not
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.940]  the biggest guy in the world. I can handle myself like when I step up to these people,
[02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:28.340]  they back away. They don't want to come after me. They don't want to go after the six foot
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:32.820]  four guy that's 250 pounds, probably could bench press five of them. No, no, no, no,
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:37.060]  they don't want to touch them. They want to harass a reporter. They want to harass a young
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:41.780]  college freshman that doesn't know any better. Have you seen that pattern? Absolutely. Time
[02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:46.500]  and time again, it's why I am targeted over and over. And I just want to clarify, I'm
[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:51.100]  not for calling to defund the police, but I am calling for the modern day police officer
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:56.300]  to understand where we're at and to make the decision consciously to do your job and protect
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:01.460]  American citizens when we ask you for it or let it or let us protect ourselves. Again,
[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:06.180]  if the police were like, okay, these thugs want to show up and start harassing and intimidating
[02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:09.900]  people. And that guy that you filmed who looks like he could probably take down all of it.
[02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:12.900]  He'd probably take him down like a bowling ball. If he decides, you know what, I'm going
[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:16.660]  to go ahead and smash some skulls. I'm going to go ahead and boom, skull number one, who's
[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:21.100]  next? Boom, skull number two, who's next? And the police are going to say, oh, yeah,
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:25.820]  well, you asked for it, mutual combat, then okay, that's one thing. But we all know as
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:31.020]  soon as one fist hit a face of one of those poor little soy boy in Tifa mentally deranged
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:35.300]  people, he would get arrested and spend a night in jail. It's totally wrong. So that's
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:39.900]  the problem here is that the left has been promoted to act as terrorists. And now they
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:44.500]  know that they're above the law. And they know the justice department won't go after
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:49.860]  them. They know the local police department won't go after them. Doesn't matter what level
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:55.180]  of terroristic engagement they put on display, destroying property, harassing people. It doesn't
[02:42:55.180 --> 02:43:01.780]  matter. They've been given carte blanche. Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:12.740]  I want you to know something. Alex Jones was right. Alex is right about far more things
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:18.100]  wrong. Alex has been right on court over a decade. I don't care how you slice it, dice
[02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:24.300]  it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right. Think about how frustrated we are
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:28.540]  if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:34.300]  have been awake for like decades. Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones
[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:40.580]  never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:46.540]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment. The government, deers, Alex Jones. That's why
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:54.900]  the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:39.500]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract. You guys censored
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:57.180]  Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is to

[02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:25.020]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:29.660]  They can go destroy cities, destroy towns, attack journalists, attack women, attack
[02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:33.540]  police officers, and then you can't do anything about it. They're protected by the Justice
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:37.380]  Department, protected by the FBI, protected by the Democrat Party, protected by the American
[02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:42.420]  media. But you know, soon as one of their skulls smashed into the concrete and started
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:47.740]  squirting blood all over their fellow comrades that, oh, that person would be the terrorist,
[02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:52.140]  that person would be the bad guy. And once again, that would send the message that you
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:56.780]  don't touch our terror groups. Now that is unless the police decided to stand down and
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:01.340]  maybe let a couple commies calls get crushed. But let's just say there's a reason I don't
[02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:05.020]  go out into these crowds anymore, folks. And people are always asking, you know, oh, and
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:07.740]  how come you don't go deal with these? How come you don't go to these protests? How come
[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:12.500]  you don't? Folks, I get attacked every time. If I defend myself, I get arrested. You're
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:19.220]  not going to see me for months. I'll be gone. That's it. Game over for Shroyer. So I'm appreciative
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:22.340]  that Savannah Hernandez goes out and deals with this stuff, even though she shouldn't
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:28.500]  have to. But you know, even, even your desire to cover this as a hungry journalist is starting
[02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:33.860]  to wane. It isn't, it isn't. It makes me more defiant when a lot of these antifa types
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:38.260]  come and tell me that I can't report. As soon as anybody tells me you can't film, it's
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:42.260]  game over for them. And I'm filming everything at that point. Like Pete Butt, Judge Secretary?
[02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:48.100]  Oh, yeah, he was a fun one. Don't misgender her or was it a him? Oh, oh, the, the press
[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:51.700]  secretary, I thought you were talking about Pete himself, our favorite diversity hire.
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:57.420]  Um, yeah, Pete and the press secretary, that was a very fun environment to be in. And,
[02:48:57.420 --> 02:49:03.260]  you know, it makes me defiant because I understand the foundations of this country. I understand
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:07.780]  what my rights are and I understand that commies can't come in and tell me what I can and cannot
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:14.940]  do in public streets in America as a journalist. However, with that being said, yes, I am tired
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:19.460]  of being beat up. It's not a fun thing for me. I am a small woman. And after I did get
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:24.100]  beat up in Austin, I didn't have a good time after. I was nervous. I had to go to boxing
[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:28.260]  classes for about a year because I had so much pent up anger and frustration over the
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:33.100]  fact that I was beat up and I couldn't retaliate at all. I couldn't go and find these people
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:36.820]  and try to give them a piece of my mind. The police didn't do anything about it. The police
[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:40.580]  that night, as soon as I went up to them, said, go ahead and call the police department
[02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:44.260]  and file a report. And I asked them to walk me back to my car because it was the middle
[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:49.940]  of the night to which they responded, no. So I mean, again, I care a lot. I care a lot
[02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:53.660]  about this country and that's why I will go and report on these things. But at the same
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:59.220]  time, if the police do want to continue to have us supporting them, they need to step
[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:03.940]  up and they need to defend our constitutional rights and they need to stop defending domestic
[02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:04.940]  terrorists.
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:08.500]  And it's going to go one of two ways. And the situation that's happened in Austin is
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:12.100]  that the police are just quitting and there's basically no police in this town at all anymore.
[02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:16.780]  And you know, I've been through this as well, living in Austin for a while. And the problem
[02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:21.780]  is that at the top, the Democrats run the police departments. And so a lot of the police
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:27.700]  officers are good men and women that want to do their job and they're held back by the
[02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:31.780]  Democrat Party. Multiple times here in Austin, I've been, I mean, folks, I don't have to
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:36.020]  tell you, you've seen it. I've been assaulted, spat on, punched, death threats, everything.
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:40.180]  And the police officers that are on the scene who are good people say, absolutely, they
[02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:44.020]  assaulted you. Absolutely. That's a credible death threat. Absolutely. Here's the police
[02:50:44.020 --> 02:50:47.340]  report. I'm going to help you. I'm going to file it. Some of them I even followed up
[02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:51.220]  with. They were trying to help me. And every time it gets to the top, they see, oh, oh,
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:55.620]  and Shroyer, throw it out. Oh, another death threat against Shroyer, throw it out. Oh,
[02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:59.020]  Shroyer assaulted, throw it out. And they tell me that this is what goes on, by the way.
[02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:02.100]  I mean, I talked to these police officers. So this is what's going on. So they have a
[02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:06.820]  choice. Do they either continue to prop up the Democrat Party run Austin that attacks
[02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:11.940]  people or do they just quit? And sadly, they're quitting. But you're no stranger to this. In
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:17.460]  fact, the first time we went out, it's probably like 2018 or something, you may remember,
[02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:22.540]  we were out at some Antifa event at a park and you were filming at the time. You were
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:27.260]  filming me doing an interview with a lady who was holding an infant. Remember this lady
[02:51:27.260 --> 02:51:32.980]  holding an infant? And I was interviewing her about this event. And an Antifa guy comes
[02:51:32.980 --> 02:51:38.260]  up and shoves you because you were holding the camera. Do you remember that? I do now.
[02:51:38.260 --> 02:51:43.340]  This woman had an infant in her arms and a radical Antifa comes charging in to shove
[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:48.300]  Savannah Hernandez. Yeah, that was a, that was a fun time. And, you know, Antifa continues
[02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:53.260]  to run rampant because they know that they can. Funny enough, I had put this video on
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:56.980]  my Twitter explaining what happened and my dad commented and they, he was like, well,
[02:51:56.980 --> 02:52:02.220]  the DOJ can't find them because they commit their acts of terrorism at night. And I was
[02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:06.420]  like, Oh, right, right. Because remember, Merrick Garland, he can't figure out who's
[02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:10.380]  attacking pregnancy centers in the United States because the crimes are happening at
[02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:14.860]  night. What a mystery. I know, I know it's, it's too much for our justice department,
[02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:19.020]  sadly. But if you were peacefully walking around the Capitol on January 6th, RIP to
[02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:23.140]  you, you're still going to be rotting in prison. I know so many people who are still being
[02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:27.300]  politically persecuted by our government is absolutely disgusting. Why is Jacob Chancelley
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:32.060]  even in prison right now? I don't understand where we're at. I mean, I do understand actually
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:35.340]  because we've been doing this. We've been reporting on the streets for the past couple
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:40.340]  of years and we have seen how this country has degraded. And you know, and as well, I'm
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:45.100]  not just doing the Antifa reporting. I'm also going out onto the streets of UT campus to
[02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:50.060]  get insight into the minds of our next leaders, the next generation to understand how we have
[02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:55.540]  gotten to where we have gotten to as a country. And the brainwashing, the indoctrination that
[02:52:55.540 --> 02:53:01.500]  I have been faced with of these students is horrifying. None of them can think for themselves.
[02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:05.980]  And I have you mean that that green haired liberal commie with 10 nose piercings doesn't
[02:53:05.980 --> 02:53:12.300]  know what's going on? I know, I know it's extremely surprising. But I've started doing
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:15.660]  this new thing, right, where I'm not necessarily trying to own the lives, but I'm trying to
[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:21.100]  make them critically think. So when I go when I speak to them, I end up owning themselves.
[02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:24.660]  I ask them, I say, Hey, hey, what do you think that way? Who taught you that? And I love
[02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:29.020]  asking them this because then they have to think about the fact that this is not their
[02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:32.940]  own thought process. This is not their own idea. And it kind of breaks their brain a
[02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:37.500]  little bit and breaks their conditioning because they go, I actually don't know why I think
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:42.700]  this. And it gets the, you know, gears churning in their head, which is a great thing. But
[02:53:42.700 --> 02:53:49.740]  why is it that we have such a huge majority of our youth who think that they have white
[02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:53.620]  privilege, who think that they were oppressed just because their skin is brown? It's absolutely
[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:57.540]  horrific and disgusting. Like I can go to UT campus right now and go find you a black
[02:53:57.540 --> 02:54:00.900]  pop student who will say, I'm scared of the police because they hunt black men and women
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:03.700]  down every single day. That's not true.
[02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:08.980]  You know, this is actually a really important thing you're getting into here because a lot
[02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:13.700]  of people go through this, including myself. Now, I was never a radical leftist commie,
[02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:18.340]  but I definitely had some liberal indoctrination and beliefs after going through college. Like
[02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:24.020]  I was anti-second amendment and some other things for a short period of my life. And
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:28.460]  this is really why they hate info wars so much because really more than anything, forget
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:33.860]  about the information that we cover, we make you think. And so you tune into an Alex Jones
[02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:38.500]  show or an info war show or a Savannah Hernandez show on rumble. It makes you think you may
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.300]  agree with what they're saying. You may disagree with what they're saying, but it makes you
[02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:47.260]  think for the first time in your life. And so there's this huge phenomenon. And this
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:52.820]  is what you're exposing on the streets. These children is what they are. They've never thought
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:58.060]  for themselves before. Everything they think, everything they believe is something injected
[02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:03.260]  into their mind like inception. And that is the direct result of our education system.
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:06.900]  Now I was thinking about this earlier because I was like, how did we get to the point where
[02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:12.620]  SVB collapses, right? And the average American who is going to be paying that off is not
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:17.060]  going to understand, you know, why everything is so much more expensive, why they're feeling
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:20.580]  the pinch in their wallet. And it is because of our education system, right? It has to
[02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:24.700]  do with the fact that we don't teach our children about money, how inflation works, how taxes
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:29.580]  work and what is our school system focused in on teaching these kids about white supremacy,
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:32.820]  teaching them that the KKK is running rampant and that minorities are oppressed and that
[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:36.660]  America is horrific and that it was built on the backs of slaves. We're teaching our
[02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:41.300]  children and the next generation everything all wrong. And that's why in the modern day,
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:45.220]  you go and you ask people, hey, why is there inflation? Why are things a little bit more
[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:50.560]  expensive? And they go because of Donald Trump. Oh, what happened with SVB? Oh, it was Donald
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.380]  Trump. Oh, why are the food prices more expensive because of Donald Trump? And that's all they
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:56:01.100]  can ever continue to repeat because the education system has specifically taught them not to
[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:05.780]  be leaders, but to be subservient followers who listen to what they're told, who never
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:12.420]  break the rules, who never think for themselves. And again, that is why our country is currently
[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:18.580]  demolished. We have been subverted culturally, intellectually. Good luck to us because we
[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:25.100]  are now the the country of diversity, equity and inclusion. And that is why North Korea,
[02:56:25.100 --> 02:56:30.580]  China, Russia are absolutely laughing at us as they should. We are not a world superpower
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:35.100]  anymore. I'm going to be honest when I say this. And we're coming up to the timeframe
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:39.500]  in which which our empire is about to collapse. So good luck to us. And you know, there's
[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:45.740]  this phenomenon of I mean, it's not really cherry picking. And I get why people do it.
[02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:49.860]  But you go out, you find an Instagram model, you find an Instagram thought, you put her
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:53.700]  on your podcast, she says stupid stuff for two hours, you get viral clips, I get it,
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:58.860]  it's low hanging fruit. The issue is not these girls, you know, the I kind of in a way, I
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:02.580]  feel bad for these girls. They've never learned anything. Also, it's not cherry picking that
[02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:09.540]  is what the average modern woman thinks. But my point is that I actually feel bad that
[02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:15.500]  they've been so misled, right? And that now they're being used as fodder on podcasts.
[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:18.300]  So it's like, Hey, let's not help them and build them up. Let's put them on podcasts
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:24.380]  and show you how pathetic they are. Yep. Can't be. I mean, you I know you don't like
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:27.780]  be having women portrayed like that. And that's obviously not who you are. But I just see it
[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:30.180]  so much. And it's just like, this is what these girls are taught. I don't know what
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:32.940]  you expect. Savannah Hernandez, where can people follow your work?

[02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:41.820]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing, the thing that matters.
[02:59:41.820 --> 02:59:49.860]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:59:49.860 --> 03:00:10.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:20.820]  I know Alex doesn't like to talk about this a lot on air, but the Bible says, let another
[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:26.700]  mouth praise you. I'm going to do that right now. Alex Jones has held so many people in
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:32.020]  this industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah
[03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:36.980]  Hernandez. How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:41.460]  of Alex Jones, including myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:46.500]  man and because of this platform. And I would probably not even be half of where I am right
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:51.020]  now. If it weren't for Alex Jones, even being my friend or talking to me, I mean, I've been
[03:00:51.020 --> 03:00:57.020]  able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cast, the super Tim Cast IRL. Listen,
[03:00:57.020 --> 03:01:02.420]  what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you don't
[03:01:02.420 --> 03:01:07.260]  know what you have until it's gone. We need to support free speech systems right now.
[03:01:07.260 --> 03:01:12.060]  So go check out the store. Go support their store. Go support info wars. Leave a donation
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:17.580]  right now. Don't wait until they're gone. I think pretty quick, Alex, I think we're
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:21.540]  seeing what we've been talking about, what you've been talking about for decades is the
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:26.180]  fall of the Republic, this infiltration of globalism where they want to destroy any
[03:01:26.180 --> 03:01:31.660]  shape or form of nationalism for the American people. A few years ago, Alex, it was you.
[03:01:31.660 --> 03:01:35.020]  You were in the hot seat. You've been the trailblazer from the beginning. They decided
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:38.980]  to target you in info wars because that's what you represented. Nobody thought that
[03:01:38.980 --> 03:01:43.100]  they would go after Trump just as harshly. They did. They de-platformed a sitting United
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:47.540]  States president. They silenced and censored him immediately because he represented the
[03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:51.180]  whole populist movement. And what people need to understand, they're going to continue
[03:01:51.180 --> 03:01:55.420]  to do this. This is why they're going after Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene because
[03:01:55.420 --> 03:02:00.260]  she's a continuation of the populist movement. And you take a look at that kangaroo court.
[03:02:00.260 --> 03:02:05.620]  It's literally a joke. They want to literally paint anybody that wears a shirt that says
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:11.060]  1776 or July 4th or the 4th of July or anything that's pro-americana or freedom. They are
[03:02:11.060 --> 03:02:15.860]  literally going to label you as a domestic terrorist in the United States of America.
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:19.540]  It's backwards. And this is what people need to understand because I know a lot of people
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:24.140]  sit back and they watch what happens to you, Alex. They watch what happens to Joe Rogan,
[03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:27.220]  these big guys. And it's like, you know what? They're probably going to make it. They're
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:32.980]  going to be fine. But what's happening is we are all Alex Jones. We are all Joe Rogan.
[03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:38.980]  We are all MTG. It doesn't matter what side you find yourself on. These people just want
[03:02:38.980 --> 03:02:44.660]  one thing. It's power. It's power and control of your mind and your life. And people need
[03:02:44.660 --> 03:02:49.740]  to just set aside their political differences and see that they're literally intentionally
[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:54.500]  pinning us against each other. They want to spark a civil war. So they have an excuse
[03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:58.740]  for complete total government overreach to control every single one of us. And at this
[03:02:58.740 --> 03:03:03.700]  point, Alex, that is not a conspiracy theory. That is quickly becoming reality and we're
[03:03:03.700 --> 03:03:08.020]  watching it unfold. It is in the process right now. It's being installed. So I hope we don't
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:12.340]  have to continue to go down this dark path where, I don't know, Alex, is Disney just
[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:17.180]  going to start pushing out open child pornography? Is that when we're going to draw the line,
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:21.260]  Alex? That's not when we draw the line. We don't draw the line when they're openly creating
[03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:25.140]  child porn and pushing it out and shoving it down your mouth and saying, you must accept
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:28.780]  this. If you don't, you're a bigot. That's not when we draw the line out. We draw the
[03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:34.100]  line now because they're opposing child grooming laws. People need to understand. They need
[03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:39.740]  to support people that get this stuff, especially info wars and banned out video. We don't wait
[03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:45.100]  until info wars is gone to finally wake up and say, Hey, they're at the tip of the spear.
[03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:48.420]  Maybe we should have supported them. Where can I donate now? Oh, I'm sorry. Info wars
[03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:52.620]  is gone. You cannot go to a donate button anymore. We need to support patriots that
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:57.180]  get this and that are pushing back right now. And now is the time, Alex, we cannot wait.
[03:03:57.180 --> 03:04:02.100]  Trying to shut down info wars is like trying to snuff Paul Revere.
[03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:19.980]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:25.300]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight? You better believe you got one.
[03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:53.780]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:04:55.300 --> 03:05:02.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, the great reset in the war for the world is a historic
[03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:06.860]  book that documents the globals and their own words plan for our future that is a hellish
[03:05:06.860 --> 03:05:10.820]  future. Now you'll be always while they sell our books, I guess they're starting to ban
[03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:15.260]  them, be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset in the war for the world at bookstores
[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:19.580]  Amazon or info wars.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[03:05:19.580 --> 03:05:24.540]  book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about 1000 left of them right
[03:05:24.540 --> 03:05:30.020]  now. So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world, a signed copy at info
[03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:34.740]  wars.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:34.740 --> 03:05:38.580]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[03:05:38.580 --> 03:05:42.060]  you help keep info wars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed
[03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:46.900]  copies of the book or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't
[03:05:46.900 --> 03:05:51.540]  yet to go to info wars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:56.300]  and donate to the library or get them to the local school. This is an info war. I'm counting
[03:05:56.300 --> 03:06:05.660]  on you and thank you for your support. Welcome back to the Algae Jones show. I'm your guest
[03:06:05.660 --> 03:06:10.660]  host, Jay Dyer, and today we're going to be talking about the history of secret societies
[03:06:10.660 --> 03:06:19.020]  because people get the idea that secret societies are some recent development that resulted
[03:06:19.020 --> 03:06:24.700]  in the deep state as we hear about and the shadow government that runs the US and perhaps
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:30.420]  even the majority of the Western world. But reality, the history of secret societies goes
[03:06:30.420 --> 03:06:37.460]  back to the ancient world and the notion of a secret form of government is in fact throughout
[03:06:37.460 --> 03:06:42.820]  Plato. And we've mentioned this many times, of course, but in the Republic, Plato talks
[03:06:42.820 --> 03:06:48.060]  about the noble lie. And this is a lie that the state has to tell, the all powerful God
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:55.220]  state has to tell in order to keep the populace in line, to keep them marching in step and
[03:06:55.220 --> 03:07:00.420]  to believe the narrative, whatever that narrative may be, that the secret council of the elite
[03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:05.420]  passed down. Now, in the Republic, early on, Plato had this as a philosopher king at the
[03:07:05.420 --> 03:07:10.180]  top and it's that pyramid, right? The below him is the guardian class who's more or less
[03:07:10.180 --> 03:07:14.220]  a communist class and then there's a worker class is completely controlled. And that becomes
[03:07:14.220 --> 03:07:19.860]  the model for all socialists and Marxist governments in the future. And also by extension of the
[03:07:19.860 --> 03:07:24.100]  coming emerging technocracy, that's what they want to put in place. Bertrand Russell says
[03:07:24.100 --> 03:07:28.180]  an impact on science of science of society that the model for the coming technocracy
[03:07:28.180 --> 03:07:33.100]  is Plato's Republic. Now, Plato wrote another lesser known book towards the end of his life
[03:07:33.100 --> 03:07:38.140]  called The Laws. And in The Laws, he even expands on this notion and he comes with this
[03:07:38.140 --> 03:07:44.260]  idea that what he calls the Council of Night in IGHT, which is odd because they meet at
[03:07:44.260 --> 03:07:51.140]  night in secret. And he says that this is going to be a council of 10 or 11 elders,
[03:07:51.140 --> 03:07:56.300]  not necessarily old people, but wise people. And in the West, we eventually even get something
[03:07:56.300 --> 03:08:01.140]  like this where people talk to about the wise men that run the West, people like Kissinger,
[03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:05.580]  Brzezinski and others are known as the wise men coming out of the intelligence apparatus.
[03:08:05.580 --> 03:08:09.780]  And one of the strictures that Plato has in the law is that other people that could be
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:16.260]  admitted to this Council of Night for the ideal Republic, this, this, the super state
[03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:22.020]  would be individuals who had engaged in foreign intelligence and reconnaissance. It's actually
[03:08:22.020 --> 03:08:30.100]  Plato proposing in The Laws, a deep state, a shadow government, literally run by a secret
[03:08:30.100 --> 03:08:38.780]  society that engages in deception, that engages in running things from a shadow nighttime
[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:43.860]  government, right? So it's shadows, it's in the shadows, Council of Night, right? Nighttime,
[03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:48.500]  that's the significance there. And so right there in one of the most famous books in the
[03:08:48.500 --> 03:08:52.980]  history of all philosophy and perhaps even in all Western civilization is the positing
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:09:01.140]  of an ideal society being run by a shadow government by a secret society. And unfortunately,
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:06.420]  it's just sort of bound up almost with the history of empires in the history of the state
[03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:13.380]  that they're run or they're consorted, consorting with some form of secret society. One reason
[03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:19.580]  for that is as the famous historian and scholar, Francis Dvorak says in his book on the history
[03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:28.740]  of intelligence agencies in terms of empires, is that the intelligence apparatus, the reconnaissance,
[03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:34.100]  the secrecy needed for engaging in those kinds of operations necessitated something like
[03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:40.180]  a secret society. So binding people via oaths and whatnot as he discusses in his book goes
[03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:45.860]  back to the ancient world. And some of the first spies were in fact mailmen, the mailman
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:52.340]  and that would deliver the letters or the scrolls for Caesar or for Pharaoh or whoever,
[03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:58.380]  they were oftentimes spies. And so they were the most traveled and the ones that were getting
[03:09:58.380 --> 03:10:02.500]  most the most reconnaissance. And so that again aligns up with kind of what Plato was
[03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:08.460]  talking about in the Council of Night and the laws. The same idea of course has always
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:13.180]  kind of been there because every government ever, every state ever has engaged in espionage,
[03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:17.940]  has engaged in intelligence operations and activities. Now, typically though in the
[03:10:17.940 --> 03:10:22.540]  history of the world, intelligence was part of military. It was part of the apparatus
[03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:28.660]  of warfare. It was an element of gaining, you know, information on the enemy and whatnot.
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:35.660]  And in the Art of War by Machiavelli, there are significant sections in the book that
[03:10:35.660 --> 03:10:39.660]  discuss this in great detail, particularly book six, because book six is all about trickery,
[03:10:39.660 --> 03:10:44.940]  detection, reconnaissance, false flags, you know, all kinds of things that can be done
[03:10:44.940 --> 03:10:51.420]  during warfare to gain the upper hand. And Machiavelli wrote that of course kind of giving
[03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:56.300]  attribution to Sun Tzu's classic Art of War. And Machiavelli's text is really one of the
[03:10:56.300 --> 03:11:01.060]  texts that they characterize as modern warfare. It's one of those key texts where we have
[03:11:01.060 --> 03:11:07.300]  a pivot out of medieval warfare and into modern warfare. So we know that there's always going
[03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:12.860]  to be this kind of tendency towards secrecy in the military and in that kind of reconnaissance
[03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:17.540]  and intelligence apparatus. But what we don't always see necessarily is that secret society
[03:11:17.540 --> 03:11:22.580]  oath religious element. But more and more we do see that as we dig into history in terms
[03:11:22.580 --> 03:11:29.380]  of coming up into the modern period, particularly with the post-enlightenment era. And the
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:34.260]  reason for this is that certain secret societies that had been suppressed in the Middle Ages,
[03:11:34.260 --> 03:11:39.740]  such as the Knights Templar, for example. The Knights Templar famously were suppressed
[03:11:39.740 --> 03:11:45.540]  by the Roman Catholic Church and the King of France in the 1300s. I think it's the Council
[03:11:45.540 --> 03:11:49.980]  of the End, 1312, somewhere in there, where we are told that the Templars were engaged
[03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:57.580]  in nefarious activities and kissing the butt of somebody and worshiping a dead rat or cat
[03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:01.380]  or something like something so crazy like this. Again, we don't know if that's true,
[03:12:01.380 --> 03:12:06.660]  but it was very likely, right? There was something going on. And they represented some kind of
[03:12:06.660 --> 03:12:12.380]  alternative form of power, some alternative nexus to the existing King of France and the
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:18.620]  Papacy at that time, the 1300s. And at that time, the Papacy was very wrapped up in geopolitical
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:25.700]  operations amongst the Franks. And then it's shifting over into the Germans and into the
[03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:30.220]  time of the Medici. And so then we get the Renaissance. Now, the Renaissance, especially
[03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:35.180]  the Italian Renaissance, I'm speaking particularly before the Elizabethan Renaissance, the Italian
[03:12:35.180 --> 03:12:42.700]  Renaissance saw this birth of this re-interest in magic, neoplatonism and secret societies.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:48.700]  And we had a promotion of a lot of this through those benefactors of the Renaissance, you
[03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:52.900]  know, the Medici's and the Picodilla Miranda was these characters who were really interested
[03:12:52.900 --> 03:12:57.900]  in bringing back the ancient Greek mysteries. And so they had this great affinity for Plato
[03:12:57.900 --> 03:13:04.180]  especially. And remember, platonic government is a government by secret society, taking
[03:13:04.180 --> 03:13:09.140]  oaths, initiating you into mysteries. And if you know Platonism, you know that Platonism
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:14.940]  is very similar to the Orphic Mysteries. And a lot of Platonism has parallel with Pythagoreanism.
[03:13:14.940 --> 03:13:20.420]  It borrows from Pythagoras. Pythagoras had two key beliefs, according to the classic
[03:13:20.420 --> 03:13:26.580]  text by James Billington, Fire in the Minds of Men. And now this is not a conspiracy text.
[03:13:26.580 --> 03:13:31.980]  He's a famous librarian of Congress who wrote this history of all revolutionary thought.
[03:13:31.980 --> 03:13:37.820]  He says, if we come up to the 1700s and the time of the French Revolution and the influence
[03:13:37.820 --> 03:13:41.820]  on the French Revolution by certain people who have been influenced by Adam of I shopped,
[03:13:41.820 --> 03:13:47.680]  that is the Bavarian Illuminati founder, he says, Billington says, there was two dictums
[03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:54.220]  from Pythagoras that the Illuminas and the revolutionary socialists at that time, the
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:14:03.780]  communists borrowed. And that was number one, the laws should be made to perfect man. So
[03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:09.700]  laws exist not to restrain evil, but to bring about ultimately the virtue of man, supposedly,
[03:14:09.700 --> 03:14:14.020]  or the perfection of man. And this is why the Illuminati themselves became known as
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:19.100]  the perfect Abelis, the original Bavarian Illuminati were called the perfect Abelis.
[03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:23.540]  And they believe that the that you could perfect man via some sort of purely natural law or
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:29.460]  natural religion. And so they went into various churches, various groups, very sex, including
[03:14:29.460 --> 03:14:35.660]  Freemasonry to infiltrate it and to utilize those lodges to promote their principles.
[03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:40.020]  They were successful, at least in sparking the French Revolution and of course, in influencing
[03:14:40.020 --> 03:14:43.860]  other areas. But whether or not there's an actual Bavarian Illuminati that continues to
[03:14:43.860 --> 03:14:50.620]  today is up for debate because they were essentially rationalists. It would be people like Voltaire,
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:56.140]  the Jacobins of the French Revolution, characters who were radical communists, right? The other
[03:14:56.140 --> 03:15:02.260]  dictum of Pythagoras that bishops said would be needed would be the dictum of holding all
[03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:08.120]  property and common amongst all men. Now they knew that not everybody was ready for that.
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:13.580]  So the true communism existed at the highest levels, highest levels of bishops Illuminati,
[03:15:13.580 --> 03:15:19.340]  for example, were atheistic and communistic. And that influences that secret society network
[03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:25.420]  influences later figures like Karl Marx. Karl Marx will found his own secret society,
[03:15:25.420 --> 03:15:29.420]  the League of the Just, and then success of other secret societies that he was connected
[03:15:29.420 --> 03:15:35.180]  to that become networks for again, this promotion of radical communism, radical egalitarianism
[03:15:35.180 --> 03:15:40.460]  and the overthrow of all existing structures to bring about the next phase of revolution,
[03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:45.860]  which is a never ending revolution, according to Lenin and Trotsky. So you're beginning
[03:15:45.860 --> 03:15:49.820]  to see I think how the revolution is never ending. Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex
[03:15:49.820 --> 03:15:53.940]  Jones show. I'm going to show you how today we're running the exact same way or the same
[03:15:53.940 --> 03:15:55.940]  model of a deep state.
[03:15:55.940 --> 03:16:01.860]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels in like
[03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:05.660]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[03:16:05.660 --> 03:16:10.020]  addicts and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:10.020 --> 03:16:13.580]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:13.580 --> 03:16:18.820]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again,
[03:16:18.820 --> 03:16:22.420]  I, you know, I have info words to thank for that. Looking back on the day, I was able
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:27.460]  to ask President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because, you know, I truly
[03:16:27.460 --> 03:16:31.900]  was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info words team. I really do credit
[03:16:31.900 --> 03:16:37.140]  that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because Alex's whole
[03:16:37.140 --> 03:16:41.980]  mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses
[03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:46.540]  to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm addicted to telling the truth
[03:16:46.540 --> 03:16:51.020]  and helping American people. And I really do credit Alex for, you know, living and filling
[03:16:51.020 --> 03:16:57.340]  that within me early on in my career.

[03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:16.260]  Welcome back to the OxygenStorm, your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. And as you
[03:20:16.260 --> 03:20:21.460]  can see now that I have these Boomer reading glasses on, I'm actually a lot more authoritative
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:27.500]  and a lot more scholarly. So I'm even more reputable now that I have these glasses on.
[03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:33.740]  You have to listen to me, even with all due reverence and submission, because I can scow
[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:39.780]  at you over these like this. You see, it doesn't just make me look academic and authoritative.
[03:20:39.780 --> 03:20:43.820]  Now we were talking about James Billington firing the minds of men, the history of the
[03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:48.020]  revolutionary faith. I was talking about how we were getting up to vice shop and the the
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:53.140]  illuminous and a little bit before vice shop in those guys in England, we had the outbreak
[03:20:53.140 --> 03:20:57.660]  of a lot of secret societies and the spread of Masonic lodges throughout Europe, probably
[03:20:57.660 --> 03:21:01.940]  the world's most famous secret society is Freemasonry. And what we're doing today is
[03:21:01.940 --> 03:21:07.180]  really kind of a demystifying operation because people sort of get bamboozled by a lot of
[03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:12.900]  the symbols of the mysteries and all this kind of stuff. And I'm going to do a little
[03:21:12.900 --> 03:21:18.180]  bit of a demystifying today, a little bit of a debunking. What are we debunking? That
[03:21:18.180 --> 03:21:23.540]  these secret societies are all powerful, that they are anything other than collections
[03:21:23.540 --> 03:21:29.820]  of human beings with common cause purpose to engage oftentimes in espionage. And this
[03:21:29.820 --> 03:21:37.740]  is the key connection here that secret societies are quite often state actors or co-opted by
[03:21:37.740 --> 03:21:44.580]  state actors or co-opted by foreign actors to engage in espionage and reconnaissance
[03:21:44.580 --> 03:21:50.940]  and subversion. Not always, there may be some weirdos that create their own little sect
[03:21:50.940 --> 03:21:55.980]  or cult or group. So not every cult or every sect is necessarily the creation of some state
[03:21:55.980 --> 03:22:01.100]  or part of some vast conspiracy, but many of the more famous secret societies in history
[03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:07.940]  have been, in fact, the tools of various powers and maybe not even state powers, maybe even
[03:22:07.940 --> 03:22:14.820]  very powerful financial powers, very powerful private financial powers have perhaps created
[03:22:14.820 --> 03:22:18.940]  secret societies. In fact, we'll see that when we talk about Cecil Rhodes and the Milner
[03:22:18.940 --> 03:22:24.780]  Roundtable groups in a moment that Dr. Kel quickly covers because he explains the secret
[03:22:24.780 --> 03:22:32.260]  society behind that whole British Empire operation. Now, in terms of masonry, for example, if
[03:22:32.260 --> 03:22:39.260]  you go back to the 1600s, as masonry was beginning to get really popular throughout Europe in
[03:22:39.260 --> 03:22:45.740]  what they call the speculative lodges, and this is more of a mystical and kind of esoteric
[03:22:45.740 --> 03:22:52.660]  approach to the mason's guild of middle ages, which were a Catholic institution that eventually
[03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:58.580]  got used for geopolitical and subversive purposes. So it eventually got retooled and repurposed
[03:22:58.580 --> 03:23:02.260]  in what were called speculative masonic lodges. And then eventually we have the birth of the
[03:23:02.260 --> 03:23:07.420]  Grand Lodge of England. And around this time of the, you know, Henry VIII and the split
[03:23:07.420 --> 03:23:12.180]  between the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church, there was this explosion
[03:23:12.180 --> 03:23:17.460]  of lodges and hermeticism. And this is roughly around the time of the Elizabethan Renaissance.
[03:23:17.460 --> 03:23:22.220]  And a lot of these characters who wrote famous plays and wrote famous poems, you know, Ben
[03:23:22.220 --> 03:23:28.660]  Johnson and William Shakespeare, Edmund Spencer, they would actually encode a lot of hermetic
[03:23:28.660 --> 03:23:35.380]  alchemical messages in their writings, studied a bunch of this in grad school. And that's
[03:23:35.380 --> 03:23:40.740]  because it was all the rage at this time to be interested in the hermetic arts, the secret
[03:23:40.740 --> 03:23:44.620]  arts, alchemy and this kind of stuff. And one of those figures, one of the most famous
[03:23:44.620 --> 03:23:50.420]  figures in the history of British intelligence was a famous occultist secret society member.
[03:23:50.420 --> 03:23:56.660]  You may have heard of him. His name is Dr. John Dee. Dr. John Dee is famous because he's
[03:23:56.660 --> 03:24:05.340]  the first 007. He would sign his letters with a cane and two balls. That's a two ball cane,
[03:24:05.340 --> 03:24:10.020]  literally, to the queen so that she would know when she saw that little symbol. Okay,
[03:24:10.020 --> 03:24:16.900]  this is from our boy Dr. John Dee. Dr. John Dee was a famous occultist and he believed
[03:24:16.900 --> 03:24:22.620]  that his neoplatonic mysteries and magic would eventually achieve, you could achieve deification
[03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:28.060]  or apotheosis that man could become God through this process in the Dr. John Dee system. He's
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:33.700]  also the creator of what's called Inokian magic, this elaborate system of language and
[03:24:33.700 --> 03:24:42.540]  symbols that supposedly is to contact angels. But in my estimate what this is about is spycraft.
[03:24:42.540 --> 03:24:47.380]  Not better way to send messages back to the queen. There's John Dee with the queen there
[03:24:47.380 --> 03:24:54.220]  doing his magic spells and whatnot. Then using this arcane absurd invented Inokian
[03:24:54.220 --> 03:25:00.820]  magic. In other words, it's a tool, it's a cryptographic technique for encoding messages
[03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:05.860]  for the queen. So I'm sorry to demystify a lot of this stuff. Now that's not to say
[03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:10.140]  that there are no subversive occultists or that there aren't people to take it seriously.
[03:25:10.140 --> 03:25:15.700]  There are. But what we're talking about today is this element that's often overlooked, which
[03:25:15.700 --> 03:25:20.660]  is that a lot of secret society networking and all this kind of stuff is merely intelligence
[03:25:20.660 --> 03:25:26.500]  apparatuses of the state or some powerful interest. For example, there's a famous historian's
[03:25:26.500 --> 03:25:33.100]  text, Builders of Empire, Jessica Harlan Jacobs. And she is a mainline historian from
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:37.900]  the, this is the University of North Carolina Press. She teaches at the University of Florida.
[03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:42.220]  Nothing to do with conspiracy texts, purely academic texts. And her book, Builders of
[03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:46.940]  Empire is just about how the Masonic lodges by the time of the founding of the Grand Lodge
[03:25:46.940 --> 03:25:52.340]  of England became the intelligence network of the British Empire. And if you watch movies,
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:57.700]  for example, like The Man Who Would Be King with Mike O'Kane and Sean Conrad, you'll
[03:25:57.700 --> 03:26:03.000]  notice that they are essentially spies. They're reconnaissance operatives for the British
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:10.500]  Army. And their job is to go around the various Masonic lodges and gaining intelligence.
[03:26:10.500 --> 03:26:19.220]  And they end up being these scallywag conmen. And that's a famous novel, I think by Kipling,
[03:26:19.220 --> 03:26:26.380]  right? So the real history, the real, the real machinations behind that gets back to
[03:26:26.380 --> 03:26:34.220]  things like the Royal Society. And this is a book that is written by a Mason. Robert
[03:26:34.220 --> 03:26:38.980]  Lohmus wrote a book called Free Masonry and the Birth of Modern Science. And it's his
[03:26:38.980 --> 03:26:43.620]  account of the history of the Royal Society. And in that book, he basically says that modern
[03:26:43.620 --> 03:26:49.820]  scientism is really the product, the invention of, the promotion of the Royal Society. And
[03:26:49.820 --> 03:26:56.360]  that's really this, the ideological underpinnings of the British Empire. So British Entity
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:04.740]  Intelligence, Allah, the structures like Oxford, Cambridge and so forth, they're really eaten.
[03:27:04.740 --> 03:27:09.140]  These things are the brains, you could say, of the British Empire and the British Intelligence
[03:27:09.140 --> 03:27:14.020]  apparatus going back, as he said, even to the war, even before the establishment of
[03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:21.940]  MI6. And so secret societies, as you can see, they form this very important network for
[03:27:21.940 --> 03:27:26.020]  the state or for, again, other interests beyond the state. And that's what we're going to
[03:27:26.020 --> 03:27:31.420]  look at next. What about non-state actors? Is there such a thing as secret societies
[03:27:31.420 --> 03:27:38.460]  that might serve private interests, private corporations, corporate interests, a corporate
[03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:45.620]  secret society? Could that exist? Is there such a thing? Yes, absolutely. In fact, there's
[03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:51.980]  many of these. Now, there's a movie that's no good. I think it has Julia Roberts in it
[03:27:51.980 --> 03:27:55.900]  and maybe Clyde Owen or somebody or Pierce Bros. and I remember who's in it. But there's
[03:27:55.900 --> 03:28:01.060]  a movie about corporate espionage with Julia Roberts. And so if you're looking for an example
[03:28:01.060 --> 03:28:04.620]  of something like that, you could watch that movie where it's something goofy, like one
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:10.660]  spy is trying to steal the secret recipe for Coca-Cola for some other company like Pepsi.
[03:28:10.660 --> 03:28:14.660]  It's something ridiculous like that. But there really is such a thing as corporate espionage.
[03:28:14.660 --> 03:28:20.180]  And oftentimes they will recruit people out of the government sphere, the civil sphere
[03:28:20.180 --> 03:28:26.740]  of espionage to go into working for some corporation to do that kind of operation.
[03:28:26.740 --> 03:28:30.420]  So that does exist. But I'm talking about something bigger than that, something bigger
[03:28:30.420 --> 03:28:37.780]  scale. What about a financial secret society? A secret society arranged around the idea
[03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:43.100]  of revolution. Yeah, that's it. Clyde Owen, that's it. Is there such a thing as a secret
[03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:48.100]  society that might be interested in reorganizing the entire world around a technocratic style
[03:28:48.100 --> 03:28:52.540]  of governance? Perhaps private banking interests to have a secret society. We're going to
[03:28:52.540 --> 03:28:57.140]  look at Dr. Quigley saying, yes, there is such a thing when we come back.

[03:33:05.100 --> 03:33:16.660]  Welcome back to the afternoon show. I am your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We
[03:33:16.660 --> 03:33:22.620]  are talking about the history of secret societies demystifying the secret societies and explaining
[03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:31.300]  them to be what they really are, which is adjuncts of the state or networks for reconnaissance,
[03:33:31.300 --> 03:33:38.460]  intelligence, and subversion, revolution, etc., etc., etc. And it may be many different
[03:33:38.460 --> 03:33:43.640]  cults or groups, right? For example, the Central Intelligence Agency has a history of utilizing
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:48.980]  and infiltrating and using many cults over the last 50 or 60 years. So it is not restricted
[03:33:48.980 --> 03:33:54.780]  to, well, there is one cult running everything. Rather, various powers will utilize these
[03:33:54.780 --> 03:33:59.780]  networks and utilize these societies for various purposes.
[03:33:59.780 --> 03:34:05.540]  Now is there such a thing as a private central banking secret society? Well, according to
[03:34:05.540 --> 03:34:11.380]  Dr. Carol Quigley in his famous book, The Anglo-American Establishment, he begins one
[03:34:11.380 --> 03:34:18.780]  of the most important chapters, Chapter 3, by noting that yes, in fact, the secret society
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:25.860]  of Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Raw Child Milner Roundtable Group, that is, of course, as we've
[03:34:25.860 --> 03:34:32.380]  lectured for the last several months, where we get the UN, where we get the IMF, where
[03:34:32.380 --> 03:34:37.300]  we get the World Bank, where we get all these institutions that we know about in the modern
[03:34:37.300 --> 03:34:44.860]  world as basically kind of running the world, so to speak, they come from this society,
[03:34:44.860 --> 03:34:50.700]  from this group. And who is this group? Well, it's made up of an inner party known as the
[03:34:50.700 --> 03:34:59.420]  elect and a society of helpers, which is a couple thousand people recruited out of the
[03:34:59.420 --> 03:35:07.140]  key universities. Now, at this time, back in the 1890s, when Lord Milner and, in this
[03:35:07.140 --> 03:35:11.900]  case, specifically Cecil Rhodes, when they set up their secret society, they decided,
[03:35:11.900 --> 03:35:19.300]  let's model it on the structure of the Jesuits. And it's not Jesuit, but it's modeled on
[03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:24.860]  that structure. This is the British Empire's structure, not the Jesuit structure. Now,
[03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:29.820]  the Jesuits eventually become part of this, I would argue, by the 20th century, when we
[03:35:29.820 --> 03:35:37.780]  get into Dr. Wim Hof's text, excuse me, Mr. Wim Hof's text, where he discusses the co-opting
[03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:42.740]  of the Jesuits by the CIA. But I don't think at this time this is a Jesuit creation. A
[03:35:42.740 --> 03:35:47.580]  lot of people get confused over this because they mistake the structure of the society
[03:35:47.580 --> 03:35:54.100]  modeled on the Jesuits as if the Jesuits run this. It's not Jesuits, it's the Rhodes-Rochelle
[03:35:54.100 --> 03:36:00.140]  Milner secret society network set up in this structure, as you can see as Quigley himself
[03:36:00.140 --> 03:36:07.700]  outlines it, with an inner party of the elect, an outer structure of helpers, which is a few
[03:36:07.700 --> 03:36:13.100]  thousand academics who believe in the cause. But remember that only this inner party of
[03:36:13.100 --> 03:36:19.740]  the elect, the chosen, actually knows what's going on and how this is really working. And
[03:36:19.740 --> 03:36:25.020]  that is at this time, some of the most powerful people in the world. And in fact, one of them
[03:36:25.020 --> 03:36:30.540]  is one of the Cardinal Manning. So actually, they did have a Roman Catholic Cardinal, but
[03:36:30.540 --> 03:36:35.220]  it wasn't all Jesuits that had set this up. So they did have an inroad to the Vatican
[03:36:35.220 --> 03:36:41.620]  even at this point. And outside in this outer ring is the academics who are the helpers,
[03:36:41.620 --> 03:36:47.620]  and this is people recruited from Oxford, Cambridge, Eaton, et cetera. So that's the
[03:36:47.620 --> 03:36:54.220]  structure of the Rhodes-Rochelle Milner secret society of the elect that really utilized
[03:36:54.220 --> 03:36:58.860]  the British Empire as its engine and as its front. So imagine that the British Empire
[03:36:58.860 --> 03:37:01.860]  is this thing which people think, oh, that's serving the British people. That's serving
[03:37:01.860 --> 03:37:06.260]  the British people. No, it's serving this inner core. Doesn't mean the British people
[03:37:06.260 --> 03:37:10.780]  are bad, but it's run by the secret society oligarchical clique, which just happens to
[03:37:10.780 --> 03:37:16.300]  look exactly like what Plato describes in the laws. Right? This is the Council of Night
[03:37:16.300 --> 03:37:23.380]  exactly as Plato described it in the laws. And it's not just Dr. Carol Quigley, who is
[03:37:23.380 --> 03:37:27.140]  not a conspiracy writer, but is in fact an apologist for the system. He believes that
[03:37:27.140 --> 03:37:33.380]  it is the best system and structure for the world. This is actually described by a couple
[03:37:33.380 --> 03:37:38.420]  of the most famous books in the 20th century, actually more than two, three of them, four
[03:37:38.420 --> 03:37:44.820]  of them. Now, we've covered two of those in the past at length, three of them, because
[03:37:44.820 --> 03:37:51.340]  C.S. Lewis's book, The Abolition of Man and his third in the space trilogy is about
[03:37:51.340 --> 03:37:57.620]  technocracy and this clique. In fact, the third of the space trilogy is specifically about
[03:37:57.620 --> 03:38:04.140]  Tavistock and these people. Another famous book that you've probably heard of 1984 is
[03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:11.260]  about these people. Ingsock is English Fabian socialism. Lord Milner and those people are
[03:38:11.260 --> 03:38:19.940]  behind Fabian socialism. And Fabian socialism is synthesized with monopoly capitalism. It's
[03:38:19.940 --> 03:38:26.220]  reformed Marxism that synthesizes with capitalism to bring about the dialectical synthesis,
[03:38:26.220 --> 03:38:31.420]  thesis and synthesis. That's everything in Hegelianism and Marx was part of a group of
[03:38:31.420 --> 03:38:38.940]  young Hegelians, which adopted Hegelianism. So it's not exactly true that the world power,
[03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:46.020]  the technocrats are all Marxists. They are Marxist capitalists. That is the synthesis
[03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:52.020]  that the Fabians always envisioned and which was always the plan of the real Marxists.
[03:38:52.020 --> 03:39:00.300]  Now, for example, in 1984, when George Orwell is describing the structure of this group,
[03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:07.100]  it is pictured as one of its key members or operatives, the character of O'Brien. O'Brien
[03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:11.060]  is characterized as one of the most evil men, I think you could say in all literature. I
[03:39:11.060 --> 03:39:17.180]  did a video on who is the most evil villain in all literature and I picked not Saruman
[03:39:17.180 --> 03:39:25.020]  or, you know, Sauron, but I picked, in fact, O'Brien. Because O'Brien wants Winston to
[03:39:25.020 --> 03:39:32.660]  understand that all reality is determined by the party. The party is essentially this
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:41.620]  inner elect, again, modeled on the roads, Rothschild, Milner, Fabian, socialist society, and that
[03:39:41.620 --> 03:39:47.380]  you can't beat this group because this group is obsessed with controlling both sides of
[03:39:47.380 --> 03:39:51.700]  every conflict. That's the model here. It doesn't mean that they do, but that's what
[03:39:51.700 --> 03:39:56.820]  they want to do. And to back this up, if you haven't followed my work, if you've got
[03:39:56.820 --> 03:40:03.100]  my YouTube channel, we've been lecturing through various interrogations that occurred
[03:40:03.100 --> 03:40:08.220]  during the Stalinist purges. One of those interrogations was the NKVD interrogation
[03:40:08.220 --> 03:40:16.260]  of the famous socialist Christian Rokovsky, the Bulgarian socialist. And when he was an
[03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:21.780]  avid committed Trotskyite who was arrested by the Stalinist NKVD and during this interrogation
[03:40:21.780 --> 03:40:28.540]  he goes into all this depth about the real secrets of Marxism being run by finance capital.
[03:40:28.540 --> 03:40:33.420]  And he says, this is essentially a secret society. In fact, we use secret societies.
[03:40:33.420 --> 03:40:39.740]  Exactly what Quigley says, exactly what Professor Anthony Sutton says. Another example this
[03:40:39.740 --> 03:40:46.380]  would be Professor Anthony Sutton's Skull and Bones book. He's the classic authority
[03:40:46.380 --> 03:40:50.980]  and writer on the history of Skull and Bones, Yale University. Now that Skull and Bones
[03:40:50.980 --> 03:40:56.940]  network, which is the secret society at Yale, that's the basis for the OSS and the CIA.
[03:40:56.940 --> 03:41:04.420]  The OSS and CIA come out of the Skull and Bones Society. And that's pictured even in
[03:41:04.420 --> 03:41:10.020]  famous movies like The Good Shepherd. When you see Matt Damon being inducted into the
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:17.020]  OSS and he's rolling around in mud and getting peed on and confessing his sexual proclivities
[03:41:17.020 --> 03:41:23.500]  to an image of eulogy or whatever, that is part of the initiation and the degradation
[03:41:23.500 --> 03:41:29.500]  that is discussed in a lot of these texts, including C.S. Lewis's third book in the space
[03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:34.340]  trilogy. He says that, yeah, you have to be degraded when you're brought into these secret
[03:41:34.340 --> 03:41:39.660]  society networks because that ensures that you are part of the system, that you are black
[03:41:39.660 --> 03:41:43.300]  and maleable, that you are on board. And you're not going to go against this because as soon
[03:41:43.300 --> 03:41:49.820]  as you do, all this dirt, all this information about you comes out. Now Rikovsky says in
[03:41:49.820 --> 03:41:55.340]  the interrogation, as he's being interrogated by the NKVD, he says that true Marxism is
[03:41:55.340 --> 03:42:02.900]  intentionally contradictory because true Marxism wants to see finance capitalism, monopoly
[03:42:02.900 --> 03:42:10.540]  capitalism give us the victory because it is truly who has funded us. So he says that
[03:42:10.540 --> 03:42:14.420]  the secret societies that we have used and we've infiltrated, like Masonry for example,
[03:42:14.420 --> 03:42:18.940]  he says that, he says, do you think that the workers, the proletariat, he says, do you
[03:42:18.940 --> 03:42:22.940]  think they were running the economic system? Were they causing and creating wars? Were
[03:42:22.940 --> 03:42:29.060]  they actually running the workers themselves? No, finance capital was running economics,
[03:42:29.060 --> 03:42:34.180]  creating wars and funding workers' revolutions. Workers don't revolution, they don't fund
[03:42:34.180 --> 03:42:38.660]  their own revolutions. And he proves this by making that point. And he says that some
[03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:42.940]  of the most famous spies in the fact in the 20th century, like Sidney Riley, the most
[03:42:42.940 --> 03:42:49.580]  famous British spy, Sidney Riley, Ace of Spies, was in fact an agent of this secret society.
[03:42:49.580 --> 03:42:52.460]  Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. I'm
[03:42:52.460 --> 03:42:53.460]  Jay's analysis.
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:43:08.900]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones. I want you all to know something. Alex Jones
[03:43:08.900 --> 03:43:14.460]  was right. Alex is right about far more things wrong. Alex has been right on court over a
[03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:20.460]  decade. I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones
[03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:25.660]  was right. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine
[03:43:25.660 --> 03:43:29.980]  being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades. Alex Jones called
[03:43:29.980 --> 03:43:37.100]  this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second. You
[03:43:37.100 --> 03:43:43.140]  are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment. The government,
[03:43:43.140 --> 03:43:48.700]  beers, Alex Jones. That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate
[03:43:48.700 --> 03:43:55.700]  worldwide tyranny.
[03:43:55.700 --> 03:44:01.660]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[03:44:01.660 --> 03:44:06.020]  This is their big move. So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in
[03:44:06.020 --> 03:44:11.060]  the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:15.620]  United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:44:15.620 --> 03:44:23.900]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand
[03:44:23.900 --> 03:44:33.420]  one word. No. No. No. Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no
[03:44:33.420 --> 03:44:39.020]  to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to
[03:44:39.020 --> 03:44:44.300]  you censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:49.020]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats
[03:44:49.020 --> 03:44:57.300]  like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[03:44:57.300 --> 03:45:01.260]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world. The globalists
[03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:05.900]  are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut
[03:45:05.900 --> 03:45:10.860]  down infowars and other true tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless

[03:46:50.620 --> 03:46:58.100]  have them for sale. But now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[03:46:58.100 --> 03:47:08.940]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:08.940 --> 03:47:15.820]  Welcome back to the House of Jones. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We're
[03:47:15.820 --> 03:47:21.500]  covering the history of secret societies, demystifying secret societies in terms of
[03:47:21.500 --> 03:47:26.820]  what, in a pragmatic sense, the purposes that they really serve. Typically. Most of the
[03:47:26.820 --> 03:47:30.260]  time, not always, but most of the time. No, there's another famous book, one of the most
[03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:35.420]  famous books of the 20th century, which many of us had to read and we probably didn't understand.
[03:47:35.420 --> 03:47:38.700]  And I'm going through it now in my third time and that's called Brave New World. And in Brave
[03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:44.420]  New World, there's actually a form of a secret society governance here as well. In fact,
[03:47:44.420 --> 03:47:50.300]  Mustafa Maughan, the main protagonist villain character who's one of the 10 world social
[03:47:50.300 --> 03:47:56.740]  controllers. While there you go, 10 world social controllers, that kind of matches up to the
[03:47:56.740 --> 03:48:03.140]  Council of Night, doesn't it? 10 wise men that run various sections of the globe.
[03:48:03.140 --> 03:48:10.340]  In this novel, which of course, Aldous Huxley said was a real plan. It is the final revolution.
[03:48:10.340 --> 03:48:17.500]  It represents the culmination of all the previous revolutions all the way back to Vyshops, to
[03:48:17.500 --> 03:48:26.340]  the Jacobins, to all those figures up to today's revolutionary characters. According to Huxley,
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:30.780]  he says that, and this is projected, of course, to be in the future. He says that in the future,
[03:48:30.780 --> 03:48:35.580]  there will be this synthesized Brave New World model. And if you notice, all the characters
[03:48:35.580 --> 03:48:41.260]  in the novel are named after both industrialists and Marxists. And that's because the novel is
[03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:46.780]  about the great synthesis that I'm talking about, the Fabian socialist synthesis. And of course,
[03:48:46.780 --> 03:48:50.460]  again, Huxley was in the circles of the Royal Society. He's in the circles of all these people
[03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:56.020]  like Bertrand Russell, like H.G. Wells, who are part of this clique, part of this group who wants
[03:48:56.020 --> 03:49:02.300]  to push this technocratic Brave New World scenario, this 1984 scenario. That's why the characters
[03:49:02.300 --> 03:49:09.380]  in the book are named Lenin, or there's Lenina, but that's the feminine of Lenin, Marx, Bernard
[03:49:09.380 --> 03:49:17.660]  Marx, Ford, Rothschild, Watson, Engels, Malthus, Bakunin, Hoover, are all explicitly and continually
[03:49:17.660 --> 03:49:22.820]  mentioned throughout Brave New World. That's on purpose. You don't know fiction writers choose
[03:49:22.820 --> 03:49:27.780]  the names of their characters almost always with some kind of significance, some kind of symbolic
[03:49:27.780 --> 03:49:32.940]  significance. And that's no different in Brave New World, where Huxley is telling us that the
[03:49:32.940 --> 03:49:43.580]  future is a synthesis of monopoly capital and Marxism, socialism, Fabian socialism. And it's
[03:49:43.580 --> 03:49:50.020]  run by a secret society. And other writers have pointed out in the last few years, in fact, that
[03:49:50.020 --> 03:49:54.940]  even one of the writers who formerly collaborated, who's been on Alex himself, who collaborated
[03:49:54.940 --> 03:49:59.900]  with Professor Anthony Sutton, Patrick Wood, right? Patrick Wood has the excellent books on
[03:49:59.900 --> 03:50:07.460]  technocracy, The Hard Road to World Order, and he also wrote Technocracy Rising and Trilaterals
[03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:12.620]  over Washington with Sutton, right? And that's all the same model. That's all what Sutton's
[03:50:12.620 --> 03:50:16.420]  writing about is this group, the same things that Quigley's talking about. Sutton is more
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:21.780]  critical as a professor and a historian and economist, Quigley is a defender. So if we
[03:50:21.780 --> 03:50:25.860]  see that both the critic and the defender are saying the same things, and we know there's
[03:50:25.860 --> 03:50:31.020]  something to this. Likewise, when we look at other entities like the Federal Reserve,
[03:50:31.020 --> 03:50:35.740]  right, books like The Creature from Jekyll Island, The Classic from G. Edward Griffin,
[03:50:35.740 --> 03:50:40.940]  right, that's outlining the same things that we're talking about in terms of all these
[03:50:40.940 --> 03:50:47.140]  people, the Milner, Rothschilds, Rhodes, this group that ran the British Empire that brought
[03:50:47.140 --> 03:50:52.980]  America back under its sway, this deep state, allied with Harvard, Yale, the Eastern Seaboard
[03:50:52.980 --> 03:50:58.220]  establishment, it's not the British Empire that's running everything, it's those elites
[03:50:58.220 --> 03:51:05.740]  aligned with the elites of the UK who use these secret societies, use these networks
[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:11.740]  to create things like Operation Gladio. Gladio was the secret society network of stay-behind
[03:51:11.740 --> 03:51:18.580]  units that, I have my Gladio book in here, I have one of these books that utilized, yeah,
[03:51:18.580 --> 03:51:23.180]  for example, what we've been lecturing through lately, various Gladio texts, Paul Williams'
[03:51:23.180 --> 03:51:28.540]  book, Operation Gladio, Daniel Ganser's PhD thesis, NATO's secret armies, right. These
[03:51:28.540 --> 03:51:34.380]  are classics on the origins and history of Gladio, which was a secret society network
[03:51:34.380 --> 03:51:40.620]  that utilized various Masonic lodges that had become fascist, right, P2 Masonic lodges
[03:51:40.620 --> 03:51:46.660]  into fascism, which had recruited a bunch of the Cardinals and members of the Vatican,
[03:51:46.660 --> 03:51:52.340]  famously, to sign on to this Gladio network for the purpose of a secret society secret
[03:51:52.340 --> 03:51:58.900]  army that would stave off a potential Soviet invasion. Now, the Soviet invasion didn't
[03:51:58.900 --> 03:52:03.660]  happen, but the justification for why it was needed was, of course, well, if the Soviet
[03:52:03.660 --> 03:52:08.620]  Union invades Europe, we want to have these secret armies ready there. But what these
[03:52:08.620 --> 03:52:13.860]  secret armies actually did was engage in a bunch of money laundering, a bunch of Vatican
[03:52:13.860 --> 03:52:19.980]  bank scandals, a bunch of collapsing banks in other countries, which, by the way, mimic
[03:52:19.980 --> 03:52:25.100]  and model the FTX model exactly. If you read the Paul Williams book, you'll be like, hey,
[03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:31.220]  this Gladio black money Vatican bank scandal here, Banco d'Ambrosio, and the various banks
[03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:36.780]  in the Caimans and Bahamas and all that. It's exactly the same as what Sam Bankman Freed
[03:52:36.780 --> 03:52:44.340]  was doing, because actually criminals study previous crimes and previous scams to do the
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:48.020]  same thing over and over. It worked in the past, just run it again. The only difference
[03:52:48.020 --> 03:52:54.380]  is that that scam was with crypto, and these scams were older 60s, 70s, and 80s scams
[03:52:54.380 --> 03:53:01.380]  that utilized the BCCI. In fact, I listed a whole bunch of shell banks in Paul Williams's
[03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:08.020]  book here. He says the shell front banks connected to both the CIA and the Vatican Bank were things
[03:53:08.020 --> 03:53:12.420]  like the Castle Bank and Trust, World Commerce Foundation, Mercantile Bank and Trust, Nugent
[03:53:12.420 --> 03:53:18.460]  Hand Bank, International Diversified Corporation, Underwriters Bank, BCCI, which of course is
[03:53:18.460 --> 03:53:22.660]  the Iran Contra Bank, Franklin National Bank. If you read about the collapse of the Franklin
[03:53:22.660 --> 03:53:27.020]  National Bank, you'll notice it very closely resembles the collapses of the banks in the
[03:53:27.020 --> 03:53:35.540]  last week, as well as FTX. The Hambrows Bank, which was an OSS bank, Banca Privatta, which
[03:53:35.540 --> 03:53:41.700]  was a Vatican connected bank. I'm in core, on and on and on. There's just tons and tons
[03:53:41.700 --> 03:53:46.340]  and tons of these shell corporations and shell banks that were created, all connected to
[03:53:46.340 --> 03:53:52.780]  the Vatican Bank scandal. And again, the Vatican Bank scandal is just an image or a piecemeal,
[03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:57.700]  a picture of the kind of things that we're talking about and seeing today. So the Federal
[03:53:57.700 --> 03:54:07.460]  Reserve model is itself the mega model of these models, you see. So FTX, very similar
[03:54:07.460 --> 03:54:12.380]  to these older Vatican Bank scandals. These older Vatican Bank scandals, basically the
[03:54:12.380 --> 03:54:17.540]  same thing as the Federal Reserve Bank. It's like mega, mega, mega scale, right? And if
[03:54:17.540 --> 03:54:24.980]  you read quickly, he says that. He says that the Federal Reserve model that the elites
[03:54:24.980 --> 03:54:31.300]  here set up is based on the Bank of France and the Bank of England model. That's the
[03:54:31.300 --> 03:54:36.420]  origins in terms of the modern world of the Federal Reserve fiat fractional reserve banking
[03:54:36.420 --> 03:54:41.660]  model. And if you didn't see Max Kaiser's interview that he did recently with Tucker
[03:54:41.660 --> 03:54:45.580]  Carlson, go watch that interview because he goes into all this as well. And he talks
[03:54:45.580 --> 03:54:49.980]  about the virtues of Bitcoin and what's going on in El Salvador, which is pretty amazing.
[03:54:49.980 --> 03:54:57.260]  You look at the salvation of the currency there via adopting the hardest asset, the
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:55:01.780]  hardest money out there, the real ethical money, something like Bitcoin. That's the
[03:55:01.780 --> 03:55:08.460]  antidote to these guys. And again, you might say, well, G.I. R. Griffin, he's more of
[03:55:08.460 --> 03:55:15.660]  a conspiratorial person. No, no, no. G.I. R. Griffin is describing what the defenders
[03:55:15.660 --> 03:55:20.020]  of the system argue. You understand? Again, quickly in Tragedy and Hope in the first
[03:55:20.020 --> 03:55:25.340]  200 pages, he says, how do we get to the modern world through the fiat banking system? That's
[03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:33.380]  how the modern world dominates. The domination of the modern world is the fiat banking system.
[03:55:33.380 --> 03:55:41.060]  And that comes out of the post-enlightenment period. That's how we got to where we are.
[03:55:41.060 --> 03:55:44.480]  That's the control structure. That's how the world is actually controlled. And according
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:51.900]  to Quigley, that model is a kind of inner secret society. So it's not masons that running
[03:55:51.900 --> 03:55:54.740]  everything in the world, but people above that is what I'm trying to say. That's what
[03:55:54.740 --> 03:55:59.980]  Rikovsky says in his interrogation. That's people a lot more powerful, a lot more wealthy
[03:55:59.980 --> 03:56:06.060]  than any specific group of masonic lodges. But those groups are used at times. That's
[03:56:06.060 --> 03:56:15.700]  what I'm getting at here. So that model is we're beginning to see this scam fiat Ponzi
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:20.940]  giant Ponzi scheme model break down because it's all based on lies and based on fraud
[03:56:20.940 --> 03:56:24.900]  and based on deception. You can't keep building an edifice that's not grounded or built on
[03:56:24.900 --> 03:56:32.260]  anything solid. It'll eventually collapse. And that was, of course, why the removal
[03:56:32.260 --> 03:56:37.180]  of the gold standard and all that was so important for getting the U.S. First, it was a Federal
[03:56:37.180 --> 03:56:41.660]  Reserve Act back in 1913. Then it becomes eventually moving off to the gold standard,
[03:56:41.660 --> 03:56:46.900]  the shock doctrine. And then it becomes just insane levels of money printing. And we've
[03:56:46.900 --> 03:56:50.780]  seen nothing but more and more consolidation, more and more transfer of wealth, especially
[03:56:50.780 --> 03:56:55.500]  in the last three years due to the coup, which is, again, part of this overall plan of bringing
[03:56:55.500 --> 03:57:00.900]  in the technocracy. So if you want more on this, I would say definitely watch that Tucker
[03:57:00.900 --> 03:57:03.980]  Carlson interview with Max Kaiser. I would say also, you know, I've written a lot of
[03:57:03.980 --> 03:57:09.420]  books on this, too. I've written two books that cover the deception and the scammery
[03:57:09.420 --> 03:57:16.980]  and secret societies in Hollywood and what movie degradation and toxic culture did through
[03:57:16.980 --> 03:57:21.740]  Hollywood in my Hollywood books. But you can also get my 600 page book, all my essays
[03:57:21.740 --> 03:57:26.660]  on theology and philosophy in this in the red book available at my website, jasonalsons.com.
[03:57:26.660 --> 03:57:32.180]  You can get it in the shop. You can also get my other book on philosophy meta narratives,
[03:57:32.180 --> 03:57:35.500]  which is just an introduction to philosophical texts. There's the shop there if you see on
[03:57:35.500 --> 03:57:39.660]  the front page of my website. Also go check out the recent interview I did with Dr. Steve
[03:57:39.660 --> 03:57:45.300]  Turley. Great interview on Trump, Putin, geopolitics, spirituality. We get into it all. This is
[03:57:45.300 --> 03:57:50.860]  the Alex Jones show. I'm a huge believer in information I watch for wars every day and
[03:57:50.860 --> 03:57:54.660]  follow Alex Jones closely. You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve and he's been
[03:57:54.660 --> 03:57:59.500]  demonized as a conspiracy theorist. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been
[03:57:59.500 --> 03:58:03.780]  awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake
[03:58:03.780 --> 03:58:11.780]  for like decades. Alex has been right on for over a decade. This is reality. It's just
[03:58:11.780 --> 03:58:16.780]  a pancake. Truth is stranger than fiction. The revolution of peaceful information is
[03:58:16.780 --> 03:58:20.780]  coming. And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment. You're
[03:58:20.780 --> 03:58:25.900]  lying to the public. It's disgusting. The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[03:58:25.900 --> 03:58:31.580]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience
[03:58:31.580 --> 03:58:36.900]  in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country. We're
[03:58:36.900 --> 03:58:45.300]  going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter. Burn in hell, New
[03:58:45.300 --> 03:58:51.500]  World Order. I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think
[03:58:51.500 --> 03:58:57.300]  anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When
[03:58:57.300 --> 03:59:02.540]  we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:59:02.540 --> 03:59:07.660]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[03:59:07.660 --> 03:59:13.220]  Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:59:13.220 --> 03:59:17.940]  just incredible. So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:59:17.940 --> 03:59:23.380]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[03:59:23.380 --> 03:59:27.180]  us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing
[03:59:27.180 --> 03:59:32.340]  it. But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com. You never buy great
[03:59:32.340 --> 03:59:36.420]  products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know
[03:59:36.420 --> 03:59:40.820]  that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com. If just
[03:59:40.820 --> 03:59:45.660]  1% more of you took action at InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please
[03:59:45.660 --> 04:00:03.420]  take action now. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
