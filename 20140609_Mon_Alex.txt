[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.800]  yesterday as soon as I heard about the two police officers and one citizen shot
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.920]  dead in Las Vegas, Nevada I knew the headlines would be this morning
[00:48.920 --> 00:56.080]  super patriots connected to the Tea Party and the Bundy Ranch crisis
[00:56.080 --> 01:09.360]  responsible and then I got up this morning at 5 15 a.m. and sure enough that
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.560]  was the headlines and then all the George Soros affiliated websites like
[01:13.560 --> 01:19.240]  Wonkett and others just magically got supposed photos of the killers the
[01:19.240 --> 01:26.520]  alleged killers dressed up as the Joker and other Batman villains and the skinny
[01:26.520 --> 01:32.400]  man that is attributed to teenagers stabbing and murdering dozens across
[01:32.400 --> 01:40.440]  the United States of course it doesn't matter if these people are mentally ill
[01:40.440 --> 01:50.280]  and doing this because they blur the macabre fantasy of the sick culture in
[01:50.280 --> 01:56.040]  the reality I will be blamed and you can bet your bottom dollar by this
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.240]  afternoon it hasn't happened yet not that I know of but you can bet your
[02:00.240 --> 02:04.480]  bottom dollar by this afternoon yours truly will be blamed for the two dead
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.800]  cops and I've been through this before now whether this is staged and boy
[02:09.800 --> 02:14.520]  there's a lot of evidence it is or whether this is just organic mind
[02:14.520 --> 02:20.120]  control of the sick culture people that feel so empty and poor and pathetic that
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.840]  they want power so they imagine their comic book villains and go out and kill
[02:23.840 --> 02:31.320]  police whether this is ritualistic warfare and the veneer of civilization
[02:31.320 --> 02:39.320]  wearing away or whether this is staged it is all part of the sick culture and
[02:39.320 --> 02:46.600]  I don't have a big crew I have a great crew but I know for a fact probably a
[02:46.600 --> 02:50.880]  hundred times the last six months I have said that you're going to start seeing
[02:50.880 --> 02:56.680]  police officers getting shot in public and it's going to be blamed on the Tea
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.680]  Party and quote superpatriots because it's in the dramas it's in the sitcoms
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.440]  it's in the movies it's in the comic books and whether it's staged black op
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.280]  false flags which we know have happened in the past or whether it's
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.840]  weak-minded schizophrenics or people with all sorts of personality disorders
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.560]  going out and doing it it's the sick culture I mean if you showed hundreds
[03:22.560 --> 03:29.880]  of TV shows with women poking their babies eyes out with ice picks you
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.040]  would have mentally ill women by the dozens every year start poking babies
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.360]  eyes out with ice picks that's what advertising is and I've talked a lot
[03:39.360 --> 03:42.480]  about this that for years before they walled it off where you couldn't do it
[03:42.480 --> 03:45.640]  at the Empire States building other landmarks every time a man or woman
[03:45.640 --> 03:51.520]  jumped off you would have five six seven eight nine ten or more people show up
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.040]  within hours of it being on the news to try to jump off like lemmings as well
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.680]  in fact if a woman did it you'd have women show up and do it this is in
[03:58.680 --> 04:02.240]  criminology if a man did it you'd have men show up to do it it's called copy
[04:02.240 --> 04:09.240]  catch and this is now four shootings that have Batman connections but the
[04:09.240 --> 04:16.840]  CNN headline is Las Vegas shooters were racist anti-government and then you
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.240]  read the article and it says they were obsessed with Batman and the skinny man
[04:21.240 --> 04:27.120]  and dressed up like murdering ghouls and I'm not saying blame the people that
[04:27.120 --> 04:32.000]  write those comic books but I mean sure as you know what don't blame me and I
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.960]  could tell you what happened with her talk show host that came out and said
[04:34.960 --> 04:40.200]  Alex Jones is calling for violence just in the last month he's gonna cause
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.240]  killings and all the rest of it don't be with him when I'm calling for not
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.920]  killing people and not killing police I said that person's been given the intel
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.720]  this is about to unfold he doesn't want to be blamed with a false flag and I
[04:52.720 --> 05:00.080]  told you it's coming I told you I know the next move I'll tell you next in the

[08:58.000 --> 09:04.680]  dismantled in front of our eyes on record NATO is in command of the entire US
[09:04.680 --> 09:08.640]  military publicly Homeland Security now says their mission has nothing to do
[09:08.640 --> 09:12.800]  with al-Qaeda our Muslim extremists and has to do with the Tea Party who will
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.880]  launch police killing terror attacks any minute with no evidence of that now
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.160]  it's beginning two plus two equals four even though they teach in common court
[09:24.160 --> 09:30.440]  equals whatever they say the borders are completely wide open tens of millions
[09:30.440 --> 09:35.040]  of people are flooding here as we speak hundreds of thousands a month pouring
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.920]  over the borders being given driver's license in California to pull the lever
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.520]  to ban guns we are in the middle of a globalist revolution against this
[09:43.520 --> 09:54.920]  country right now and my gut tells me that the cold blooded degenerate evil
[09:54.920 --> 10:04.960]  killing of two police officers and a citizen in Las Vegas yesterday is
[10:04.960 --> 10:13.480]  absolutely staged ladies and gentlemen and I will document here on air how
[10:13.480 --> 10:20.160]  it is staged right now because one way or another the sick twisted culture of
[10:20.160 --> 10:27.040]  death and of destruction porn that Hollywood sells to the narcissistic
[10:27.040 --> 10:33.880]  masses was responsible for manipulating the mental illness of these
[10:33.880 --> 10:47.280]  individuals and others or and this is the much more likely analysis this was
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.480]  staged there is so much proof of this being stage yesterday when I first read
[10:52.480 --> 10:59.080]  about it and this morning that my mind exploded with hundreds of data points
[10:59.080 --> 11:06.720]  and quite frankly it's conclusive show conclusive that the team who does an
[11:06.720 --> 11:13.720]  amazing job is digging through the literally hundreds of predictions I
[11:13.720 --> 11:19.960]  made since the Bundy ranch situation on air sometimes more than 30 times per
[11:19.960 --> 11:27.160]  show I said they're going to go into restaurants and they're going to start
[11:27.160 --> 11:30.760]  killing police they're going to go into Walmart's they're going to start
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.280]  shooting people they're going to go into movie theaters they're going to start
[11:34.280 --> 11:40.880]  shooting people and it's going to be blamed on the tea party and the quote
[11:40.880 --> 11:49.120]  super patriots word for word within hours of this happening yesterday it was
[11:49.120 --> 11:57.640]  in the news with no proof that they were right-wing tea party patriots then
[11:57.640 --> 12:02.920]  today they're now directly saying we need homeland security to go after anyone
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.400]  that criticizes the government while the government has been captured by foreign
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.680]  banks criminally stealing tens of trillions per quarter in banker bell
[12:13.680 --> 12:19.520]  out money to private mega banks bankrupting us with Obamacare by design
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.840]  you name it five dead two police officers the two supposed shooters is
[12:25.840 --> 12:31.920]  at that convenient husband and wife and one wall Martian as the media likes to
[12:31.920 --> 12:39.600]  call them some poor person who knows a witness we don't know and we have a
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.360]  supposed photo with the George Soros affiliated satire site so they can put
[12:44.360 --> 12:51.920]  out this info wonk it and we'll scroll down and show TV viewers that full image
[12:51.920 --> 12:58.800]  that's up on info wars.com forward slash show Jared and Amanda Miller the
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.640]  super patriots who gunned down a couple of cops and a lady who were going to
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.400]  Walmart in Vegas yesterday so they've already they already know what happened
[13:10.400 --> 13:17.360]  and CNN already knows what happens super patriots kill Las Vegas shooters
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.360]  were racist anti-government you read the article doesn't say anything about that
[13:22.360 --> 13:31.360]  it says they were obsessed and dressed up like the characters from Batman Joker
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.640]  and Harley Quinn and the fictional horror character that recently suffered
[13:36.640 --> 13:43.600]  in the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin skinny man
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.920]  you know the people that shot governors the people that shot John Lennon the
[13:49.920 --> 13:55.600]  people that sir hand sir hand that shot RFK they all had copies of catcher in
[13:55.600 --> 13:59.760]  the rye they were obsessed with it I've talked to the detectives the police
[13:59.760 --> 14:06.960]  officers and family members of some of the people I just named and I'm not
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.200]  allowed to say anymore at that point but the FBI came in and told them to shut
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.240]  up and basically told them you know if you don't want to be dad don't
[14:17.240 --> 14:24.640]  investigate this even the LAPD's report said that sir hand sir hand who was
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.560]  clearly drugged and not shoot Robert F. Kennedy the point is people say why do
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.640]  they have a book because that's the template with the electroshock six
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.440]  months of audio recordings the drugs all of it and they're using and I've been
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.960]  saying this before it ever happened with Aurora and now four other incidents
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.760]  that they're using the Joker as a programming template in mind control and
[14:48.760 --> 14:56.120]  we know that Holmes of Aurora was under mind control told police that witnesses
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.560]  all other shooters he was drugged up in the parking lot like sir hand sir hand
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.040]  wasn't even part of the shooting was under high-level Air Force psychiatric
[15:04.040 --> 15:13.080]  care in a above top secret DARPA mind control program Denver post ladies and
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.080]  gentlemen that he was in a super advanced DARPA secret program being given
[15:18.080 --> 15:27.720]  $97,000 a year by DARPA his dad taught mathematician in super equations
[15:27.720 --> 15:34.280]  Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber L.A. Times was CIA central intelligence
[15:34.280 --> 15:46.760]  agency for 18 years in M. K. Ultra M. K. Ultra M. K. Naomi now let's be clear the
[15:46.760 --> 15:54.680]  programming is now so powerful they don't even need to get you in a laboratory
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.160]  now with the chemicals in the food the water the culture the flicker rate
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.280]  hypnotizing people you've seen the TV shows that have been documented by
[16:01.280 --> 16:04.920]  Scotland Yard we've shown clips of I forget the name of it
[16:04.920 --> 16:08.440]  Jacobson runner and tell me the name of the minute he's a big viewer of it where
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.080]  they're able to brainwash people off the street to be able to go and believe
[16:12.080 --> 16:15.760]  they're committing an assassination in one hour now they do it because they
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.840]  talk to a hundred people do test and find who is more suggestible out of a
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.520]  hundred people that's what the government does they get university
[16:25.520 --> 16:30.360]  students in the DARPA and Air Force programs they've got handlers top
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.440]  Air Force psychiatrist you name it in the case of in the case of Aurora this
[16:35.440 --> 16:42.160]  is on record and then they just roll them out ladies and gentlemen usually just
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.600]  to be drugged up and take the fall and not know if they did it or not folks
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.560]  they could take the strongest person the North Koreans rebel do this the North
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.760]  Vietnamese rebel did with US soldiers they could take a Marine Corps colonel
[16:53.760 --> 17:00.240]  and in a month have them saying whatever they wanted folks and believing it they
[17:00.240 --> 17:04.320]  take some college kid with a high IQ and ass burgers one of their favorite
[17:04.320 --> 17:08.400]  programmable types because they're so machine-like and they can have them
[17:08.400 --> 17:19.080]  doing whatever they want in a matter of days now Harry Reid comes out and says
[17:19.080 --> 17:21.600]  we're gonna do something about this these are domestic terrorists at the
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.320]  Bundy Ranch everybody needs to be arrested they roll out last week the
[17:26.320 --> 17:29.080]  domestic terrorism task force saying the Tea Party is the number one enemy I
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.280]  told them building this behind the scenes now they're rolling it out they're
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.720]  releasing terrorists saying you know well they have yoga glasses will release
[17:35.720 --> 17:41.240]  them that's in the New York Post they're saying speech is connected to this we
[17:41.240 --> 17:44.040]  need to shut down speech and they're rolling out all this internet censorship
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.800]  and internet IDs this month the current issue of our magazine just came out
[17:47.800 --> 17:53.560]  today death of the internet is the title they're making their move on every
[17:53.560 --> 17:58.760]  front right now to demonize their opposition because of Benghazi the
[17:58.760 --> 18:04.000]  false flagged fast and furious listen if they would ship more than 20,000 guns
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.080]  to Mexico two criminal cartels to then trace them back to crime in the US to
[18:09.080 --> 18:14.840]  blame every gun owner that's 170 million people out of 315 million if they
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.840]  would frame more than half this country for the crime in Mexico and say it's
[18:18.840 --> 18:25.280]  your fault thousands of dead in Mexico hundreds in the US including at least
[18:25.280 --> 18:30.960]  seven police officers border patrol would they stage this now and the answer
[18:30.960 --> 18:37.880]  is absolutely if they would use al-qaeda to attack Syria Libya Egypt all these
[18:37.880 --> 18:41.440]  other countries and give them weapons would they do this now would they stage
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.920]  chemical attacks and get caught three times this year even the UN admits it
[18:44.920 --> 18:51.320]  yes if they would stage al-qaeda attacks if they would do all of this would they
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.720]  do this to get our guns and blame the Tea Party that's sweeping in every run-off
[18:55.720 --> 19:01.600]  election and every primary right now defeating in almost every case 90 plus
[19:01.600 --> 19:08.360]  percent of Republican incumbents are going down 1776 is happening peacefully
[19:08.360 --> 19:13.760]  through the system they want to start a civil war with the police they want to
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.760]  march their operatives their globalists it may have even been cutouts who were
[19:18.760 --> 19:22.360]  told you're part of a drill come you know come to this pizza place this is a

[23:06.640 --> 23:10.880]  government I was looking at survival stuff I was raised as a girl scout and
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.680]  their motto was to be prepared food for patriots was an opportunity for me to

[24:14.240 --> 24:20.320]  to defeat us I say this every day and I need listeners to go through all the
[24:20.320 --> 24:25.880]  YouTube videos all the archives and flood YouTube with Alex Jones predicts
[24:25.880 --> 24:31.920]  Las Vegas police killings and that I would then be blamed after the Liberty
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.360]  Movement's blamed it hasn't happened yet but I don't have time to track it it's
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.320]  probably they're probably blaming me right now in MSNBC and I knew as soon as
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.760]  I heard yesterday and then sure enough the supposed shooters who are
[24:44.760 --> 24:50.300]  conveniently dead like to dress up like the Joker and like skinny man and the
[24:50.300 --> 24:53.560]  skinny man there've been scores of stabbings around the country as teenagers
[24:53.560 --> 24:57.920]  stab other children to death because that's what skinny man would do that's
[24:57.920 --> 25:02.040]  how you become powerful people are obsessed with comic books adults I know
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.400]  are and they really think it's real I mean I go with my friends you know and
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.840]  and and see comic book movies and I see grown men getting really excited and
[25:10.840 --> 25:17.240]  crying and I mean this is mind control ladies and gentlemen yep raw story
[25:17.240 --> 25:22.080]  again Democrat front group Las Vegas Revolution shooters ID to his right
[25:22.080 --> 25:29.320]  wing conspiracy nuts with death wish boom look like hippie nerds to me not
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.880]  willing oh Alex Jones boom boom boom when was that published I bet it was
[25:34.880 --> 25:44.880]  before I even got on air today EDT 30 minutes before I went on air I'm being
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.640]  blamed Democrat run group it gets direct talking points from the White House
[25:49.640 --> 25:56.280]  raw story part of the whole globalist ring boom I mean what did MSNBC say I
[25:56.280 --> 26:03.920]  am quote deeply racist and did not show one single piece of proof because I'm
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.800]  the opposite they hate the fact that I'm fighting the infanticide of black
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.560]  babies they hate the fact I'm fighting Gardasil injection of Mexican girls in
[26:13.560 --> 26:24.680]  Mexico they hate it they absolutely hate it I was down in San Marcos this
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.200]  weekend tubing with do and his kids and my kids and it was like Cinco de Mayo
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.680]  down there I think there was about 90% Hispanic Americans down there and about
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.080]  every fifth person I went by was a huge listener other folks Alex Jones Alex
[26:37.080 --> 26:41.080]  Jones we appreciate what you're doing again this this transmission reaches
[26:41.080 --> 26:44.760]  everybody everybody wants freedom the globalist cannot stand it ladies and
[26:44.760 --> 26:52.720]  gentlemen and I can feel the eye of Soran upon me and I'm in God's hands is
[26:52.720 --> 27:01.760]  all I could say but I tell you I have the enemies number 100% and I'm having
[27:01.760 --> 27:11.840]  little gallows humor here folks because this is this is epically insane I never
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.760]  wanted to be in this position I don't like being famous I don't like the
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.240]  incredible danger I'm under quite frankly at the very tip of the spear and the
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.520]  enemy absolutely hates me and the White House responds to us routinely and
[27:24.520 --> 27:30.840]  demonizes us and I mean I have the enemy watching and listening to the show
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.280]  every day because they know I know who they are and I know their game and I
[27:35.280 --> 27:46.800]  know their plan and my continued living quite frankly is that other people learn
[27:46.800 --> 27:53.400]  the enemy combination the enemy paradigm the enemy MO because if enough
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.680]  people pick up the enemy signature the enemy program the enemy operation the
[27:58.680 --> 28:09.040]  enemy recipe it's over for them we can blow their operation wide open believe
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.280]  me folks Harry Reid comes out and says anybody who doesn't want these BLM land
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.360]  grabs is a terrorist we're gonna come after him domestic task force and then
[28:18.360 --> 28:25.480]  in his state run by him he's the dawn of Nevada this happens and they're
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.720]  connecting it to that on CNN last night in this morning and now to yours truly
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.240]  and you notice through the grapevine other high-level people got the word in
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.600]  the so-called conservative media you're gonna be blamed with this unless you
[28:39.600 --> 28:43.360]  make a break so they came out and they said Alex Jones wants dead people Alex
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.280]  Jones wants dead cops Alex Jones is behind this he wants murder when I'm
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.640]  saying the opposite and then now I come on air just a few weeks ago on three or
[28:54.640 --> 29:02.120]  four shows and said to protect myself I said I've got to respond to this host
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.040]  they've been threatened they've been told this is coming and again I know that
[29:08.040 --> 29:13.880]  because previously I know he was threatened with having a new Oklahoma
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.200]  City blamed on him if he didn't play ball and he went on Fox News on one of
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.920]  his last shows and said they're preparing new Oklahoma cities to blame me and
[29:20.920 --> 29:25.240]  the Liberty Movement that's going back and I sung his praises played the clip
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.880]  and I said he's got it he's been threatened folks the Democrat memos
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.120]  say they need state terror attacks they need state shootings we've shown those
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.320]  here on air so they think you're so dumb they're running these operations out in
[29:39.320 --> 29:43.240]  the open I mean folks when you understand this the enemy's
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.080]  unclogged they're completely naked we've got their whole off I'm gonna break it
[29:47.080 --> 29:53.360]  down we come back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:53.360 --> 29:56.920]  GCN radio network

[33:05.200 --> 33:13.040]  seas and the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces
[33:13.040 --> 33:18.960]  of the United States to take action and reply. Dr. Martin Luther King the
[33:18.960 --> 33:23.000]  apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death
[33:23.000 --> 33:41.640]  in Memphis, Tennessee people calling themselves members of the
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.480]  weather underground last night planted farms and federal office buildings in
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.000]  Washington and open California it's if the baby's out of incubators and let the
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.080]  children to die on the cold floor. Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding
[33:54.080 --> 33:58.120]  a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgement that the
[33:58.120 --> 34:02.520]  Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence Navy ship. The death of
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.240]  bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.360]  effort to defeat Al Qaeda. The Taliban is taking responsibilities for shooting
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.760]  down a US helicopter more than 30 people were killed and there are reports this
[34:14.760 --> 34:19.320]  morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs. There may be a false flag incident
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.200]  where some ship goes down and you be used for the excuse to accelerate the
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.680]  next war. If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and
[34:28.680 --> 34:32.720]  everybody in between is that we all hated the bank bailout. The Department of
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.440]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree. It comes out to
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.720]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. Today it is infinitely easier to kill a
[34:43.720 --> 34:48.120]  million people than to control a million people. They estimated that they would
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.880]  have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducations and when I say
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.440]  eliminate I need to kill. I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up.
[34:56.440 --> 35:07.000]  This isn't a game. From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[35:08.200 --> 35:15.560]  This is not a game. This is not entertainment ladies and gentlemen.
[35:15.560 --> 35:20.040]  This is unlike any other radio broadcast that I think's ever really aired in this
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.520]  country. We are covering the globalist criminal takeover of the nation in a
[35:25.520 --> 35:31.320]  real time and because of that we exposed the underwear bomber put on the plane
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.160]  by the CIA, had the eyewitnesses on the show, came out on C-SPAN and
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.480]  congressional hearings a month and a half later that that was accurate. We blew
[35:40.480 --> 35:49.240]  that operation. We continue to blow their operations to short circuit their
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.080]  operations to blame the American people for incredibly rare infrequent
[35:55.080 --> 36:03.800]  terrorism that kills less people than honeybees do every year on record. I
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.960]  hammered those statistics for a while and then Esquire in the same issue that I
[36:07.960 --> 36:12.200]  was in with a cover story last year did a story about the honeybees killing more
[36:12.200 --> 36:18.120]  people than terrorism. That's the point is that the media is listening, the
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.160]  dinosaur media is listening, the new media, the real media is listening. This
[36:23.160 --> 36:29.640]  show has incredible power and I don't say that from a perspective of narcissism
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.800]  or a power trip. I think everybody who works here, everybody that listens to
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.200]  this show, everybody that carries this broadcast, everyone who is affected by
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.600]  what's happening should realize that this broadcast even though its rag tag is
[36:44.600 --> 36:50.560]  reaching 20 million people a week now one way or another. Terrestrial, shortwave,
[36:50.560 --> 36:58.600]  AMFM, internet, YouTube. Governments are listening from Japan to Syria, from Russia
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.040]  to the United States. It's come out mainstream news because we really do
[37:04.040 --> 37:09.200]  know the enemy operation. I really have studied it for 25 years, almost 20 on
[37:09.200 --> 37:16.400]  air since 1995. You do something 14, 15 hours a day, you talk to every expert
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.000]  out there, you get a very clear picture of what's going on. I live in a think tank,
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.520]  I live in a war room and I told you we've got to dig these clips up and it's
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.680]  every show that they were going to shoot police and blame it on the Bundy
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.360]  supporters. They'd have a drill or something and they've been having them
[37:36.360 --> 37:42.280]  in Las Vegas every week in the last month. They would shoot the Patsy's, have a few
[37:42.280 --> 37:48.040]  wind-up toy PR actors come out with the official story, the cops won't even know
[37:48.040 --> 37:52.040]  what's going on, the cops were really killed, the citizen was really killed,
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.720]  the so-called shooters are gotten rid of and now you can project it on to who?
[37:57.720 --> 38:04.120]  Super Patriots, right wing, Tea Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Alex Jones and
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.680]  folks when you've got a website that has over a million visitors a day, all of our
[38:08.680 --> 38:11.760]  Facebooks, Twitter, you name it, about three million visitors a day
[38:11.760 --> 38:14.920]  conservatively, Prison Planet, all the other sites,
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.640]  prisonplanet.tv, of course almost everybody's visited infowars.com. Are
[38:20.640 --> 38:23.880]  they going to go into every computer when somebody kills a cop and say well
[38:23.880 --> 38:29.080]  they visited ABC News, they visited drudgerport.com, they visited CNN,
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.120]  well they visited Yahoo homepage, Yahoo's to blame.
[38:37.240 --> 38:43.800]  Here's a headline, daily cost issues, retraction of info wars, Poplowski smear
[38:43.800 --> 38:50.200]  2009, within two hours of three Pittsburgh cops being dead
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.280]  when dishonorably discharged Marine Poplowski
[38:57.480 --> 39:00.920]  got another pit bull that was crapping all over the floor, his mother
[39:00.920 --> 39:03.880]  kicked him out, wouldn't leave, called the police because the dog was urinating
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.080]  and defecating, that's on record.
[39:09.960 --> 39:14.760]  They show up, he throws a fit, kills three of them
[39:14.760 --> 39:22.360]  with a semi-automatic AK-47, within two hours they have it on the news
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.800]  Southern Parvy Law Center local writer saying his computer said he did it for
[39:27.800 --> 39:31.560]  Alex Jones, we did a search and found out he was a white supremacist sworn to
[39:31.560 --> 39:35.880]  destroy me, threatened to sue the newspapers and others and forced six
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.520]  different retractions including in the Pittsburgh paper.
[39:40.520 --> 39:46.360]  You understand?
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.640]  Within two hours of them having him in custody,
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.000]  they were blaming me because he had visited info wars
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.360]  and then we went and searched his handle and everything and there he was on
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.240]  the white supremacists and the other fed run groups
[40:03.240 --> 40:13.320]  a mentally unstable, drunken, unemployed, dishonorably discharged punk
[40:13.320 --> 40:20.280]  who dreamed of kicking my butt and attacking me and killing me, he said
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.680]  and then he kills three cops and I get the blame. Well guess what, I forced
[40:24.680 --> 40:27.400]  her attraction there and it's now reached the point, I want to warn
[40:27.400 --> 40:30.760]  everybody, I don't have time for lawsuits, I don't want to sue people
[40:30.760 --> 40:34.680]  but I have to start suing people when they say I'm deeply racist
[40:34.680 --> 40:39.160]  or when they say I'm behind the Boston bombing because I have to say
[40:39.160 --> 40:42.840]  I'm not guilty of this or they're going to teach the police in these briefing
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.360]  rooms like I know they're doing that I'm teaching
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.000]  the public to kill police so the system sets me up and kills me
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.840]  or throws me in prison ladies and gentlemen and if they can get me
[40:54.840 --> 41:02.840]  folks, they can get anybody.
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.240]  Well they were trying to bring down Rush Limbaugh a few years ago
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.880]  even though he's in direct competition with me in the same time slot
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.160]  I went with Ted Anderson
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.400]  and bought $100,000 worth of advertising on Rush Limbaugh and we
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.640]  lost a little bit of money but it it I think we made like $90,000 it cost
[41:23.640 --> 41:26.440]  about $100,000.
[41:29.320 --> 41:33.560]  Why do I do that? Because I put my money where my mouth is folks
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.240]  you understand that? We either stand up for talk radio and a free and open
[41:37.240 --> 41:39.320]  internet and we either stand up for free speech
[41:39.320 --> 41:42.680]  so that I've got articles here where they're saying thought crime is terrorism
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.840]  Holder's actually saying that the guy who ran the cover up of Oklahoma City
[41:46.840 --> 41:50.120]  as deputy attorney general the guy that ran the false flag fast and furious
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.160]  and got caught lying about it his own memo saying we'll blame the Second
[41:53.160 --> 41:57.000]  Amendment and gun owners for the carnage CBS News
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.520]  this false flag hardcore evil one
[42:02.680 --> 42:10.440]  has his White House run media matters and all and and all the rest of them
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.520]  raw story you name it lining up before I went on air today
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.360]  to blame who? Alex Jones
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.200]  talk about ominous I said that thunder lightning just
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.720]  heard the thunder right above the office
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.160]  how many false flag bats one the two or three
[42:33.160 --> 42:36.680]  I mean it's just getting out of control ladies and gentlemen and quite
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.680]  frankly I'm excited I'm of good cheer
[42:41.080 --> 42:44.680]  I'm a person who loves God and loves justice and loves the truth
[42:44.680 --> 42:47.960]  and I could be proud of what I've done and I can say that we've been pretty
[42:47.960 --> 42:50.920]  darn accurate trying to get things right trying to
[42:50.920 --> 42:55.160]  tell the truth we've got about a 98 accuracy rate
[42:55.160 --> 42:58.920]  and the system knows that and it freaks them out that I know them so well
[42:58.920 --> 43:02.200]  I'm like an old-fashioned police detective tracking the serial killer
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.400]  getting closer and closer and there's this weird relationship between me and
[43:07.400 --> 43:10.120]  the establishment
[43:10.600 --> 43:14.040]  that is just unbelievable I mean they're they're all watching right now the
[43:14.040 --> 43:17.000]  Pentagon's watching right now foreign governments are watching
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.360]  right now the George Soros groups are watching right now and
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.240]  admitting they're watching
[43:24.840 --> 43:30.520]  why why why because I'll tell the truth and other people won't
[43:30.520 --> 43:33.480]  that's why I'm so attacked that's why I'm so demonized that's why they have all
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.960]  the megaphone groups and disinfo and and and bots
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.640]  and shock puppets as they call them online attacking attacking attacking
[43:41.640 --> 43:44.760]  attacking Alex's CIA Alex works for the Vatican

[43:47.320 --> 43:51.480]  Alex is a Fed because they know I'm the opposite folks
[43:51.480 --> 43:55.720]  I work for justice I get a real satisfaction
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.080]  out of standing up against evil I get a
[43:59.080 --> 44:03.080]  complete fulfillment out of it not because I'm a hero but because I won't
[44:03.080 --> 44:09.320]  be a slave I won't sign on to this fraud I see through the scam
[44:09.320 --> 44:12.920]  I won't put my name on it
[44:12.920 --> 44:18.600]  I'm in a fight for my life ladies and gentlemen and so are you
[44:18.600 --> 44:21.480]  make no mistake the globalists have hated this country all along
[44:21.480 --> 44:25.720]  they want to bring it down I mean look at these headlines on drugsreport.com
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.480]  we'll put it on screen for TV viewers America struggles with surge in child

[44:45.000 --> 44:49.800]  patrol none none we were 90 miles outside the
[44:49.800 --> 44:51.640]  border and I was going to get ready to gripe at them for
[44:51.640 --> 44:54.200]  knowing we're US citizens and want to search our vehicle they just waved us
[44:54.200 --> 44:57.400]  through there was one guy you speak about 20
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.840]  agents threatened with firing
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.960]  after photos leak sheriff fed should pay for housing
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.960]  feds drop plain loads of illegals in El Paso

[46:00.200 --> 46:04.840]  because he's already legalized by fiat you're seeing total lawlessness
[46:04.840 --> 46:10.120]  our military under NATO command al Qaeda being publicly funded and freed
[46:10.120 --> 46:14.440]  prisoner releases that are illegal on record
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.280]  and homeland security in the sitcoms the dramas
[46:18.280 --> 46:24.600]  the cartoons the news the the the the the patriots are going to start shooting
[46:24.600 --> 46:28.040]  cops guys in tri-quarter hats on green lantern
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.560]  cartoon killing cops
[46:31.560 --> 46:37.400]  shooting at cops and I said it's either gonna be a stage false flag you can see
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.120]  the pre-programming I tell your old could see this if you were conscious
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.360]  or they know with their programming that there's enough suggestible people
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.360]  out of 315 mil that if you put another this out there
[46:50.360 --> 46:53.640]  it's like suicide by cop the more they advertise go pull a gun in a cop let
[46:53.640 --> 47:01.640]  them kill you the more it happens and you advertise
[47:01.640 --> 47:04.920]  mad about what's going on go kill a cop you know
[47:04.920 --> 47:08.520]  that's what they say in the media not me then they come out and say Alex Jones
[47:08.520 --> 47:11.480]  once cops get killed don't be with the Malcolm X be with the
[47:11.480 --> 47:15.960]  Martin Luther King be nonviolent when we are nonviolent
[47:15.960 --> 47:20.040]  offensively we have a right to defend ourselves no one can argue with that
[47:20.040 --> 47:24.120]  and I've told the police this hundreds of times and I'll hundreds of times
[47:24.120 --> 47:27.720]  probably 400 500 six I don't know
[47:27.880 --> 47:32.520]  I'll say it again and we'll mark it down right now
[47:32.520 --> 47:40.680]  here at 11 47 35 seconds central on this day Monday the ninth day
[47:40.680 --> 47:44.280]  of June 2014
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.160]  that you are going to start seeing police vehicles IED
[47:49.160 --> 47:52.520]  you're going to start seeing police shot up in restaurants everywhere
[47:52.520 --> 47:56.360]  you're going to start seeing all sorts of attacks on police departments you name
[47:56.360 --> 47:58.840]  it
[47:58.840 --> 48:01.320]  and how did I know you were going to start seeing this
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.360]  ladies and gentlemen when they put it out everywhere that it's about to happen
[48:04.360 --> 48:07.880]  and say when it happens blame the tea party and then it happens and it's in
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.120]  Harry Reid's controlled state in his district
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.280]  and he immediately blames it on the bundies before anything comes out and
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.840]  now it's blamed on me it's so predictable two plus two equals four
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.520]  they need the police and the military to wipe out the liberty movement and we
[48:26.520 --> 48:29.880]  wipe them out you notice the armored vehicles were no good
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.640]  against asymmetrical warfare the Las Vegas police had those big giant
[48:33.640 --> 48:37.720]  homeland security vehicles from Iraq there didn't mean anything
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.720]  the police under orders stayed outside for over an hour at the Walmart
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.480]  before going in the first beat cops ran in and started shooting so the supposed
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.520]  people killed themselves who knows what's true by the way
[48:50.520 --> 48:56.120]  you saw Dorner the cop do this can we trust cops with guns if a cop goes bad
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.520]  was Dorner mind control was Dorner a setup they weren't ready for it it
[49:00.520 --> 49:03.800]  paralyzed them they didn't blame the liberty movement maybe not
[49:03.800 --> 49:08.120]  but let me tell you this with Jared and Amanda Miller
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.880]  with the same MO of the Joker again and the skinny man tying it into cartoons
[49:13.880 --> 49:20.040]  and comic books with no proof the local southern property law center ADL
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.640]  they're always the usual suspects start feeding the democratic run CNN
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.640]  raw story all of them Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones
[49:29.640 --> 49:36.600]  because I'm the one saying do not go out and randomly shoot a police
[49:36.600 --> 49:39.800]  officer I've been saying that for about five years
[49:39.800 --> 49:42.920]  because I thought if I was the globalist what would I do I could see it in
[49:42.920 --> 49:45.560]  them's movies and their internal documents they were starting to promote to
[49:45.560 --> 49:48.920]  the public but telling cops it was coming that the tea party was going to
[49:48.920 --> 49:52.360]  come out and shoot them and kill them and that and that every small town will
[49:52.360 --> 49:54.840]  be IED every cop listening knows they've been
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.760]  trained in this in the last six years that you will be attacked by US military
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.880]  veterans total crud so when it starts that's the official
[50:03.880 --> 50:08.600]  story it tells you and again if they hype it enough
[50:08.600 --> 50:11.960]  there might be mentally ill vets or something that might do it so you prime
[50:11.960 --> 50:15.320]  the pump like like a starter plug you know we
[50:15.320 --> 50:18.920]  sit there and press on the four-wheeler to put some gas in before you start it
[50:18.920 --> 50:25.560]  the opposite of the choke the primer they prime it and do a few more copy cat
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.840]  cop killer deals there's so many people on
[50:28.840 --> 50:31.320]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are in a dream state
[50:31.320 --> 50:34.680]  they will march out like programmable zombies and start shooting cops
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.040]  and I estimate in the civil war 300 000 police will die
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.480]  I estimate if the military marches out against the gun owners
[50:43.480 --> 50:48.360]  half a million dead two million dead on the side of the patriots
[50:48.360 --> 50:51.160]  won't matter we'll have another 10 million where that came from
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.040]  but it'll be a real war once they start it we've got to stop the civil war
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.560]  stop the civil war don't kill cops this hour of GCN programming is proudly

[54:36.680 --> 54:40.520]  you know i guess they're doing a better job this time when they blame me
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.360]  for poplasky killing the three cops and
[54:42.360 --> 54:47.480]  turned out he hated me he reportedly wrote the police to kill or not to kill
[54:47.480 --> 54:54.120]  you need to be a registered member to rate this post and it says i stand at
[54:54.120 --> 54:57.560]  the point in my life where i am on probation and
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.880]  selling marijuana i take the urine so see
[55:01.880 --> 55:05.640]  again this is what i said is this someone pushed to the edge over the edge
[55:05.640 --> 55:09.080]  is this someone under or you know organic ambient background
[55:09.080 --> 55:19.480]  mind control in the culture or is this a patsy and we just don't know
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.400]  but it look we we launched planet infowars back in 2012 and it looks like
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.320]  this was set up right when it was created
[55:27.320 --> 55:31.320]  so that should be newsworthy that should give them a lot of
[55:31.320 --> 55:35.560]  a lot of grass to make hay with let's do searches on comments under his
[55:35.560 --> 55:41.560]  handle now well i guess uh i guess i didn't get
[55:41.560 --> 55:46.760]  through to him that it was important not to go out and kill random police
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.400]  and to work as hard as you can to wake people up in the community
[55:54.280 --> 55:57.880]  and i will say this when you have militarized police why do the vietnamese
[55:57.880 --> 56:00.120]  fight more than seven different cultures from the
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.400]  chinese the japanese the americans the french that have taken them over because
[56:03.400 --> 56:06.680]  they want to be free you have tanks you have men in uniforms you have
[56:06.680 --> 56:11.800]  guys in drill sergeant hats this weekend i was at a
[56:11.800 --> 56:17.720]  hotel moody gardens with my kids down in
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.040]  gallistan and i'm going down to the pool
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.400]  and i have one of the hotel pool i'm one of the room towels
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.800]  and this guy said to me hey you're not supposed to have one of those towels
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.080]  down there you know you know you check towels out from them and i said okay
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.320]  thanks because they're going to tell you to take it back up to your room
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.200]  and i went okay so i'll walk out he's with his wife and his kid
[56:40.200 --> 56:44.520]  and we start walking he goes we're gonna do that towel and i said i'll just put
[56:44.520 --> 56:47.800]  it right here there was like a table there in the hallway
[56:47.800 --> 56:52.200]  he was like what are you doing and i go dude are you a cop
[56:52.200 --> 56:54.920]  and he got real mad and he said yeah what's it to you it's like a muscular
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.680]  guy with his wife and kid his spanish guy and i went man i just knew just mind
[56:58.680 --> 57:01.880]  your own damn business man the guy started to bow up i was like
[57:01.880 --> 57:07.480]  dude you don't have your gun in your badge right now man
[57:07.880 --> 57:12.040]  you know i can tell when i'm on the hiking bike trail when it's a bad cop
[57:12.040 --> 57:15.640]  you know on a kayak you name it they own everything
[57:15.640 --> 57:18.840]  and the most cops aren't like that but they're trying to hire cops like that
[57:18.840 --> 57:22.520]  and a lot of people are getting sick of it they know you push the public hard
[57:22.520 --> 57:25.800]  enough you'll get a real revolution and i've said it doesn't need to be killing
[57:25.800 --> 57:30.040]  cops but this whole thing looks like it's staged and we'll
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.720]  continue to keep an open mind and look at all the angles but it's harry reeds area
[57:33.720 --> 57:36.840]  it's right after the bundy deal harry reeds said
[57:36.840 --> 57:40.600]  there is this domestic terrorism coming these people are terrorists let's play
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.560]  that clip so these people who hold themselves out
[57:45.560 --> 57:50.520]  to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists
[57:50.520 --> 57:54.360]  and i think that we are a country that people should follow the law
[57:54.360 --> 57:59.240]  and what went up in the ski is not very good i repeat what went up there is
[57:59.240 --> 58:04.120]  domestic tourism okay domestic terrorism not tourism
[58:04.120 --> 58:07.800]  there you go now coming up we got george humphrey in studio at about 10

[58:36.120 --> 58:38.760]  ago where i predicted the tragedy that just happened
[58:38.760 --> 58:42.040]  we need a revolution of understanding and of non-violence
[58:42.040 --> 58:45.880]  and of freedom the globalists are going to start a physical revolution
[58:45.880 --> 58:51.640]  by pushing the people hi folks alex jones here was some important information

[59:01.960 --> 59:04.920]  and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[59:04.920 --> 59:09.400]  deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born

[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:01.240]  and i want to get our focus off the globalist because they're a joke but
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:04.280]  they're dominating our society so we have to focus on the things they're
[1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:08.280]  doing there are so many beautiful good things going on in
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:11.960]  this world and that's why we who are positive have to focus on some of the
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:16.120]  negative so it can be identified and dealt with
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:22.280]  Jared amanda miller we found uh their facebook
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:27.080]  we've tied it into planet info wars dot com blaming our social network is like
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.080]  blaming facebook i want that point made and the article kit and adon

[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.720]  were already blaming me yesterday and today we've now learned
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:42.600]  i wasn't sure when i first started the show if i've been blamed yet i was
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:49.720]  blamed last night and this morning uh by a democratic affiliate run groups
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:53.480]  when i'm on record and and and just in the last hour the crew has been able to
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:58.600]  find a bunch of clips john bound and others uh cj tell folks about some of
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:01.080]  these clips because i haven't even seen them yet what's the first clip and what's
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:05.000]  the day the first clip we have is from april 26th
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.880]  you're claiming to be set up or the tea party group and
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:12.600]  americans like is being set up to look at look like false flag terrorist
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:14.920]  let's play that clip i mean i know i said over and over again they're going to
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:17.720]  shoot cops in restaurants let's go ahead and play that clip
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:21.400]  every once in a while i get things wrong and i admit when i get things wrong
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:24.760]  i wish i was wrong about all this it's not fun
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:29.320]  to have white house run cnn msnbc media matters
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:32.920]  saying i'm deeply racist with no proof and then i'm violent and i want to kill
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:37.160]  cops and i want a war they're saying that so cops start
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:42.040]  thinking i'm a bad guy so when they set me up nobody comes to my aid
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:47.720]  i'm being set up but that's part of the mission
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:50.360]  and again that's just some of the preliminary clips they've been able to
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:52.840]  find i you've all heard it you know i've said
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:55.640]  they're going to shoot cops in public places they're going to blame it on the
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:58.440]  tea party to have homeland security come after liberty
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:01.880]  movement they officially launched the terrorism task force in all 50 states
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:04.520]  for the tea party saying we're terrorists last week
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:08.280]  this starts up now we found photos of the supposed shooter
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.760]  at richard mac events you name it i mean this is going to get bad folks
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:15.480]  and what they have is they'll have an informant or somebody that goes to our
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:19.640]  events then they set the informant up later kill them and then blame us
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:22.920]  and that's what's happened in false flags before
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:25.880]  you understand that they've done this before
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:31.720]  fast and furious was a false flag operation um gladio they did a lot of
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.160]  things like this operation north woods is how the u.s army would stage
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:38.280]  shootings in public places to blame their enemies that was the class of five
[1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:43.560]  in early 2000 what's the next clip cj we've got one from the 19th of
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.520]  may here you're predicting basically the same thing
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.840]  but you've done hundreds of times here it is and ladies and gentlemen
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:53.960]  a more than a decade before they got ready for the desert storm and all that
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:56.520]  they were already getting ready to shut up saddam by telling them to invade
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:59.080]  collate and the rest of it and they ran a wreck war they were getting ready for
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:03.080]  desert war and now for the decade it happened
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:06.680]  under bush but it's accelerating under obama they are now
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:15.240]  preparing for war with gun owners veterans pro-lifers
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:21.720]  libertarians americans good people and so we're here covering this to force a
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:24.680]  debate about it because if there's a debate about this
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:27.640]  they're not gonna be able to do it but it will be
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:31.560]  they will stage a false flag and and then that will be preceded by the quote
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:35.000]  civil war they're gonna blow up schools you
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.280]  name it blame on the liberty movement then they're going to come after us in a
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:41.480]  purge then a real civil war is going to start
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:45.880]  i think it'll kill probably 300 000 police yeah in that particular clip about
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:48.040]  blowing up schools that's part of it too there's a bunch of those where i say
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:50.760]  shoot cops in restaurants
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:53.320]  because i know how they work they did i mean they did that in vietnam they would
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:56.360]  kill some of our own troops sometimes well we'll be right back ladies and
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:59.160]  gentlemen stay with us

[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:37.800]  of fast and furious and over and over again
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:42.920]  they have tried to frame yours truly for people that shoot cops richard ploskey
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:47.160]  in 2009 we forced a retraction by the paper in pittsburgh and five other

[1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:59.000]  harry reed say about a month ago there's going to be terror attacks it's the tea
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.800]  party and then they launched this homeland security
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:05.880]  in every town and city last week task force saying the tea party's about to
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:10.120]  start shooting cops and bombing police vehicles the police need tanks on the
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:13.480]  streets because the veterans are about to hit them and hit them hard with none of
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:17.560]  this happening now that does two things
[1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:22.200]  it means they're about to stage stuff corporate globalist criminal
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:28.680]  spy interest and most importantly they're getting ready to
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:31.800]  point homeland security at their political enemies that's in the news
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:35.160]  today and the former nsa director has come out and said
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:39.160]  an attack is going to come if you don't give up all your rights to the nsa
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:44.520]  from al qaeda while they're letting al qaeda go while they are giving them
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:49.560]  weapons in syria it's incredible so we've got that report
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:53.880]  coming up as well from cnn general keith alexander
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:58.920]  warned that the nsa mired controversy won't be able to keep us safe so
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:03.800]  terrorist will get us so if you don't give your rights up
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.800]  you're a cop killer folks if you don't go along with the system why you might be
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:11.960]  someone who wants to kill cops like alex jones when i'm saying clearly in the
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:15.720]  propaganda they're getting ready to stage
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:20.200]  bombings of schools shootings of police because it's in the movies the dramas
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:24.040]  and in the news with no proof it'd be like if i was saying somebody's
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:27.560]  going to burn down the police department next week
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:31.000]  someone at midnight's going to throw them all off cocktail on the door
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.680]  well either i'm the main suspect if it happens
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:39.960]  because i'm saying it's going to happen or i caused a copycat
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:43.160]  or if you were saying that see how it works mainstream media is saying the
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:47.160]  veterans are going to ied you will be hit by veterans attacking the tea party
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:50.760]  is going to blow stuff up uh west points main training mission is to
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.480]  fight the tea party domestically that's forbs ap
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:58.040]  reuters this is crazy and then now it starts
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:02.440]  right as obama implodes the borders right as they implode the economy with
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:05.480]  obama care right as they say our military is under nato control
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:08.680]  right as bank of america starts announcing capital controls over the
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:12.200]  weekend we so much news in the feature archive
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:15.880]  i didn't even get to down to next to susan joins us in the next hour
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:19.720]  persecuted number two documentary filmmaker in history 40 million
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:22.600]  grossed domestically and worldwide with his obama
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:25.560]  2016 he had a new movie coming out to unify
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:29.640]  immigrants around being free market and not being socialist
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:36.120]  he's been arrested total political persecution
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:39.000]  we're all in this together ladies and gentlemen
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.120]  anyone who's truly populist anyone who's a true liberal
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.400]  like thomas jefferson and i see myself in that vein
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:50.920]  anyone that calls for people to come together anyone that talks about americana
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:54.120]  is an enemy now we've got all these clips of where i predict we're gonna play
[1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.760]  him again i played in the last segment where i said they're gonna stage the
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:59.480]  stuff they're gonna attack police and blame it on us
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:03.640]  just in april and then a month after that in may
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:07.000]  because i see the programming this isn't hard to do
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.480]  and now supposedly jared and amanda miller had a planted info wars dot com
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:15.160]  account we've checked it you to live in indiana his facebook says that too
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:20.040]  is facebook gonna be blamed because he had a facebook
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:24.120]  you see but before the media even found this because we found it
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:26.840]  they were blaming me last night this morning raw story you name it
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.920]  vegas shooters revolution shooters i need his right wing conspiracy nuts
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:37.240]  with a death wish obsessed with the joker like the last three shootings
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:42.040]  then obsessed with the skinny man that stabbings all over the country
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:45.720]  am i going to be blamed for stabbings in this goth death culture
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.680]  that then meets anti-government because the cops beat him up
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:53.560]  are they products of the corrupt culture taking out their vengeance on the innocent
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:56.600]  police which is despicable and a terrible idea for liberty
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:13:01.960]  or is it some type of setup they're part of a drill they were killed
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:05.640]  we know that's happened before we're looking at it all right now my gut tells
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:08.040]  me this happened in harry reid's controlled area
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:11.880]  los vegas he's saying that we're domestic terrorists are tying it to bundy ranch
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:15.880]  with no proof and now the proof is being provided afterwards
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:19.880]  that sounds like a setup now george unfree is the best-selling author
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:25.000]  documentary filmmaker and it has uh you know is what i call a classical liberal
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.480]  um liberal many fronts and what you call you know currently liberal
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:33.240]  but help pat Buchanan was you know was the head of his campaign here locally
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:36.600]  when he ran i remember going to his house to get more yard signs or dumping him
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.880]  off there and of course he's also a business
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:43.560]  owner designer inventor successful entrepreneur
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  and again he's been doing radio and access tv
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:52.040]  i learned about derivatives from his book on tape in like 1999 he predicted
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.840]  everything that would happen we'll tell you about that book on tape talk about
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:57.960]  evergreen but he joins us for the balance of the hour
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:02.280]  to just to cover the waterfront and and george it's so good
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:05.880]  to have you here with us god bless you for being here we haven't even talked
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:09.560]  before you came on air i want to talk about this false flag do you
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:13.160]  concur with what i'm saying what can you add to it
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:16.920]  where do you see all this going it looks like they're dropping the hammer on
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:20.280]  every front well first of all it's good to be here
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:26.840]  alex yeah i love you and i've known alex for over 20 years
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.000]  and when we were down at the little studio when you're coming over to my
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.760]  house you know you and this the change that is
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:40.040]  taking place here is amazing and i'm not blowing smoke yet i just
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:43.400]  love you you know you're egotistical you're a loud
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:49.480]  mouth you're you're tough but you are a true hero and i am so
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:53.560]  when i travel around the world and i spend most of my time traveling
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:58.920]  around asian different places people all over the world
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:02.600]  when i say i'm from austin texas they say do you know alex jones
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:06.840]  and i get a big smile on my face and then we have a nice conversation
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:12.440]  all over this planet people are listening to alex jones and that's not
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:15.640]  about me though it's just a benchmark of the popularity of liberty
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:21.000]  absolutely but it's also about you in that you have had the courage
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.560]  to speak the truth you've had the determination and the willpower
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.800]  to stick with it and you've had the smarts to develop
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:36.200]  a mechanism to get this message out and so and besides that alex your help
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:40.120]  brother alex besides that behind all the
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:45.240]  gruffness he's a really fun guy i mean he's really fun and he knows a lot more
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:49.560]  stuff than he lets on and so anyway i'm really happy to be here i haven't
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:53.000]  been on the show for probably over a year i've been in uh
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.520]  southeast asia for most of the time and you know
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:01.480]  the bottom line we it's amazing that we even have to talk about this
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:05.960]  you know just one week after another there's just one more false flag event
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:08.760]  after another and george you could be part of the establishment we don't brag
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:11.960]  about you but i mean your your family your famous industrialist you've been
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:16.440]  incredibly successful in clothing lines uh uh real estate i mean you're you're
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.360]  you're i mean you could be part of the system well
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:24.360]  yeah and and i have benefited in some ways
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:31.320]  from the system but i also know that i love my family i love myself i love my
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:36.680]  country i love austin i love freedom i love this planet
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:43.240]  and the bottom line is i've been i've been studying this stuff for 25 30 years
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:47.160]  and the reality is is that everything not everything but almost everything you're
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:51.400]  saying is right on and we're we're talking about the
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:57.000]  sustainability the life of this culture the life of our families
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  the freedoms that are so dear to us and actual life itself on this planet
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.600]  so you even though you you are very strong about this this issue
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:12.680]  the issues that we're talking about are so much bigger
[1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:15.960]  than even 99 percent of the patriots of this country
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:19.560]  have any idea i totally agree i mean the rabbit hole is so deep
[1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:23.480]  we are fighting just a force of pure destruction it's it's
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:27.640]  you know just let's just back up a little bit there was a movie called eyes
[1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:31.320]  wide shut with tom cruise in it and it's a great title
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:37.240]  but almost every day i go outside and i always look around
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:41.480]  and four out of seven days there's chemtrails up in the air
[1:17:41.480 --> 1:17:46.120]  four out of seven days a strangle in the breeze a straight they're all over
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:49.960]  and almost every day when i see them i look around and i say i look at the
[1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:54.360]  people and 98 percent of the people never look up
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:58.520]  they always either have their their view about seven or eight feet down in
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:01.560]  front of them or just but they don't look up and
[1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:05.320]  then when you ask them what are those things up there
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:09.080]  the cognitive dissonance their eyes go kind of glassy
[1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:14.280]  and only about one out of ten people will actually say well what is that
[1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:18.760]  the fact that they that we are being sprayed and they admit they're doing it
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:21.960]  we know the names of the programs we're going to skip this network break
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:25.720]  it's incredible it is unbelievable friends
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:30.040]  this is you know we can talk about so many things but this is eyes wide shut
[1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:34.120]  right in front of us and our own government is spraying toxic
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:39.240]  material right on top of this in only about one out of a hundred people are
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:43.320]  even aware and bill gates is in the guardian telling us why he does it
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:48.440]  bill gates runs the major program and gets money to the department of energy
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:52.040]  and it's it's public and no one even knows it's there in
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:55.880]  literally you and i have seen them tiptoe
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:59.080]  you know put lines crossing like in the tiptoe pattern
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:02.280]  right across this and i'll be out in the golf course playing golf
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.880]  or on the driving range or playing tennis and it has my friends
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:10.040]  and they don't even want to know that is the amazing thing
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:15.960]  everybody is being poisoned the gmo's the tamaracella la la la la and we're
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:19.080]  going to go into all of this but the amazing thing
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:22.920]  is not the people them the people who are doing it to us
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:29.400]  it is our own people who are so mind control the cognitive dissidents is so
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:35.160]  strong and the ignorance is so amazing that our own people
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:38.920]  are going along with the slaughter they're like sheep going in
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:43.640]  to getting slaughtered and it doesn't have to be that way and the thing i love
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:47.240]  about you alex is that you provide you have this
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:53.080]  courage that is contagious and and it takes courage to say no i'm not going
[1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:55.960]  into the slaughterhouse doors i'm not doing it
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:20:01.000]  and you know what friends we don't have to there's another way we don't have to
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.560]  go down the yellow brick road and get wiped out
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:08.760]  we don't have to do this there is a better way
[1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:12.360]  we can have a new paradigm we can turn this thing around
[1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:17.000]  we have the greatest country in the world we have still a lot of great people
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:20.120]  here and we have the answers we have renewable
[1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:23.320]  energies we have the economic systems that we can
[1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:27.320]  turn around and we have the consciousness and all of this
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:31.640]  it's not about political or economic or media people just awaken it's over
[1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:34.040]  where would you say where would you say george
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.160]  i'm pretty sure guess where would you say my friend we are currently because
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:40.360]  there's a huge awakening happening but at the same time other people are getting
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:43.880]  deeper into control or then i have deep understanding you have deep
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:48.280]  understanding i catch myself even acclimating to the corruption
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:52.280]  and just going with it well we are in a first of all third fourth fifth sixth
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:56.280]  dimension it's all binary there's all duality in
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:01.480]  in these systems and so for every negative in what we call the negative
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:06.200]  which is the tamaris all the gun running the the the gmo's all these
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:10.040]  things is that there's also the positive and we have to understand
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:14.840]  that this is a free will universe and that we as human beings
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:19.080]  we can change we don't have to go along with this poison the poison of our
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:23.000]  minds we by first of all listening to shows
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:26.440]  like yours alex in getting objective information
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:31.320]  and then we have to make a choice are we are we going to go down and fight with
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:33.960]  these people because we can't fix this thing
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:37.640]  you know like buckman can't fix it try to well you know all i've ever said all
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:41.080]  you've ever said is nonviolent yes don't be violent i can see them
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:44.760]  pre-programming to cause a civil war speak to that briefly i want to go
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:47.560]  through some issues with you because you're and you're also an economist
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:50.360]  actually yeah and i've spent a lot of time in india
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:54.120]  i've spent about four and a half years in indian ghandi is
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:57.880]  you know i've lived at ghandi's house and i believe in what's called satra gaha
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:01.400]  which is nonviolent civil disobedience and creating
[1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:04.920]  a new culture out of our own higher ideals
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.280]  we can't go along with the existing paradigm
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:12.440]  but we do have the tools the wisdom the ability
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.880]  to change things and that's what you're doing alex
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:19.320]  all these good products that you sell on this show like
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:23.080]  inner food and the things that we can do to make ourselves healthier
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:27.320]  so number one is getting formed number two is love ourselves
[1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:30.280]  you know about a year ago before you left town you challenged me to get even
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:33.560]  healthier and i have i'm still not great but it's it's a process well you know
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:37.160]  your eyes are a lot clearer and your complexion is better than i've seen you
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:41.960]  for a long period of time we can all get healthier and and the fact is
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:46.040]  is that our slave masters they're not my slave masters but the slave masters out
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:49.880]  there they want to pre program us as human resources
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:53.960]  to you know tap out at about 65 or 70 years of age
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:57.480]  and you know what we have the ability they don't want elders around they don't
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:01.400]  want elders but we have the genetic ability through the dna
[1:23:01.400 --> 1:23:06.680]  to live a lot longer and not only longer but with a lot more vitality and a lot
[1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:09.880]  more fun because the three three things that we got to
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:15.240]  remember is life love and joy life love and joy and if
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:19.880]  we're full of life having fun and and being with good people
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:23.560]  people aren't going to follow us they're going to awaken right beside us
[1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:27.080]  and then that will change things in a chain reaction i agree but first we
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.400]  have to identify i want to give a suppositive stuff with you
[1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:33.000]  what the enemy is doing what do you make of just the total lawlessness
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.680]  legalizing all the illegals telling people worldwide dump your kids here
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:39.960]  we'll pay for it obama carries you know written i mean you're an economist
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:43.400]  economist trained yeah uh you know you've run the city of
[1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:45.400]  austin your names on so many buildings down here
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:48.600]  well i mean talking to folks run businesses you name it
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:51.880]  what are they currently doing clearly as a layman they're trying to shut down
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.240]  the economy well alex that question you and i could sit
[1:23:55.240 --> 1:23:58.520]  here for the next three days and we wouldn't finish it up but what you one
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:02.600]  of the things you're talking about is that we now have 21 to 32 million
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:06.680]  illegal aliens in this country now i'm not saying the illegal
[1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:10.360]  if i was if i was a poor person mexico i'd come here too
[1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:14.040]  but the point is is that if there's a political weapon going on if i go to
[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:17.640]  mexico and i overstay my visa guess what i get fined or i get
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:20.840]  thrown in jail and where i travel around the world
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:24.040]  and i pay attention to the laws of that country
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:30.200]  and and if we don't protect our boards we have troops in 118 countries
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:33.640]  and yet we don't protect obama is advertising
[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:37.400]  come here and the planes are landing every minute
[1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:40.840]  and they're just and and and then just go right through customs you're here
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:45.960]  and it's a it's a if i fly back into the u.s i get a proctology exam
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:52.440]  and it's amazing is that this is going on right in front of our eyes and it's
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:55.960]  politically correct not to talk about it
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  you know you've been called a racist and as i have been
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:04.840]  and that is the craziest thing in the world i've known alex for 20 some odd
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:07.000]  years but it doesn't even i mean the point is the whole
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.360]  world's imploding it's in why do the globalist want to overrun the borders
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.280]  well be well first of all because the united states is the last
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.120]  potential place of freedom our constitution
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:22.840]  is an amazing document and there are still good people in this country and
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:25.880]  folks from other countries have no idea they have no idea
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:30.280]  and the people the power lethal the the illuminati whatever you want to call
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:34.840]  these people it's all about power to them they care not and they give them
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:38.040]  they give them an idea to vote in california and other states it's over
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:42.040]  game over it's they're gonna vote to take our guns everything alex there i'm
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:46.840]  i know you've talked about this 10 000 times there are 47 million people in
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.040]  the united states on food stamps think about that
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:54.360]  47 million almost 15 now people million
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.880]  million people on food that's more people that live
[1:25:57.880 --> 1:26:03.400]  in most countries that is one out of 8.5 people in this country now here's
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:06.440]  california and texas here's the here's the crazy thing
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:10.440]  is that there is even more money for corporate welfare
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:15.240]  than is going for social welfare so we have this welfare on both sides of the
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:20.200]  right and the left and you know the people who are in the middle the
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:23.320]  productive people the people who have the small shops the small
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:28.280]  businesses who work for a living you don't pay your taxes a swat team's
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.560]  coming it is unbelievable and i'm i know that you've
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:36.280]  talked so many times about the irs looking at the the tea party and the
[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:40.360]  conservative people who are political persecution
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:44.600]  it's going on folks it's it's very real and it's not right it's
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.720]  it's it's it's so illegal and yet because the people of this country
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:54.120]  have swallowed the blue pill they've swallowed the blue pill
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:57.960]  they don't care and because they don't care is the apathy
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.320]  is that the bullies it's like if you have a bully keep pushing you
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:05.080]  he's going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing until you stand up
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:09.080]  and you might get your little tailgit whip but if you swing back as hard as
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:12.440]  you can or kick him in the shins he's going to stop it
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:16.760]  or you know better yet you you hit him right between the eyes
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  and the and the thing about this is is that alex you
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:24.520]  have never advocated violence in in your whole life
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:28.280]  but you have advocated which i fully agree with
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:32.520]  self-defense and that is something that everybody should do
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.880]  is self-defense is not terrorism it is not and even mahatma ghandi
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.480]  who is my my great guy said it is better to die in battle
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:47.160]  in a war to defend your country than to die
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:53.160]  a coward in in in your country to the heels of your masters
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:59.800]  so he was also he was not for totally he was not for giving up he was for strong
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:04.200]  sovereign action to protect the self and the family and the country and the
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:07.800]  world sure he was saying at key points sometimes it's better to be non-violent
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:10.520]  when you're attacked to make the point that they're the oppressor
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.640]  so they can't have the fight they're looking for exactly no one to hold them
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:16.600]  no one to fold them and and that's what we need to do
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:22.280]  first of all our our big brothers whoever you want they've got more weapons
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:27.560]  than you know what to do with the we we can't we're we're in this thing the
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:32.040]  pentagon admits they can't win uh physical wars now it's 90 percent
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:35.160]  in full war we are not here to be martyrs
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:39.320]  we're here to win this thing i'm not here to be a martyr and to win this
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.360]  thing we have to be smart and the first thing is
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:46.040]  is to get the information out objectively
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:50.120]  so that people can understand and it just like
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:53.400]  when you're selling something you've got to repeat the the name at least seven
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:57.080]  times keep repeating repeating repeating and i have
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.520]  friends every day who are wait waking up you know they're on the borderline
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:03.960]  they're on the borderline they're on the borderline and then they'll hear you
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:08.040]  or they'll heal me or or whatever and then they get it and once you
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:11.960]  once you go through that magic door once you pull the curtain back and you see
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:15.640]  how wild this thing is and i'll tell you what friends
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:19.080]  when i first started doing this i was really scared about talking about that
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.360]  i say 95 percent of people didn't know the Federal Reserve was private
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:25.960]  but once you start becoming aware of this your whole world changes
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:29.960]  and actually it gets a lot better yeah it's fun to fight the tyranny we're meant
[1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:33.080]  to do it yeah and it's not only fun to fight the tyranny
[1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:38.280]  but to go off in a new direction and have a better healthier more loving life
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:41.800]  it's cool alex and and it is you know just being here

[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.800]  was because this is the this is in the halogen family they put all the bad
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:19.880]  halogens the fluoride the bromine and the water
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:23.960]  in the food in the baking products as it blocks the pineal the glands everything

[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:28.520]  but you know you heard me before i did that plug there
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:32.840]  talk about what's going on with this demonization campaign you heard during
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:36.520]  the break as we read from his planet info wars comments
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:41.000]  it appears to be him uh where he you know says you know i'm never going to
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.600]  shoot any police i never plan to shoot any police
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.280]  funny that he says things like that now they say he's done this but he's
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:53.000]  conveniently dead he goes he says who knows anyone can trust
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.120]  anybody really i'm done for the most part done talking
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:38:59.000]  hopefully people will follow my lead when i strike back
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:04.280]  with luke and the ewoks uh i mean you know this is the kind of stuff he's
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:08.600]  saying here he says looks to me like they want very specific ways of
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:12.120]  thinking for their slaves so they'll show up and take the domestic terrorist
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:15.480]  away and they shoot police they can turn to each
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:18.680]  other and say see we told you so he's talking about the government shooting
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:21.320]  police or if someone fights back because he's
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:24.040]  obviously a listener hearing where i'm saying don't have a civil war don't shoot
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:27.400]  police as the medias hyping patriots are going to shoot police
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:30.760]  to turn the police against us with the adl and southern prairie law center
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:34.760]  telling him constantly i'm doing this i don't want to talk about me george
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.000]  i want to get into the world positive things positive things you see the top
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.560]  three or four positive things the top three or four negative things
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:44.680]  because we don't identify the negative we don't know what we're fighting against
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:48.920]  i believe in humanity know we can turn the corner but
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:52.360]  we need to get out of the the denial and admit
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:56.200]  that we're defending all this great stuff but we have to admit what's going on
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:59.560]  if we have a shot at it so i see exposing the evil as positive
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:04.200]  but i agree with you as prima facia for every evil thing every bad thing there's
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:07.640]  a good thing newtonian physics for every action
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:11.560]  there's an opposite right and just as powerful reaction well
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:15.800]  what i like to do is i like to step back from it a little bit further
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:19.160]  and i would like to just share with your listeners
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:24.680]  and which many of them know is that this situation this rabbit hole is so much
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:31.080]  deeper it is so much wilder it's so much crazier
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:35.320]  than 99.5 of the people have any idea about
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:40.120]  there is a very wise man who once told me life is an illusion
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:46.680]  realize it life is a challenge meet it life is a game play it and life is love
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.080]  accepted and the the illusion it's maya we're in a big
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:55.000]  holograph and and and understanding new to in that
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.920]  that i understand newtonian physics i mean
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:02.840]  quantum physics completely but i kind of see this life is
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.240]  is is a hologram and it's what we create our conscious it just came out with
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:10.040]  mathematics there they found an invisible hologram
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:13.960]  holding the whole universe together there's an in my mind
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.320]  people are starting to get hip to that and the fact is is that we create our own
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.600]  realities and the those beings who are in
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:25.800]  charge of our political our economic our culture
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:31.240]  our easy ecclesiastic institutions they are in fear based consciousness they
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.800]  want to control they think that the only way that they're
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:37.000]  going to win the game is by taking from others
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:40.440]  they are in fear in limitation consciousness
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:44.040]  and because i know you have a very strong belief
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:47.720]  in the creator and the god as i do and i know that life
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:51.800]  is eternal it's it's infinite out there there's nature saying the mathematics
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:55.560]  shows a clear hologram and an invisible force beyond holding
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:59.080]  everything together and it's so much more beautiful but i am
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:03.320]  completely in agreement with you is that the only way to get
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:06.920]  out of the hologram just like in the movie the hunger games
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:11.880]  is to realize what's going on inside and we've got to play the game exactly it's
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:15.000]  a beautiful wonderful universe i don't want cops to get killed
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.200]  i don't want a civil war the new world order wants that
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:25.640]  absolutely and it's all because of of of of action reaction and solution
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:29.480]  and and these people this is this has been going on for centuries
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:33.720]  they create a problem they blame it on certain people who are their enemies
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:37.880]  like alex jones and then the solution is more power for them
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:41.160]  but you know what we've got this figured out we
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:44.600]  understand this week after week after week you know
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:48.520]  whether it's weiko or it was ruby ridge or it's
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.760]  oklahoma city or tw flight eight you know 800
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:57.240]  all of these things they're all were created to create fear
[1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:02.360]  and fear is the way that they control the masses listen they they wrote eco
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:05.720]  science when the year i was born in 74 the white house current science are
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:09.000]  admitting they put flawed in there to brain damages and make us fearful and
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:14.200]  weak you know just the fluoride thing as you've said i used to be an elected
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:17.640]  official i was a city council member and we have
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:21.800]  and i go down and talk to our elected officials right now
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:25.480]  and when they will talk most of them will not talk to me right now and i'm
[1:43:25.480 --> 1:43:29.480]  always very polite i know all the right buzzwords i wear my coat and tie
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:33.560]  i call them sir you know and i'm very polite with them but i take down
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:37.880]  mds i take down other dentists i take down reports from
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:41.320]  you know harvard university showing that fluoride
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:47.400]  not only does not protect the teeth but it is a toxic element within the body
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.600]  and the cognitive dissonance the fear just even at the city council level and
[1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:56.120]  it's not just austin texas it's happening all over the world
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:00.280]  mayor lee levin will flipped our cameraman off from the dais
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:04.040]  he actually held his finger up and did it yeah when we were there on floor i've
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:07.720]  been polite and why is he so demonic well
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:13.080]  we've had a series of mayors who are controlled by the downtown moneyed
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:16.600]  interest and first of all we have to understand
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:21.000]  these people are controlled they don't even realize what they're doing
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.200]  they don't have that much life experience
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:28.200]  they haven't paid their bills they haven't run businesses
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:33.320]  they haven't talked to open-minded people and most importantly they are
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:37.480]  afraid of the truth they do not want to give in
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:41.720]  they want to keep control now there are some new people who are running for
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:44.680]  city council and this is happening all over the country people like
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:47.960]  laura laura presley who who speak the truth but
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:53.160]  the present city council god love them they're a bunch of cowards
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:57.480]  and i say this with unbelievable respect there's people like you know
[1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:01.400]  there's some good people down there but you show them this information and you
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:05.000]  say whose side are you on the fda said quit using fluoride
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.080]  as a pesticide two years ago wall street journal you see it on toothpaste it
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:11.640]  says if you swallow the stuff go to the doctor
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:15.400]  i mean it's like the chemtrails it's it's it's hiding in plain view but but
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:18.920]  but getting back to consciousness yes and reality i interrupted you with that
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:25.400]  but but the point is is that for every one of these beings who are afraid of
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:27.880]  looking at the truth and we all know those people
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:31.400]  they're members of our family they're go to our churches
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:37.080]  that we see them at the coffee shop every single day more and more and more
[1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:39.640]  people are waking up they're listening to your show
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.600]  they're coming to groups like the circle of intention
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:46.120]  they're learning about life they're reading good books they're
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:49.800]  they're talking to other people and we're coming together
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:54.760]  and all wherever i go every day i have this conversation
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:58.120]  you know alex the number of people who come up to me
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:01.560]  and say hey i've seen you i've read your book or i've seen your movie or i've
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:07.960]  seen you on alex jones and then they they just want to talk it is so
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:11.960]  it keeps my heart warm let me ask you a question why do you think you're so
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:15.480]  alive and and myself so alive people ask that question they don't want to do a
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:18.520]  highlight over what we've said they don't want to put exclamation points behind
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:20.440]  what we've said they don't want to create martyrs
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:23.960]  but at the same time they just want to assassinate our names but i think a lot
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:26.760]  and i know a lot of people in the system they're scared as well
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.360]  we have more allies than we know absolutely i mean it's not the government
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:34.280]  folks it's not even the the average company it's select groups that know
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:37.400]  how to manipulate people we're all in this together but why do you think we're
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:43.000]  still alive well thank god i mean first of all
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:46.920]  i have a very very strong belief in the creator and the goodness of the creator
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:50.680]  and i and i we're protected and i do believe that we are protected and i'm
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:54.040]  not trying to go you know hardcore religious or anything like but i do
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:58.280]  believe that we are protected i also believe that within the system there
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:02.120]  are good people who are realized you know i
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:05.800]  they know they know we're good people they know we're good people they know
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:09.320]  that we're here to protect our country to make our country
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:12.600]  better to make our world a safer more beautiful place
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:16.200]  because they have children they have grandchildren themselves
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:21.080]  and they can see that if we continue down this primrose path
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:24.760]  we're not talking about just corporate fascism around the world
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:29.080]  we're talking about perhaps the extermination of large numbers of people
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:32.840]  on this planet that's a set goal absolutely it is
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:36.360]  absolutely it is and when ted turn you know and
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:39.720]  and they're really talking it because it's all
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:43.080]  about power but it's not going to happen you've been in a lot of elite circles
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:45.800]  and i've run into some in my years and so is my dad
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:48.920]  how often when you're at a cocktail party years ago or playing golf with you
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:52.600]  know billionaires whatever i know you have do they bring up we've got to get
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:55.320]  rid of the public we've got to reduce the population because i know
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:01.880]  that's that's the cocktail talk in these groups well i used to hear that
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:07.400]  20 25 years ago i don't hear that so much anymore
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:11.880]  occasionally i hear that but i think more people first of all they know more
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:15.160]  about who i am and so they watch their conversation
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:19.800]  a lot more it's also because i don't hang out with those people as much as i
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  you know i just i just choose my friends different i liked being around
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:27.080]  more like-minded people but you know what's really incredible
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:31.240]  is that 15 or 20 years ago these people wouldn't talk to me
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:35.080]  and now they want to play tennis or they want to play golf they want to come
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.360]  over and more and more people are in the beginning of patriots the
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:41.320]  scarce man hated fear and scorn and time when his cause exceeds
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:44.200]  the timon join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot mark twain
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:47.480]  so you've gone full circle being ostracized and now they're begging you
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:52.120]  to come yeah and and and you carry a sharper knife than i do
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:56.440]  because you're at it day after day after day after day after day and
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.920]  and i i choose my words a little bit more softly but you and i are saying
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:06.200]  the same things but more and more people because we all realize it's all
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:10.760]  based upon the pyramid and most of the people who are part of the power elite
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:14.360]  who are in the pyramid they don't understand the big picture
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:18.600]  but because the grass grows from the roots and the grass is coming up and
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:21.720]  they're starting to realize that they're i was about to say some of the most
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:24.680]  controlled are at the last third of the pyramid
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:27.480]  absolutely not at the very top they know what's going on at the top but right
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:30.040]  up but right near it are some of the most controlled
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:33.800]  compartmentalized people and and that's what i know that my job is to shake
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:36.840]  people awake so they can then be decompartmentalized
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  not to hear what i have to say you wake up and take the red pill baby
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:43.880]  you got you can't be told about the matrix you got to see it
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:47.800]  you yeah you've got to see it and but these people
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:51.240]  are waking up because they realize the folks higher up
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:56.680]  they don't care about them there is no loyalty in this group of what we call the
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:01.000]  illuminate look at the v.a. we've been looking at the v.a.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.240]  for 20 years i mean you know you and i both realize how
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:09.720]  inefficient it is it's just totally completely inefficient
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.400]  and just like you talk about obama i mean obama care
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:17.720]  is is sick care it is all you have to do is follow the money
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:21.240]  look at the stocks of the insurance companies that
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:24.920]  they exploded they exploded the the value of the stocks that
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:28.840]  deal with obama care their valuations have
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:32.840]  have exploded just and then you buy into the sin and by stock and make money
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:36.280]  off the eugenics and the death panels
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:39.720]  but there's a better way and and and that's what i want to talk about solutions

[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:46.360]  put the media around with that little side issue factoid uh George Humphrey is
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:48.840]  my guest a good friend of mine you know he
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:52.480]  He said his books and videos are mainly out of print, if you can find them.
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:54.440]  He's just busy doing other research right now.
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:57.800]  But I mean, plug some of them, if the folks want to find them on eBay or other places.
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:02.240]  Well, my first booklet was called Common Sense, an introduction to the...
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:03.720]  The book on tape was world class.
[1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:04.720]  Yeah.
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:06.200]  Give me a copy of that, I'll put it on prisonblinded.tv.
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:09.080]  Yeah, I've still got some of those tapes there.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.280]  So the second one was Uncommon Sense, Your Choice, the blue pill or the red pill.
[1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:14.520]  And then I did...
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:18.320]  I wrote one of the very first books about 9-11 called 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:23.560]  And I made one of the first full length documentaries about 9-11, 9-11, The Great Illusion, that
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:26.800]  Alex has done a great job selling and it's...
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:27.800]  You know what?
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:28.800]  I haven't...
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:33.760]  I looked at it the other day and I made it 10 years ago and it's still, you know, one
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:36.840]  of the better, you know, films out there.
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:39.480]  I mean, 9-11 is a slant.
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:42.760]  Anybody who doesn't understand 9-11 is not paying attention.
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:46.720]  And it shows they'll do incredible hoaxes and we're not saying the whole government,
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:47.720]  criminal networks.
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  Right.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:49.720]  Just like they got...
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:50.720]  But now they get caught.
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:54.960]  George, they got caught launching chemical attacks to blame it on Syria and it even came
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:55.960]  out in the BBC.
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:56.960]  It was staged.
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  Of course.
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:01.400]  I mean, but used to, that was like, oh, our government has no connection to al-Qaeda,
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:02.400]  you traitor.
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:05.040]  Well, that was all about the pipeline.
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:09.800]  I mean, you know, basically what it was is that the Rothschild force is wanting another
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:13.880]  pipeline so that Russia didn't have the only gas line going in...
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:15.720]  Same reason they're going into Ukraine right now.
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:16.720]  It's the same story.
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:17.720]  Exactly.
[1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:25.280]  And in France, always follow the money and, you know, what you have right now is the Rothschild
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:30.440]  interest of Western Europe versus Putin and even though...
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:36.880]  And I'm not supporting Putin because he's a gangster, but he's a really smart gangster.
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:40.800]  And if you ever listen to what he has to say, a lot of what he has to say...
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:43.920]  Well, he put a guy on national TV and they've asked me on the guy's show and I just didn't
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:49.480]  do it, that they say is the Alex Jones of Russia, he runs the state-run media now.
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:52.360]  They basically say don't take the shots, they're putting stuff in them.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:53.360]  It's eugenics.
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  They pay people to have kids.
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:56.840]  I mean, the Russians have really, I think, turned a corner.
[1:56:56.840 --> 1:57:01.840]  I'm not saying it's not gangster run, but they want a large gangster force.
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:03.440]  They're not trying to kill their own people.
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:08.240]  The Russians don't hate their own people anymore and they realize the Soviet system was a globalist
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:09.240]  program.
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:12.720]  And by the way, the Russians don't put fluoride in their water.
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:13.720]  God!
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:16.240]  The Chinese don't put fluoride in the water.
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:20.400]  The Eastern Europeans and many of the countries in Western Europe don't put fluoride in their
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:23.480]  water and on and on and on and on and on.
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:30.200]  And even though Putin is a gangster, he's somewhat of a nationalist and it's always
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:34.280]  important to listen to both sides of a story.
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:35.720]  Both sides of the story.
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:40.600]  And what we're fed in the predominant media, it just makes...
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:42.840]  You and I have seen this.
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:44.120]  We know all the buzzwords.
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  We realize it.
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:49.640]  And for 20 years, I've just kind of laughed at it because it's so transparent.
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:54.360]  But most people, it's amazing, they believe this stuff.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:55.960]  They truly believe this.
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:58:00.400]  And now the elite go on CNN and SMBC every week and go, we lie to the public.
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:01.400]  Yeah.
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:03.160]  Susan Rice came out and said, yeah, we lie, big deal.
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:07.600]  I mean, they now just say, Gibbs says, yeah, we lie to you.
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:09.360]  What is that?
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:15.400]  Because they realize that the people are so, you know, you got to have courage at home
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:17.240]  and free in the land of the brave.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:22.680]  Well, folks, the courage level, the vibration, the intensity of the American people has gone
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:23.760]  down so much.
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:27.920]  The apathy, the welfare, all the things...
[1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:30.640]  And that's why this show's been successful for all its wards.
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:34.680]  Is it changes the wavelength against people out of their dollar and do five more minutes
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:42.280]  before the next one, Susan, on Solutions, George Humphries.
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:49.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:53.400]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[1:58:53.400 --> 1:58:57.960]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[1:58:57.960 --> 1:59:01.520]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:04.600]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.440]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:12.160]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:16.120]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:20.640]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:25.800]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:30.080]  Fluoride is in teeths and coffins and water, it's in breads and toothpaste.
[1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:33.120]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:34.640]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:36.000]  It's time to take action.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:37.840]  It's time to filter our water.

[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:10.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:11.480]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:22.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:32.120]  George Humphrey is here, I'm always calling him George Humphrey, he's George Humphrey,
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:37.240]  known in 20 years at least, probably 21 years, I'm calling him Humphrey, George Humphrey.
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:40.040]  George, National SUSE is coming up.
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:44.680]  Hey, to enclosing more solutions, because you've been a guy that's been very successful
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:48.600]  at reaching millions of people, and you've helped influence me a lot, what are some of
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:50.840]  your other points you give people advice on?
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:52.840]  Okay, it's real simple, Alex.
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:01:00.880]  Number one is to get objective, real information, to read the right books, to listen to Alex,
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:04.260]  and to listen to stuff without freaking out.
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:08.000]  Because I'll tell you what, 15, 20 years ago when I'd read this stuff, I'd wake up
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.600]  in the middle of the night and I'd freak out, but you know what, just to get the information.
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:19.640]  Number two is to take good care of our bodies, 67, I mean, 37% of the people in this country
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:23.720]  are obese right now, another 32% are overweight.
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:32.360]  So eating good food without GMOs, eating organic, getting enough exercise, being outside, being
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:36.760]  with the people who love you, not with the people you're supposed to be with, go out
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.320]  with your dogs, go to the lakes and go swimming, enjoy yourself.
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:47.200]  Number three is whatever your spiritual practice is, deepen it.
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:49.440]  If you're a Christian, get to be a deeper Christian.
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:52.980]  If you're a Jew, get to be a deeper Jew.
[2:01:52.980 --> 2:02:00.240]  If you're a pagan, you know, whatever it is, find God because God, the Creator is everywhere
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:02.880]  and the synchronicity is increasing.
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.600]  And then start understanding that this is not just a political or an economic issue.
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:15.000]  This is a time of metaphysical choice and that is what is so incredibly wonderful.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:23.520]  And it's not just a change of ecology, it's not just a change of psychology, our whole
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:30.520]  solar system, our planet because of where our solar system is now and because, and this
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:37.200]  is a fact, we are getting now significantly more electromagnetic frequency into our solar
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:39.520]  system and onto our planet.
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:44.520]  And because of that is that the vibrations are changing and we have the opportunity right
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:48.680]  now to change our way of life, to become more aware.
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:53.280]  And everybody has a choice to stay into the old third dimension.
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:54.280]  Remember that move?
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:57.120]  I had Harry Dent on, a former top bank capital analyst.
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:02.800]  He said, oh, they all know it's really sunspots and space memes that manipulate the economy.
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:03.800]  And then I went and looked it up.
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:08.200]  I've read that before and it's like mainline at the big Goldman Sachs and all of them know
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:09.200]  that.
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:10.200]  The public doesn't know any of that.
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:16.680]  Well, the reality is that most of the global warming or global climate change, I should
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:18.800]  say, is because of the sun.
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:21.400]  I mean, it doesn't take much to figure out.
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:24.920]  That's where we get most of our power from and because not only are we getting more
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:30.320]  electromagnetic frequency, but we're getting more radiation and debris into our solar system
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:31.880]  and the magna around the sun.
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:33.640]  There's the New York Times talking about it.
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:38.400]  Is reacting and that changes that affects our planet.
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:44.360]  Now clearly what man is doing on this planet, we are absolutely destroying this beautiful
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:47.640]  beautiful planet and that has to change right now.
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:49.520]  And the problem is just like with alternative energy.
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:51.880]  They bring out fake alternative that's a scam.
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:54.880]  They take over the environmental movement that you've been a big part of and then don't
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:55.880]  fix.
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:56.880]  Look at GMO.
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:00.960]  I mean, that right there is the carbon dioxide is not the issue, it's GMO.
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:05.360]  There are so many issues and one of the things I really want to point out is that from the
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:11.880]  day I've known Alex, he has been a staunch environmentalist, but he talks about it in
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:14.280]  very scientific and real ways.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:16.560]  He just doesn't go, the sky is falling.
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:20.320]  He said, let's really look at the facts and I really appreciate that.
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:25.440]  But the important thing is to realize that each of us are our own creators.
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:26.880]  Each of us have power.
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:28.760]  Each of us are sovereign.
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:35.040]  And as Gandhi said, in the heart of each man and woman is the seed of the universe.
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:41.120]  And when we realize that each of us have a contribution to make to our own evolution
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:44.640]  and to the world and that we can and we must.
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:46.720]  That's the essence of consciousness.
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:50.560]  We're here alive, creating art, loving, living.
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:54.400]  It's the ultimate adventure towards Humphrey, towards Humphrey.
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:56.880]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, my friend.
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:04:58.600]  Please, let me do tonight.
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:04:59.600]  I love you.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:00.600]  I'll talk to you later.
[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:01.600]  Thank you, brother.
[2:05:01.600 --> 2:05:02.600]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:08.240]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:10.040]  iodine available.
[2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:18.640]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine,
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:20.880]  environmentally clean conditions.
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:29.080]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit
[2:05:29.080 --> 2:05:30.360]  deep in the Earth.
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:34.880]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:39.200]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:41.320]  It's the new formula.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:43.600]  Experience the ancient purity.
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.040]  Shield your family.

[2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:07.520]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Groot, master herbologist and chief formulator behind the InfoWarsLife
[2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:08.520]  products.
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:12.800]  So, Groot, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking superfemale vitality?
[2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:17.720]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from supermale vitality, from emails to even
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:19.600]  excited callers on the radio.

[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:39.560]  When he brought me home, the bottle's superfemale, it had tons of energy, tons of motivation,
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:40.560]  a lot of drive.
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:42.560]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:44.960]  Our relationship, all I can say, it's just a lot better now.
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:49.320]  I've just started taking superfemale vitality from infowarslife.com.

[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:05.200]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order.
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:08.280]  New Genics and all the other issues covered here at infowars.
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:11.080]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:12.720]  If not, then I want to know why.
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:15.320]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:19.640]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, are so poppers.
[2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:20.640]  I say, so what?
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:23.160]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:26.560]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:30.840]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:35.240]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:36.240]  years.
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:37.240]  And I'm still fighting.
[2:07:37.240 --> 2:07:39.880]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:41.760]  The Info War is worldwide.
[2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:46.040]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.

[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  in the heart of the Resistance, in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  I think we need to recognize that you're being persecuted, or it could happen to all of us.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  What do you say on that front? I know you're in court now. What can you say about vacation?
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  We'll move on to your new film.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Sure. I exceeded the campaign finance limit by giving $20,000 to my longtime friend Wendy Long,
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  who was running a really uphill, even an impossible campaign for the Senate.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  I should have set up a pack. There are many different ways to do it, so I made a mistake.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  But I think what's shocking to me is the way in which I see, not just my case, if I look nationwide,
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  the way in which the Obama administration has been recklessly circumventing the law
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  from the Defense of Marriage Act on through immigration,
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  turning the blind eye to guys on their own side who are doing shocking things.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  Here's Harry Reid diverting campaign finance funds to his daughter or granddaughter's wedding,
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  and no investigation, no prosecution.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  So this is a case where Lady Justice in the Obama administration appears to have taken the blindfold off,
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  and is kind of winking at her pals, and then kind of taken off after her enemies.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  Very well said. What can you say about your case, where it's going to release state for the film?
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  I mean, I hope that this doesn't derail your film.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  It absolutely won't do that. I have to appear before a judge in September to decide my fate.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  But the film comes out July 2nd. We actually opened in Houston and Atlanta, June 27th.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  That's kind of an early run. But the week of July 4th on Wednesday, July 2nd,
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Lionsgate is releasing this film into over a thousand theaters nationwide.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  So it's going to be a great 4th of July rocker, but it's also a 4th of July slap in the face
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  to the progressives, because it's a way of looking at what they've been doing to America.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  We normally expect anti-Americanism to come from the outside, from the Nazis,
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  or the Soviet communists, or maybe from some Iranian mullah.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  But the most vehement takedown of America is now occurring within this country,
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  and that's what this book and the film is intended to be an expose of.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  Undoubtedly, they're scared of this film.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  I mean, you're not tooting your horn to say that.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  I think we're just saying prima facie of facts here.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  But from your inside perspective, sir, do you agree with that statement A?
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  B, why do you think they're so scared of it?
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Well, I would say they should be scared.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And if they're not scared, they're going to be.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  2016 scared them a little bit, because in 2016, I went sort of into the world of Obama.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  I was at his family homestead.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  I flushed his brother out of the great third world slum in Nairobi.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  And that upset Obama.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  We know this for a fact, because Obama personally came out railing against 2016 on his website, BarackObama.com.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  Now, if they were scared of 2016, wait till they see America,
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  because America is a much more explosive, more powerful film.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  It brings the whole argument home.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  It's not just about Obama.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Obama and Hillary are in the film, but it's about this vast progressive movement,
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  which has in a sense made the long march through the institutions of elementary and secondary education,
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  academia, Hollywood, the media, national public radio, the mainline churches.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  So sometimes while the conservatives and Republicans are huddling and trying to figure out,
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  gee, how do we take back the Senate?
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  These guys have basically taken over the commanding heights of our culture,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  and they're conducting a relentless indoctrination campaign against our young people.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  They're doctoring American history.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  So the film blows the whistle on this whole menagerie.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  And you were talking about persecution of others.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  I mean, I've seen MSNBC.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  We played the clips.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  Say, good.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  Arrest the Tea Party.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  Good.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  Don't let them be politically involved.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  News is reported on Army memos at Fort Hood saying,
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  you could be court-martialed if you're part of the Tea Party or evangelical.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  I mean, this is stuff beyond Cuba, and they're just doing it out in the open, calling it liberal.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  I mean, I can't think of language strong enough to describe this group other than authoritarians.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  I mean, how would you describe them?
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  I do think that Obama has an authoritarian streak.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  I also think from what I now know about him, and I've talked to his relatives,
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  an incredibly mean-spirited and vindictive guy to give you a small example of how he is.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  When I was interviewing George Obama in Nairobi, I later talked to Obama's sister,
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  and she goes, well, you know, we're having George followed.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  The family is having one of its own siblings followed.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  And so there's a paranoid streak going on over there.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  They look at critics, not as well-meaning people who disagree with them,
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  but as enemies who have to be in some senses put out of business.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  And so I think this is a very dangerous mentality.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  You know, we didn't see it with Clinton, we wouldn't have seen it with Jimmy Carter.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Obama has, in a sense, represents a new low in American politics.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  He's up the ante.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  In fact, that was an article I think I saw in Variety.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  We can pull it up on screen for TV viewers, but radio listeners.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  About a month ago, didn't his Obama's brother back out of the film because of threats?
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  Yeah, this was his other brother, Mark.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  So Obama's brother George is living in third world poverty,
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  but Mark went to Stanford in Emory Business School and now lives in China.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  He's an entrepreneurial guy.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  By the way, he's very pro-business.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  He and Obama had a big fight over Obama's dad.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Obama idolized the dad that he never knew.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  This other fellow, Mark, who lived with the dad said,
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  no, this guy's a terrible guy.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  He's an alcoholic.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  He beats my mother.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  So Obama has grown up in a fantasy world,
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  and he's never escaped the fantasy because he's been coddled all his life by sicker fans
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  and people who've told him what a genius he is.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  So he's finally come to believe it.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  He does stuff thinking he has an unerring political instinct like this Bergdahl thing.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Then it jumps up to bite him and then he needs the media to start covering for him.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  So when an incredibly embarrassing political situation nationwide,
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  we've got a total embarrassment in the White House,
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  but no one can really say that because so many people in our press
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  won't want the first African-American so desperately to succeed
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  that they're, in a sense, in a shameful task of covering up for him.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  And they are scared of your film, undoubtedly.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  The good news is, the books are already out,
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  and I believe it's available now.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  I just got my copy this morning, so I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  Tell us about Dinesh D'Souza's new book, America,
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  Imagine a World Without Her.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  Okay, we just lost Dinesh.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  Well, the book actually is The Intellectual Spine.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  Hello?
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  It's okay, Dinesh. Your Skype was breaking up a little bit.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  Go ahead and start over about your book.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  Yeah, I was saying the book is The Intellectual Spine for the film.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  And it takes on the central argument of American progressivism,
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  which is that the wealth of America, including your wealth,
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  mine, and all the stuff we have in our house,
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  all this stuff right here is based on theft.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And this is an audacious, outrageous argument,
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  but the whole idea is that everything we got is stolen.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  We stole the country from the Native Americans.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  We stole the labor of the African-Americans.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  We stole half of Mexico. Capitalism is theft.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  So this idea is based on the notion that the federal government
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  now is doing nothing more than restoring stolen goods.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  It has every right to take our stuff,
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  because our stuff doesn't really belong to us.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  Obama and Elizabeth Warren and all these characters
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  have been hammering this argument now for six years.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  And it hasn't really been argued, it hasn't been taken on head-on.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  So that's what I do in the book.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  I answer this wealth critique,
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  and I make a moral defense of America and the free market.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  Well, I haven't read the book yet, and I haven't seen the film,
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  but when I saw the trailer before you were indicted,
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  I mean, I got a pretty clear guess of where it was going
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  to really look at all the different sides,
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  but to also point out, this was the age of conquest
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  when this country got formed.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  It was all different sides battling each other,
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  different Native groups against other Natives,
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  the French with one Native group, the British with another,
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  the Spanish.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  I mean, it was just ongoing.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  There were six flags over Texas.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  You know, the American system was better than all the others.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  That's why it prevailed in an age of barbarism,
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  and I don't romanticize it,
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  except for the fact that in an age of squalor,
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  it was heads above the rest,
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  and the ideas of freedom were never fully realized then,
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  and still haven't been realized,
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  but the attempt to realize them created the greatest liberty
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  and productivity the world's ever seen.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  The idea of wealth creation is itself an invention.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  Historically, people got wealth by taking it from other people.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  It reminds me when I was a kid, in India,
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  I'd go to school with like 10 marbles in my pocket.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  None of us had any money,
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  so the only way to get more marbles
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  was to take somebody else's marbles.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  America came up with a different idea,
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  which is that you can make stuff,
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  you can make silicon out of sand,
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  so you can, through innovation and technology
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  and creativity, generate new wealth.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Now, when the white man came to America,
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  and by the way, people often blame America for Columbus
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  and for the Spanish conquistadors
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  and for what the British did,
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  let's remember that Columbus came in 1492.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  That's 200 years before America.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  So America gets saddled with all these crimes
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  that preceded America,
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  and yet when the Europeans came here,
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  every Indian tribe,
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  just about every Native American tribe
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  that was occupying land,
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  had in fact seized that land by force from somebody else.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  So that this conquest ethic, as you very aptly call it,
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  was on both sides,
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  and what America brought into the world
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  was an alternative to conquest.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  So what's going on in our schools
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  is what I call the shaming of America,
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  and it's a progressive left-wing scheme
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  to rip off America.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  You need to shame people and make them feel a sense of guilt
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  so you can slam them up against the wall
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  when you come to take their TV and their couch and their car.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  You then accuse them of having stolen goods,
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  and this is sort of the racket
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  that I'm blowing the whistle on in this book and in this film.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  Exactly. They project all of these distorted crimes,
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  some of which happened, some of which didn't,
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  on people hundreds of years later.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  I mean, that's beyond the authoritarian idea
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  of your neighbor steals something in the old Soviet Union,
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  so you get sent to the gulag, too.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  It's beyond that. It's so outrageous.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  And now, 7 billion Third World people,
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  if we took the smartest and the best of the world
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  from all over the planet, from Japan to India,
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  from Russia to Germany to Mexico,
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  from Africa to, you know, Nigeria, wherever,
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  that would be great like Switzerland has done.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  But instead, if you're poor and have leprosy,
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  or you want to have your baby for free,
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  or you're poor, put your kid on a plane,
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  Obama will take them.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  This is like a military attack,
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  and now we have a federal judge today saying,
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  Obama's not enforcing the law,
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  and another 230,000 kids are on the way.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  Mr. D'Souza, this appears to be a fallout.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  This is so over the top.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  I can't even believe this is happening.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  You know, I'm an immigrant, and I always, I love America.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  As an immigrant, I always knew I was coming
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  from the corner of the world to the center.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  I always came here to embrace the American dream
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  and the American way of life.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  Far from sort of turning America
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  into a sort of ethnic smorgasbord,
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  I always wanted to assimilate
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  to the high principles of America.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  And what's strange now is the way in which
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  what the Obama people seem to do
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  is they don't seem to want productive,
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  creative immigrants who are going to, in a sense,
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  pull the wagon.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  They want guys who are going to come and sit in the wagon.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  That's because that's their people.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  And so we are living in a morally inverted society
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  in which Obama goes to the people sitting in the wagon.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  He goes, you're the most morally wonderful people in America.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  And he looks at all the people pulling the wagon,
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  and he goes, you're greedy, you're selfish,
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  you're materialistic, you got to pull harder.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  So think of what this does to America's morale.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  It basically convinces people who are pulling the wagon.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  Gee, maybe I should go sit in the wagon
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  because life seems to be a lot more comfortable in there.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  Isn't this classic Cloward and Piven?
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  I mean, I know Cloward and Piven came out in the 60s,
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  but the communists and socialists
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  had always wanted to collectivize farms
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  to control the population and control the food.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  I mean, it was always about control.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  And really, I mean, I think the evidence is overwhelming.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  They want to wreck the economy to then control it.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  They want to break eggs to make an omelet
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  to quote Joseph Stalin.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  You know, I think where the Republicans are out to lunch
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  is that they say, oh, you know,
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  all these liberals there, you know what?
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  They're well-meaning.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  It's just that their policies don't work.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  And then we get lengthy exegesis about how
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Obamacare doesn't work and the capitalist system is good
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  and too much regulation is bad.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  Look, the thing we don't realize is that
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  progressivism is driven by very powerful human motives,
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  primarily the motive of envy.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  Obama is seeds with envy and resentment.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  Part of the reason is he doesn't want to live in a society
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  where the entrepreneur is at center stage.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  The entrepreneur has skills that Obama does not even begin to have.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  Obama couldn't even begin to invent the iPhone.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  In fact, the guy can't even put up a website.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  But Obama does have other skills
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  as he can work up a mob.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  He knows how to mobilize resentment through his community organizing
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  or resentment organizing skills.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  So Obama would like to see a transfer of power
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  away from the productive entrepreneurial class
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  toward the resentful intellectual and political class.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  And most people don't see that.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  They think that he's basically trying to divide up the pie fairly.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  But it was a Linsky who instructed Obama and even Hillary,
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  listen, always go after power, but pretend to care about morality.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  Master the language of fairness,
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  so you can get everybody to go into a stupor.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  And in the meantime, you relentlessly engage
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  in a Machiavellian pursuit of power.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  I think we're coming full circle,
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  because obviously the American system wasn't perfect.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  If you study the real history from the French, German, British,
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  Native American perspective,
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  I mean, it's pretty much what you're putting in your book,
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  coming out in your film, it's just the reality
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  of looking at the time people lived,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  that it was a free market system mixed with the old conquest.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  But it was revolutionary that we were bringing the flower,
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  the tail into the Renaissance, the Enlightenment
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  into a new world where the frontier could be pushed away from government
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  where real freedom could flourish
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  and everybody wanted to come here from around the world
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  because you could transcend your caste,
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  transcend the group that you had to be what your dad was
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  if you grew up in Italy, say, where you grew up in Germany,
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  and you could be whatever you could really do
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  and it was about what you stood for in a free market.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  They're now calling it liberalism,
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  but it's the opposite of Jefferson
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  because it truly is mob rule
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  and ideology over true free market.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  It is the purest, most sickening gangsterism I've ever seen.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  I gotta say, sir, I've seen a lot of interviews with you,
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  had you on the broadcast before, but since you've been persecuted,
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  you've gotten more focused, more hardcore,
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  and when we're facing the radicalism of the kleptocratic authoritarian left,
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  we need to raise our rhetoric to the level of reality,
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  and you've been very gentlemanly, very scholarly in a lot of shows I've seen.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Lately you've been on fire,
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  and I think that's because you've now gone through a new level of persecution
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  and I think if the socialists think that we're weak,
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  they have no ideas, they try to really persecute us,
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  what is going to happen?
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  What do you predict for America's future?
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  Do you think now truly seeing the face of socialism and progressivism
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  that we could have a new golden era of Americana again?
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  I certainly think that we can beat these guys.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  You know, when I was in college,
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  my professor once told me about the story of the lion tamer and the lion,
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  and so here's the lion tamer with his little stick rancing around,
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  and he gets the lion to do exactly what he wants.
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  But the professor said, wait a minute, Dinesh,
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  who is more powerful, the lion tamer or the lion?
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  In reality, the lion is more powerful,
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  but the lion doesn't know that.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  So the progressives are the lion tamer.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  They think they have us intimidated and cowed,
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  they think we're going to do whatever they want,
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  but we need to realize that the real power is with us.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  We actually outnumber them,
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  and if we'll be organized and fight smart in the way that they do,
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  we'll crush them.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  So yes, I have to some degree,
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  if they've been trying to silence me,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  they've picked on the wrong guy,
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  because that's not going to work with me,
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  and it only redoubles my enthusiasm to be determined and outspoken
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  in speaking my point of view.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  So yes, this film is going to be a real weapon
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  if she will win the war of ideas,
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  and they have every reason to be alarmed,
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  because when people go in the theater and see this film,
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  they're going to be blown away by the hidden history of America
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  that is factual but is excluded from the textbooks,
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  and the progressives don't want us to know it.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  Yeah, I mean, I'm part Native American myself,
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  so I'm not demonizing them,
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  but they would come on the East Coast and say to both sides,
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  the French or the British,
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  if you don't help us,
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  we're going to wage war on you and destroy 20 towns.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  I mean, you're going to help us go kill this other group of natives,
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  because they were acting just like Europeans,
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  people are just people,
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  and just to deify Native Americans and act like they're God
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  is just another progressive fraud.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  Dinesh to susan.com,
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  is that the best place for folks to find the book online, sir?
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Yeah, the book's available on Amazon.com.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  Certainly, Dinesh to susan.com for all kinds of information.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  Our movie, America, the movie.com,
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  and look for it July 2nd.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Alright, Dinesh, we're out of time.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  Promise to come back when the film comes out.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Love to do it, Alex.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  A true political prisoner.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  Thank you so much, sir.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  They want to make him a political prisoner, folks.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  He's a cause to live for the First Amendment.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  Dinesh to Susan, God bless you.
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  Thank you so much. We'll be back.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  In the near future.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  When you realize how fake it all is,
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  the football, the basketball.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  Security, alert.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  This is Homeland Security.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  Analysis, info wars,
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  building independence, media operation.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  You let the worst people get controlled
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  The Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  They are never going to stop.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  until we stop them.

[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy.
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  Get electrically, it's for God you can fail it.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:28.000]  Look it up.
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  If men are more interested in online gaming
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  than they are in their wives,
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  had their drinking water contaminated.
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  in our drinking water?
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  you can take to protect you and your family
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  At least once a week.
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:13.000]  In the Councils of Government, we must guard against
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  whether sought or unsought,
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  by the Military Industrial Complex.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days,
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  rolling through your neighborhood.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis,
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  do not be alarmed.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  We will take all weapons.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  And Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  in a vastly different way.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  on a huge ammo buying spree.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  MSKSLA News 12 Jeff Beall discovered that clergy would help
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  Somebody else made that happen.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky,
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  but this is only a drill.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  I am inside.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  I have two words for you.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Predator gloves.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  You will never see it coming.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras,
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in,
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running,
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  and we're not backing down if you want to come and take them.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  We are on the march.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  The Revolution is there for you.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  To stop too far.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Live the way they have to live.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Live all the hate that's going there.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  All right, folks, we've got the Las Vegas Police Department and Sheriff's Department clips here.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  And the globalists have been building up a war.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  They've been building up tanks, helicopters, weapons,
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  literally drilling against George Washington himself in the training manuals,
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  bad-mouthing the founding fathers.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  The founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in the military.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  You're not a communist, you're not good.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  There's a lot of pressure in these countries, a lot of unstable people.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  And Jared and Amanda Miller were the classic type that wanted to be somebody kind of like natural-born killers.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  If you believe the picture put on the internet that anybody could be framed with.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  I personally have had people put up fake websites of me, fake audio, edited video.
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  So I've been through this a lot.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  I don't just believe a criminal government that staged fast and furious and so many other events,
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  and that funds Al Qaeda.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  But they are now all over the news.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Type my name into Google and try to connect me, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, you name it, to this.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  And they were doing it last night before anything was even found.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  And now they're saying, yes, they were at the Clive and Bundy Ranch.
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  And yes, they're part of the white supremacist sovereign citizen.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  They mixed white supremacist in with sovereign citizen.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  And then that's a label they put on anybody that's basically not left of Lenin.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  So here is a clip of that press conference.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  I don't want to open the phones up to you out there to get your take on what you think about this.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  While, again, honeybees kill 200-something people, wasps kill hundreds of people every year,
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  deer jumping out in front of cars, kill over 300.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  I mean, you know, cops, number one cause of death being died and automobile accidents are being hit while they're writing tickets.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You know, they're gangbangers that shoot cops for no reason.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  You know, cops, not one of the most dangerous professions, not like a Navy diver or something,
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  but it's going to be a dangerous profession.
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  I don't want that job, especially with the type of federalization you've got, what they're being told to do.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  But I've said it before.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  I mean, as for a restoration of this republic, a intellectual velvet revolution,
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  the police, even though we see bad videos of them and bad examples and bad apples,
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  despite all the things the system is doing, they've been bucking the system.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  And they're more pro-gun than the general public by light years.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  They're more aware of what's going on because they understand criminology and things,
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  especially cops that have been in a while, you know, who aren't just not writing tickets.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  And the military is the most await group.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  I mean, just 80-plus percent.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Then you've got the police.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  I mean, I got to say 50, 60, 70 percent, maybe higher.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  Secret service.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  I mean, if I'm in a restaurant, there's secret service in there.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  I can't stop them by me, food and drinks, federal, Marshall, same deal.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  And then you're like, I'm getting mad at these people all day talking about them.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  And they're all, oh, we know, we know.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  I mean, I was down at the federal building for the JFK thing.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  And the feds were like, wait a minute, hey, Alice, we like to show in the security guard,
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  federal security police, actually police and all those other things.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  But it didn't matter.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  So they hired a group of thug auxiliary bouncers in dressed like six foot four guys on average,
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  dressed up in sheriff's department outfits that are openly Democratic party to literally beat people up.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  For no reason, just so they could, you know, so, so I've said this to everybody.
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  I know people are mad about the system, bad about the corrupt courts, mad about not being able to pay your bills.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  And then the cop pulls you over and gives you a ticket, whatever.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  That's no reason to kill somebody if this was real.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  It has a lot of signs that could have been staged.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  I don't know.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  But you people want to lose for the new world order.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  And the globalists, they will start when the globalist stage more of this or wind people up to do this.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  And the cops are getting more brutal to liberty movement.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  If the public goes crazy when that happens, it'll be a civil war.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  So I would tell the police, I think most departments are smart enough to know this.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  If you go out picking fights with people that are in the tea party, picking fights with people that are in the liberty movement,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  who statistically are the most law abiding citizens out there, you can pull those numbers up.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  You're going to have some kind of comic book character.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  DC Comics type.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  Goth, Pib, and I'm not against Goth or Pibs, but you know what I mean, that I mean, look at most of mass shooters have been into Goth death and comic books
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  and shoot them up video games and nihilism and drug culture.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  And this guy's Facebook and his other pages on PlanetInfoWars.com, that's what they basically said they were into.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  They were desperate. They felt disempowered. They felt powerless.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  And so they went out and found some Las Vegas cops to kill.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  Give you believe the official story, but again, we don't know if it's true or not.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  The most senseless, pointless, mindless, stupid, loser, just the worst thing you could do.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  I mean, why not start following Harry Reid around to his different lunches and stuff and call yourself press, you are,
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  start a website, put advertising on it, use the enemy's own system, Google ads on it, and finance yourself exposing them peacefully.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  And I mean, they'll hate you. There's nothing they can do because there's too many of us.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  You know what's happened in Harry Reid's territory, it happened right after the Bundy Ranch thing.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  You know they'd pull something. I said they're going to pull a false flag, probably shooting cops.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  And I know I said that probably since Bundy Ranch thing a hundred times in the last couple of years,
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  300, 400, 500 times, you've all heard it at nauseam. I'm sure you're sick of hearing it.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  We'll find the clips. We found some of them, but not the specific ones.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  Because if I was the globalist who are willing to stage all these other false flags,
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  I would have black ops grab these people out of their houses to set up patsies because they fit a profile with their emails,
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  get them in the back of a truck, march them into the Walmart, shoot them both in the head,
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  have an inside job security guy in the Walmart turn the security camera off in that area.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  This is just one way to do it. I'm not saying this is how it was done. This is just one way to do it.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  And then you have people, I bet they were dressed up, whoever did it. That's the disguise.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  The joker and the lady shoot the cops, then go in and shoot one more for good measure.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  And then right at the same time, you know, one minute later, again, they don't even know why they're there,
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  they get shot in the head. Or maybe they're drugged and you bring them in.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  Or maybe they're organically produced by the Sikh society. I don't know.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  But because some guy wants to dress up in a clown outfit and kids and Mr. Skinny outfits,
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  just because they want to do that and then go around killing people,
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  I don't need to lose my butcher knives at my house because you've got kids all over the country.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  Let me find the article right here. Going around killing people, saying they're doing it for,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  there it is, Wisconsin girl stabs 19 times by friends.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  At least hospital after telling family she wanted to live.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  And then again, they do it because of the comic book character, the slender man, the skinny man.
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  And then a 12-year-old stabbed all this stuff.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  The guy with the Hunger Games director supposedly killed six people and then himself seven.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Three of them were stabbed. That was like buried in the news. Who knows if any of this is real?
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  And you notice Diane Feinstein has introduced a bill to get family members to rat on each other over guns.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  And if a family member just says they're concerned about it, not even that you made a threat, your guns are gone.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  It's the end of the Second Amendment. Feinstein and Boxer introduced Bill to a rat out family member with a firearm exploiting
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  Isla Vista's shooting in a new bid to confiscate firearms for American citizens.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  California Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer are exploiting the shooting in a new bid.
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  The Pause for Safety Act will allow families, this guy had the police call like five times on him, all sorts of stuff.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  They've been saying he was going to kill people. Do you even believe it? Families and others to seek gun violence prevention order
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  in court will allow police to confiscate firearms for people who have not committed a crime and may not necessarily pose a threat
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  who have made threats. I mean, that is just such a big deal.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  What is your take on this latest event and the fact that yours truly is now being blamed by the usual Democratic Party front grips?
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  I mean, how are they going to try to set me up?
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  They're only trying to put Dinesh D'Souza, he has multiple charges, each one of them I think carries five years.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  One of the charges carries 10. I know I read that. This guy's facing all these years in prison
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  because he publicly went and got four of his friends to bundle and give $20,000 to a lady in an uphill battle in the Senate
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  running against for Hillary Clinton seat in New York. They went all these years to come after him and he's like,
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  I must have made a mistake because you can go set up a pack and give a million dollars.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  I mean, they're literally legalizing all the illegals and saying, come here if you have poor kids, just have your kids, whatever, that's fine.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  But Dinesh D'Souza is facing prison. He'll just make his film bigger. It'll just backlash against you.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  I want to hear from folks out there. You don't want to hear from first, forget the number round.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  What if you're a police officer? I mean, what do you think about this?
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  I mean, statistically, they want you to be totally afraid where you shoot citizens for no reason.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  Everybody's trying to kill you every minute.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  I mean, statistically, your chances of having someone randomly walk in and shoot you are just astronomical.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  What are the couple million cops total in this country?
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  A little over two million police. It's gone from less than a million ten years ago.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  And you might have, what, a few dozen a year that randomly get shot, usually by gangs.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Most of it happens in like Oakland and Chicago.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  And then now they're going to say the Tea Party's behind this and try to start some fad.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  I mean, do you agree with me or disagree with me?
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  Military. I'll give them back to duty military as well.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  I mean, have you heard me on air say this was coming?
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  Even if it's not staged hyping that people are going to start killing cops everywhere,
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  randomly, the Tea Party is, is putting the idea out there, folks.
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  800-259-9231. 800-259-9231.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  800-259-9231 will take calls in this next segment, one segment of overdrive and that's it.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  Briefly, please do not forget that this entire transmission is supported by the wonderful listeners out there
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  who stand for nonviolence, unlike the people they're demonizing right now, whether they do it or not.

[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  And it's changed my life, the nation I had, that was proprietary, turns blue with the actual purple crystals.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  The first type we have, we have the new type that no one else has from 7,000 to 12,000 feet in a U.S. mine
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  that is the purest form of iodine known to be out there.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  The pure crystals put into the palm oil organic solution that is unbelievable.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  For me personally, what it's done for my memory, my way I feel everything, you've heard the rave reviews.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  There's video of Rob Dew at the factory in Arizona at the laboratory that we gave you a tour of
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  Friday when David Knight did a great job sitting in co-hosting the show.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  It's incredible. Survival Shield X2.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  And regardless, when you purchase a bottle of it, you are supporting the transmission.

[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  From the research I've seen, it just blocks the estrogen mimicry and helps get your glands going like they should.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  Amazing.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  By the time I take a big swig of it right when the show ends or during this break, I'm taking it right now.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  I already had my Super Mill Vitality at about 5.30 this morning when I got up.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  I had a lot of stuff to do this morning.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  But I'm going to take some right now because it is absolutely awesome.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  And we just cheerfully go in through and beyond into the New World Order Black Hole here.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  And it really is up to you out there how fast we grow and what we're able to do.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  I'm fully committed.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  So I'm saying energize, spread the word, support our local sponsors, become a local sponsor for local AM and FM stations.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Let's get aggressive and value this type of uncompromising, hardcore, truth-based, liberty-based system.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  Media Matters, White House Run, Alex Jones alleges that Las Vegas cop ambush was absolutely staged by Harry Reid and other conspirators.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  Now I said my gut tells me it's absolutely staged.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  That's in quotes, absolutely staged.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  I'm not specifically saying Harry Reid did anything.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  We all know he's a sweet little old man who walks all ladies across the street.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  You've seen airline magazines for $29.95, but today it's yours free.

[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Again, 1-800-478-9638.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  In the near future.
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  Alert, security, alert.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  This is Homeland Security.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  Analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Prime Directive did credit Alex Jones.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  They are never going to stop.
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  Block free iPhone app at infowars.com.
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  Imperatives, destroy Britain's planet TV.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Electrally it's for God you can fail it.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  Well, Charity loves company when it comes to demonizing people.
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  Raw stories now demonizing my shelf.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  And Breitbart.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  So Breitbart thought they'd totie up and run some of the disinfo that I've been promoting violence and stuff.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  And now they're being set up.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  See how that works, trying to be friends with the Democrats?
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  I mean the Democrats, folks, I've always been nonpartisan.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  They're trying to take over right now.
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  And they're authoritarians and look at how they screw poor people.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Rabbit, Julie, Jerry and Roger.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  And again, when I don't want police to call in or I don't ask them to, we get full lines of police.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  I don't think any police have been able to get through or called in.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  I want to get their take on this, but America's filled with a lot of weirdos now.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  And when the depression fully hits, it won't be like the 1920s and 30s, folks.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  This country's a time bomb.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  And if I was the police, I wouldn't be trying to follow media matters, White House spin to have war with the Tea Party and the veterans.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  They want to sit back while we all kill each other.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  Let's just not do it.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  And again, I'll say it for the probably the 500th time.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  You don't go out and kill police.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  Yes, that's something that the French resistance did to Nazi police in France.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  But that's not, our police aren't Nazis.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  They're misguided in many cases.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  They're globalist control, just like the bank down the street might be.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  You don't go shoot the teller because, you know, Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan is corrupt.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  I mean, it's the same deal.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  It's insane.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  Let's go to Rabbit in Wisconsin.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  What's your take on all this?
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  My take on this biggest shooter, along with what happened in Waukesha, is how you were saying earlier.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  It's all MK Ultra, MK Naomi, mixed in with St. Danik's session.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  And it's reflecting the culture we created and we're reflecting right back into it.
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  Yeah, I see women just everywhere with cuts all over their arms now.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  I know cutting's been big for a while, but it's getting epidemic.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  I mean, am I to blame for that?
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  I mean, it's just a bunch of weirdness going on.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  And can you imagine if a full board of depression hits and the welfare checks don't make it?
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  Can you imagine the explosion that's going to happen?
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  Of course, I'll be blamed.
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  Well, these type of things are just going to happen more and more often until it's just so overwhelming.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  And then people will just bend over backwards and accept any sort of panacea the government dishes out.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  And I think that's what they're setting the stage for.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  It's important to stay calm and level-headed and really kind of focus in on getting yourself right,
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  getting your family right and making sure you're not only prepared, but you're at peace.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  I mean, imagine walking into a pizza place cold-bloodily and just shooting two people in the back of the head.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  I appreciate your call.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Of course, imagine burning up a church full of little kids at Waco because you wanted to kill their parents.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  I mean, it's evil.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  Waco's wrong. This is wrong.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Julie in California, go ahead.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  This whole thing just stinks.
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  I mean, the guy who apparently did this, Jared Miller, you know, he had, I guess he cultivated marijuana.
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  He was on probation.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  He did jail time, I guess in 2013.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  It's all on his Facebook page.
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  You're going to have gang mentality people that latch onto the patriot movement.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  It's inevitable.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:59.000]  Just like gang people get in the military or just like a cop ran around, you know, in California shooting people.
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  It doesn't mean all cops are responsible for Dorner.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  Go ahead.
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  Not, but I mean, they're trying to, they're trying with a broad rush to paint everybody the same color.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  And it can't work. It cannot work.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  The NRA has really got to get out and get ahead of this message and say, hey, look, this, there's a problem here.
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  No, the message is a crazy guy with a gun killed a bunch of cops
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  and shut down Southern California.
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  Cops aren't to blame.
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  Next, even if it's true, crazy guy, whether it's stage or not, sure stinks like it, shoots two cops.
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  You know, not everybody in the Tea Party's fault.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  I mean, it's that simple.
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  We don't let them cause a civil war.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  That's the goal.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  That's the goal.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  Overdrive coming up.
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  Thank you, Julie.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  Paul, Roger and Jerry.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  We're going to jam you all in.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  Maybe we have time.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  Back in 70 seconds, overdrive.
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  Fluoride.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  Unbound.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  Clean.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  In a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  I take it every day.

[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:57.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  Network.
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Big Brother.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:08.000]  Mainstream media.
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  Government cover-ups.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Well, anyone right of Satan, if you use the left-right false paradigm,
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  is now in connection to the shooters who dressed up like comic book characters.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  Nobody will talk about that.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  Why do people keep dressing up like that when they kill people?
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  Let's go to Roger in Nevada.
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  You're on the air.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  Go ahead.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  I have the Las Vegas Newsroom on newspaper in front of me.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  And they have right here.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  It says, two Las Vegas officers bystanders slain.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  It says, shooters and ambushed, spoke of white supremacy.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  They started to kill police.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  It said they were showing a revolutionary war-era flag.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  And what they're trying to do is they're trying to tie this into
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  that all of us, you know what I think, are guilty.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  You know, they're trying to accuse all of us who enjoy freedom.
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  You know what I think?
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  They're trying to spin us off that we're the bad guys, which we're not.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Well, the White House is freaking out about this with Media Matters right now
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  and saying that I said Harry Reid did it.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  I'm saying he runs that area.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  He stands to gain.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  He's been involved in fast and furious.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  I think they are suspects.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  In bare minimum, like we find out with this last shooter out in California,
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  knowing something was going on and doing nothing.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  I mean, this is the opportune timing of this.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  If a group stage falls flags before, then there's suspects in every new event.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  It's that simple, basic criminology.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  That's all I have to say.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  Good points.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  Roger, Jerry in Georgia, you're on the air.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Hey, Alex, I called.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  I told them that if you go to these guys' hometown newspaper, the Lafayette newspaper,
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  it's got the guy's whole rap sheet.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  He's been up for drug charges, criminal recklessness, battery charges.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  Battery was strangled.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  No, I know.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  I've seen it.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  He pitched the M.O. of an informant sent to the Bundy Ranch and then set up in a drill.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  Go ahead.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  No, my point is, instead of the headline saying, Violent Expelling Drug Dealer Shoots Two Cops,
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  they skewed the headline to what they wanted to say.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  Oh, I agree.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  And we need to get a big article out exposing all this.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  I mean, are police to blame for Dorner?
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  And Alex, if you Google Chicago Weekend Shootings, there were 30 shootings with three dead in Chicago this weekend.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  Hey, that's a good point.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  30 dead in Chicago shootings, media ignores to blame Vegas on Tea Party.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  There's your headline right there.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  All you have to do is Google the major cities where there are strict gun laws.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  Every Monday, they have the weekend shooting tally.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  But this is something they can use so it's got national news.
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  No, exactly.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  Yep, there is the NBC headline Chicago 30 shot for fatally in weekend Chicago violence, but because that's gang related.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Oh, it's an on issue.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  We can't blame Alex Jones.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  But oh my gosh, we got a guy on a clown outfit.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  It must be Alex Jones's fault.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  I mean, I'm getting so sick of this.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  And I've caught him before planting stuff and making stuff up.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  I don't know if that's the case here, but I mean, you know, we reached 20 million people a week.
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  There are going to be some bad people that listen, but my gut tells me this stinks.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  I mean, CJ, give me your honest opinion in there.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  I mean, does this smell to you?
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  It smells a little bit, but you know, somebody going nuts.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  It's a little plausible.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  But like you said before, should we should we arrest all police though?
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  Because Dorner would kill people.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  Sure, why not?
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  We've got gels big enough.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  Yeah, I think that's the answer.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  Because I mean, anyway, it slides that it's the sick culture.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  And a guy that was institutionalized the whole time.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  All right, thank you.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Adults dressing up like comic book characters.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  Paul, what do you think exactly is the culture Paul in California?
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  What do you think real fast?
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  I just want to say this whole thing was sick.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  And it's, it's, it's set up.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  It looked like it set up.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  And hello.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  Now I'm listening to you, brother.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  Sorry.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  I like to say is all, all these other alternative news media that's online or whatever are going to be calling for a raw story.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  Like you said earlier, I looked at the story, had your name on it.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  Ron Paul's name on it.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  And they said this guy had, they put a gas and flag on the, on the cops.
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  I find that suspect at all.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  And all these, all the alternative media is going to be calling on that.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  It just reeks of frame up.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Reeks of frame up.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  Unbelievable.
