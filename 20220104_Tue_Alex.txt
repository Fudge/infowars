[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:22.000 --> 00:31.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  It's time we started standing up to all of these mandates.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  You remember when the government told us, when Tony Fauci told us that we were going to lockdown?
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  He said it was for two weeks, and now it's been almost two years.
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  And I'm going to tell you three things that you need to remember in this critical day and age.
[00:55.000 --> 01:04.000]  One is that once government acquires a power, it never lets it go voluntarily.
[01:04.000 --> 01:14.000]  The second thing that we need to know is that every power that government acquires using this pandemic as a pretence,
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  it will ultimately abuse to the maximum effect possible.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  And this is just a rule that is as certain as gravity.
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  The third thing that you need to know is that nobody has ever complied their way out of totalitarianism.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  Every time you comply, the demands will get greater and greater.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  We need to resolve, here and now, this is the hill that we need to die on.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  They have come for our jobs, they've come for our transport, now they're coming for our children.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And we have an obligation as parents to protect them.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  There has never been a government in history that has told its people,
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  we are going to demand that children sacrifice themselves and take risks to save old people.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  It's always the other way around.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  The old, the mature, the adults always put themselves at risk to protect their children.
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  This is an ethical issue, it's a moral issue, it's an issue of character for each of us.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  And it's an issue about the preservation of democracy and public health.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  We all need to stand up now and do everything that we can to block these power plays by authoritarian powers
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  that are trying to steal from us the health of our children.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  Well, that apple didn't fall too far from the tree.
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  Real presidential material, their real leadership, just like Bolsonaro, he's got balls.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  Bolsonaro survived that deadly stab attack that hit his liver and kidneys.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  He was running for president a few years ago, but it's hit him hard.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  They shot him and missed a shit at him and hit, as they said in Wisconsin.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  Wow, it is finally starting to dawn on everybody that the globalists have launched an economic, paramilitary,
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  martial law takeover designed to collapse civilization.
[03:31.000 --> 03:39.000]  And this is a globalist criminal vision that we are under and that that's the enemy and this is a new type of war.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  And we better figure out the new type of war, we better identify who's doing it to us,
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  or we don't have a chance in hell of stopping it.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  But the minute we realize we're under attack and who the enemies are, they are extremely weak.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  But if you continue to deny the New World Order and play their little mind games and let them deny,
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  you know, that all this is going on and to have national headlines out from the ADO and the New York Times going,
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  there's no such thing as mass psychosis.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  There's no such thing as mass formation psychosis.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  There's no such thing as mass.com syndrome.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  And then you have all the government documents admitting it.
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  So we've got so much to cover today, but the fight is on for the future.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  And know this, globalism is corporate tyranny.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  I'm not against corporations and companies, but they become governments and they become worse than governments and above the law.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  Think about the British East India Company as the model of this system we're under and study it.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  You'll understand everything we're facing because it is actually the same group that ran that,
[04:43.000 --> 04:55.000]  that is now the literal and cultural and corporate offspring and progeny of that British Empire project.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.000]  and freedom into the new year, while at the same time making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back in stock.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  Winter sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3, take it under the tongue for higher absorption is back in stock.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2, deeper crystal iodine, the game changer, the missing link,
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  not just for immune system, but all electrochemical activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  Give yourself a gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  50% off for a limited time. Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[06:02.000 --> 06:10.000]  Red-billing the planet in a multi-dimensional attack against tyranny.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Well, Morpheus is a fictional character in the 1999 hit movie with Keanu Reeves.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  Lawrence Fishburne and others.
[06:32.000 --> 06:40.000]  But all of you in the fight against the Matrix-like New World Order are Morpheus.
[06:40.000 --> 06:48.000]  This broadcast is here to awaken the general public and the mass that is the archetype of Neo.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very, very honored to be here.
[06:52.000 --> 07:02.000]  Let me tell you the giant stories we have for you today, the reports, the breaking news that all integrate together into one.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  There is a private corporate worldwide tyranny that has taken over, that is devaluing all the currencies to enslave and impoverish the population
[07:10.000 --> 07:20.000]  while giving themselves first use of the currency to buy up all infrastructure, including buy-off almost all the political minds that can be purchased.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  They are dissolving borders, they are dissolving institutions, they are dissolving western cities, they are dissolving western universities.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  They are dumbing down the youth, they are removing basic reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[07:32.000 --> 07:42.000]  In every western country, it is the globalist great reset to collapse civilization to then build the post-industrial pagan world
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  where children are exploited and only corrupt elite adults are allowed to have basic freedom.
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  An inversion of how the universe is supposed to work where adults fight and strive for our children instead of our children becoming a commodity
[07:58.000 --> 08:04.000]  or at birth, seven pounds of flesh to be used as the system sees fit.
[08:04.000 --> 08:13.000]  So here's all the giant interconnecting news as the clock ticks down and why I've been so upset on air, why I've been so angry on air.
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  I apologize to the listeners, I apologize to the crew, some of that's been happening, but it's 100% real and that's all I've got is the fact that I wear my art on my sleeve.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  The clock is ticking. They are already announcing and pre-programming and preparing.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  We've got the biggest developments yet on this front today. I will be covering at the bottom of the hour.
[08:33.000 --> 08:47.000]  Stage terror attacks and events ahead of the election in 308 days to bring in the police state that's already been established and already been rolled out under the offices of COVID-19
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  but to be directed towards everyone that's loyal to America, everyone that's loyal to our Bill of Rights and Constitution and our heritage,
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  an open declaration of war against all of us.
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  I told you that was coming years ago. It was in the government's own documents, even under Trump's nose it was unfolding and now it's in warp speed.
[09:08.000 --> 09:18.000]  We have that whole area. The New York Times says every day is January 6th now and the threat within is the American people and they must all be arrested.
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  Millions must be put, the prisons must be emptied of violent offenders and filled with the Trump supporters.
[09:27.000 --> 09:36.000]  But they really aren't Trump supporters, are they? They're America supporters and Trump was just a champion amongst that and I hope he continues at some levels to be that person.
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.000]  But we are not Trumpist. We are Americans.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  That's all coming up today.
[09:48.000 --> 10:04.000]  When the ongoing crimes freeze across the country as the lawlessness is implemented by design and where all that is leading us, Beverly Hills residents panic by guns amid massive unprecedented crime wave.
[10:04.000 --> 10:22.000]  And then we have the economic world inflation news that we're going to be getting to in great detail and the massive new intensified purging of the scorched earth censorship now expanding against millions of day being banned and taken down.
[10:22.000 --> 10:40.000]  New pedophile scandal news at CNN and so much more but let me now start getting into the big news up front and if we can let's put the live show feed headline up for TV viewers.
[10:40.000 --> 10:51.000]  I already had talked about this six months ago because already numbers were coming in preliminary from insurance companies in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK, Canada and the US.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  And these are numbers that are watched very, very closely and are amongst some of the best numbers you're going to find.
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  And it's not just one hundred billion dollar insurance company that's one of the largest.
[11:03.000 --> 11:22.000]  It scores them reporting record deaths amongst groups that normally were not dying at high levels of heart attacks of blood clots of aneurysms and of explosive cancers in the last year in 2021.
[11:22.000 --> 11:39.000]  We're now in 2022 on this Tuesday, January 4th broadcast. And that is at least a 40% increase in the death rate of ages 18 to 64.
[11:39.000 --> 11:54.000]  Or what they see as the working demographic, the main engine of the country, 18 to 64. Unbelievable.
[11:54.000 --> 12:12.000]  And it matches all the VAERS data and everything else we knew, less than a year into these injections. The largest death rate in recorded actuarial history in 150 years in the United States.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  And similar numbers are pouring in. In fact, they're worse because they're complying more in the UK, in Europe and Australia.
[12:19.000 --> 12:29.000]  Australia is reporting 76 confirmed adverse reactions, 76,000, including massive deaths in Australia.
[12:29.000 --> 12:37.000]  I have national Australian TV admitting it and the government paying out for the 76,000s.
[12:37.000 --> 13:01.000]  They say only the worst of the 76,000 get money. And remember, October of 2020, a year and three months ago, the CDC document admitting they were predicting massive myocarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, cancer.
[13:01.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's all listed. It's all listed because they were loading the gun with the bullets and getting ready to fire them in.
[13:10.000 --> 13:22.000]  I'm sorry, I said 77. It's 79,000 people suffered severe adverse reactions. Again, usually my mistake is that I somehow downgrade things.
[13:22.000 --> 13:34.000]  Sorry, 79,000. Some victims get 600,000 in cash who are paralyzed and or dead.
[13:34.000 --> 13:45.000]  Not much money for your life, but it's all devalued currency. So they're just pumping it all out, pumping it all out, pumping it all out to everybody.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  The next story alone we should spend the entire broadcast on, but it gets even worse.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  These are three stacks on the COVID takeover here. All of them just as hardcore as this.
[13:57.000 --> 14:05.000]  Look at this one. Manhattan DA closes investigation of Cuomo in 20 plus thousand known deaths in the nursing homes.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  Yeah, they weren't keeping the family out to keep them safe. They were killing them and getting 53,000 per murdered person.
[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  He's a damn ghoul. And the DA is liberal and said, good job.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  And it gets worse. New York City, New York State and 10 other states, now it's 11, all put out official policy reports saying it's true.
[14:28.000 --> 14:38.000]  What Harrison Smith and M4 war said in November of 2021, we're not going to give white people treatment for COVID because they're bad.
[14:38.000 --> 14:46.000]  And you, I mean, just think of the evil of that and the division and how it's meant to make white people hate black people.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  It's not black people on average that are running this, that are doing this.
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  It's the globalist creating divide and conquer that's in the emails from six years ago on WikiLeaks or five and a half years ago,
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  saying use culture war, expand the culture war. And this is a culture war.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  I guarantee you go out and you question 10,000 black people on the street and say, should black people be given preferential treatment on medical care of our white people?
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  And they'll say, hell no. But oh, don't worry, the liberals are doing it for them. They're not trying to give them real care.
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  We actually know in New York and other areas, they grab poor black people off the street as the number one group they take and intubate and murder and murder.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  They're murdering you while every TV commercial and ad I see has a black spokesperson of all these evil companies.
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  The globalist companies are like, hell, we're robbing everybody. Let's just put blackface on. That's what the companies have done.
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  Corporate blackface. You can see it while they slaughter your ass and everybody's asses.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  Folks, that's just three articles. It gets a lot worse. This is full on modern war, great reset.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  Wake up to it and say no or everybody's dead. Come on, let's wake up.
[15:59.000 --> 16:09.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year,
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  all at the same time, making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back in stock.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  Winter sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3, take it under the tongue for higher absorption is back in stock.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  Despite the fact that it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystal iodine, the game changer, the missing link,
[16:38.000 --> 16:44.000]  not as for immune system, but all electrochemical activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.

[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars live products.
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[17:26.000 --> 17:36.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  It is now back in stock.

[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  Welcome.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Go ahead.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  Good, bro.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Great last caller.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  All right.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  Go ahead.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Hey, Alex.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  I've been partaking my call.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  Get off the fence.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  Get the product.
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.000]  Support the info war.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Tyler in Maine.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  You're on the air.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  Thanks for rolling.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  Go ahead.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Hey, Alex.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's great to be on with you.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  It's an honor.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  Awesome.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  All right.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  It helps in the bedroom.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  So just number one.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  It definitely works.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  It's not a joke.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Absolutely.
[19:54.000 --> 20:23.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  I'm here live.
[20:30.000 --> 20:38.000]  Only place to find us is on 300, actually, plus AM&F and radio stations.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  And over 100 cable and TV stations that we know of.
[20:41.000 --> 20:42.000]  We're free to air.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  So a lot of what we know about.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  That's wonderful.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  And it's awesome.
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  You have permission to carry it all or a little bit of it or chop it up or do whatever
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  you want.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  We are free to air, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  That's where you find us.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  And a lot of them re-stream the show.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  It's great to share it from those stations because then they're not as censored as much
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  as we are on Facebook and Twitter.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  And then, of course, you can always find us at infowars.com or it's on a show.
[21:06.000 --> 21:12.000]  Or freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv that takes you to band.video.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  But band.video, its URL is banned in most places.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  But freeworldnews.tv is not the last time I checked.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  In fact, for about a year it has been the site.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  We'd have a month of 79 days of hell or we'd have an election 2020s and then they would
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  ban that URL.
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.000]  And now it was in the news yesterday that Deutsche Telekom that owns T-Mobile is banning hundreds
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  of sites including info wars, gateway pundit and others from you being able to send the
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  text but it's more sophisticated than that.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  In fact, reprint me that article I didn't cover yesterday, thank you.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  They don't tell you they're blocking the link.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  They just don't send it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  So it says it goes through but it shows up as invisible so the link's there but no one
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  knows it's there.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  The first time I saw that was 20 years ago whenever YouTube came out or 18 years ago
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  whatever it was and Yahoo didn't like the new up and coming company because Google hadn't
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  bought it yet.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  Little San Francisco company, two guys turned their garage and so we would try to send links
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  out on instant messenger to my producers and people of YouTube clips and they would block
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  it and wouldn't let you share it.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  But that was corporate infighting.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  This is what CNN called for two years ago was it's time to block Alex Jones, I'm the
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  test case of course, from being able to have his name or website texted over someone's
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.000]  phone and we need him blocked off email and now it's all here.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  There's no end to this.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  This isn't liberal censorship.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  This is a global corporate fascist authoritarian takeover.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  They're in a war bankrupting you, destroying your currency, annihilating your borders, demonizing
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  your heritage, pulling down statues of the founders of the nation.
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  A couple years ago it was Robert E. Lee, now it's Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  It's all happening.
[23:22.000 --> 23:30.000]  They are literally disappearing us and photoshopping us out of history, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  They always show the meme because it doesn't make sense if you don't show it.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  Go ahead and zoom out please.
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  See the meme doesn't make sense if you just show it with the guy there.
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  You got to show how famously they would photoshop people out of the Joe Stalin photos as he killed them
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  and pretty soon there would be nobody in the photos.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  They would republish them in the newspaper, oh look here Stalin as he tours this country
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  and then meanwhile all these groups and organizations have been disappeared.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  This is hardcore classical tyranny and I actually have that in my stack as well.
[24:09.000 --> 24:17.000]  We're going to be getting to coming up and so much more but it all ties in with the coming terror attacks.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  They're going to blame on us, blame on you, blame on loyal good Americans that aren't communist minions
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  and it ties into the coming mass culling that's already here.
[24:27.000 --> 24:36.000]  Major insurance companies reporting between 35 and 60% increase in deaths of 18 to 64
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  and the preliminary numbers are coming in now that's been going on in England for a few months
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  and here for a few months massive increases in deaths of five and ups
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  and now that it's rolling out against the newborns well they're dying too
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  and the US life expectancy is down by three years in just the last year.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  Yep you're not going to be retiring at 65 or 66 or 67 and getting that pension fund
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  because they're going to devalue all the currency and bankrupt everything
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  and they're going to kill you but you're the happy sweet TV head baby boomers
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  that had me, the Gen X and the baby boomers are pretty comfortable in a lot of ways
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  but as bad as they are Gen X has its own problems and boy the millennials
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  they're either super awake or super in the matrix
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  and don't care about anything and just think you order DoorDash and watch TV
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  and that's how the universe works they are in for such a rude awakening
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  we are being mopped up we're being exterminated we're being killed in front of each other
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  and we're not doing anything about it on a mass scale
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  like Klaus Schwab giggles and laughs and says we deserve to what?
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  We deserve to die.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  Remember in Goldfinger James Bond says to him
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  do you expect me to talk when he's got him strapped down with a laser aimed at him
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  he goes no Mr. Bond I expect you to die
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  they want the world for themselves they want the technology for themselves
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  they don't want to fly over and see power lines and smokestacks and farms and everything else
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.000]  and some of it is ugly I get it but to the globalist aesthetics of royalty
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  and the rest of them they want you dead so they can drive around their yachts by themselves
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  they want you gone and you know what they're bad and they're evil
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  and their control freaks and their pedophiles and their scum
[26:34.000 --> 26:41.000]  but they see a weakness and they see a mark and they see a sucker and they see a soft target
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  and so they can't help it they're predators and you keep acting like lobotomized sheep
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  you're gonna get hurt and you're gonna get hurt real real bad
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  and the more computer games you play and the more Netflix you watch
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  every study shows the more alone and isolated and depressed you are
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  now they got the weaponized marijuana 10, 15, 20 times stronger than it used to be
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  shutting everybody down with weaponized drugs getting you to roll over and die
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  so many people I knew in life were productive and did a good job and were happy and had families
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  and then their doctors like why don't you smoke some pot for your back pain
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  and you never see them again they just watch TV in a basement till they die
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  and George Soros funded all of that as well
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  70% of Americans are now on medication most of it psychotropic or pain killing
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  a drug doubt satanic country now I'm gonna stop bitching about that
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  and I haven't even scratched the surface on all the big pharma tyranny
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  but big pharma is the tip of the spear of the globalist takeover
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  we're gonna be getting into more of that but first the plan to stage terror attacks
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  based on January 6th and demonize the American people to publicly roll out the homeland security attack
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  and trigger a full bore civil war which the left is now priming and preparing
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  so that's all coming up when we come back from break
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  in fact pull me some of the articles from last few days where they were former CIA
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  analysts says civil war imminent we're already in the third phase of it
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  we've got to arrest all the leaders we've got to put troops on the streets to fight martial law
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  which is martial law so this is it we're seen as a weak target and they're making their move
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  I mean you put up with pedophile story time you put up with open borders you put up with dollar devaluation
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  you put up with all this crap and so now
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  now my friends you will die or you will wake up and say no
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  but I guarantee you it's not even debatable they've pre-prime the whole deal
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  the terror attacks are imminent to be blamed on all of us
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what the globalists are doing right now
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  this is their big offensive this is their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  because now they've revealed themselves now their world government their permanent martial law
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  so listen Paul Revere's when you spread the word about the broadcast when you pray for the broadcast you're the tip of the sphere

[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  it's Alex Jones
[33:29.000 --> 33:33.000]  okay next segment I'm going to play national Australian news admitting
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  79,000 serious adverse reactions including massive deaths
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  and the government's paying out 79,000 people
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  billions of dollars for the sick and dying
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  but if you try to share that on Twitter or Instagram
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  they'll ban you because everybody knows the shot never hurt anybody
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  it just says on the insert now they finally put stuff on the insert
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  beware this may cause heart attacks and a bunch of other stuff
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  but you can't tell people that or they'll shut you down
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  I mean this is just such criminal activity
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  I mean literally the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook and Google
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  and Instagram and all those are now beyond Joseph Mengele
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  in the death numbers the angel of death
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  I mean they are beyond Nazi territory with this
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  and Mike Adams texted me last night he's got a report coming out today
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  in fact I see if it went up yet where they crunched numbers
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  this is even before this insurance company that news came out
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  that we're going to be dealing with if you look at the actuaries
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  millions dying a day remember there's seven and a half billion people on the earth
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  within just a few years if the numbers continue to track
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  because it's killing a large number in the first two weeks
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  and then it's killing a lot in the last six months to a year
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  but it's accelerating it's accelerating it's going up
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  I mean you understand folks I just if you just tuned in
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  I just showed everybody
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  major life insurance company we're covering it next segment
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  major life insurance company with a hundred billion dollars
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  saying we got a 40% increase in death
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  and people that this is the highest level in history in young people
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  this is massive this is humongous
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  and I know it's hard to get your mind around
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  but look at the statistics we've been showing for four months here
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  this is put out by John Hopkins and the UN
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  all across the world as soon as they get the second shot
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  and the booster what happens explosions in infections
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  explosions in hospitalizations and explosions in deaths
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.000]  all over the world where the Pfizer and Moderna shots are given
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  absolutely incredible
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  and Bill Gates and Peter Dazik and Anthony Fauci
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  they gave the orders on record
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  going back we now know in November and December of 2019
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  before he even heard of COVID to start making the COVID-19 vaccine
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  that's the biggest smoking gun ever
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  we reported on that eight months ago
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  it was made big news a few months ago Glenn Beck reported on it
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  but Tucker Carlson reported on it
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  but nobody's gotten in trouble
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  it's not just that they lied to Congress about gain of function
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  they said right there ladies and gentlemen
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  that okay we want it for the spike protein this virus
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  even called it COVID-19
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  they made it and then they told the vaccine makers
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  this is what you make it to do
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  and that's why no matter which one you take
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  AstraZeneca, J&J
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  it doesn't matter if it's an mRNA vaccine or a virus vector
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  it does the same thing
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  create spike protein that's highly poisonous
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  and starts replicating forever in your body
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  the studies say a year and a half
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  because that's how far we go back in the UK
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  where they started the injections
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  but the evidence showing it doesn't even dissipate
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  it just keeps growing and growing and growing
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  and growing until you die
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  you know I said I'd hit this police state
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  New World Order news
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  and I will
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  I'll do that next segment
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  I'll hit the New World Order martial law
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  January 6th kickoff to Civil War
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  next segment
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and then I'll start the next hour and hit the COVID news
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  because it's hard for me to start talking about it
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  and then not get to it
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  and I've got five stacks on this
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  that are all just over the top
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  absolutely over the top
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  during the break Joe Rogan just sent me this
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  I guess I am name dropping
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  because I put his name on it
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  but I'll look at it more
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  and he did send it to me
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  but it's two 1950 style women
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  talking to each other
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  and one says
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  got a stroke right after the jab
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  the other woman says
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  it must have been that climate change
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  it's not funny though is it
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  it's not funny at all
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  you know we trade memes like all day long
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  in articles like baseball
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  like kids would trade baseball cards
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  back in the 50s I guess
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and the one I sent over was this one
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  have you seen this
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  life insurance CEO says
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  death's up 40% among those ages 18 to 64
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  you know who that is
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  that's the work force
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  right there ladies and gentlemen
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  it's not just cute
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  so the longest segment of the hour
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  is the next one
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  I'm going to hit this but
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  you have to understand that
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  when I show you this document right here
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  that this is a declaration
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  of war against you and your family
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  and this is a signed letter
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  of treason by Barack Obama's third administration
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  the Biden Harris Obama administration
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.000]  I mean it says
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  we're going to have a war with the American people
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  it says we're going to round them up and grab them
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  it says that they're the number one enemy
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  I mean it's unprecedented treason
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  unprecedented and then now we're in the next year
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  and they're rolling it out
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  and I have the articles right here
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  but we can stop them
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  because they're looking over their shoulder
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  that's why they want censorship in place
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  because they know a lot of FBI agents
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  aren't in on this and aren't part of it
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  they know there's a lot of people
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  on the intelligence agencies that aren't bad
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  and they know what's going on
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  and there's a lot of people in the military
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  that are good
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  that's why they're saying
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  we need a purge of the military
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  and a purge of the justice department
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  and a purge of anybody that is an SJW
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  because they see all those people as terrorists
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  so we need solidarity together
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  as the American people
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  and we need to be aware of how these powerful outside forces
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  can't bring us down militarily
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  but they can bring us down from within
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  and they've gotten their globalist Davos group graduates
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  which are a lot of top U.S. generals are
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  and most presidents and prime ministers around the world
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  that's the Bilderberg Group's public college for elites
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  it's public
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  it's a private college
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  but it's a private school
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  but it's public operation
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  and people now get it
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  and people understand
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  but the growth curve has been very slow
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  now it's really picked up
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  but the question is
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  is it going fast enough
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  and that's our job
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  that's why they want us shut down
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  because M4 Wars creates
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  in the past 90% of the talking points
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  against the new world order
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  with the original research
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  with the data
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  with the new thought processes
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  the wide spectrum analysis
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  the multi-dimensional analysis
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  with pleasure
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  in just the last year
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  we are now the progenitors of 50%
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  of the true understanding
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  and I wanted to run that down to zero
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  that's when we went
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  so my plan to become obsolete
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  one way or another is happening
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  and again that's all from God
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  it's literally a revelation of understanding
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  a whole division
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  but really it's a download
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  and it's all happening
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  just the way the Holy Spirit told me it would
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  will not be enjoyable for my physical body
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  or my family
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  but they'll all be destroyed anyways
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  we don't beat this
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  so I'm all in
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  sometimes I'll throw fits and get upset
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  that's the flesh being weak
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  and I apologize
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  but we have changed history together
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  and I really want to
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  finish strong here in the next year
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  I hope we're still in a year
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  but I'd give that 50% chance
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  I mean you probably won't
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  it'll be probably total martial law death camps
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  you name it
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  unless we have a huge awakening
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  so it could be your last chance
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  to get an M4 Wars t-shirt
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  could be your last chance
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  to get some of the great supplements
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  could be your last chance
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  to buy a book or a film
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  and help us have funds
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  to stay on air as long as possible
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  but if I lied to you about
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  how grim the situation is
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'd be a bad person
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  and I have to tell you
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  we are a sinking burning ship
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  the whole world is
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  this is anti-Christ takeover
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  global collapse by design
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  to bring us to our knees
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  and if we don't wake up to that
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  and reject it
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  it's going to accelerate
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  there are many anti-Christ spirits
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  the anti-Christ tries this over and over again
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  the devil tries it over and over again
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  it doesn't mean this anti-Christ move
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  is the one where he takes over finally
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  for a couple years according to the Bible
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  but it's our job to fight it regardless

[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  the CEO of Pfizer just came out
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  and said that
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  people talking bad about the vaccines
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  are working for quote dark forces
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  the FBI and CIA have been
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  advising him on
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  who these evil groups are
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  they know that all over the world
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  their poison shot is being banned
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  by major governments
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  and Moderna is in trouble as well
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  they know that the people
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  are starting to get wise
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  this depopulation agenda
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  in fact evidence is starting to mount
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  but they're so deadly
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  they're killing a higher percentage up front
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  and so people are waking up
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  the weapons work a little too good
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  they're supposed to be silent weapons
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  for quiet wars
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  but instead they're making too big of a noise
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  but it's too late for a return back now
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  they're coming after our children
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  so it's up to us to protect our little children
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  or God will not look favorably on us

[46:56.000 --> 47:19.000]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  well there's three types of people in the world
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  you can oversimplify but that's the way the world works
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  there's a lot of different other subtypes
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  but there are people that are just kind of like children
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  and go through life ignorant
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  and don't really want to know how things work
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  and they just follow what they're told to do
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  and they're kind of a living dead
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  and you got to feel sorry for them
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  but they're not consciously evil
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  and then you've got people that know how the world works
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  that decide to serve evil
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  and decide to basically work against civilization
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  and society because they have a desire
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  to dominate and take things from people
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  and they don't like to build things
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  and they think people that are into honor
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  and into courage and into long term relationships
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  are losers
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  and then there are people that love God
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  and love justice and want to be good
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  and have a guilty conscience
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  about the fact that we also have dark sides
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  but we're trying to be good
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  and the problem is it tortures those of us that love God
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  to see all this evil going on
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  and it frustrates us
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  and in so many cases we end up turning to evil
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  saying the injustice is the means
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  and using the enemy's tactics against them
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  believing that well it's worth it to use the ring of Mordor
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  this one time
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  but when you continue to do that
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  over and over again it takes you over
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  and you become what you were fighting against
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  I mean I've got all sorts of nasty things I could do
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  all sorts of horrible things I could do to people
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  that mess with me and attack me and things
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  but if I do that I get down on their level
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  and then I lose my connection to God
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  and my discernment
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  and also it begins to introduce lies into your mind
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  and deception and that's a virus
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  that doesn't just hurt people you lie to
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  it hurts you
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  lies are bad
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  lies are like false numbers
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  put in a calculator
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  that screw up the equation
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  they're not good
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  deception isn't good
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and I get it you're under attack
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  a foreign army's coming to your midst
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  you're gonna have to pose as them to get behind their lines
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  and find out where they are so the planes can come and bomb them
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  I get that type of lie in war
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  but that's why they push war on every front
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  is to get good people in line with their evil
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  so let's talk about it what's happening right now
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  from a branding perspective
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  how do you know when the summer Olympics are coming
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  because for a couple months before
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  on whatever channel's carrying them that year
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  you see the dun dun dun dun dun dun
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  coming up the Olympic games
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  you know the Olympic games are coming
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  you don't need to know the whole backstory
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  or the history or any of it
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  you know they're telling you where the summer games
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  or the winter games are gonna be
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  and you need to take some time out to watch that
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  well I've been sitting here
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  since I got on air 28 years ago
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  watching governments try to brand
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  the American people starting at Waco
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  and Ruby Ridge and other areas as terrorists
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  and sell the American people on tanks
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  burning down churches
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  doesn't mean the people inside were perfect
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  but they're trying to set the precedent to do that
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  and so I started watching C-Span
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  and I started watching the hearings
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  and I started interviewing the filmmakers
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and I started learning about what really happened
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  and I went to see
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  the truth of Waco
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  and met General Parton and Ted Gunderson
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  and all these great patriots
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  and got the immediate
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  fast track into what was really going on
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  and the older I get
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  the more those guys were geniuses
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  and then when I was young and dumb
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  I didn't understand half of it
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  now I realize they were incredible
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  and I got to hang around with those guys a lot
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  you don't even realize
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  when you're young and get to have a chance like that
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  but it doesn't matter
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  we're moving on now to what's happening currently
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  they are publicly saying
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  you know like in the 1960s
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  70s and 80s
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  the main enemy was the Russians
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  and the TV ads were against the Russians
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  and the movies were against the Russians
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  and the magazine articles were against the Russians
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  and everything's the Russians on and on and on
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  I mean you knew we were in a cold war
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  with the Russians
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  and you turn on the TV
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  or you open up a magazine
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  or you go online
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  all you hear is
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  Trump supporters are white supremacists
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  and they're terrorists
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  and the main mission of the US military
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  and the FBI
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  and the CIA and that's illegal by the way
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  with the CIA
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  to operate domestically is the American people
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  and we have to brace
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  for the imminent war
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  and then I'm like hey they're getting ready for a civil war
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  they're getting ready for a civil war they're going to trigger
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  they're losing politically they want to get a fight going
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  they're going to start it and control both sides
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  we don't want to be part of this in all the headlines
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  Jones is insane
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  don't listen to him
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  I was saying back in
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  November and December of
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  2020
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  they're trying to set Trump up
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  they're trying to get Trump to declare martial law
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  and all this stuff and then if Trump tries that
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  that's when they're really going to arrest Trump
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  and bring in permanent martial law
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  and Trump was smart and didn't do that
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  but they still provocateur the million people
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  we got in DC peacefully to get
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  again 500, 600 to go in the building
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  built onto that this whole
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  structure of
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  anybody that questions
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  lockdowns, forced inoculations
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  open borders or election fraud
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  is a white supremacist
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  and is a terrorist
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  and it's all in the national strategy
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  for countering domestic terrorism
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  30 plus pages long
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  I suggest you go read it
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  for yourself at whitehouse.gov
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  now let's move on
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  we see this, CIA
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  an expert in foreign conflicts
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  believes the US is closer to civil war
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  than anyone would like to believe
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  and claims America is no longer a democracy
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  but a
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  anocracy
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  oh and the CIA
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  CIA group
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  put this out says
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  but we've got to put troops on the street
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  and arrest all the Trump supporters, leaders
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  then we'll be safe from their
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  martial law so she pushes
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  martial law in the name of
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  stopping it
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  100% gaslighting
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  like Emperor Palpatine
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  we've got to wipe out all the Jedi's
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  because they might
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  attack us when we take over
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  I mean it's ridiculous
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  if you're conscious and a lot of people are
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  they're deciding to join like okay I'll just join with this
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  we're gonna finally get to have our rule
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  of leftism it's gonna be so great
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  it's gonna be a nightmare
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  yeah
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  the next US civil war is already here
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  we just refused to see it
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  so I'm telling you the left's curing up a civil war
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  years ago but they didn't want that out then
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  so they said all over the news
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Jones is insane, Jones is crazy
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  we just type in Alex Jones
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  falsely claims the left
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  wants a civil war
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  Alex Jones falsely claims
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  preparation for a civil war happening
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  hundreds of articles
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  oh we're already in one
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and we need the army and the CIA
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  to arrest Tucker Carlson
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  they have articles out saying
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  oh
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  Tucker Carlson and
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  people like him
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  they're causing, they're radicalizing
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Swallowswell put out an article
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  saying oh he was
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  radicalized by
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  this guy that threatened Swallowswell
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  over the email or over a text message
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  or whatever it was or some online crap
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  it was DM, it was a DM
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  a private message on the internet
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  on Twitter read the article of the day
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  and he's like oh oh oh
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  this guy out of Canada said you know I deserve to hang
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  and it turns out I talked to him
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  and he's under the orders of Tucker Carlson
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  and we gotta just silence him
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I mean he's a terrorist
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  he claims I'm a Chinese spy
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  which you are you little maggot
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  so it just goes on and on ladies and gentlemen
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  now let's get right into it
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  here is the latest article
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  out of the
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  New York Times
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  January 6th
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  is the new Shinking in Lusitania
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  that's what got us into World War I
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  and 9-11 wrapped in 1 instead of being
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  used to justify war on
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  foreign nations and terrorism
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  January 6th will be used to justify war on
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  Americans who dissent
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  to the dim media world view
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  they're right stripped
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  under the new guise of safety
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Rikosky absolutely got that right
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  and here's the article
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  out of the New York Times
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  every day is January 6th
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  our whole world is this
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  we've got to have troops and checkpoints
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  and CIA and censorship
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  because there's an evil army
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  of racist white people
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  about to murder everybody
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  and this is the globalist that launched the COVID-19
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  they're denying people health care
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  that kicked folks out of the old folks home
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  these are the murderers
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  these are the globalists that signed on to the foreign powers
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  that the country over
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  these are the ones disolving the border
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  these are the ones destroying the currency
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  these are the ones with drag queen pedophile time
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  these are the ones saying the founding fathers are bad
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  everything you'd imagine in red dawn
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  reeducation camp
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  you go watch that old movie of
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  what if the Soviets took over
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  America sucks in his evil in a whorehouse
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  and your fathers are evil
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  and that's literally what they tell you on the news
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  they're gonna be at reeducation camps
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  in North Dakota
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  I mean this is real
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  this is here
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  this is happening and they're just normalizing it all
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  and how are they gonna get to where they wanna go
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  staging terror attacks
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  staging events
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  they've got training camps all over the country
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  roping in young impressionable people
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  under different banners and guises
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  to launch their main attack
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  in the coming months
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  the globalists will attack themselves
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  to then launch a civil war in America
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  everything we've witnessed
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  in the last few decades has only been the build up
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  this is their big offensive
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  this is their takeover
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  because now they've revealed themselves
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  now their world government
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  their permanent martial law
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  but they're using their corporate power
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  and trillions to go across the planet
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  and shut down people telling the truth
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  so listen Paul Revere's
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  when you pray for the broadcast you're the tip of the spear
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  you keep us on air
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  that are back in stock 50% off
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  X2 and Winter Sun
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  both of these are on our top 5 best sellers
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  they are so good for your body
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  and if there's two things you do for your body
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  it's these two products
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  they're all back in stock at infowarstore.com
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  50% off and it keeps us on the air
[58:45.000 --> 59:11.000]  only way we fail is if you don't take action
[59:11.000 --> 59:17.000]  you get a free phone of $600 to $50
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  value absolutely free
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  at infowarstore.com
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  smart phones are always tracking everything you do
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  these aren't and the calls are free when folks call you
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  you just pay $99.95 a month
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  for your minutes
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  $150
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  so the calls you are free works like a regular cell phone
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  you're not being tracked or traced
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  and I keep one on my car
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  I've given it to my parents as gifts
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  regular phones don't work
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  they work
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  infowarstore.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  or 941-955-1029-4195
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  then 20 and ask the Alex Jones Special
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  if you are receiving this transmission
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  you are the resistance
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  alright ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  I want to play a clip
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  out of Virginia
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  of what happens when you have
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  polar vortex storm
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  come in and hit hot weather
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  dump a bunch of ice on the roads
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  or they've been stuck now
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  coming up on 36 hours on the highway
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  can't get off
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  and again that shows how precarious
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  our industrial society is
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  just on time delivery
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  and the incredible complexity
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  of things
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  makes our civilization very
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  very
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  un-unflexive
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  non-flexible
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  then you get the globalist eco
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  neo-nazi
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  depopulationist in control
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  who want to wipe out most of the population
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  and I mean I see their view
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  I understand it actually
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  because I understand I don't want that
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  God's got a bigger plan plus they shouldn't play God
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  plus they're some of the worst people
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  the most wicked they should
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  if they all killed themselves
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I would start considering some of their plans
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  but like sterilized children
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  brainwashed families
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  put chemicals in the water
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  I mean it's a horrible plan they've got
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  but if you can't address them
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  on their plan and actually debate them
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  and can't see what they're doing
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  they have no respect for you
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  or their fear I have a job to do
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  opposing them because God's watching
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  but you understand
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  when you deny this is going on
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  the globalists don't even see you as human
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  they see me as human
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  that's why they've tried to hire me
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  I've even named names
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  the Kissinger Group
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  try to give me to go to New York meet with Henry Kissinger
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  this is like 15, 16 years ago
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  so I mean I could
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  have joined them folks I'm not joining them
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  but this is how precarious
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  civilization is and when you want to artificially destabilize it
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  you've got full control
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  if you then pose as the saviors
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  over the very destabilization
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  you've created here it is
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  in BC's
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Josh Letterman
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  has been stuck inside of his car
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  for about 10 hours
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  and the problem's not with the locks
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  he's in his car
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  he's been stuck there
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  still 30 miles outside of DC
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  alright Josh tell us what this has been like
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  and what have you heard
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  from people I guess
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  in the same situation
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Mika this has been a pretty insane
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  and fairly dystopian experience
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I was headed back to DC
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  last night
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  GPS said I'd get back around
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  515
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  about 715
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  with several delays
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  it was looking pretty bad on the roads
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  and by 730 we were just at a standstill
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  and have been at a standstill
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  ever since
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  meaning the thousands
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  I can see thousands of cars where
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  I am on the highway on I-95
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  have been in their cars overnight
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  without food, without water
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  it's been 26 degrees outside
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  and nobody knows
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  how long we're going to be here
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  or how we're going to get out
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  so people
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  once it got into about 5 hours
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  that people were stuck in their cars
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  because frankly
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  people wanted to conserve gas
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  they didn't know how long they'd be able to stay warm
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  if they ran out of gasoline
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  I've been doing okay gas wise
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  but we've talked with
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  some of the other folks who have gotten out of their cars
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  to walk their dogs
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  to let their kids out of the car
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  who have been camped up
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  in the cars for hours and hours
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  and they've said
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  this is scary you don't plan for
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  a situation like this
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  where is the situation we find ourselves in
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  almost 24 hours
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  after this snow is actually falling
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Hey Josh, it's Willie
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I'm glad you're hanging in there
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  we're looking at these live pictures from above
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  and my gosh the line of traffic goes on
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  and on and on and on
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  so what is going on up front here
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  who are you hearing from
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  what are you hearing about when you might be able to break this log jam
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  I mean you've been out for more than 10 hours now
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  how much longer do you think you'll be there
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  that is an open question
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  we've been looking at basically
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  twitter trying to see if local authorities
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  are putting out any information
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  as well as local radio
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  there was one period where
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  they briefly opened one lane over a night
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  and we got to move about
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  a quarter of a mile down the road
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  then it crashed again and was completely out
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  we haven't seen
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  since before midnight
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  I have not seen an emergency vehicle
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  or a police car or a plow
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  on my side of the highway
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  both the north and south bounds are completely shut down
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  we've seen some plows on the south bound side
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  it's possible there are some
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  emergency vehicles trying to help us
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  at the front of this kind of coming from the other direction
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  but from this vantage point
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  Christmas 2021
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  is over
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  but you've still got a really great chance

[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  thanks for keeping us on the air
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  I cannot stress enough to you
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  how much danger you and your family are in
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  and how dark the times are
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  on this planet
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  we have a psychotic
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  mad scientist
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  eugenics based
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  ruling class
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  that have decided to collapse
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  civilization
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  and destroy it under the auspices
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  of environmentalism
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  but really they're transhumanists
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  that want full control of human development
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  and decided that there is an unmanageable
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  size herd
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  that they want to quote cold
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  now
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  I had this actual folder
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  in here last week I never got to it
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Barbara Marks Hubbard
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  folder and another folder
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  on depopulation quotes
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  and I meant to cover that
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  you guys dig that out of the stack and bring it to me
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  not for today but I need to cover that soon
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  I just want to do special night time shows
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  starting three nights a week very soon
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  because I want to be able to come in commercial free
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  and just really take
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  night time for like an hour going over some big topics
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  read a bunch of documents on air
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  do a class on that
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  and then take two hours of phone calls
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  and I said I'd be doing that by mid January
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  three or four months ago but I'm behind schedule
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  because of a lot of family stuff
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  and January six stuff and all the other things
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  that are going on but it's all being built
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  a bunch of other stuff's been prepared
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  with other organizations and groups
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  and we've got
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  six or seven big projects left
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  that are all eight and a half nine months pregnant
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  and are about to
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  break our water on all this together
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  and really give birth to some big things
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  and our collective will that we've done
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  and make no mistake
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  I use the analogy of
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  the birth of something because that's what this is
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  I mean all of us are the mothers and fathers of this fight
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  and the energy you put in
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  and what you contribute
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  with your time, your energy, your prayer
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  your financial support
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  is building the resistance
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  and I can tell you
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  and all glory goes to God, I'm so humbled by this
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  it's actually staggering
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  it's actually a great weight
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  it's the opposite of what I would call
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  something that's fun
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  the Bible talks about
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  with wisdom comes great sorrow
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  or the beginning of wisdom brings great sorrow
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  and
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  but it's also very bittersweet
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  it's also very fulfilling
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  I mean when I did bad things
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  when I was younger
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  somebody started a fight with me so I broke their nose
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  and then went ahead and broke their jaw
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  stomped their face once they were down
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  I'd feel really empty later
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  like I'd done something wrong because God was saying
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  that's not good what you did
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  or when I paid for an abortion I would feel totally empty
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  and like a horrible person
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  and I finally repented and fully woke up and got saved
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  for the second time more intensely
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and the reason I talk about this is
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  that when I would do things like that
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  I would feel completely empty
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  like when I got my driver's license
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  particularly I was just out of control
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  with women I mean I would just
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  get on women in grocery stores
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  like adult women I would just
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  walk up to people in church and women and just pick them up
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  I would just I mean it was out of control
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  people were like oh that really sounds studly
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  it was it got emptier and emptier
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and emptier and emptier and emptier
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  and the more confidence I got the more the women
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  just like that
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  but it was
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  it was killing me and
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  it's the same thing with all this
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  I have incredible weight on me
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  and
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  I'm tortured many ways but I don't feel
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  empty at all
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  you see that's the difference with the Holy Spirit and God
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  God will put pressure on you and give you jobs to do
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  but I have
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  so much life and so much discernment
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  and so much
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  that it's the opposite of that empty hollow
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  feeling you have when you're evil
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  or when you're doing things against God's plan
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  it's the opposite I'm not empty
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  I'm so full
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  that I'm bursting at the seams and that's why
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I apologize sometimes when I'm obnoxious
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  it's because it's just it's too much
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  yeah there's the quote
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  they found it
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  for in much wisdom is much grief
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  and he that increases
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  knowledge increases sorrow
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  that is
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  so damn powerful Ecclesiastes
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  118
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  but it's true
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  absolutely true
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  and
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  I know
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  with you the audience you have a lot of great sorrow
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  I know you're just like me that's why you tune in
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  because you're just like me I meet you all over the country
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  you're so beautiful and wonderful and I see
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  our listeners and they can be Hispanic
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  or Asian or white or black doesn't matter
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  they've all got this light in their eyes
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  and they're so alive
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  and it's not even their features
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  it's not like their classic movie star
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  features or whatever it's like
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  it can be a black man it can be a white woman
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  it can be a black lady it can be a Hispanic lady
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  it doesn't matter like you meet people that are awake
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  and I'll be sitting there
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  shaking their hands talking to them and I'm just like
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  talking to them and I can see
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  how alive they are
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  and then I think about members of my own family
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  who used to have that light in their eyes
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  but because I worked too much
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  or I wasn't home enough or whatever that's what I have guilt over
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  they don't have that light in their eyes anymore
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  and I realize what matters to me
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  more than my name
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  or more than my health or anything
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  even my I love my children more than anything
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  but what matters is
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  the light in their eyes
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  because if the system comes after them
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  and the system destroys them as long as
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  when they go they have their light in their eyes
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  that means they've got a connection to Christ
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  they've got that spark, that fire
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  it's that fire that means everything
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  it's the fire in the eyes
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  it's the sparkle
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  in the eyes
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  that is everything
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  and they want to take that magic from us
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  that connection to the divine because
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  the eyes grow out of the brain
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  when you're in embryo and they're literally
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  stalks of your brain that grow out
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  beautiful appendages of your brain
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  which itself is just a receiver
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  transmitter, a transceiver to the universe
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  and they're so beautiful
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  and you just see those eyes
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  of innocent children
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  counting on us to be strong
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  counting on us to stand up against evil
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  counting on us
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  and then I think about the police and military
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  you know at a base level
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  as a man you want to go ahead
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  and get in a war because if you think
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  you're in the right let's just get it going
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  you're going to show them
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  but if you pull back and realize that
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  they attacked our police and military
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  who aren't perfect but are some of the best in the world
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  when it comes to their morals
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  check it out, look into it, travel around the world
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  and find out for yourself
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  they have attacked them with Black Lives Matter
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  in George Soros and
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  put DA's controlled by Soros
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  in almost all the cities and towns
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  to then
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  persecute
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  them
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  and intimidate them
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  so they quit and leave
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  and then when they quit and leave
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  they put their people in and so it's so simple
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I don't just
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  not want to have a civil war
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  because I don't want to get killed or put in prison
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  it's because the globalists are losing politically
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  they're losing spiritually
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  they want to overturn the chess board to do this
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  and they want to wreck the country
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  and bring it into disarray
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  to plunge the stock market and buy it up
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  for pennies on the dollar that's the next big scam
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  they've done in countless other countries
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and they admit they're engaged in
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  that I've been warning since 2001
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  when we got their documents
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  that they're setting up
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  they said then
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  we've already taken the third world over
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and we're going to use the same tactics
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  on the first world and that's an
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  international monetary fund
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  document run by the CIA
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  and Henry Kissinger
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  so think about that
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  they want us to line up like idiots
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  and shoot and kill each other
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  and oh
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  blow up some stuff, claim there's terrorists
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  give the cops fake orders
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  the military fake orders to go
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  retake a
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  order or whatever that's not going on in the new world order
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  whatever they're planning in the future
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  and then to kick the whole thing off
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  and have us all like a bunch of idiots
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  go kill each other
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  and here's the thing
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  they're probably going to get away with it
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  and kick it off
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  but there'll be a big enough minority
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  of people
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  who transcend this
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  to understand what's happening
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  and I'll assure you once the big war kicks off
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  that Leonardo DiCaprio
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and Klaus Schwab
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and Bill Gates
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  and all the rest of them playing God
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  are going to be in a whole new world
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and I want them to know
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  yeah, you're going to get Alex Jones, okay
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  you'll be able to look at your little
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  factoid and see me strung up or whatever
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  or in some damn death camp
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  but let me tell you, know it now
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  I've looked at every angle
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  you will pay for what you've done with COVID-19
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  and the release of it
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  and the January 6th and the martial law
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  of it, you will get it
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  and I don't care how much you surveil
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  or vet your own people
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  your own people are going to be
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  your demise, historically it's a well-known fact
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  and so
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I know you can't help yourself, Soros
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  you've been murdering and killing people since you were 14
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  you can't help it, it's who you are
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  and all the rest of you people
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  but just know this
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  we're not starting a war
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  we don't want a civil war
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  and we don't want to kill the military and police
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  they're purging them, they're attacking them
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  we need to embrace the military and police
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  and lift them up and educate them now
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  and let them know we're going to support them
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  and stop this now
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  while there's still time
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  everything we've witnessed
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  in the last few decades
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  has only been the build up
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  this is their big offensive
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  this is their takeover
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  because now they've revealed themselves
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  their depopulation agenda
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  has been exposed
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  to go across the planet
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  and shut down people telling the truth
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  so listen, Paul Reverez, when you spread the word
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  you're the tip of the spear
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  you keep us on air

[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  they are so good for your body

[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  it's these two products
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  they're all back in stock at infowarstore.com
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  50% off and it keeps us on the air

[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  I've been buying this from the Mexican Rebels
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  and the price has never gone up
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  for about 50% more
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  for a pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  you're gonna find anywhere
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  it's Wake Up America Patriot Blend
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  from the Chiapas Rebels, literally
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  um
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  we had like that
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  okay, you wouldn't believe it

[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  it's in the rearview mirror
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  but you can still take advantage
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  of Christmas prices

[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  it has been heated up
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  and so it has a dramatic effect
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  compared to powdered versions
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  they also work quite well but just aren't as strong
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  this is like a very fine wine
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  in fact each batch is different
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  people are like why are you selling something
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  that's just how it is it's how it works
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  so it's always good
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  it's just sometimes it's like super strong
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  be surprised and this is it
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  John the Revolator is a smooth operator
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  John the Revolator
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  put an LF there
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  take him up to the lifestyle
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  take him up to the top
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  with a mountain stop
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  let's put good eyes
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  yeah, put good eyes
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  that's why he wrote it thousands of years ago
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  and you're trying to put it down on you
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  Hollywood trash
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  he says John stole it from the Jews
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  and the Muslims too
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  oh really?
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  well the Muslims came around 400 years after Christianity
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Christ didn't come
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  to abolish the Old Testament
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  but to fulfill it
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  yeah there is only one God
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  and then the fake God you serve
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Satanist
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  all right let's get into it right now
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  you know I mentioned this
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  I thought I'd play the newscast for you
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  and I've got more breaking news
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  I'm not going to get to now
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  because I want to actually put a report together on this
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  but more soccer players
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  more newscasters
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  young people taking it
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  and having heart attacks and dying
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  or barely alive
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  with five heart attacks
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  out of Brazil
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  this is not broken anywhere
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  I'm going to shoot a report on it
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  live
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  I'm going to talk about it in the last segment of this hour
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  and then we'll get it up on infowars.com
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  with the details
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  so that's coming up
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  and we have the gentleman
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  the first person to win the $5,000
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  to jump on
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Miami television
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  and talk about how it's a poison
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  deathshotinfowars.com
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  people say Jones
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  you say you need money
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  and you're going to go bankrupt
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  but then you're going to give $5,000 to people
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  to jump on TV
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  and say the shots killing people
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  yeah I need money to do that
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  I need money to do our job
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  I'm strategic
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  we paid out $300 to something thousand dollars
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  for people to jump up and say Bill Clinton's a rapist
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  on TV
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  and we're credited with beating the Clintons
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  they certainly think that beat them
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  it was on national TV
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  hundreds of times
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  it devastated them
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  it devastated them
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  so yeah
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  it makes it more fun for everybody
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  and then once one person starts doing it
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  it gets everybody doing it
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  and what did the Fox News
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  host Mr. Waters say
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  weeks after we launched this contest
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  we need people to confront Fauci
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  with him running the Wuhan lab and creating the virus
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  that's the kill shot
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  the media won't do it
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  and then now they want Waters
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  fired
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  because they're afraid of you
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  taking action
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  they want to punish that idea
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  we don't want to have a war
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  we don't want to bomb things or shoot people
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  or attack federal buildings
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  we want to go out and have rallies and demonstrations
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  and when somebody's live in the park
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  live in the TV or live wherever
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  somebody's live up on a stage
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  out at the park
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Keith Overman I did that years ago
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  took over his show
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  bringing up key issues about the New World Order
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  that's what we do
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  that's how we do it
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  that's how we get it done
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  and I'm trying to get a chain reaction
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  going
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  to get everybody else to go out
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  and every time they see a news camera getting their face
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  because they're not going to be inspired just by this show
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  all right now
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  but they'll be inspired by everybody else
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  doing it
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  like the first guy that got on Tucker Carlson
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  when he was just a weekend host
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  and said Bill Clinton's a rapist
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  that was one of our listeners
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  he had the idea to do it and I said wait a minute
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  we ought to give people $5,000 every time they did it
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  and it happened a whole bunch
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  and then I said the contest is over
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  and then hundreds of more people did it for fun
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  and it defeated the globalist
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  it's beautiful
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  but let's play this back to back
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  clip 6
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  is life insurance CEO
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  of a hundred million dollar company
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  says deaths are up
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  18 to 64 year olds at a level never before seen
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Scott Davis
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  CEO of One America Insurance
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  and other insurance companies are reporting the same thing
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  and then it dub tells the clip 4
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  79,000 people with adverse serious reactions
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  some dead
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  being paid $600,000
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  by the Australian government from the vaccine
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  that supposedly doesn't hurt you
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  but does, here's both clips
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  one of our businesses is
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  that we offer group life and disability insurance
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  to employers
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  and we are seeing right now
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  the highest death rates we have ever seen
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  in the history of this business
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  not just at One America
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  the data is consistent across every player
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  in that business
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  now this is primarily
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  working age people
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  18 to 64
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  employers like all the employers
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  on the screen here
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  and what we saw just in third quarter
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  we're seeing a continuing to fourth quarter
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  is that death rates
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  are up 40%
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  over what they were pre-pandemic
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  just to give you
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  an idea of how bad that is
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  a 3 sigma
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  or a 1 in 200 year
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  catastrophe would be
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  10% increase
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  over pre-pandemic
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  so 40% is just
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  unheard of
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  and what the data is showing us
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  is that the deaths that are being reported
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  as COVID deaths
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  greatly understate
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  the actual death losses among working age
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  people from the pandemic
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  it may not all be COVID on their death certificate
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  but deaths are
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  just a huge, huge
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  numbers
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  we're also seeing an uptick
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  in disability claims
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  it was short-term disability claims
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  and now we're seeing a long-term disability
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  you know, hit pause
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  hit pause
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  again, this is Cloward having the plan to break down the economy
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  and notice last year
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  they said it was much worse, the vaccine saved us
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  and then this year is
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times that number
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  almost double what they've ever seen before
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  so understand
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  that
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  they haven't got all the numbers in yet from last year yet
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  it's gonna be worse
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  he goes on to say that, but
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  again
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  you take the shot, now it's worse than ever
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  the same numbers everywhere, continue
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  or whether it is because
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  people haven't been able to get the health care that they need
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  because the hospitals are overrun
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  we're seeing those claims
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  start to take up as well
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  and for one America, we expect
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  the costs of this are gonna be well
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  over $100 million
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  and this is our smallest business
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  so it's having a huge impact on that
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  those costs
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  will trickle towards other employers
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  over time because
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  premiums are starting to go up
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  so it will cost more for employers
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  and most of us in the industry
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  are starting to target
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  and to add premium loads
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  onto
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  employers that are based in counties that have low vaccination rates
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  it's just
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  typically what we would do for underwriting
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  and you have a risk factor like that
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  there's also gonna be higher costs
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  on employers from greater absences
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  particularly in a time when there's low unemployment
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  and workers are hard to come by
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  so
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  even though we had crony capitalism and a lot of corruption
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  we still
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  had more wealth than anybody else in the world
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  and so nobody wanted to get rid of the system
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  well, the big boys over the day
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  most group of the UN
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  they're gonna implode it
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  and they've got their big companies with unlimited capital
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  from the fiat system
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  but your company or your small business isn't gonna get it
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  you're gonna go bankrupt
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  and this is simply a consolidation, a total takeover
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  that kills you while they're at it
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  they just see themselves mopping up garbage
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  mopping up trash
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  they don't care if a five-year-old has a heart attack and dies
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  they don't care if you get
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  lesions on your brain
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and are paralyzed
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  they don't care
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  none of them are taking the shot, Klaus Schwab's not taking the shot
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I like to see Klaus Schwab
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  I'm convicted
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  what he's done
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I like to see him hauled up in front of the world
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  I like to see him pay
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  that snaggle tooth monster
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  but let me tell you, he'll pay
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  God is gonna get him
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  God is gonna destroy him
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  vitamin D3
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  take it under the tongue for higher absorption

[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  despite the fact it's been sold out for months

[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  survival shield, X2, deeper crystal iodine
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  the game changer
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  the missing link, not just for immune system
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  but all electrochemical activity in the body
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  it's back in stock, 50% off
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  so that's the new year special

[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  this is Klaus Schwab
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  and we're here with X2 and Winter Son
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  at infowarstore.com
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  50% off for a limited time
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  thanks for keeping us on the air
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  has only been the build up
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  this is their big offensive
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  this is their takeover
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  because now they've revealed themselves
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  but they're using their corporate power
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  and trillions to go across the planet
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  and shut down people telling the truth
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  so listen Paul Revere's
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  you keep us on air
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months

[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  that are so good for your body
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  and if there's two things you do for your body
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  it's these two products
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  they're all back in stock at infowarstore.com
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  50% off and it keeps us on the air
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  only way we fail is if you don't take action
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  in late August
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  infowar saw an explosion of orders
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  because our audience
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  understands that the globalists
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  are destabilizing the planet
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  by design and are attempting
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  to cause an economic and financial
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  collapse worldwide
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  has always been something that's important to have
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  it's a check box that everybody needs to have
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  taking care of, right along with water filtration
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  self defense

[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  you're going to see more food supply shortages
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  and you're going to see food supply
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  increases that are already taking place
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  so lock in your storeable food now

[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  that's how you fight the great reset
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  is by being self sufficient and not under their control
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  so get prepared now
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  at infowarstore.com

[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  this is the holy grail
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  of tyranny ladies and gentlemen
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  this is the takeover in humanity
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  better wake up and say no
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  finally folks are starting to wake up
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the charts
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  want with info wars
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  but it's not enough
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  every individual has to not comply
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  you see, they need the fear of God
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  putting them legally and lawfully
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  of the new world order
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  the Alex Jones show
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  because there is a war on
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  for your mind
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  we did it five years ago
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  we can do it again, the people take action
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Bill Clinton is a rapist
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  is the model of victory
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  that's how we expose him, here it is
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  rapist
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  rapist
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  rapist
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  rapist
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  rapist
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  rapist
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  rapist
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  rapist
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  rapist
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  rapist
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  rapist
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  rapist
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  rapist
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  rapist
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  rapist
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  rapist
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  rapist
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  rapist
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  I've been waiting for this segment all morning long
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  we are rolling out the red carpet
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  not for Tucker but for some adorable
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  adoptable dogs
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  every year the best friends animal society
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  helps cats and dogs
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  who are stuck in animal shelters
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  Bill Clinton is a rapist
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  people still can't let this
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  consensus and
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  too many people are worried
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  about whether there is going to be a future
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  and their kids can have the same
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  help with their ability
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  I know that
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  I know that
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  that's what we are all about
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  how can we have a comedy to watch for everybody
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  how can we make sure everybody gets a chance
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  to participate
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  and to see
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  the most important dog in the society
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  raising children
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  how can we look together
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  and talk about the first thing
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  we've ever done
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  how can we be safer
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  in the world
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  so that we
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  can grow
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  how can we do that
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  I drink in the world
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  and we can get a lot of those dogs back
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  just depends
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  on what you think
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  get in my hand
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  I'm telling you
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  the old treat down
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  if you want to know what this is about
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  turn on the tv
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  music
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  so Jesse Waters last week said
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  the kill shot
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  you want to be in trouble
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  fighting Terry
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  so the kill shot
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  is going out confronting Fauci
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  he told the media
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  and he told citizens
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  at a big republican event
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  turning point USA
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  that you need to go out and ask real questions
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  of these people
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  you need to jump into live feeds
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  don't break the law, don't crash paths, don't hurt anybody
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  these people are everywhere
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  and so yeah, I don't have a bunch of extra money
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  because all the money we've got is in the fight
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I sold my house to put the money in the fight
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  that's why we're offering $5,000
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  for everybody
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  that gets on live
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  television, nationals preferential
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  that's what we really want
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  but if you get an A for effort
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  you get the 5,000
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Miami went nationwide
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  and you got to post it on rumble
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  you got to post it on like parlor
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  you got to post it on
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  youtube, twitter, whatever
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  the more places you post it and send it to us
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  the better and I'll make the decision on whether you win
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  but I want to pay it out
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  because once we've paid out 10-15 winners
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  then I can stop the contest
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  it causes a chain reaction
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  so people don't do this just for the money
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  they do it because it's exciting and it's fun to do
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  but it does make it fun
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  to get recognized
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  for what you're doing and if we turn the people loose
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  in an info war
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  we need to be out in the street
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  or we'll never pick up our guns if it's need be
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  which I don't want to happen
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  but the left wants a civil war
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  because they're losing the fight
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  intellectually
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  they're losing the fight
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  for the hearts and minds
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  so we need to turn up that fight
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  with civil disobedience
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  and on the scale of 1-10
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  jump into front of a live newscast
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  and public's a one
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  and I'm not saying it's not a big deal
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  it's hugely successful
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  a 10
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  would be a thousand people going in a national TV show
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  and breaking down the doors
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  and taking over the live show and doing a sit-in
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  which you can argue is
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  a form of
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  trespassing
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  but if the place is pushing
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  racial division or if a restaurant
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  won't let blacks eat at it
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  don't we agree everybody should go in there
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  and say that's wrong?
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  so that's where we are
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  they're now denying white people
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  in Minnesota and in Texas
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  the state's trying to stop it
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  and in New York they've endorsed it
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  denying white people
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  18-65
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  they're saying you're not in a net risk group
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  what does that even mean
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  for COVID you don't get monoclonal antibodies
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  well that deserves sit-ins
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  and I'm not saying go sit-in
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  at your hospital or do this
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  you need to follow your own conscience
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  but this is the time for civil disobedience
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  at their minimum which is incredibly successful
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  just because something isn't
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  on the scale of almost criminal
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  it's a one
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  doesn't mean it's not effective
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  doesn't mean the more extreme stuff is more effective
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  it's saying jumping on a live TV show
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  and talking about the truth
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  legally and lawfully is a one on a scale of 10
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  of civil disobedience
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  and it's the most successful thing
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  you can do
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  so I really appreciate Stefan Rivera
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  joining us here's a quick clip
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  also did the Bill Clinton's a rapist
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  successful five years ago
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  but here he is
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  getting on the biggest TV station ABC
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  in Miami here it is
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  is there live with an update Andrew
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  you may remember all events were cancelled last year
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  because of COVID-19
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  this year we're told the shows
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  will go on
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  infowars.com
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  the COVID-19 shot is for population control
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  infowars.com
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I'm going
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  and it goes on from there
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  well he got a little out on air it doesn't matter
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  he's number one
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  he's the first to walk on the moon
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  he's the first to get it done and to get it to us
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  if others have done it we don't know about you send it to Rob D
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  just the initial D
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  ROBD
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  infowars.com or get them on air but I'm ready to trigger the chain reaction
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Stefan Rivera
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Instagram YouTube studio time
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  Florida coastal championship
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  wrestling on YouTube
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  thank you so much brother we really appreciate you
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  awesome awesome thank you Alex
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  for having me and what a great
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  opportunity for this country to unite
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  and do something amazing
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  so thank you again you know thank god for these
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  opportunities
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  and I also want to take this opportunity to thank my son
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Joel I wouldn't be able to do this without you
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  buddy so thank you so much
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  so why do you think this is important
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  I mean obviously you've taken action you did the
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Bill Clinton as a rapist deal
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  on television as well
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  why do you think this is important
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  this is incredible importance
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  I mean we are
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  you just had a guest yesterday two days ago
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  we have a hypnosis in this country
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  we have people completely just
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  it's a fog over their brain
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  over their eyes and really
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  any seed that we can plant
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  to kind of shake that up I mean really
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  just use those seeds use those opportunities
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  to wake up the community
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  that's really the first step you can
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  you can do as an American right now
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  wake up your neighbors
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  wake up the people around you
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  do what you got to do
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  even if it's just writing a letter
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  you don't have to be the most charismatic person
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  to try to wake someone up
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  I agree you know you get my point
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  about what you're doing is very effective
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  but at a certain point denying
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  white people medical treatment
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  because they're white which is now officially being done
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  this for me
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  I'm thinking about doing a sit-in or something
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  and getting arrested inside a hospital
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  because when you're denying black people
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  anybody medical care this is
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  seriously criminal activity in my view
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  it's scary Alex I mean the people
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  that were heroes last year
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  are now they're second-class citizens
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  I mean it's disgusting I mean absolutely
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  disgusting I have a lot
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  of compassion for anybody in the healthcare field
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  the medical workers who are told
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  you're the best ever and now you're
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  scum you're fired if you don't take the shot
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  yeah what is that what is that Alex
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  that's absolutely nuts
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  what's it like in Miami
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  because I know Florida is super awake probably
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  even more than Texas I've been there quite love Florida
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  but it seems like Miami when I've been there
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  to go on Schultz's show
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  is as bad as Austin
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  no listen yep
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  you nailed it on the head because
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  Miami and where I live Broward County
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  are very heavily
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  populated areas I mean we
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  we have people from all over the world
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  but again people are voting Democrat
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  over there I mean the schools
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  the school system I mean hospitals
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  everything I mean it is absolutely
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  nuts but everywhere else I mean once you start
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  getting out of West Palm
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  you start seeing some freedom some people that
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  are very open to
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  your options and you know they're not going to
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  sit here and bully you to do
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  what they want you to do you know they don't care
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  they want to live their life they want to do
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  what's best for them and their family
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Stephon Rivera stay there let's talk about where we
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  go next the fight for liberty straight ahead

[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  you didn't start a fight with
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  David Rockefeller you didn't start
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  a fight with the UN they started
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  a fight with you
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  and they're not going to back down
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  and they're not going to go away
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  until they have the fear of God
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  put into them the average person
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  still doesn't even know about the new world order
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  or about globalism or about corporate
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  fascism and it's not until
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  they understand that and that we're under
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  attack we have any chance of beating
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  these people
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  it's only been in the last
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  60 years that we've had satellites
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  that can decently measure
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  what's happening in the atmosphere
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  but if you look at all the different studies and reports
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  about NASA and other governments and other
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  agencies they all disagree
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  what's really happening with the climate
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  the only constant the only great truth
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  is change
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  is the only constant so yes
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  climate change is totally real
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  but notice first they called it global freezing
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  back in the 70s and 80s
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  and then it's going to be global warming
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  okay now it's just climate change
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  but did you know that man-made climate change
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  is a real thing
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  when it comes to the United Nations
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  and the Department of Energy
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  and Bill Gates and the UN
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  they have weather control treaties from 1979
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  for a very long time
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel Prize
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  for an idea of spraying different particles
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  out of jet engines to control the weather
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  so yes man-made climate change is real
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  it's time to protect your privacy
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  it's time to come to grips
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  criminals
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  hackers, corporations, big tech
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  government are stealing
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  all of your data and creating a map
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  and a database of where you go
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  and what you do so in the future
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  when your globalists take over
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  they can shut you down
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  protecting your privacy
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  protecting your photos
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount

[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  and we are back ladies and gentlemen
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  thank you so much for joining us
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  on this January 4th Tuesday edition
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  look
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  we scored together
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  it was literally together
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  I don't just say like you're part of this listeners
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  to make you feel powerful
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  you are powerful
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  I need you to get out of this
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  you need me to get out of this
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  we are truly in this together
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  I saw that fella
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  jump on national TV
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  five and a half years ago now
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  when they were saying
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Trump was a rapist with no evidence
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  so we're going to use that to get the women to not vote for him
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  and that scared the system so much
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  he even came out in court documents
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  that Hillary got so upset about that
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  because they knew their weakness
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  was Clinton's war on women
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  not just her husband but her herself
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  and so I saw that guy jump on
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Fox News and do that
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  and it wasn't a
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  rocket science move to say
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  hey, we're going to have a contest
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  $1,000 per person
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  that gets on TV
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  and points out that Bill Clinton is a rapist
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  and it started happening more and more
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  and I said oh my gosh, $5,000
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  and it happened hundreds of times
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  we didn't pay out hundreds of times
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  we stopped it at 300
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  almost $400,000
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  that didn't have the money
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  it's not about the money we're paying
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  it's about the
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  strategicallyness of this
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  taking action and calling
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  these people out
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  so we've already hit the homerun
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  the grand slam before
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  with this broadcast because of you
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  again, it's you
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  it's you, it's you, it's you
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  it's you and if you don't
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  want to have a civil war that's violent
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  if you don't want to have them turn your power off
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  and starve you out until you submit to the cultural
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  reorganization they're trying to do
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  then you better get active
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  in the streets and it ain't about $5,000
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  I just do that to put value
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  on it and to have people
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  celebrate
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  so going back to Stefan Rivera
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Coastal Championship Wrestling on
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  YouTube can find him on CCW
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Alive Wrestling Tuesday 7 p.m.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  on Coastal Championship Wrestling
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  on YouTube channel as well as professional
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  Instagram and YouTube channel StudioTime
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  FL
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  we've gone recently just won the $5,000 bounty
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  make sure they get paid today
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  for disrupting a local news report or just culture jamming
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  that's what I'd call it in Miami
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  to spread the truth about
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  the shots and the New World Origins
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  so I want to give you a few minutes here
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  and want to just recognize you for what you did again
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  you did a great job in the Bill Clinton's
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  The Rapist as well
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  but I've seen that video
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  on anything else you'd like to add
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  and then just what it was
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  if you had a few minutes on TV
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  that's the real point to get others to do it
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  so what you did is a great victory
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  but if you had a couple minutes
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  what you would say to the public to warn them
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  oh man
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  that what's going on is absolutely real
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  it's biblical
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  to a biblical proportion
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  I mean this is in your face
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  if I had a few minutes to
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  wake them up the first thing I would do
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  is try to share the gospel with them
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  that's the first thing I would do
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  woke me up and
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  that's like the most censored thing ever
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  talking about Jesus and saving
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  your soul I mean but if I could
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  get them to see what's going on in front of them
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  is the double sidedness
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  the
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  how Fauci is now
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  I mean masks, no masks
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  all that it's just it's hypocrisy
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  and I think
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  the majority of Americans
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  see right through it and that's what really makes me so happy
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  so
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  get involved if you don't have the courage
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  to get in front of a camera
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  you don't have
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  a charismatic
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  characteristic just
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  buy a covidland dvd and
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  give it to your neighbor you know
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  what I was doing was I was handing out gospel
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  tracks and I was printing
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  I was creating a qr code
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  linking directly to covidland
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  on bandah video and I would just
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  using a double sided piece of tape
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  I would stick that qr code that I would print out on my own
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  on the dvd that I would get
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  and I would just give it to as many people as I can
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  and it was pretty effective
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  and anything you can think of
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  to spread the word I mean please do it
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  you live
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  you have a very short time here on earth so
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  get to work
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  I agree and the great part about this is I talked about all the amazing people I meet
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  who love liberty
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  and most will say they're Christians others just love life
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  and don't like tyranny like Joe Rogan's come a long way
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  and I'm not like judging him but he's
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  really waking up maturing in amazing
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  ways
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  if not the top rapper in the world
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  and jiu-jitsu is Craig Jones from Australia
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  he lives here in Austin we're good friends we hang out quite a bit
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  but
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  the point is I get to know you
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  you're a great wrestler too
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  I really feel sorry for the bad guys
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  because I get to know all the greatest
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  men and women loving God
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  and loving justice and freedom like we're all
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  the cool fun people and they've got
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  all the weird little globalists like Fauci
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  it's incredible
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  they just want to control you
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  that's it
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  they want to control you they want to control every
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  aspect of your life and they have no respect for you
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  agenda 2021
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  end game I will
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  I mean forever promote this
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  film you made
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  end game I mean it outlines
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  agenda 2021 I mean 21
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  perfectly I mean

[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  saying yeah record levels of young people
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  dying
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  like way over any level ever I mean it's the

[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  I have a relative
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  took the COVID vaccine and she is right
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  now at home with COVID I mean
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  it's
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  absolutely
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  life is backwards I mean what's up is down
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  what's down is up it's
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  what do you make of the Santas you know
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  Christ said judge tree by its fruits it's one thing
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  he went to Yale and the rest of it but he's
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  a lot more than the Texas governor a lot more than
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Trump he is demanding
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  because I know they have plenty of monoclonal
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  antibodies that's on record but the Democrats are
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  withholding those from conservative states
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  and playing the race card from white people
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  what do you make of that
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  because the Santas is making a big deal about it and
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  thank God
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  I mean living in Florida
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  I mean other than
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Texas I wouldn't want to live anywhere else to be
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  honest I mean Rhonda Santas is
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  leading the way and
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  with what's going on with Trump
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  you know pushing the vaccine I mean the Santas
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  is a huge option
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  I mean you got to keep your eyes on the Santas I mean
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  if you care about this country
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  you know you'll support people like him
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  well sure and I mean the Santas is not even
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  attacking the shot but he's not out there saying
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  nobody ever had a problem
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  and it protects you once you take it
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  that's just not true and believe me
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Trump's a great asset I hate watching
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  it's like Trump's this big beautiful mansion
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  we built politically now he's burning it
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  down himself it's like a house
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  burning itself down so you know
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  that's why I'm so pissed at Trump
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  yeah me too me too I don't like
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  to see that at all
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  what are your friends what are your friends saying about
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Trump what's their what's their take on what what he's doing
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I mean a lot of them
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  they hate it they absolutely
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  hate the vaccine they don't like the mass
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  they don't like going to places that
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  you know I work in schools a lot
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  and they're they're so strict
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  I mean and it especially in South
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Florida anywhere else it's
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  in Florida it's great but
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Broward County Miami-Dade County forget about it
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Alex it's awful
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  absolutely well listen Stefan
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  I got a feeling you're going to do this again
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  you should organize groups to do it
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  because you're the first domino to fall
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  and if we catch that lighting in a bottle again
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  like we did five years ago it's going to
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  change the world but regardless you've done a great
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  job and God bless you sir
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  thank you Alex I bless you too
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  you know most
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  of my family are either
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  doctors
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  or
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  entrepreneurs or military and I guess
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  military they're all army most of my family all
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  joined the army that's what they all do
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  and nothing against the other services
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  just my family's all been in the army
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  and
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  I was in East Texas
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  over New Year's with some of my family
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  they were telling me the stories of
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  officers they know being made to take the
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  shot and how sick they're getting
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  and
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  I've never seen my family like this
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  they're like what do we do
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  what I'm like
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  we're under and they all know by the way
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  they don't even need to listen to me
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  they already were telling me how everything
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  worked and everything
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  I mean this country's under attack
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  they couldn't attack us with nuclear weapons
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  or an open assault
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  this is an attack on America
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  this is a global
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  takeover
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  and so it's my sincere wish that this contest
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  takes off and everybody confronts them
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  and exposes at the shots full of poison
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  don't believe the news to save people
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  in fact
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  if it fails and I don't get a bunch of winners
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  to pay out I'll feel bad
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  because we're paying out the winners of this
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  with the proceeds from my house being sold
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  which I'm happy to sell
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  my house
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  I'm happy to do that
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  which I did sell
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  to fund this I mean why wouldn't I want to be all in
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  but if we just got more people
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  to be all in on the fight
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  right now

[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  I'm not going to tell you a little story
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  we had one
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  you wouldn't believe it
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  so it's infowarstore.com
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  that's how we fund this operation
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  thanks for watching
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  we'll see you next time
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  and I say it strongly
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  I'm very proud of the vaccines
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  we got it done as you know Brian
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  we got it done very rapidly
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  in less than 9 months it was supposed to take 5 to 12 years
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  and they wouldn't come up
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  most likely wouldn't have come up with the right answer
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  and we have
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  3 of them great ones and great therapeutics
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  we got a lot of it done
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  but the mandates are horrible
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  and we were there at the White House
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  for Operation Warp Speed
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  like you said you rolled those bags out in record time
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  well we saved millions of lives
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  worldwide
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  don't forget in 1917
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  100 million people as many as
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  maybe 50 to 100
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  but 100 million people
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  probably died from the horrible Spanish flu
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  I think we would have been in a very similar position
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  50 to 100
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  if we didn't have the vaccines
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  all over the world
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  and in the United States
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  millions and millions more people would have died
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  it would have been a disaster
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  but the mandates
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  should not be
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  they're trying to enforce these mandates
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  and it's so bad for people
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  and for our country and so bad for business
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  outweigh the risks
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  but as the vaccine rollout now ramps up
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  through the booster phase
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  there are a rare few who suffer serious side effects
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  now the federal government
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  is offering compensation for anyone who becomes
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  seriously ill after having
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  their COVID shot
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  it's been a long road to recovery
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  for Maddie John
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  it's a really uncomfortable
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  and quite a frightening experience
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  he felt like he was having a heart attack
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  two days after getting the Pfizer vaccine
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  I just got this sharp pain
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  that I've never experienced before
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  in the centre of my chest
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  diagnosed with severe pericarditis
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  he was off work
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  for 10 weeks
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  you're constantly worrying I suppose that anxiety around
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  I suppose we're talking about your heart
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Maddie's not alone
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  it's estimated 79,000 people
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  have suffered
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  adverse reactions to vaccines
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  now the government's offering
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  compensation
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  claims under $20,000
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  will need evidence from your doctor
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  claims over $20,000
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  assessed by a team of
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  legal experts
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  the highest figure reserved for only
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  the most serious of cases
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  I think it could cost the government a lot of money
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Daniel O'Pare works at
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  nine lawyers
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  he's looked closely at the government's scheme
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  if you do suffer pericarditis
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  it can result
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  in you being out of pocket
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  you might have to see a cardiologist
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  you might need procedures
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  so it is definitely appropriate that there is a vaccination
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  scheme there to compensate those people
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  but like all schemes there are limitations
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  to make a claim
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  you must spend at least one night
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  in hospital
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  and that's the clause that makes Maddie John
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  eligible
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  he was admitted to hospital twice
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  but never stayed the night
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  it is a little bit frustrating
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  and out of pocket a fair bit
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  but in saying that too
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  it is what it is and that's life
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  the scheme is now open
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Nick Hoes
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silent
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  I want them muted, I think they are horrible for our society
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Spunning people
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  they're dictating the opinions that everyone
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  on the platform is allowed to have
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  their own opinion
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  I'm a conservative Jew
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  so I guess that makes me
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  such a dangerous person
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  spreading articles, spreading videos
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  spreading links, you're going to get demonized
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  you're going to get attacked
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  it's going to do something terrible
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  like help Trump get re-elected
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  that's really what all this is about
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  said that they deem
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  our content and our brand
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  on
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  is the right to be
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  due and say whatever you want
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  it's about freedom of expression
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  down the journalists
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  and the left not interested in telling
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  they can say whatever they think
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  I respect their constitutional right to do it
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  I hope they respect my content
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  alright folks, we've got our special guest
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Dr. Said Haider joining us
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  in studio
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  straight ahead, stay with us
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  everything we've witnessed
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  in the last few decades
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  has only been the build up
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  this is their big offensive
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  this is their takeover
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  because now they've revealed themselves
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  now they're a world government
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  they're permanent martial law
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  and their local tyranny is out in the open
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  but they're using their corporate power
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  and trillions to go across the planet
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  and shut down people telling the truth
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  so listen Paul Revere's
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  when you pray for the broadcast
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  you're the tip of the spear
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  you keep us on air

[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  they're the top five best sellers
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  they are so good for your body
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  and if there's two things you do for your body
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  it's these two products
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  they're all back in stock at infowarstore.com
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  50% off and it keeps us on the air
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  Thank you for your reaction.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  Well Dr. Said Haider is here in studio with us
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  I saw him last week on Harrison
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  and I'm busy in the morning and I watch Harrison some
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  but I don't usually like stop for an hour
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  when I'm in my office
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  I remember from a show watching the doc home
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  this guy's really well spoken
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  so I said to my producer
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  I said can we please get him on
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  they said yeah he's willing to come in studio
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  I guess he has a brother here in Austin
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  so boom all the way from Puerto Rico
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  here in studio with us
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  our second live show of 2022
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  Doctor thank you so much for coming in
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Thanks so much for having me Alex
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  I really appreciate you
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  you did an amazing job bringing things down
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  you're saying fluoxamine is the
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  biggest thing that you wanted to cover
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  so thanks for coming here
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  yeah thanks a lot for having me
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  so fluoxamine is an SSRI
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  it's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  and that basically means it affects your serotonin
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  neurotransmitters all over your body
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  so the really important thing about fluoxamine
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  is that it works great for COVID-19
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  there's a phase 3 study on fluoxamine
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  showing that if you take fluoxamine
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  at least 80% of the prescribed doses
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  you have a 12 times lower risk of dying
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  than if you don't take fluoxamine for COVID-19
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  and I think the most interesting
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  thing about fluoxamine to talk about
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  with your viewers
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  is that a lot of people
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  end up in the hospital nowadays
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  and they call me and tell me I've got COVID
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  it's really bad and the doctor won't give me ivermectin
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  they won't give me hydroxychoroquine
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  I know all these things work for COVID
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  and they just refuse to give it to me
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  theoretically if a patient were to tell their doctor
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  in the hospital that hey doc
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  I used to have depression for years
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  I used to take fluoxamine 15 milligrams
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  twice a day I know it's kind of a weird dose
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  for depression but that's what my doctor gave me
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  I did great on it, I wasn't depressed
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  and then I decided to go off of it
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  against my doctor's advice
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  I've been off of it for about a year now
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  and I've been getting really depressed in the last couple of months
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  can you put me back on fluoxamine
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  I don't know a single doctor in America
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  who won't buy that story and give a patient fluoxamine
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  and it's really sad that patients have to go
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  to these lengths
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  I'm glad we're jumping right into it
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  what have you thought the last two years of this
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  and just you're a medical doctor
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  very respected I should have done your old bio
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  we just jumped right into it
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  Dr. C. Hyder is a doctor
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  who specializes in internal medicine
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  who treated 35,000 pages
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  over 4,000 with active COVID infections
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  resulting in zero deaths
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  as only five hospitalizations
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  that is incredible
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  over 30,000 were given ongoing preventative ivermectin
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  of those who took ivermectin
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  to prevent catching COVID
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  less than 10 returned with active COVID infections
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  with the breaking news
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  the USPS and FDA
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  that's why I wanted to get you on
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  and the FDA are colluding to withhold
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  overseas ivermectin shipments
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  to America
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Dr. Said Hyder is working
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  to
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  work with this crisis
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  and by sourcing the cheapest
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  U.S. mail order pharmaceuticals in each state
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  this bold action will provide Americans
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  with the best saving drug
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  before they get sick so they are ready
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  for treatment on day one
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  of symptoms go to
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  mygo2.com
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  so that's why I wanted you on
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  you got here so quick I'm like damn
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  you were on really laying out how they're not trying to stop
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  what's it called?
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  Interstate commas they're not interfering
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  with interstate shipments of ivermectin
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  but overseas ivermectin they are seizing at the border
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  so they're trying to block that
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  so I didn't mean to tell you
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  let's finish up with the fluvoxamine
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  if I'm saying that right
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  and why we think it's working on
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  covid and then why they're trying to block it
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  and then back to the other subject
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  sure so fluvoxamine works for covid
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  in a number of different ways so it does
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  it stabilizes platelets so they don't dump serotonin
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  into the bloodstream and this
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  actually can nip the cytokine
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  storm in the bud so it can stop the cytokine
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  storm it also acts on the sigma
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  1 receptor it's an anti-inflammatory receptor
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  and I just want to kind of mention
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  that you know I I hesitated
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  to even prescribe fluvoxamine because
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  you know it does affect brain neurochemistry
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  but that only really kicks in after
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  four to six weeks and you only need to use it for two weeks
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  for covid 19
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  plus it's good not to die
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  yeah it's always good to stay alive
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  so I haven't really seen a lot of side effects
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  with fluvoxamine it's really really rare people do
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  really well on fluvoxamine especially
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  with this short two week course so I highly
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  recommend it to all my patients and I have
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  I haven't seen anyone who took
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  fluvoxamine within the first five days of
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  covid 19 who even got worse
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  after that point no one was hospitalized
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  who took it in the first five days and so are you saying
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  fluvoxamine is even better than ivermectin
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  so you know they were
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  they were compliment the complimentary
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  to each other right but
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  I do think fluvoxamine probably has
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  even stronger data than ivermectin ivermectin
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  has incredible data for covid 19
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  and there's a lot more studies of ivermectin
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  but fluvoxamine has some really
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  powerfully really well done studies
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  and I can't think of any other drug that you can
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  say if you take the doses as
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  prescribed you'll have a 12 times lower risk
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  of dying than if you don't and that just shows how
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  powerful SSRIs are in the brain
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  this thing can completely block a virus
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  imagine what it does on the other
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  side of your brain this is powerful so that's
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  a really good point so ivermectin actually doesn't
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  cross the blood brain barrier that's another reason
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  to add fluvoxamine to ivermectin because it goes
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  into the brain it addresses inflammation
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  inside your brain which ivermectin will not do
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  and you talked about the studies because
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  it's not just you I was already hearing from
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  all these scientists I respect hey fluvoxamine
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  you got to cover fluvoxamine I'm like
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  and then I see you on the year coming how they're
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  trying to suppress it this is amazing
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  it's absolutely amazing and and the
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  other good point is that fluvoxamine is actually
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  on the Johns Hopkins treatment guidelines
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  for covid now and it's still not on the NIH
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  NIH guidelines it's not in the FDA guidelines
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  so the FDA
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  they're not even trying to block it right now
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  so it's just so they're
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  not they're not putting it on the guidelines just
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  the Johns Hopkins guidelines have it but
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  you know so Steve Kershbank rolled the fluvoxamine
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  trials and what he discovered was that when he
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  tried when he just when he got through phase
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  three studies no he couldn't
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  find a pharmaceutical company that would present
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  the data the FDA for him and he had to find
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  a pharmaceutical company because the FDA
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  won't take it from private citizen
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  so so that I mean that I think that's just
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  ridiculous you know he spent millions of
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  dollars to take it through phase one two
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  and three studies he's got all the data that
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  he needs for an emergency use authorization
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  and yet he need he can't
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  find a pharmaceutical company willing to do it
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  and why not because they're not going to make any money
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  and isn't Steve Kershbank a great guy
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  he is absolutely doing these studies and then
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  and they don't want it because they won't make money
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  yeah so our system is just totally broken
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  right you know we know that we have drugs
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  really cheap dirt cheap drugs and what could be
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  better we ivermectin can be had for
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  like less like a cent per dose right you can
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  make it for one cent per dose
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  and you know fluvoxamine is cheap
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  hydroxychloroquine is cheap
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  budesonite inhalers are cheap and it's just a
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  steroid inhaler it's been around for decades
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  all these drugs have incredible safety profiles
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  ivermectin especially I mean it's the
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  safest drug I can think of literally
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  it's safer than Tylenol which is the leading
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  cause of liver failure safer than ibuprofen
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  which is known to cause like heart failure
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  I mean there's no other drug that's as
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  safe as ivermectin fluvoxamine
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  is safe enough to use for COVID for
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  almost anyone I very rarely see
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  side effects of fluvoxamine.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  It's amazing you came here to be with some person
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  I really appreciate it and so don't put the
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  carpet for the horse but do we know
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  chemically what ivermectin does versus
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  fluvoxamine and why they work so well?
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  Yeah so ivermectin actually so
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  so they both actually have anti-inflammatory
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  effects different kinds of anti-inflammatory
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  effects but they address specific inflammatory
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  cytokines that are raised by COVID-19
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  so ivermectin affects it in lukin-6
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  fluvoxamine hits the sigma-1
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  receptor so they're actually
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  better than using steroids for COVID we
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  know steroids work for COVID-19 because
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  there's a there's a viral replication phase
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  then there's an inflammatory phase so ivermectin
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  will give you some anti-viral effects
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  fluvoxamine actually also has some anti-viral
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  effects that are not really talked about much
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  but it affects the acid sphingomyelinase
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  enzyme and it prevents
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  entry of COVID-19 into cells
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  ivermectin does the same thing it prevents
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  entry of COVID-19 into your cells
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  it binds to the spike protein
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  and so the point I wanted to get to
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  was that steroids are kind of broad
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  spectrum immunosuppressants and so they
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  they're kind of like carpet bombing right like
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  instead of like you want like targeted
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  action that you get with ivermectin and
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  fluvoxamine.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  Wow so we've seen again huge
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  resistance against ivermectin
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  I've seen some against the fluvoxamine
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  but you're the expert what's happening there
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  yeah so I mean the the the worst
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  thing with fluvoxamine is that no one's
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  talking about it right like you had a couple
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  of news articles when the phase two trials
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  but it should really be
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  approved by the NIH
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  the CDC should be talking about it
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  it should be on the official guidelines
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  and that's why we're here you're like hey
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  yeah I'll make a big deal out of ivermectin
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  and how they're trying to block it but that's yesterday's battle
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  we're almost kind of winning that war
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  we need to get fluvoxamine out there.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Absolutely we do need to get fluvoxamine out there
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  and like I said before you know I've had patients
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  come to me from the hospital
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  I had this elderly gentleman in the hospital
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  and this was his story his son had to smuggle
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  an ivermectin to him okay he was on a ventilator
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  okay his doctor was saying he's gonna
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  probably die in a few days he started
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  ivermectin he was better within a couple of days
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  and he was being discharged his roommate was
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  also on a ventilator okay his roommate
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  saw what had just happened the last three days
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  with him asked him if he could take
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  the rest of his ivermectin so his roommate gets the rest
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  of his ivermectin he gets better in a couple
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  of days comes off the ventilator he gets discharged
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  now they're fast friends but
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  they had to act like secret agents to treat
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  COVID-19 you know with effective drugs.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  That's the story you were telling I wanted you on about
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  but then it's philoxamines even bigger let's
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  come back and start off Doc wherever
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  you want thank you so much for coming to town sir
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  we'll be right back.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  I never compromise the quality
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  of ingredients we put in m4's live products
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  and that's why for more than two years
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  and we could never get the ingredients
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  again until now and we have
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  reformulated and not just used the same
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  ingredients we've boosted it and
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  made them even stronger so out

[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  this and I've taken your B12
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  and let me tell you when I don't take it
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  I pay a price I really do
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  I take that B12 and I am
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  electric man I can run 10 miles
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  I did some pretty heavy work
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  with a highway department and
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  my friends will attest to the fact that
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  yeah for a guy in his
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  60s you know pushing 70
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  and I'm not just blowing
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  smoke here the B12 saves my life
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  let's go ahead and take another call
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  welcome hello Alex yes Malcolm
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  alright I will make this quick and real short
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  where the other patrons can get on the line
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  uh Alex I have to promote one thing
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  from one of your co-host Owen Schreuer
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  super male volatility
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  and brain force plus mix those two together
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  you're an unstoppable tank
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  super male volatility really really works
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  it's cold pressed herbs
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  and natural compounds that have never
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  been heated up and so it has
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  a dramatic effect compared
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  to powdered versions that also work
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  quite well but just aren't as strong
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  this is like a very fine wine
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  in fact each batch is different
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  people are like why are you selling something
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  that's just how it is it's how it works
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  so it's always good
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  it's just sometimes it's like super strong
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  at a decent price then this is it
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  for almost 28 years
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  against the globalist I wanted to stop
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  their agenda I wanted to wake up
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  the world and stop them
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  dead in their tracks before they went operation
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  but we failed
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  because a lot of people are awake
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  but they are going ahead
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  with their full operational
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  deindustrialization great reset
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  and that's why it's more important than ever
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  than all viewers and all listeners
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  tell everybody they know about the show
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  because people are ready to wake up
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  and ready to hear the truth
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  so we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  and trying to stop their agenda
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  and we've also got to get personally prepared
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  and one of the number one things to do
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  is get very affordable prices
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  at infowarstore.com
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  or specialty diets it's ready to ship
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  right now lock your orders in
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  before food prices go up
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  and before there are long lines and waits
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  because believe me serious times are coming
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  get ready at infowarstore.com
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  alright welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Dr. Saeed Hyder is our guest
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  medical doctor
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  treated over 35,000 patients in his career
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  4,000 with active
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  covid infections and
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  he's just been really doing a great job
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  exposing what's happening
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  and if you just joined us he was getting a flu voxamine
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  but also what's happening
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  suppressing ivermectin but as you said
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  ivermectin's got a lot of attention
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  Rolling Stone ran fake stories
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  about thousands sick and dying
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  in Oklahoma from taking it none of it was true
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  it was a fake story but you're saying
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  flu voxamine they're not even denying
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  this on John Hopkins who's like
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  one of the head grips there they're actually
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  admitting that it's giving people a 12
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  times better chance
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  of surviving covid that is
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  insane that we haven't heard about this
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  so thank god you're bringing it up
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  absolutely so
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  they're not so much accepting
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  that it works i mean they do
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  every time you have a study that comes out
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  and shows that a drug works for covid-19
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  they always look for
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  some kind of drawback they try to punch holes in it somehow
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  with flu voxamine it causes some
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  side effects and
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  some people weren't able to take it because it causes some nausea
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  so in the group that took at least
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  80% of the doses there was a 12
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  times lower risk of dying but not everyone
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  could take 80% of the doses or more
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  so this brings up another point
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  that if you can't take flu voxamine
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  you can actually take prozac instead so 30mg
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  of prozac works just like flu voxamine
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  it does exactly the same thing
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  it's better tolerated actually you know
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  people have less side effects from it
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  less nausea it's easier to remember
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  you know everyone can remember prozac
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  it's a famous drug so
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  if you want to put one drug in your mind
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  you know in case you're in a hospital to ask for
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  from a doctor it would probably be prozac
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  that works really well
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  and the systems used to pushing that so you're like sure take that
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  yeah absolutely I mean
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  we're not doing it for the 3-4 weeks it takes to kick in
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  it's being done chemically
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  for other things so yeah it has other effects
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  other than the effects on the brain
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  and your serotonin receptors in your brain
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  that's not really what we're targeting and it doesn't have
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  those psychological effects so you don't need to worry
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  that you're taking like a psychiatric drug
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  to change the way you think or the way you feel
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  it's not going to give you anxiety or depression or anything
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  and it works like a shot
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  as you said antidepressants were not read doctor
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  depending on the drug but 2-5 weeks right to kick in
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  yeah 2-5 weeks to kick in
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  I mean I'm not a big fan of antidepressants anyway
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  I never prescribed antidepressants to patients
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  you know I would continue them
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  if they were already on them because people get used to these drugs
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  their brains actually get used to them
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  it's kind of like a crutch and I think
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  you know if you look at some of the
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  books that have come out like the emperor's new drugs
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  you know back you know 10-20 years ago now
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  they do suggest that
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  these drugs may actually make outcomes worse for depression
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  oh absolutely
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  but the point is it's funny how one thing
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  satan creates the suppressant control
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  ends up being good on the other end
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  yeah I mean it's kind of like the internet itself
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  it was created by the department of defense
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  you know I don't really support a lot of things that they do
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  in terms of the wars that they fight
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  but you know
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  and the same with like the deep state and the CIA
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  you know there's a lot of things that I wouldn't support that they do
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  but the internet can be used for good as well
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  as bad
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  exactly people think the internet was created for freedom
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  it was created to control people actually
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  if you read the documents in the early 60s
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  I don't doubt it
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  surveillance grid yeah
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  and then it ended up getting turned for good
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  now it's kind of a battle right now
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  absolutely and I think this is a big battle actually
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  and it kind of like points to an overarching
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  kind of theme that you know
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  that we're dealing with in America and around the world
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  you know the rise of authoritarianism
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  and totalitarianism and this is
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  you know they're coming for
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  you know our children now
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  they're coming for our medical autonomy
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  they're coming for physician autonomy
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  I mean they're really forcing everyone
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  to just fall in line
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  and you know lockstep and you know
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  physicians are afraid of speaking out
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  you know I'm able to speak out
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  because I'm not
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  no one owns me right
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  like I'm an independent practitioner
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  you know patients pay me directly
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  they don't even have to go through insurance right
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  whereas doctors who work in large healthcare systems
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  they often send me their patients
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  and their patients tell me
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  my doctor sent me to you because he wanted to prescribe
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  every medicine he could not his hands were tied
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  he would have been fired you know he has to put food
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  on the table he's worried about his family
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  and this is just a terrible place that we're in
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  right and we need to take back
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  our freedoms from our government
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  I totally agree and that's why you've got
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  mygo2doctor.com
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  so it's mygo2doc.com
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  mygo2doc.com
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  mygo2doc.com
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  and I guess that's the whole future
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  that's one good thing Trump did was make it where I guess
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  doctors across the United States
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  wonder where they are
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  to be people's physicians right
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  yeah so I mean people look
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  at the regulations a little bit differently
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  at the federal government level with the COVID-19 pandemic
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  they allowed physicians to
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  see you know patients anywhere in the country
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  but at the state level you know medical
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  boards still require that a physician be licensed
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  in their state to see a patient in their
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  state and this is kind of like a stumbling block
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  because it's really difficult to get licensed in every
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  single state I mean I do have some COVID
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  waivers and probably like 25 states
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  at this point and people should be able to go to whoever they want
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  they should be able to and you know I've had patients
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  you know basically you just got to tell
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  a doctor that you're in a state
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  that he's licensed in and he'll be able to treat you online
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  so you know even if you know
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  doctors aren't like detectives I'm not trying
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  to figure out where you live or ask you
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  let's spend a few minutes on you because everybody calls me constantly saying
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  where are good online doctors for me to
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  talk to you where do I get advice
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  mygo2doc.com
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  yeah so the great thing about our website
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  is that you go to some other websites and
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  you can only talk to the doctor
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  for like a week or two and then you have to pay again
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  if you need to ask them another question
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  with us you can actually register for free
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  you can ask any question as many questions as you want
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  for the rest of your life basically indefinitely
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  without any charge okay so
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  so information should be free and it is free
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  but you need like I think it's
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  important to have a gatekeeper go to somebody you trust
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  yeah it's not free to have the website
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  and pay for everything and then pay the rent
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  and do it so how are you
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  so I do charge people
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  for prescriptions but again if you
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  can't afford a prescription you can ask for a discount
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  and if you're really hard up for
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  money just ask us to waive our fee
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  and you'll still have to pay the pharmacy for the medication
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  so that's to be clear other mainline
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  corporate pharmacies are trying to deny
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  people ivermectin
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  and fluvoxamine and all this
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  and then people that are almost ashamed
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  and then we're sorry we charge if we do this
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  I mean we should be
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  the future you should
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  launch pharmacies across the country
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  what we need is to innovate here
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  yeah so I gotta clarify so doctors
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  prescribe drugs right
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  the pharmacist dispenses them and this is
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  where we ran into trouble right like I don't own
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  the pharmacy and I can't own a pharmacy right doctors
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  you're just sending people to a pharmacy
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  and that's a really important issue because we used
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  to send people to CVS because they had the cheapest source
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  of ivermectin you could go and get like
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  good rx prescription for really cheap ivermectin
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  at CVS and then the pharmacist
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  were not allowed to dispense it anymore
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  so some of them wanted to and they could not
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  so now basically all the chain pharmacies
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  won't give you ivermectin so we had to
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  go to mail order pharmacies and
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  we did the work this is the other special thing
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  about us we called
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  probably thousands of pharmacies at this point
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  all over the country looking for the cheapest possible
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  sources of real human grade
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  ivermectin okay so I had patients
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  come to me from other pharmacies that they had been
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  sent to telling me that they were going to be charged
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  like seven hundred to a thousand dollars for a five
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  day course of ivermectin
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  we all of our pharmacies
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  I have crew members that have families
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  living like North Carolina they were trying to charge
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  them three thousand dollars for it
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  yeah it's money grabbing right yeah
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  absolutely price gouging
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  some of the pharmacies you know they only have
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  expensive ivermectin some of them may be price gouging
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  all of our pharmacies you can get a
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  14 day course not even a five day course
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  but 14 days for less than $150
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  sometimes it's $80 sometimes it's $100
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  if you really insist on just five
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  days it'll probably be less than 50 bucks
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  I think everyone needs at least 14 days total
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  on hand in case you need to take it
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  for longer than five days
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  well I've stockpiled it I mean I saved
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  I had people I knew almost died without it
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  yeah I mean they got from 82
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  oxygens to 90 oxygens and within five hours on it
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  yeah so I get this I hear this a lot
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  people take it and within hours they can
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  feel better you know and sometimes they'll even
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  feel it wearing off like they know exactly
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  what it's doing in their body they can tell
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  they get better and then they're like doc it's starting
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  to wear off and I just tell them take it again
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  wearing off take it again keep taking it
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  stay there doc I want to because
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  I've been kind of leaving this discussion
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  but you're the expert I want to get back
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  to philoxamine because that's the big one
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  that's not getting attention we all know about
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  ivermectin then I want to tell the story
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  which you've been covering first hand accounts
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  it's also in the news that they're not looking
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  for fentanyl in the mail coming in from overseas
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  they're looking for ivermectin
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  that never has killed anybody
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  so I mean it sounds like aspirin
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  is more dangerous than this we'll be right
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  back as you know two-year-old shouldn't be
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  taking aspirin folks we'll be right back stay with us

[2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  So
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  when I first started taking survival skill
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.000]  basically I was 275 pounds
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  I was overweight I had brain fog
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  on to a job and I heard Dr.
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  Shoe and I listened to it so the first one I got
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  was the original survival skill the X1
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  and it worked pretty good and then
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  shortly thereafter you came out with that too
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  you had you know with a deep burn source you know
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  and I got really excited about that so I took it
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  and man in two weeks I went from
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  brain fog to like literally like
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  my brain was enlightened
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  you know I could think again I could
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  connect with people again and over the
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  course of the next couple of years
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  I got my health back and I religiously
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  took basically all of your supplements
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  they're all absolutely amazing supplements
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  the one I like recently is knockout
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  it's amazing it works but anyways
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  that's a break free of the globalist
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  system and the only way to do that is to take
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  our own health into our own hands
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:06.000]  for calling Godspeed

[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  he's going to be covering those huge issues
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  in the first hour of the war room
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  coming up here in about an hour
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  and 27 minutes from now
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  all Joseph Watson from England will be
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  hosting the fourth hour today
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  but I mean I watched
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  the full interview with him and Harrison Smith
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  it was just riveted by it about
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  because he's a doctor
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  like these other doctors we've had on
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  that is simply trying to prescribe people
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  medication to help them and so he knows the inside
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  baseball of how they're trying to suppress
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  things like ivermectin it's so criminal
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  to watch them block the monoclonal antibodies
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  to watch them block the ivermectin
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  to watch them try to stop
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  all of this and then he gets into fluvoxamine
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  and how big a story that is
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  it looks like again they're synergistic
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  but statistically almost
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  even better than the ivermectin
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  again I'm not endorsing SSRIs
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  neither is he it's like that's how powerful
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  they are they cause such huge changes
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  that you know it blocks it
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  and we're not how about long term here so
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  I could ask a million questions
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  but just continue from wherever you want
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  with the fluvoxamine
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  and that or with the suppression of ivermectin
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  and just so much more doc
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  yeah so
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  yeah just going back to fluvoxamine
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  I just wanted to point out that
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  you know depression is the only
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  comorbidity or coexisting
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  illness that lowers your risk
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  from COVID-19 that that's actually
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  kind of one of the first signals that we saw
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  that made us think about SSRIs for COVID-19
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  every other illness
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  that you might have worsens your risk
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  from COVID-19 except for depression and that's because
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  a lot of depressed patients are on
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  SSRIs like fluvoxamine
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  fluvoxamine is just like fluvoxamine and prozac
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  are the best out of the SSRIs
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  so actually a lot of them have effects
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  on the Sigma-1 receptor and they have anti-inflammatory
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  effects and they work for COVID and they work
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  to prevent COVID-19
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  I mean just recently one of my patients had
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  an outbreak
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  she's been on fluvoxamine twice a day
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  for psychiatric reasons but also
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  to prevent catching COVID-19
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  and to prevent getting really sick from it
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  she was the only person in her workplace
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  who did not come down with COVID-19
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  and I attribute she was on ivermectin
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  and fluvoxamine both nowadays
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  and when I went through infections with patients
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  who are on ivermectin twice a week
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  I would not recommend fluvoxamine long-term again
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  for preventing COVID-19
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  you don't really need to use it like that
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  but what's really important to know
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  is that you need to start treatment really early
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  you need to start right away
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  and you need to have a game plan
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  you need to print out the directions from a doctor
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  you need to have the medications in your medicine cabinet
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  don't wait until you get sick
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  because it'll just take too long
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  you're gonna try to sign up that might take a day
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  but at that point
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  you talk about heroes like
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  Dr. Bartlett and others
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  I literally had a bunch of my crew
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  a bunch of family six, eight months ago in Texas
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  all almost dead
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  and he was literally on the phone trying to find pharmacies
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  that would give us the steroids
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  and give us the ivermectin
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  and as soon as I gave it to my dad
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  my mom, my friends, others
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  it was like dramatic and I made me so angry
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  that they were trying to suppress this
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  I've had this experience talking to pharmacists
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  I'm like, you know, cajoling them
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  and just trying to like, you know,
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  beg them to give ivermectin to patients
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  and some of the pharmacists are like, you know
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  they're telling me, okay, well
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  I think this is too high of a dose, it's too dangerous
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  if you're willing to drop the dose, I'll go ahead and prescribe it
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  and I'm just telling them, you know
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  are you their doctor?
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  are you treating them?
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  do you have a medical license?
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  plus, has ivermectin ever killed anybody?
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  so maybe once
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  and the only way ivermectin could get
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  it's been given like a billion times
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  okay, in the last 40 years
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  this is like the super drug
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  possibly, I don't think it's ever killed anyone
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  but if it did, right, there may have been one death
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  from ivermectin and the only thing
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  that can kill you with ivermectin is if you have
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  a really terrible widespread
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  parasitic infection, so if you have
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  parasites in your brain and your liver
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  and your heart, you know, they die in rot
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  they die and that causes inflammation
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  that harms you
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  this does not happen in the United States
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  at this point, I've probably prescribed ivermectin
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  more than most physicians in the world
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  especially more than most physicians in the US
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  I mean, 35,000 patients
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  have taken ivermectin at my hands
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  well, the reason I knew that is I read about some of these amoebas
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  that are in Texas water at the end of the summer
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  that sometimes they're in the brain
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  and they take the antibiotic, it kills them
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  but then that causes toxins
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  it causes inflammation basically
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  and the inflammation can be bad for your organs
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  I have never seen anyone in the United States
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  have a widespread enough
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  parasitic infection where an antiparasitic drug
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  would cause them serious side effects
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  like that
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Wow, so what a, as a medical doctor
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  who has the Hippocratic Oath, what is it like
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  to watch big pharma and control your profession?
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  So it's really sad, you know, I think
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  what you have to realize is this has been
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  going on for decades and now it's
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  just coming out into the open and I think that's one of
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  the, you know, the hidden blessings or the silver linings
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  of this pandemic is that the wool has been
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  pulled over people's eyes for decades
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  and now it's been removed and a lot of
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  people have started to wake up and realize the truth
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  they've been red-pilled, you know, a lot of doctors
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  you know, a lot of people, you know, they
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  took the first and the second dose of the vaccine
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  and then, you know, they start hearing about
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  countries where they're giving like a fourth and a fifth
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  and a sixth dose and now it's going to be like
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  maybe every six months or every three months
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  and, you know, there's data coming out that, you know, the vaccines
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  for Omicron may only work for a month
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  and then, you know, become negatively effective
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  after 90 days, you know, where it's actually
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  makes you more likely to catch the disease
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  Yeah, the Israeli government's like, it lasts one month
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  and you're gonna do it, like
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Absolutely, so this is, you know, this is terrible
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  you know, it just
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  baffles me, right, so like Ivermectin
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  you can, Ivermectin is actually
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  mostly used in the U.S.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  off-label for scabies, okay
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  so you can give Ivermectin off-label for scabies
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  which is mostly like
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  annoying, it's not dangerous, it's not
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  deadly disease, but you can
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  give it off-label for COVID-19
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  it just doesn't make sense, it does not compute, right
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  they actually
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  give Ivermectin for scabies to people
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  who don't even have scabies, like in nursing homes
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  you have a scabies outbreak, they treat the entire
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  nursing home with Ivermectin
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  Remember it came with all the migrants coming across the border last year
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  that the government was giving them the Ivermectin
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  Right, I mean, it's just
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  an incredibly safe drug, so when you have the FDA
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  tweeting out these, you know, like
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  ridiculous tweets about horse medicine
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  and y'all shouldn't be taking it and all this stuff
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  just, it just doesn't
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  Again, you said it earlier, but go slow
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  cause I'm on a doctor like you, what does Ivermectin do?
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  Yeah, so Ivermectin obviously
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  we're not using it for the antiparasitic
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  effects, I'm not saying that COVID-19 is a
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  parasitic infection, no, absolutely not
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  COVID-19 is a virus and it has antiviral
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  effects, so Ivermectin binds to the spike protein
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  it prevents the spike protein
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  from combining with the ACE2
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  receptor, which it needs to combine with
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  in order to enter your body's cells
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  So whatever mechanism it uses to kill worms and stuff
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  also blocks virus?
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  No, no, no, it's got different mechanisms to treat
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  COVID-19, so it works in a different way
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  for parasites and a different way for COVID-19
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  So like I'm saying, the spike protein
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  is on the surface of COVID-19, right?
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  The spike protein is what
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  binds to your body's cells, it binds
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  to the ACE2 receptor on your body's cells
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  and once it binds
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  it can enter your body's cells, so it's kind of
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  like sticking a key into a lock
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Ivermectin blocks that key so that it can't
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  go into the lock and it can't get
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  into the door, it can't get into your body
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Cause I put the superglue in the lock
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  It's incredible, I mean it basically prevents
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  the virus from attacking your body
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  It like bounces off of you
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  You know, it's like you're a superman
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  The virus can infect you
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  I've heard doctors that have said Ivermectin is anti-cancer
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  I don't want to get you in trouble saying that, but
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  I've heard this too, I haven't really looked into it that much
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  because I've been so focused on COVID-19
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  and it kind of brings me up to another point that's really important
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  Some other websites you go to, they have doctors
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  who are like, you know, they're cardiologists
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  or they're dermatologists or they're plastic surgeons
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  and they just have to
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  get these people to prescribe Ivermectin
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  because there's like, no one is willing to do it
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  So they don't always have
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  you know, the most up-to-date knowledge
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  or they don't have a lot of experience because they're doing this kind of part-time
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  you know, sometimes they're doing it in their parking lots
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  you know, from their phones and their cars
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  in the middle of traffic and that's great
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  because we need that, you know, there's only a couple hundred doctors
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  in the country who are actually prescribing this stuff
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  for patients
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  Well, I was about to say, they'll give a 12 year old
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  a day after, morning after pill
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  that's super toxic, that's okay
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  but then something that doesn't ever cause any problems
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  you can't get
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  I mean, not just that, I mean, the worst thing that's happening in our country
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  one of the worst things is that we're giving kids
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  you know, hormone treatments to change their sex
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  their gender identity or you know
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  to try to, you know, turn men into women
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  and women into men, you know, they're not even men or women yet
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  they're boys and girls, right?
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  They can't make their choice yet
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  Their brain's heavy to even, you know, gotten to the point
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  we don't even let them drink yet, right?
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  We don't let them, you know, go to work
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  You're gonna be on the war room, too, coming up at 3 p.m. central
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  but we got another segment left here
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  wow, this guy is awesome
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Dr. C. E. Heider
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  and the best place to find his great work is
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  MyGoToDoc.com
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  that's
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  M-Y-G-O-T-O-D-O-C.com
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  MyGoToDoc.com
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Wow, live saving information
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  ladies and gentlemen, stay with us
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  Everything we've witnessed
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  in the last few decades has only been
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  the build up
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  this is their big offensive
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  this is their takeover
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  because now they've revealed themselves
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  now they're a world government
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  their permanent martial law
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  but they're using their corporate power
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  and trillions to go across the planet
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  and shut down people telling the truth
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  so listen, Paul Revere's
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  when you spread the word about the broadcast
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  when you pray for the broadcast
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  you keep us on air
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  that are back in stock 50% off
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  X2 and Winter Sun
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  both of these are on our top 5 best sellers
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  they are so good for your body
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  and if there's two things you do for your body
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  it's these two products
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  they're all back in stock at m4warstore.com
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  50% off and it keeps us on the air
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  only way we fail is if you don't take action
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  is still unaware
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  that there's a war between free individuals
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  and nation states
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  on one side and the globalist on the other
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  who are literally trying to create
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  a post-human world
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  from the United States to Brazil
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  and of course triggered by the Briggs in the UK
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  nations were pulling out of the private
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  corporate fascist world government
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  that's why they launched their great pre-set
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  and they're programing for collapsing us
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  of Build Back Better
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  this is nothing more than
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  a top-down vertical
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  consolidation of the world economy
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  and because they couldn't take our guns
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  and because we wouldn't bow
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  because the left
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  which is the ideology of this world government system
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  couldn't win
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  they released a biological weapon on us
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  now we know two years ago
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  we learned about it about 20 months ago
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  it's that simple they can't meet
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  it's because of our free speech and our guns
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  so the global corporate combine
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  expose this paradigm and we win
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  it's that
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  real organic
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  cocoa bean powder
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  with natural chocolate flavor
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  and a touch of sea salt
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  it even takes better than last formula
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  and again it has that cutting edge

[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  Dr. C. Hyder
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  is our guest
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  and you're here with your brother
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  you got another brother to look for
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  and also I want to invite you back anytime
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  you want to come on with the show ends
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  you're going to be on in about an hour
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  and 10 minutes with Owen Schreuer
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  but you are on fire during the break
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  you're doing a great job on air obviously
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  but let them have it the mask
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  the children you got a lot to say
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  I'm going to start this segment
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  in the name of God the most merciful
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  the most compassionate and I think
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  the reason is that
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  all good things start with the remembrance
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  of the Lord and it reminds us
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  that we need to have some compassion
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  for our fellow citizens
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  who have been brainwashed right
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  and it brings, we were talking about
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Matthias Desmet during the break
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  he's a psychiatrist out of Europe
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  he's talked about mass formation
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  that kind of explains why
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  it's allowing things that make no sense to happen
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  and so what he points out is that
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  if you have in a society
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  you have these elements at place
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  what you need to have is free
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  kind of like a generalized free-floating anxiety
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  where people tend to be really anxious
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  and as a physician I see this all the time
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  I mean half of my elderly patients
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  are on anti-anxiety drugs
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  and basically half of all my patients
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  at least are on anti-anxiety drugs
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  so this is a big problem in the United States
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  you have to have free-floating frustration
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  in the 1920s I did 10 years ago
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  why do my wife have to work
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  and I have to work and we need
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  we're just getting behind every year
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  so there's a lot of frustration in the society
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  the other thing that you need is lack of social connection
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  the internet and social media
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  have really removed us
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  from in-person social connections
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  that we used to have
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  and then the last thing that you need is
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  kind of like an attack on your pre-existing institutions
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  which we've had in the last few years in America
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  and lack of meaning and sense
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  anymore the world doesn't make sense anymore
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  why are we attacking our history
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  why are we tearing down the names of our high schools
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  and Klaus Schwab says that
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  we are making them angry to control them
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  right so when you have these
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  four elements then
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  if somebody brings you something
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  terrible like COVID-19
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  those things latch on to COVID-19
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  so the anxiety latches on to COVID-19
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  and then you give people a way to deal
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  with that anxiety like okay
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  put on a mask it's gonna make me feel better
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  that it's gonna help me you know lockdowns
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  are gonna help us defeat this existential threat
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  right so that
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  people's anxiety latches on to it
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  and they do these ridiculous things that
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  oftentimes make no sense and we knew
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  right from the start that lockdowns made no sense
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  we knew in April of 2020
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  without a doubt
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  we had studied it in 50 countries
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  they had no correlation with outcomes
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  and since then 40 studies have come out
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  showing that lockdowns don't work
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  they don't stop the spread of the virus
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  they don't exercise the power
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  absolutely and the only people
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  the only reason people go along with it
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  is because of this like mass psychosis
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  basically it's called mass formation
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  you know Matthias Desmet came up with this terminology
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  but it's essentially like a mass psychosis
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  I call it mass Stockholm syndrome
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  absolutely it looks a lot like Stockholm syndrome
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  you know you just keep abusing these people
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  and they become even more and more focused
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  on following the directions
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  and so the important thing is to realize that
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  30% of people go down this path
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  of brainwash, you can't talk to them
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  they have this glazed look in their eye
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  if you bring up things that go against the narrative
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  they just can't deal with it
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  30% are kind of awake
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  like Alex Jones, like all you out there
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  they realize what's going on
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  they can still think critically for themselves
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  they can evaluate new information
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  change their opinions, change their beliefs
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  based on scientific proof and evidence
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  and then 40% of people are kind of on the fence
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  they can go either way
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  and we need to target those 40%
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  like Alex Jones is doing here
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  that's what people are doing on Info Wars
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  that's what people are doing on alternative media
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  all over the place, all over the country
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  How great is it seeing Joe Rogan fully awake now
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  he's really starting to get...
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  Absolutely, it's incredible
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  and this is what we need to do
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  we need to target these people like Joe Rogan
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  and other people who are kind of on the fence
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  and we need to wake them up
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  and when they wake up it makes a huge difference
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  because he's got viewership of millions of people
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  so this is incredible stuff that's happening
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  avoid the 30% who are asleep
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  and they're not going to wake up
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  they're just going to take the blue pill
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  I agree doctor, don't beat your head against them
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  go for the people who are kind of ready for that red pill
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  and talk to them, show them segments
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  that you think might convince them
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  maybe have somebody else talk to them
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  if you've talked to them too much
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  you've got to kind of be smart about it
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  Let me ask you this question, you're a smart guy
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  how does the big pharma corrupt system strike back
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  because right now their narrative is collapsing
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  I see victory, but I've lived long enough to see
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  when they're waking up and finally coming together
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  they've got another trick
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  What are they going to do next?
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  At this point they have to really go big
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  or they may go to jail
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  Pfizer has been sued
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  to the tune of 10 billion dollars
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  in the last 10 or 20 years
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  I think since 2000 they've had 10 billion dollars
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  in fines
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  They're the most fined organization in the world
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  One of the dirtiest corporate
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  corporate cultures in the world
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  they had
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  like a 2 billion dollar fine
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  for marketing drugs
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  off-label
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  they actually marketed one of their drugs
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  off-label which is against the law
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  they can only market things for FDA-approved indications
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  they were fined 2 billion dollars for that
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  billions of dollars in other fines
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  So Pfizer
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  you find them and they just bounce right back
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  this is like a rounding error on their profit statement
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  this doesn't mean anything to Pfizer
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  but now
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  with the information
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  coming out in the Pfizer trial
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  they covered up Maddie DeGray's
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  problem in the Pfizer trial
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  she was basically paralyzed
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  she can't feel anything from the waist down
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  she has a feeding tube, she can't eat
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  she had seizures
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  and this was written up in the Pfizer trial
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  which basically means she had a tummy ache
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  and we don't know why
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  this is just blatant fraud
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  and the other thing
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  Pfizer farms out its studies
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  to multiple other companies
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  to do the dirty work for them
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  but they are at the end of the day
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  responsible for what goes into their studies
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  and they're responsible for all the data
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  and it came out that one of these companies
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  that they farmed out the trial to
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  the vaccine trials to
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  they did all kinds of funny stuff with the data
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  it was unblinded
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  they were not falling up with people
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  who might have COVID
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  just all kinds of shenanigans
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  and this barely made a ripple in the mainstream media
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  or the legacy media
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  I mean Joe Rogan and Alex Jones
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  are more mainstream than the legacy media
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  but the media covered it up
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  Pfizer didn't even address it
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  the FDA didn't address it and this accounted for
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  10% of the patients in the Pfizer trial
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  went through this company
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  that basically was doing
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  things that were wrong with the data
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  doing corrupt things with the data
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  so the trial itself is clearly corrupted
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  and if this really comes out
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  and becomes really widely publicly known
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  everyone could go down
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  the senior officials at the FDA
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  they were already in trouble before
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  it seems like they doubled down with the COVID
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  and they're doubling down more and more
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  what else can they do?
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  they're looking at the hangman's news
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  this is coming for them
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  if all of this really comes out
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  if they lose control of the narrative
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  these people are going to jail
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  exactly we're not seeing confidence
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  we're seeing desperation
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  that's all that they have left
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  we're talking about the highest ranks
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  they could all go to jail
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  Bill Gates caught with Epstein
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  it's all coming down
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  at the end of the day
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  these people are fighting for their lives
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  we are fighting for our lives
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  they are fighting for their lives
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  I've never heard it said better doctor
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  that's why they're so dangerous
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  they're desperate
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  we need to get desperate too
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  because we have loved ones dying in hospitals
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  this is just outrageous
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  that they can't get drugs that are proven to work
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  they want to prescribe what they want to prescribe
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  doctors' hands are tight
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  never in this country have we experienced this before
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  we have never seen doctors
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  not allowed to write prescriptions
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  why do I get a medical degree?
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  I put the bumper sticker out right now
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  it's so true doctor get desperate
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  we've got to get desperate
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  we're fighting for our lives
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  our loved ones are often fighting for their lives
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  and we can't give up
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  they had taken my dad six months ago
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  he had died
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  but I got ivermectin
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  I got steroids he got better
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  they had killed it
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  the important thing I think
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  for people who are religious
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  I'm a religious person
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  I know a lot of your listeners are religious people
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  and they believe in God
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  and a lot of people don't like to lie
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  but at the end of the day war is deceit
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  you've got to lie in wartime
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  you've just got to throw out all the stuff
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  so you've got to lie to get the drug to save you
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  I know people who are lying to get fake vaccine cards
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  to travel
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  so at the end of the day if you think something is going to kill you
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  don't take it
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  if you think something is going to save your life
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  get it no matter how you need to get it
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  get your hands on it
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  get it to your loved ones
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  get them the truth
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  what I found about conservatives and christians
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  and people that are religious
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  is they'll sit there and won't even
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  bend the truth to save themselves
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  and you're talking to globalists
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  it doesn't even matter just get what you need to save your family
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  so at some point
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  you've got to stop turning the other cheek
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  you can't just let people beat you up all day long
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  you can't let people kill your family
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  you have a God-given responsibility
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  to yourself
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  and then to your family members
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  and then to the people around you
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  and then to the entire world
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  so there's these rings of responsibility
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  that radiate out from you
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  and if somebody comes to your door
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  and says I'm here to kill your brother
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  where is he?
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  even if he's standing next to you
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  on the other side of the door
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  tell them he's across town
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  what else are you going to do?
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  at the end of the day God doesn't want you
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  to take a fall for somebody else
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  very well said doctor

[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  of our children
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  which is the real crime that is so huge
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  they want to sterilize people
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  who are doing it right now

[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name

[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  and if you don't fund us and don't want to share that's fine
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:03.000]  well I'm impressed by Dr. Said Haider
[3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:05.000]  because man this guy's like
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  inside my brain
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:09.000]  but no I'm inside his brain
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  we're looking at the same picture
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  you were saying internet kill switch
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  fake cyber attack
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  I said what's most important is final five minutes
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  you got so much more to say on the war room today
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  you haven't covered the attack on the children
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  but the harm unblockers all of it
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  what are you going to be covering on the war room
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  in one hour tell us doctor
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  so we'll see I mean I just kind of go with the flow
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  but you know I'd like to talk about vaccines
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  and kids
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  you know that's a terrible thing
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  we can talk about you know hormonal treatments
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  for children which I think are just ridiculous
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  and
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  you know I'd like to talk about
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  actually you know just what's happening to our culture
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  and our society you know our culture
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  is being
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  just torn apart and
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  terrible things are happening
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  they've been happening for years but the problems
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  are speeding up and things are just going downhill
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  really really quickly
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  and where does this end up right
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  basically tearing the country apart
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  right we need to come together
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  and we're so close right
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  you know there's not that much difference
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  between human beings especially between Americans
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  but little things are dividing us
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  and you know they're making us
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  fight against each other right to weaken us
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  and this is
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  it seems like it's working right
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  I mean it looks like
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  what's the solution I mean do we split
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  into two separate Americas and maybe that's
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  the solution that we need
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  maybe we need to have Texas and you know Florida
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  and you know other other states
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  South Dakota you know split off and become their own
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  country
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  I don't know how we solve this problem but
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  to really fight back
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  against you know globalist
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  tyranny we need to join hands
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  we need to join forces right we need to find
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  what's common amongst us and
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  COVID-19 is a common threat
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  authoritarianism is a common threat right it's
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  threatens everybody it doesn't threaten
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  red or blue or white right
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  you don't know which side of the aisle you're on
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  you know your life
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  and your liberty are on the line
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  so if we can whatever we
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  can do to bring people together I think
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  is the most important thing to do and for that
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  you really need to have compassion for people
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  who differ from you in certain things and try
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  to bring them around
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  to realize that we're all in this together
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  this fight against you know
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  tyranny and authoritarianism is something
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  that affects everyone in the country
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  and I agree doctor and the point
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  is admitting to yourself
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  that you're living in a historical
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  time I mean all periods are historical
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  but this is such a hyper
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  important point absolutely so
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  so since the beginning of time since
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  you know Adam came down from
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  you know the Garden of Eden we've been
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  fighting a war right and and this
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  time the stakes
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  are higher than they've ever been before we have nearly
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  eight billion people on planet earth eight billion
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  souls right hanging in the balance
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  and there's a fight for them right
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  and you know you know probably
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  the you know there's a saying
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  that the you know the best trick the devil ever
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  pulled was to convince people that he doesn't exist
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  this is basically what's happened
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  you know people who are really in power the deep state
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  you know maybe the globalist whatever you want to call them
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  they're in the shadows right
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  and the thing that they fear the most
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  is the light you know they fear
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  sunlight the most you know it's kind of like vampires
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  if you pull back the curtains
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  and you shine the light on them they will
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  scurry away like cockroaches they don't
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  want to be known you know the people that
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  we see on television these are
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  these are not the people in power you know the people
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  that we elect are not the people who are truly
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  in power behind the scenes even the
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  heads of the FDA these people don't hold
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  true power they're like fall guys right
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  like if something goes wrong they're going to
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  go to jail but the true power
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  behind the scenes is not
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  it's not even known they don't want to be known
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  right that's why they went after that's even
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  the spars document they admit they're going to burn
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  the minions and that's why they went after
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  Assange so hard that's why they went after
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  WikiLeaks that's why they went after
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  the people who published
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  data on bank accounts
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  all over the world you know these hidden bank accounts
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  you know the Fonseco problem
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  or incident so they
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  don't want to be known they want to be hidden
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  you know and this is the difference right
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  in the past you know kings and emperors
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  they wanted everyone knew who they were
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  they knew who was really in power now
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  the true people in power you know
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  the proletariat you know the common man
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  they're 15 minutes of fame the people who are really
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  in power they don't want fame they don't want you to know
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  who they are you know you think that like
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  Bill Gates is the richest person in the world
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  I doubt it right like he's just
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  the people those are the people we know about
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  right that's that's the money that's you know
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  well I'm impressed stop to say
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  Eid Haider thank you so much

[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:50.560]  We've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[3:05:50.560 --> 3:05:53.160]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:53.160 --> 3:05:56.480]  So protect your privacy today and support the info war
[3:05:56.480 --> 3:05:58.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:04.000]  Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.new studios
[3:06:04.000 --> 3:06:05.760]  in the United Kingdom.
[3:06:05.760 --> 3:06:35.400]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:40.320]  We are live. It is the first summit news hour of 2022.
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:42.880]  And we're going to be talking about all the same things
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:45.800]  that we talked about in 2021.
[3:06:45.800 --> 3:06:48.600]  With a slight difference, we are going to be talking about
[3:06:48.600 --> 3:06:52.440]  yet another case of a professional soccer player
[3:06:52.440 --> 3:06:54.800]  at the peak of physical condition.
[3:06:54.800 --> 3:06:59.000]  Suddenly mysteriously collapsing and dying during training.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:01.760]  Absolutely no idea what that has to do with
[3:07:01.760 --> 3:07:06.040]  what could have possibly caused it, non the wiser whatsoever.
[3:07:06.040 --> 3:07:09.320]  Also last night there was another incident at a football
[3:07:09.320 --> 3:07:12.920]  match in the UK where a fan in the stands collapsed.
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:14.720]  Suddenly it had to be taken to hospital.
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:17.760]  Again, cause remains unknown.
[3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:21.440]  The tennis legend Novak Djokovic has won an exemption
[3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:24.840]  to compete at the Australian Open Tennis Tournament
[3:07:24.840 --> 3:07:27.480]  in a week or so's time.
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:30.600]  Of course he is the defending champion
[3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:33.720]  and he is a living legend standing up to this
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:36.040]  authoritarianism vaccine mandate.
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:42.240]  Tyranny, we're also going to look at the situation in the UK
[3:07:42.240 --> 3:07:45.200]  because of course they predicted,
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:48.120]  and I did a video about this which I'm going to air later,
[3:07:48.120 --> 3:07:53.200]  5,000 daily Omicron deaths a day by January.
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:57.160]  The same people who predicted 7,000 hospitalizations
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:08:00.200]  in the UK if we lifted.
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:02.800]  Restrictions on so called Freedom Day they said
[3:08:02.800 --> 3:08:04.800]  if we don't lock down hard again,
[3:08:04.800 --> 3:08:07.320]  if we don't ruin everyone's Christmas,
[3:08:07.320 --> 3:08:11.640]  we are going to see 5,000 deaths from Omicron per day
[3:08:11.640 --> 3:08:12.800]  by January.
[3:08:12.800 --> 3:08:16.160]  Well today, even with the official death toll,
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:18.280]  which as we know is wide open to,
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:21.040]  let's call it interpretation,
[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:23.480]  they said 3,000 to 5,000 the official death toll
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:26.920]  on this 4th of January is 48.
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:28.720]  So again, the same people,
[3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:31.960]  theamongering with complete alarmism time and time again
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:34.600]  have been proven wrong yet again,
[3:08:34.600 --> 3:08:38.240]  and yet we still listen to them.
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:40.000]  But is the narrative shifting?
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:42.760]  Is the dogma crumbling?
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:44.920]  That is the question we're asking
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:48.240]  because we have this headline out of Summit News.
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:51.600]  Jab chief says, well, we can't vaccinate the planet
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:53.440]  every six months.
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:56.200]  Of course experts in Israel have said there need to be
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:59.320]  seven jabs, they're already up to their fourth in Israel,
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:02.440]  about to be up to the fourth in the United Kingdom.
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:04.440]  But Professor Sir Andrew Pollard,
[3:09:04.440 --> 3:09:07.720]  who helped develop the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine,
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:10.080]  warns that endless rounds of booster shots
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:11.720]  are not the answer,
[3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:14.040]  and that we quote, can't vaccinate the planet
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:16.880]  every four to six months.
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:19.200]  Largely of course, that's because
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:21.120]  the vast majority of African countries
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:24.440]  have no interest in taking the vaccine whatsoever,
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:27.480]  including only 25% of South Africans, by the way,
[3:09:27.480 --> 3:09:31.040]  who recovered quite well from their Omicron wave
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:33.760]  back around a month ago.
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:36.800]  Pollard asserted that pursuing a zero COVID policy
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:39.200]  of no infections whatsoever was foolish,
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:43.280]  and that quote, at some point society has to open up.
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:46.880]  He said booster shots should only be focused
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:48.760]  on the vulnerable, which is what we've been saying
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:51.640]  since the very start of the pandemic.
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:53.520]  Adding quote, we can't vaccinate the planet
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:54.720]  every four to six months.
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:09:57.400]  It's not sustainable or affordable.
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:00.360]  He went on to say that because Omicron's
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:02.520]  less severe than previous variants, again,
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:05.680]  remember the experts in the UK back a month ago,
[3:10:05.680 --> 3:10:09.080]  refused to even consider the overwhelming evidence
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:10.840]  out of South Africa,
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:14.280]  that Omicron was far less severe than previous variants
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:16.000]  because they wanted to create the drumbeat
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.040]  of propaganda for another lockdown.
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:20.600]  Well, now Pollard is admitting
[3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:23.480]  that it is less severe than previous variants,
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:26.360]  and that quote, the worst is absolutely behind us.
[3:10:26.360 --> 3:10:29.040]  We just need to get through the winter.
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:29.880]  And he also says,
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:33.080]  you're not a huge fan of mandatory vaccination schemes.
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:35.360]  Now he's saying we can't vaccinate everyone
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:37.560]  every four to six months.
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:40.600]  It does look like from everything that I've read so far
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:41.800]  in the new year,
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:44.400]  that they are gonna institute a daily,
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:47.240]  or sorry, an annually vaccine,
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:49.040]  which will count as a booster.
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:54.040]  Of course, Pfizer's $7.7 billion in record profits
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:10:59.120]  over the last year, 2021, not quite enough.
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:00.800]  So they're gonna have to have a vaccine
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:02.400]  at least once a year.
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:05.760]  And the requirement for you to engage in social life,
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:07.640]  again, for you to buy food,
[3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:09.280]  basically is the ultimate intention
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:11.040]  with the social credit score.
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:12.960]  For you to use public transport,
[3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:15.600]  for you to fly on airplanes,
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:18.600]  maybe eventually for you to even use the internet.
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:21.400]  Well, of course, be dependent on your complete compliance
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:23.720]  with that annual booster.
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:27.640]  But even this guy who developed one of the vaccines,
[3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:28.960]  the AstraZeneca,
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:30.800]  is saying it's completely unfeasible
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:34.320]  to continue this booster program every four to six months.
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:38.160]  Meanwhile, over in Denmark,
[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:41.760]  their chief epidemiologist is even more optimistic.
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:46.240]  She says the pandemic is basically over.
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:48.840]  This is a tyrant Grove Kraus, again,
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:50.840]  Denmark's chief epidemiologist.
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:11:53.120]  And we have a short video on this with her comments.
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:55.000]  Here is that video.
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:02.400]  Remember throughout the entirety of last month
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:05.160]  when I wouldn't shut up about Omicron being mild.
[3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:06.680]  When I repeatedly insisted
[3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:08.520]  that it wouldn't cause huge spikes
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:10.240]  in hospitalizations and deaths.
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:13.640]  When I relentlessly focused on data out of South Africa
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:15.600]  to underscore this prediction,
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:18.880]  remember how Doomsday Sage government advisors
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:21.120]  insisted the exact opposite?
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:23.520]  Well, it's time to take a look at who got it right.
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:24.560]  And it was me.
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:27.760]  Yes, Entilus predicted the lockdown fanatics
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:29.880]  got it massively wrong yet again.
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:32.280]  Professor Pantsdown Neil Ferguson,
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:34.280]  his Imperial College team demanded
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:36.960]  a pre-Christmas lockdown off the back of modeling,
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:38.480]  which predicted, quote,
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:41.000]  3000 daily Omicron deaths
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:44.080]  at the peak in January without further curbs.
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:46.440]  Now, I know we're only four days into January,
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:50.800]  but how many COVID-19 deaths total were recorded today?
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:52.320]  48.
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:57.320]  48 versus what they predicted, 3000.
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:12:58.440]  Bit of a difference there.
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:01.320]  And bear in mind the overwhelming majority of those deaths
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:02.800]  aren't even from Omicron.
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:04.360]  Omicron deaths are so rare
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:06.400]  they've stopped releasing figures on them.
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:10.240]  So it's hardly gonna hit 3000 a day within three weeks,
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:11.080]  is it?
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:13.040]  Remember, these are the exact same people
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:16.720]  who said hospitalizations would hit 7,000 a day
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:19.160]  after the restrictions were lifted in July.
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:22.240]  They never got significantly above a thousand.
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:25.160]  They were wrong then and they're wrong again now.
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:27.720]  We saw massive pre-Christmas hysteria
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:29.240]  about Omicron in London.
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:32.800]  Data shows COVID rates in London are already slowing
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:35.040]  and there's no spike in mortality.
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:36.240]  They got that wrong.
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:38.760]  The number of hospital patients on ventilators
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:41.640]  is also stable because as we said,
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:45.120]  until we were blue in the face, Omicron is mild.
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:48.040]  Now the same sage modelers that got literally
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:50.760]  everything else wrong are saying the Omicron wave
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:52.800]  will be, quote, long and drawn out.
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:55.080]  Despite South Africa's rates spiking
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:57.480]  and rapidly declining very quickly.
[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:01.040]  And despite even the BBC reporting it's likely that, quote,
[3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:03.440]  the wave will come and go pretty quickly.
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:05.600]  So that's the next prediction sage
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:08.480]  is virtually guaranteed to get wrong.
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:10.200]  Just as they got it completely wrong
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:13.360]  and they predicted 3,000 Omicron deaths a day.
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:16.360]  When in reality, there's 48 total
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:19.000]  and the vast majority aren't even Omicron deaths.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.760]  How many times do these clowns have to cry wolf
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:25.480]  before we stop paying heed to their rampant alarmism?
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:29.080]  So there you have it.
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:33.360]  They predicted 3,000 to 5,000 deaths from Omicron a day.
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:35.520]  Nobody's dying of Omicron.
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:39.120]  Literally vast numbers of the population in London
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:42.600]  across the rest of the United Kingdom have had Omicron.
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:43.680]  It's a cold.
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:44.880]  It's so mild.
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:47.840]  It's a cold in the young unvaccinated,
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:50.320]  in the boosted, whoever it's a cold.
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:52.160]  The hospitalization rate,
[3:14:52.160 --> 3:14:54.440]  when you compare it with the vast amount of testing
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:57.360]  because somehow testing yourself for COVID
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:15:00.840]  has become this new feverish religion.
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:03.040]  There's literally a complete absence of tests
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:04.600]  available for people who need them
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:07.480]  because people want to take 10 tests a day
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:09.440]  just so they can tweet about it.
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:11.160]  Absolutely bizarre.
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:14.160]  The ventilation numbers are way down.
[3:15:14.160 --> 3:15:16.880]  The same guy, Professor Neil Ferguson,
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:19.240]  who predicted 3,000 to 5,000 deaths per day
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:21.280]  at this point basically,
[3:15:21.280 --> 3:15:25.040]  is now out in the media admitting COVID hospitalizations
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:27.200]  and missions in London are flatlining
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:30.360]  and we can expect them to start falling nationally
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:31.600]  in a week's time.
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:33.280]  He's saying it's all gonna be fine.
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:37.280]  This is the same guy who called for more lockdown measures
[3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:41.680]  saying it would kill up to 5,000 people a day.
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:43.960]  Now he's saying, oh no, we were wrong again.
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:46.120]  Oh well, but listen to us next time.
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:47.760]  We'll get it right next time.
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:49.720]  Completely absurd once again.
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:51.120]  Summit.News will be back.

[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:06.560]  it changes the world.
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:09.160]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:10.640]  They know you're angry.
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:12.120]  And now to get around big tech,
[3:16:12.120 --> 3:16:13.480]  it's more important than ever
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:16.080]  that we use every tool we've got.

[3:16:56.760 --> 3:16:59.560]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:01.640]  has only been the buildup
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:03.960]  for what the globalists are doing right now.
[3:17:03.960 --> 3:17:07.160]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:09.160]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[3:17:09.160 --> 3:17:11.120]  because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:12.280]  Now they're a world government,
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:13.720]  they're permanent martial law,
[3:17:13.720 --> 3:17:16.120]  their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:18.680]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:21.320]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:22.760]  to go across the planet
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:24.920]  and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:26.440]  So listen, Paul Revere's,
[3:17:26.440 --> 3:17:27.960]  when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:30.400]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear

[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:18.440]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:21.080]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions

[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:02.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:20:02.560 --> 3:20:04.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:11.640]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:18.800]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters,
[3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:24.760]  it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:29.320]  3.7 billion in profits with the continual round
[3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:31.440]  of booster vaccines,
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:35.120]  or is the pandemic actually coming to its natural end?
[3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:39.720]  We've seen the Omicron variant infects numerous people
[3:20:39.720 --> 3:20:43.480]  in terms of times over what Delta infected.
[3:20:43.480 --> 3:20:47.200]  200,000 plus cases announced in the UK today,
[3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:49.840]  but of course it causes mild symptoms
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:54.040]  and it provides, God forbid, natural immunity.
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:20:55.760]  That's what some experts are now saying
[3:20:55.760 --> 3:20:57.640]  that it is nature's vaccine
[3:20:57.640 --> 3:20:59.360]  and because it is gonna provide vast,
[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:01.920]  vast numbers of people with natural immunity,
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:06.240]  it's gonna herald the end of the pandemic as a whole.
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:07.520]  And on that subject,
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:09.720]  Denmark's chief epidemiologist said
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:11.800]  that the pandemic could be over in two months.
[3:21:11.800 --> 3:21:14.200]  We have that video now, I'm gonna play it,
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:15.960]  I'm gonna come back and talk about it.
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:18.880]  Here is Denmark's chief epidemiologist.
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:24.520]  The corona pandemic will be virtually over in two months
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:26.760]  and our lives will be returning to normal.
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:29.480]  That's according to Denmark's chief epidemiologist,
[3:21:29.480 --> 3:21:30.840]  Tyra Grove Krauss.
[3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:33.560]  Krauss cited the fact that Omicron's hospitalization rates
[3:21:33.560 --> 3:21:35.720]  are significantly lower than Delta
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:38.760]  to assert that the pandemic could be in its final weeks.
[3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:40.720]  I think we will have that in the next two months
[3:21:40.720 --> 3:21:42.920]  and then I hope the infection will start to subside
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:45.280]  and we get our normal lives back, she said.
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:48.160]  The health chief says Omicron cases will peak in January
[3:21:48.160 --> 3:21:51.560]  but will start to rapidly decline at the start of February.
[3:21:51.560 --> 3:21:54.880]  A study headed by Krauss at the State Serum Institute
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:57.160]  concludes that Omicron's massive spread
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:21:59.600]  and the fact that it doesn't cause serious symptoms
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:01.080]  will leave the world in a, quote,
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:03.520]  better place than where we were before
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:06.960]  because it will contribute to widespread natural immunity.
[3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:09.360]  Kind of like nature's vaccine.
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:10.880]  Oh no, don't say that.
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:13.680]  Pfizer's still got two dozen more boosters to flog.
[3:22:13.680 --> 3:22:19.800]  Well, in Denmark, we also have infection experts
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:21.240]  countering that narrative.
[3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:22.560]  One of whom says, quote,
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:25.720]  we will never see the end of coronavirus.
[3:22:25.720 --> 3:22:28.360]  This was in a reaction to a statement by WHO
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:31.600]  to Chief Tedros Adhanom Gabrisis,
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:34.400]  that name that nobody can pronounce,
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:36.240]  who said that the pandemic could be over this year
[3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:39.080]  if the majority of people in all countries get vaccinated.
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:40.440]  That's never gonna happen.
[3:22:40.440 --> 3:22:43.360]  The rate of vaccination in some countries in Africa
[3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:46.480]  is zero percent.
[3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:49.440]  But this was responded to by experts, again, in Denmark,
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:50.880]  including Eskil Peterson,
[3:22:50.880 --> 3:22:54.920]  Professor of Infectious Diseases at Orhus University,
[3:22:54.920 --> 3:22:56.080]  who said it would be a number of years
[3:22:56.080 --> 3:22:57.560]  before the pandemic ends.
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:01.160]  Also Chief Physician at Orhus University Hospital,
[3:23:01.160 --> 3:23:03.160]  Professor Lars Ostegard asserted
[3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:04.720]  that while the pandemic stage of the virus
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:06.080]  may be declared over,
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:08.160]  coronavirus will, quote,
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:09.320]  never end.
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:11.600]  It's always gonna be part of our everyday lives.
[3:23:11.600 --> 3:23:13.880]  He went on to say,
[3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:15.720]  but is the narrative starting to crumble?
[3:23:15.720 --> 3:23:18.320]  We have this headline, again, out of Summit.News.
[3:23:18.320 --> 3:23:22.560]  Paul, majority of Germans don't trust pandemic statistics,
[3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:23.800]  build the newspaper,
[3:23:23.800 --> 3:23:27.320]  which is one of the biggest newspapers there in Germany,
[3:23:27.320 --> 3:23:28.880]  conducted this study,
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:31.760]  which asked people about the Robert Koch Institute,
[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:33.840]  which is the big health institute
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:36.880]  that runs health policy in Germany.
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:39.240]  The poll found that 57% of respondents
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:43.320]  don't trust the data being released by official sources,
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:46.400]  while 32% still think the government has credibility
[3:23:46.400 --> 3:23:48.760]  when it comes to releasing COVID figures.
[3:23:48.760 --> 3:23:51.160]  One of the reasons cited in this article
[3:23:51.160 --> 3:23:53.560]  relating to the poll in Germany
[3:23:53.560 --> 3:23:56.360]  was the fact that large numbers of people hospitalized
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:23:59.320]  for other reasons are being falsely counted
[3:23:59.320 --> 3:24:00.720]  as COVID patients,
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:03.720]  and this has been the case all along.
[3:24:03.720 --> 3:24:07.640]  In the UK, we've had numbers up to 65% of people
[3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:11.320]  being counted in official daily COVID case tolls,
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:14.880]  entered hospital for completely different reasons
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:16.080]  other than COVID.
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:19.840]  Many of them go on to catch COVID in hospital,
[3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:21.720]  because that's the main place where it spreads,
[3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:23.640]  and then they're counted in the daily toll,
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:26.680]  and that's used to bump up the hysteria even more.
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:27.800]  By the way, there's a report,
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:30.440]  which I just saw before I went on air.
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:32.440]  New York State.
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:35.560]  This is that BNO newsroom on Twitter.
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:37.600]  New York State will start breaking down
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:39.800]  its hospital figures between with
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:42.000]  and because of COVID-19,
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.280]  the governor has announced.
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:47.600]  She said, we're going to start asking some questions.
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:51.120]  Is that person in the hospital because of COVID
[3:24:51.120 --> 3:24:52.960]  or because of a car crash?
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:55.280]  Now, you'd think they would have done that
[3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:57.880]  22 frigging months ago,
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:00.040]  and then we would have had a huge disparity
[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:04.880]  in the reality of cases of COVID-19 on a daily basis,
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:07.680]  and cases that are actually COVID,
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:10.480]  they go into hospital because of COVID,
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:13.000]  not just with COVID.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:16.080]  Of course, you had Dr. Malone on Joe Rogan a few days ago,
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:18.440]  again, pointing out that hospitals do indeed
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:21.880]  literally count gunshot wound victims
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:25.760]  who die of a gunshot to the head as COVID cases,
[3:25:25.760 --> 3:25:28.000]  if they died with COVID.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.600]  Now, 22 months into the pandemic,
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:34.680]  the governor of New York says they're going to separate
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:37.480]  those two cases to differentiate
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:40.880]  between those who are in hospital for different reasons
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:44.680]  and have COVID or catch COVID after entering hospital
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:48.360]  or those who are in hospital purely because of COVID-19.
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:51.120]  You would have thought they would have done that
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:55.880]  in March 2020, but now here we are in January 2022,
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:25:58.360]  and they're only just announcing that they're going to do that,
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:02.560]  which by the way is another indication that this touch wood
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:05.480]  may be coming to an end, the fact that they're finally
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:10.080]  admitting the differentiation in those cases.
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:13.320]  But again, in Germany, the majority of the public
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:15.400]  does not trust the government on its release
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:17.960]  of official COVID figures, and we also have this headline
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:19.960]  out of Breitbart in Germany.
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:23.400]  Rally against lockdown sees 100,000 Germans process
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:26.040]  ruling party demands clamp down.
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:28.440]  More than 100,000 took to the streets in Germany
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:30.920]  on Monday nights to protest the nation's lockdown rules
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:33.360]  as Eastern members of the ruling free democratic party
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:35.000]  demand a clamp down.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.160]  So those numbers in Germany aren't sinking.
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:39.600]  Of course, we have the mandatory vaccine law
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:43.680]  being pushed through in Germany as it was in Austria,
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:45.880]  and we have a mass collapse in trust
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:49.320]  in health authorities in Germany.
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.560]  Fueled in part, no doubt, by the fact
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:53.800]  that there was this major scandal last month,
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:55.800]  which we talked about briefly
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:58.080]  in one of the shows last month,
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:00.000]  where the mayor of Hamburg came out
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  and literally used this to justify further lockdown
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:06.720]  restrictions by claiming that the unvaccinated
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:11.200]  in Germany represented 95% of COVID cases.
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:15.440]  He then cited that completely erroneous statistic
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:20.240]  to ban the unvaccinated even from outdoor Christmas markets.
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:22.600]  It turned out after a Senate investigation
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:26.720]  that the actual figure of unvaccinated COVID cases
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:28.520]  was not 95%.
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:32.320]  It was 14.3%.
[3:27:32.320 --> 3:27:35.840]  Again, you go back to the situation in the UK.
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:38.000]  They got it spectacularly wrong by saying
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:40.480]  that there'd be 5,000 Omicron deaths per day.
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:43.360]  By January, it's literally 48.
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:45.840]  You have the unvaccinated being scapegoated in Germany
[3:27:45.840 --> 3:27:49.360]  to try and pass this new compulsory vaccine law.
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:52.520]  With erroneous claims that 95% of COVID cases
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:53.880]  are amongst the unvaccinated,
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:57.120]  turns out to be 14.3% in Hamburg.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:00.160]  Is it any wonder that now the trust
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:02.400]  in official health authorities in Germany
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:04.960]  in other countries is crumbling?
[3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:08.800]  Meanwhile, COVID passport microchip developers
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:10.480]  has chipping of humans happening
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:12.120]  whether we like it or not.
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:14.560]  Resistance is futile.
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:17.160]  You probably saw this video late last month.
[3:28:17.160 --> 3:28:20.840]  It's disruptive sub-dermals this company out of Sweden,
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:22.880]  which has linked the implantable,
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:27.880]  scannable microchip to COVID passport certification.
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:32.200]  So they run a cell phone, a smartphone over your arm.
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:33.840]  You've got the implantable microchip
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:35.480]  and it immediately pops up and shows
[3:28:35.480 --> 3:28:37.960]  that you've complied, you've obeyed,
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:40.720]  you've took your seven booster shots.
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:43.080]  There was some pushback to that in the media
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:46.160]  after this came out publicly last month.
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:49.360]  But the director of that company, Hans Sobal,
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:52.200]  says that it's gonna happen, it's already happening.
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:53.200]  Yeah, he used to do it.
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:01.360]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:02.760]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:05.920]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:08.200]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:10.800]  that's wild harvested above organic
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:13.240]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:29:13.240 --> 3:29:15.280]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:16.840]  that the media calls communists,
[3:29:16.840 --> 3:29:18.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:20.280]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:21.760]  and we've got it and the farmers
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:23.240]  don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:29:23.240 --> 3:29:25.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:26.600]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:27.680]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:29:27.680 --> 3:29:29.760]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:31.880]  for about 50% more, per pound.
[3:29:31.880 --> 3:29:33.440]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:34.520]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:36.360]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[3:29:36.360 --> 3:29:38.920]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:41.080]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:46.040]  We had one, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[3:29:46.040 --> 3:29:48.880]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:50.600]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:53.160]  And if you don't fund us, you don't want us here, that's fine.
[3:29:56.840 --> 3:29:59.560]  Christmas 2021 is over,

[3:31:04.280 --> 3:31:08.160]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:10.240]  are stealing all of your data
[3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:12.960]  and creating a map and a database of where you go

[3:32:58.240 --> 3:33:01.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:33:01.080 --> 3:33:04.640]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:09.800]  Cheers to Christmas.
[3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:45.760]  So the esteemed sage modelers got it wrong once again predicting thousands upon thousands
[3:33:45.760 --> 3:33:50.000]  of daily Omicron deaths, completely ignoring all the evidence out in South Africa that
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:55.840]  it was mild, it caused basically no deaths, no significant uptick in hospitalizations
[3:33:55.840 --> 3:33:58.960]  or people on ventilators to help them breathe.
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:05.080]  Those same people are out in the media today saying that we may get by Omicron with no
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:09.280]  new restrictions, the government, Boris Johnson has come out with a press conference in the
[3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:14.200]  past few hours basically patting themselves on the back saying that the restrictions they
[3:34:14.200 --> 3:34:19.160]  already brought in were sufficient and that there would be no new restrictions for now
[3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:27.040]  even as they literally introduced more restrictions, namely with forcing secondary school pupils
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:31.640]  in the United Kingdom once again to wear face masks in class.
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:38.320]  We've had studies showing that this completely hampers harms cognitive development in children.
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:43.760]  It of course affects the death, they can't lip read, it ostracizes, it atomizes people
[3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:48.000]  in a school situation, in a social situation even further.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:51.560]  They say there are no new restrictions and yet they're introducing a new restriction
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:57.720]  today by forcing kids to wear face masks in schools once again despite the fact that Omicron
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:03.600]  has basically been dead on arrival in terms of fueling their hysteria and their fear mongering.
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:08.720]  Here's Nigel Farage talking about that issue, the introduction of face masks in secondary
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:11.280]  schools in the United Kingdom from today.
[3:35:11.280 --> 3:35:13.040]  Let's go to that clip, here it is.
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:16.760]  So the schools are going back today, at least some of the schools are going back today,
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:19.440]  those that haven't got stuff shortages.
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:22.160]  But I'll ask it myself a question here.
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:26.160]  Haven't our kids suffered enough over the course of the last two years?
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:31.200]  On average, a child goes to school for 190 days a year.
[3:35:31.200 --> 3:35:37.160]  In large parts of the UK, in the last calendar year, they missed 60 days of schooling.
[3:35:37.160 --> 3:35:42.160]  That's a third of the academic year many of our youngsters have missed.
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:46.400]  More than that, there are opportunities to play sport, there are opportunities at the
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:51.560]  end of their GCSEs, to party, to have fun, to do all the things that teenagers growing
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:53.480]  up at school should be doing.
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:59.720]  It's all part of life, it's all part of growing up and all of that has been denied to them.
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:05.680]  So now we've got the start of the school term and the Education Secretary, Nadim Sahawi,
[3:36:05.680 --> 3:36:12.960]  has said that kids in school from year seven onwards must wear face masks all day.
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:19.680]  I mean, frankly, what is the point of face-to-face teaching and engagement if everybody's wrapped
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:20.680]  up in face masks?
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:26.240]  It's a very similar argument to the one that's been used about the Birker, if you think about
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:29.480]  it, over the course of the last few years.
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:35.720]  Also, to face masks actually work, well, at the start of this pandemic, the government
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:41.280]  didn't think they worked at all and now it seems we have to wear face masks everywhere.
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:47.680]  There is almost no evidence against this virus that face masks, frankly, make much difference
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:54.160]  at all and I think this is a completely unfair imposition on our kids.
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:59.920]  If they catch Omicron, they are likely to have symptoms no worse than a cold, no worse
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:05.920]  actually than what goes around schools at the start of each autumn and winter term and
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.240]  I think, frankly, for those at school, for our teenagers in particular, to expect them
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:12.920]  to wear face masks is outrageous.
[3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:16.360]  I'm sure most parents think this is completely and utterly wrong.
[3:37:16.360 --> 3:37:21.560]  We want our kids to get back to normal life, to normal schooling and Mr. Sahawi, if you
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:27.800]  insist on kids wearing face masks at school, I want you to wear a face mask everywhere
[3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:33.600]  you go to wear it for all your public appearances, to wear it in the office, lead by example.
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:36.680]  Well, of course, he isn't going to do that, is he?
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:42.960]  So let's have a rethink of this and this whole hysteria around Omicron is really highlighted
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:45.280]  but what's going on in Scotland?
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:51.120]  Rafts of restrictions brought in by the Puritan, Nicola Sturgeon, all sorts of restrictions
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:53.560]  were told that could last till spring.
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:58.160]  Do you know how many people in Scotland are in intensive care with the Omicron variant?
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:01.040]  No, go on, have a guess.
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:02.040]  One.
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:03.040]  No, really, one.
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:08.640]  There's one person in intensive care with the Omicron variant and for all we know, they're
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:11.400]  in intensive care for different reasons.
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:16.800]  So let's end this hysteria, let our kids get back to a normal life, let's put this
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:22.600]  virus behind us, let's learn to live with it.
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:27.520]  There is Nigel Farage talking about the mask mandate being brought back into schools despite
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:33.640]  the fact that Omicron is basically a cold, a mild cold at that as many people who've
[3:38:33.640 --> 3:38:34.640]  had it have said.
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:40.440]  Meanwhile, let's talk about the wonderful efficacy of the vaccine, here's a headline
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:41.440]  out of the sun.
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:47.120]  Now remember, we had this mass spate of professional soccer players across Europe, not just soccer
[3:38:47.120 --> 3:38:52.120]  players either, we had stories on hockey players, basketball players and others, suddenly either
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:57.440]  in training or in the middle of matches collapsing, in some cases being taken to hospital, in
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:03.400]  some cases dying, investigations were carried out, we were assured by national newspapers
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:07.880]  and like the Daily Mail, they said it was a quote, coincidence.
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:12.160]  We had ex-professional footballers bring this up and say there should be an investigation
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:17.400]  namely Matt LaTissier, we had ex-professional footballers again in the UK bring this up
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:24.440]  on national radio shows like Talksport in the UK, Trevor Sinclair, when he brought up
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:30.520]  the subject, when he dared suggest that it might be linked to the vaccine, he was unceremoniously
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:36.600]  cut off but the person sitting behind the desk with the delay button wasn't quite quick
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:41.680]  enough so his comments did get out but then the feed cut out anyway, nothing suspicious
[3:39:41.680 --> 3:39:43.400]  about that at all.
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:48.760]  Well now we have this headline out of the sun, football tragedy, Marcos Meneldo dead
[3:39:48.760 --> 3:39:57.320]  at 25, Deportivo Marconis star dies after suffering heart attack in training, this is a Guatemalan
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:01.880]  football who tragically passed away at the age of 25 after suffering a heart attack
[3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:08.600]  in training on Monday because 25 year old men in peak physical condition, that's completely
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:14.320]  normal for them to suddenly collapse and die in droves and basically expire in their mid-20s
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:15.320]  isn't it?
[3:40:15.320 --> 3:40:20.760]  I go back to Fabrice Mouamba who was a Premier League footballer in the UK about 10 years
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:25.920]  ago, collapsed in the middle of a Premier League football match, it looked touch and
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:31.560]  go as to whether he was going to survive, he ended up thankfully surviving but that
[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:37.640]  was highlighted at the time, that was a massive story in the UK for weeks on end because it
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:40.920]  was such a rare case.
[3:40:40.920 --> 3:40:46.560]  Now we have them basically numerous times a week across Europe but we're assured that
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:53.200]  it is just a coincidence, Deportivo Marconis defender complained of breathing difficulties
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:59.320]  during a session while preparing for the new season, he received emergency CPR, he was
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:06.240]  then transferred to hospital but he tragically died, no word in the article about the cause
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:13.120]  of his death I'm sure again that it's all just a coincidence, meanwhile Cambridge vs
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:19.480]  Portsmouth played 21 minutes at a time after medical emergency, players leave the pitch
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:25.360]  as Fan is carried away, Cambridge's match against Portsmouth, again this is a soccer
[3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:30.760]  match in the United Kingdom was stopped as a fan required medical treatment in the stand,
[3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:35.240]  it took 21 minutes for the match to restart because they had to go up into the stand and
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:41.520]  take the spectator away to hospital because he mysteriously collapsed, that happened also
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:45.120]  actually in a match that I was watching live about a month ago, a Sheffield Wednesday match
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:49.440]  where a similar thing happened, a fan collapsed in the stands, they had to delay the match
[3:41:49.440 --> 3:41:55.880]  for about 15 minutes, seems to be happening quite often recently doesn't it, well somebody
[3:41:55.880 --> 3:42:02.880]  who will not have that fate before them hopefully is tennis legend Novak Djokovic, this is out
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:08.800]  of information liberation, living legend Novak, Novak Djokovic wins exemption to compete in
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:15.040]  Australian Open, the tennis legend Novak Djokovic stood tall in the face of mandatory vaccination
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:19.160]  threats from the Australian government and just managed to secure an exemption to copy
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:24.920]  in the Australian Open, because of course they can't have the world's number one tennis
[3:42:24.920 --> 3:42:32.320]  player not appearing at their flagship tournament having him unable to defend his title, so they've
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:37.400]  given Novak Djokovic an exemption and he has to be praised for his brave and vocal stance
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:43.560]  against compulsory vaccine mandates, of course every other Australian citizen who is laboring
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:49.600]  under the same restrictions will not get a mandate because they're not a multi-millionaire,
[3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:54.720]  top level sports star but we still have to praise Novak Djokovic, Summit.News will be
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:56.560]  back now, go away.
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:01.440]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:06.440]  the globalists are doing right now, this is their big offensive, this is their takeover
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:09.760]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[3:43:09.760 --> 3:43:13.520]  themselves, now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:19.160]  tyranny is out in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:23.400]  their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling
[3:43:23.400 --> 3:43:27.360]  the truth, so listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:30.840]  you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products and
[3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:35.040]  at infowarstore.com you keep us on air, plus we've got great products that have been sold

[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:44.920]  top five best sellers, they are so good for your body and if there's two things you do

[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:57.240]  off and it keeps us on the air, only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:43:57.240 --> 3:44:01.760]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in
[3:44:01.760 --> 3:44:08.200]  my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has, and it's
[3:44:08.200 --> 3:44:18.800]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[3:44:18.800 --> 3:44:27.600]  sweat for, and now we're just throwing it all away, and I see the general public, ENA,
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:32.120]  medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, trancey,
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:37.920]  and I know we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad,
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:45.120]  but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:50.400]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again, it's just the globalists are actively
[3:44:50.400 --> 3:44:54.840]  trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[3:44:54.840 --> 3:44:56.640]  species as we know it.
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:45:01.520]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:06.640]  the globalists are doing right now, this is their big offensive, this is their takeover,
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:09.800]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:13.560]  themselves, now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:19.200]  tyranny is out in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:23.480]  their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:24.480]  the truth.
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:27.880]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[3:45:27.880 --> 3:45:32.320]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com

[3:46:44.680 --> 3:46:48.760]  way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, infowarstore.com
[3:46:48.760 --> 3:47:17.600]  or 941-955-1029-4195, then 20 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:23.120]  Now we've seen efforts and we've seen this even being introduced in the UK to deny quote
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:28.480]  racists and homophobes hospital treatment if they abuse staff, if they're mean to staff
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:33.040]  or if they make offensive comments while in hospital, just deny them treatment altogether,
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:39.040]  well of course now we see this rolled into COVID-19 and the pandemic with white people
[3:47:39.040 --> 3:47:45.680]  being put at the back of the cube being denied medical treatment for COVID-19 based on an
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:51.080]  immutable characteristic, something completely out of their control, their skin color in
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:56.160]  order to fight racism, we've seen it in Minnesota, we've seen it in Texas, we've seen it in
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:03.640]  other places and now we see it in New York, headline New York to deny white people COVID-19
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:10.120]  treatments to fight racism, is this what they call white privilege to be literally left
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:15.920]  to die in hospital because you're white, New Yorkers follow Minnesota by putting white
[3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:19.720]  people at the back of the queue when it comes to life saving COVID-19 treatments in the
[3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:26.440]  name of fighting racism, so of course they're finally rolling out this monoclonal antibody
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:32.680]  treatment which is of course made in a lab mimics the natural antibodies in the body
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:37.880]  to help the body fight disease, they have that treatment but they're rationing it across
[3:48:37.880 --> 3:48:42.240]  America and now New York's Department of Health has published a document revealing
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:48.120]  how it will prioritize non-whites when it comes to distributing the treatment in addition
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:53.400]  to antiviral pills, the plan states that in order to receive the treatment a patient must
[3:48:53.400 --> 3:48:59.000]  have quote a medical condition or other factors that increase their risk for severe illness,
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:06.840]  one of those quote risk factors is being a race or ethnicity that is not white, so literally
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:11.600]  if you're white you get put to the back of the queue for these treatments that actually
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:16.520]  work in fighting COVID which is why they're rationing them to such an extent, God forbid
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:21.080]  we should make treatments that actually work that don't involve vaccines widely available
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:26.280]  to the population but not if you're white, apparently you get kicked to the back of the
[3:49:26.280 --> 3:49:32.400]  queue, system is already in place in New York with the New York Post reporting how quote
[3:49:32.400 --> 3:49:38.160]  one Staten Island doctor said he filled two prescriptions for Paxilovid this week, was
[3:49:38.160 --> 3:49:42.960]  asked by the pharmacist to disclose the race of his patients before the treatment was authorized,
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:49.160]  so he's literally being stopped from giving these antiviral drugs to people because they're
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:54.360]  white, apparently that's part of their white privilege, of course the Minnesota Department
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:50:00.600]  of Health is pursuing a very similar policy which we reported on last month, they have
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:06.280]  a point system in this rationing scheme where it says if you're non-white you get two extra
[3:50:06.280 --> 3:50:12.120]  points, the person with the highest points of all these risk factors is first in line
[3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:18.080]  for the treatment, so if you're black if you're Hispanic you get pushed ahead of the queue
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:24.440]  compared to a white person immediately by getting those two extra rationing points, similar
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:28.880]  system is also operational in Texas and we feature a video regarding that very subject
[3:50:28.880 --> 3:50:34.040]  in the article, according to one analyst the race-based rationing system violates federal
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:40.480]  law namely Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which of course says you can't discriminate
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:46.720]  against people based on race, but again if you're white, apparently you can and that's
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:52.360]  why privilege and as I mentioned before earlier in the show, New York is actually now breaking
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:56.800]  down its hospital figures between with and because of COVID, it's actually a positive
[3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:01.480]  development which should have happened 22 months ago, but now they're only giving the
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:07.160]  viral pills, the anti-viral pills, the antibody treatment, first in the queue for non-white
[3:51:07.160 --> 3:51:13.440]  people because of course systemic racism still exists in America, it really does still exist
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:19.600]  but not against the people who they say it does, meanwhile someone else who is bravely
[3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:26.040]  fighting against racism by literally getting more obese, getting fatter is the pop star
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:33.720]  Lizzo of course where lectured all day about how vaccines, how masks will keep us safe,
[3:51:33.720 --> 3:51:39.520]  not really taught so much about healthy eating, exercise about how that helps your immune
[3:51:39.520 --> 3:51:44.880]  system, Lizzo is contributing to the fight against racism though by literally getting
[3:51:44.880 --> 3:51:49.600]  fatter, yeah really, here's the clip, let's go to it right now.
[3:51:49.600 --> 3:51:54.360]  Pop star Lizzo posted a video to Instagram in order to celebrate the fact that she gained
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:51:59.920]  even more weight, yeah really, here's a clip of the video in question, it was captioned
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:06.080]  with the words, I gained weight, I look the fuck good, Lizzo looked nothing short of sensational
[3:52:06.080 --> 3:52:10.640]  as she showed off her dance moves in a sizzling Instagram video on Sunday, give me a fucking
[3:52:10.640 --> 3:52:15.320]  break, people are walking around with three shots in their arm and multiple masks on their
[3:52:15.320 --> 3:52:20.160]  face if they dare to leave home at all because the media and celebrities terrified them into
[3:52:20.160 --> 3:52:25.920]  panicking over coronavirus, yeah that same media and those same celebrities simultaneously
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:31.960]  amplify the body positivity movement, even though being fat drastically heightens your
[3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:37.040]  chance of dying of Covid, we're literally living this meme, but coronavirus just can't
[3:52:37.040 --> 3:52:42.760]  compete with obesity, which is the top contributor to mortality over anything else that exists
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:49.960]  in the world, obesity kills 300,000 Americans a year, stop normalising it, there were more
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:55.880]  than one million admissions to NHS hospitals in 2019-20 where obesity was a factor, in
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:53:00.760]  the UK we were locked down to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed, the owner of a
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:07.040]  system of Covid passports was imposed on us to protect the NHS, so when will the clinically
[3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:12.480]  obese be issued with rationing passports to prevent them from overwhelming the NHS, when
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:18.840]  will fat people be refused entry to McDonald's to protect the NHS, Lizzo is already obese
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:23.960]  that's not an insult it's an observable fact, she then celebrates getting even more obese
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:28.600]  like it's some kind of achievement, and how does the media and all her brain dead celebrity
[3:53:28.600 --> 3:53:34.640]  friends respond, yes you go girl, because what could be more progressive than diabetes,
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:39.080]  stroke and heart disease, recall that Lizzo literally complained about thinner white girls
[3:53:39.080 --> 3:53:43.960]  colonising the fat acceptance movement because they weren't fat enough, she also previously
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:49.040]  said quote, I think it's lazy for me to just say I'm body positive at this point, I would
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:54.840]  like to be body normative, I want to normalise my body, Instagram promotes images of obese
[3:53:54.840 --> 3:53:59.760]  people in the name of body positivity, while refusing to accept healthy eating ads which
[3:53:59.760 --> 3:54:05.200]  include photos that show people with well toned bodies, we live in truly demented times,
[3:54:05.200 --> 3:54:10.880]  and no don't tell me that stating that blindingly obvious is being mean to fat people, being
[3:54:10.880 --> 3:54:16.160]  fat literally kills you, encouraging people to get fatter is contributing to them being
[3:54:16.160 --> 3:54:21.920]  at a higher risk of dying, that's not a venerable social justice cause, it's a deranged death
[3:54:21.920 --> 3:54:26.880]  wish, it is far better to see people getting offended over fat jokes than it is to see
[3:54:26.880 --> 3:54:32.800]  fat people dying in agony from preventable illnesses, what's next, a smoke positivity
[3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:37.640]  movement, am I going to walk around carrying placards of images of my blackened lungs demanding
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:42.800]  everybody respect my bad lifestyle choice, that would be transparently insane, and yet
[3:54:42.800 --> 3:54:48.280]  giant billboard displays like this have become commonplace, also know how obesity surpassed
[3:54:48.280 --> 3:54:53.560]  smoking as the biggest killer at around the same time that culture and media started denouncing
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:58.560]  fat shaming, it's your choice to be fat, but don't go around pretending it's a good choice
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:05.760]  that should be respected or encouraged, it shouldn't, well there you have it again the
[3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:11.120]  same media, the same culture, the same celebrities who demand that you wear a mask and get jabbed
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:16.640]  to protect your health, well then simultaneously literally celebrate somebody who is clinically
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:23.600]  obese and getting even fatter by calling it empowering, and again they've used this, they've
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:28.680]  tied this in via intersectionalism to the anti-racism movement and said that we need
[3:55:28.680 --> 3:55:37.200]  to accept and encourage people getting fatter via body positivity, again to fight racism,
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:43.360]  we live in interesting times, meanwhile UK government greets us skids for fleets of surveillance
[3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:50.000]  drones over cities because it's to protect the women, in a cynical PR stunt the UK government
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:55.120]  is considering plans to allow women who feel threatened on the street, yes this is an actual
[3:55:55.120 --> 3:55:59.560]  news story, it's not out in the Babylon Bee, to call upon surveillance drones that would
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:04.320]  arrive in minutes and shine a bright light on any potential attacker, they literally
[3:56:04.320 --> 3:56:11.360]  want to give people the power to summon surveillance drones via an app on their smartphone that
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:17.120]  will then stalk anyone who they wish, I mean he could be harassing them, he could be minding
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:22.800]  his own business, I'm sure this isn't going to be completely open to abuse is it, to then
[3:56:22.800 --> 3:56:28.360]  summon a surveillance drone, shine a spotlight on the alleged culprit, perhaps bark orders
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:33.520]  at them, perhaps chase them off, this is now being trialled at a university in England
[3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:39.520]  at a cost of half a million pounds and they're actually petitioning the government to introduce
[3:56:39.520 --> 3:56:43.620]  this, it's going to take about a year and of course it has nothing to do with protecting
[3:56:43.620 --> 3:56:48.760]  women, if they wanted to protect women from stalkers, from sex offenders on the street
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:54.560]  they would allow women to be armed with pepper spray, the law in the United Kingdom specifically
[3:56:54.560 --> 3:56:59.760]  forbids anyone from being allowed to carry pepper spray on the street because they don't
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:05.560]  give a damn about protecting people, this is about replacing police helicopters with
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:11.840]  surveillance drones and even the creator of this technology admits that for the same cost
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:18.200]  as having one police helicopter surveillance city, you can have 25 surveillance drones
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:22.800]  for the same price, but they're introducing it on the foundation of protecting women from
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:30.480]  stalkers, from sex attackers, it's merely the rollout for the mass invasion of surveillance
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:36.880]  drones to blanket entire cities, to be whizzing into your garden snooping on your activity,
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:41.800]  but they introduce it by the cynical PR level of protecting women, that's going to wrap
[3:57:41.800 --> 3:57:48.800]  it up, Summit.News, War Room is coming up, stay tuned.

[3:58:58.080 --> 3:59:04.360]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com, studies have
[3:59:04.360 --> 3:59:10.320]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[3:59:10.320 --> 3:59:15.920]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[3:59:15.920 --> 3:59:20.680]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:59:20.680 --> 3:59:27.280]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[3:59:27.280 --> 3:59:31.920]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[3:59:31.920 --> 3:59:37.680]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
