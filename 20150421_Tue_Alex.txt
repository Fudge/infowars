[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.700]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today on this Tuesday April 21st
[00:29.700 --> 00:38.040]  2015 we have a lot of bizarre news and we also have some replies from Bloomberg a direct
[00:38.040 --> 00:43.920]  reply to an article we had up yesterday about Jeb Bush possibly going to Bilderberg in 2015
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.080]  of course they announced that he's going to be going to Poland Estonia and Germany in
[00:49.080 --> 00:52.880]  early June that's about the time that the Bilderberg conference is going to be held
[00:52.880 --> 01:00.640]  in Switzerland and there was a very sarcastic condescending article that came out of Bloomberg
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.320]  I mean what else would you expect talking about that not talking about Bilderberg but
[01:05.320 --> 01:11.800]  basically talking about us you know we're conspiracy theorists and you know we're spouting
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.240]  all this nonsense and he actually tweeted out the question is Jeb Bush going to go
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.600]  to Bilderberg and he got a response from the Bush campaign so we're going to talk about
[01:22.600 --> 01:27.560]  that actually Alex is going to join us in the next segment Alex Jones is going to come
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.160]  on and talk about Bilderberg I find it very interesting that for decades the press the
[01:33.160 --> 01:38.800]  mainstream media had nothing to say about Bilderberg and as Jim Tucker used to say isn't
[01:38.800 --> 01:44.520]  it amazing that the most powerful people on earth and government and business and the
[01:44.520 --> 01:51.000]  military can all meet together do it in secret for a week and there's absolutely no media
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.880]  coverage isn't that interesting and of course David Rockefeller thanked them for that courtesy
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.760]  thanked them for helping to keep certain things that they wanted to do quiet and of course
[02:00.760 --> 02:07.120]  Bilderberg I should say Bloomberg maybe we should call it that the the Bloomberg Bilderberg
[02:07.120 --> 02:12.080]  report they they do a good job of covering up for that and there's also an interesting
[02:12.080 --> 02:18.920]  story where a city bank executive an economist who famously said just a few months ago that
[02:18.920 --> 02:26.160]  gold is in a 6000 year bubble think about that is that a bubble that's lasted throughout
[02:26.160 --> 02:30.960]  recorded history by definition that is not a bubble okay but the same economists that
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.120]  said that that does chief economist for city bank of course always pushing the central
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.640]  bank agenda no matter how absurd he's now calling for something very dangerous and that is getting
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.840]  rid of cash because you know cash is an obstacle to negative interest rates they've held interest
[02:46.840 --> 02:53.360]  rates at 0% for so long for us not for them I mean they're charging Greece 28% they charge
[02:53.360 --> 02:57.760]  you on your credit card that or more sometimes they go up to 50% if they can come up with
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.120]  a rationale for it but of course in terms of what they have to pay to the central banks
[03:02.120 --> 03:08.160]  the main bankers get a 0% interest rate but they want to take it to a negative interest
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.160]  rate for us they're not content just to use our money for free and at that point people
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.160]  are going to say well why would I pay to have money on deposit in the bank I'll just take
[03:17.160 --> 03:22.800]  it out in cash so one of his solutions and he talks about possible solutions is just
[03:22.800 --> 03:29.000]  to outright band cash we've seen a war on cash many different levels started with money
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.760]  laundering reports and structuring reports from the government when you put the money
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.640]  in the bank now they want reports when you take more than 5000 out many cases in the
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.040]  U.S. and the U.K. people have been refused to have their money taken out now they're
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.600]  reporting that to the government as if it's a crime we know what's coming with this we
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.520]  know what's coming with the jade helm training we know that they are concerned about financial
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.160]  collapse among other different scenarios they're working to set up martial law and of course
[03:59.160 --> 04:03.520]  they don't want you to be independent of their system they don't want you to have cash they
[04:03.520 --> 04:11.560]  don't want you to have bitcoin but it's a very upside down world as we're moving towards
[04:11.560 --> 04:16.160]  gumboat diplomacy in the Middle East going to Yemen going to Iran threatening them of
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.360]  course we have John Kerry this is story on info wars.com the world the U.S. is helping
[04:22.360 --> 04:27.320]  commit atrocities in Yemen and pretending that it's Iran's fault and of course he says
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.760]  Iran needs to recognize U.S. is not going to stand by while the region is destabilized
[04:31.760 --> 04:39.840]  see if we do anything it's not destabilizing but if our political enemies do it is destabilizing
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.760]  we can invade a country we can occupy a country that's not destabilizing what we did in Libya
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.720]  is not destabilizing but we have to worry about our enemies destabilizing things no
[04:48.720 --> 04:58.920]  matter how absurd stay with us we're going to be right back with Alex Jones.
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.360]  Do you enjoy shopping online using PayPal but hate signing in with your username and password
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.760]  well Jonathan LeBlanc PayPal's global head of developer evangelism has now suggested
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.080]  that implantable microchips among other biometric systems could be used to pay in the future
[05:12.080 --> 05:15.480]  that's right the mark of the beast used to buy and sell is being proposed in his recent
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.920]  kill all passwords presentation being circulated in the U.S. and Europe and a wall street journal
[05:19.920 --> 05:23.800]  article titled PayPal wants you to inject your username and eat your password LeBlanc
[05:23.800 --> 05:27.760]  said that identification of people will shift from antiquated external body methods like
[05:27.760 --> 05:32.440]  fingerprints toward internal body functions like heartbeat and vein recognition where embedded
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.560]  and ingestible devices will allow natural body identification these devices will include
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.560]  brain implants and attachable computers which put users in charge of their own security
[05:40.560 --> 05:44.960]  he said well now that Obamacare will have total open access to your medical records your entire
[05:44.960 --> 05:48.960]  biometric makeup will soon be hackable but hey at least you'll be able to buy a vibrating

[08:08.240 --> 08:15.480]  have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action
[08:15.480 --> 08:21.480]  and reply Dr. Martin Luther King the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement
[08:21.480 --> 08:41.080]  has been shot to death in Memphis Tennessee people calling themselves members of the
[08:41.080 --> 08:45.600]  weather underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.160]  and open California they took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.200]  on the cold floor survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation
[08:55.200 --> 09:00.800]  and to what happened an acknowledgement that the Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.280]  Navy ship the death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.160]  nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda the Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down
[09:10.160 --> 09:15.000]  a US helicopter more than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.480]  of them are US Navy SEAL there may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.400]  you can use for the excuse to accelerate the next war if there's one thing that has unified
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.680]  Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between is that we all hated the bank bailout
[09:31.680 --> 09:36.880]  the Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to
[09:36.880 --> 09:43.880]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today it is infinitely easier to kill a million
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.400]  people than to control a million people they estimated that they would have to eliminate
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.920]  25 million people in these reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I need help I'm here
[09:53.920 --> 10:00.920]  to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game from the front lines
[10:00.920 --> 10:12.000]  of the information war it's Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones radio show I'm David Knight
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.280]  here live on Tuesday April the 21st 2015 we have a report that came out yesterday an article
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.880]  that asked the question is Jeb Bush going to Bilderberg in 2015 it's a good question
[10:23.880 --> 10:28.640]  because his campaign announced that he's going to the general area at about the same time
[10:28.640 --> 10:32.800]  that the Bilderberg convention is going to be held this year in the meeting and as we
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.840]  pointed out in the article info wars correctly predicted in 2007 that Texas Governor Rick
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.120]  Perry would run for president 2012 after going to the Bilderberg conference and is Istanbul
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.560]  Turkey it's also reported that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton disappeared off of their
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.440]  schedules mysteriously for a couple of days while the Bilderberg conference was going
[10:52.440 --> 10:59.120]  on in northern Virginia so it's kind of interesting to see that his schedule coincides with that
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.240]  so we just asked that question it's a very secretive organization they don't really
[11:03.240 --> 11:08.320]  talk about what goes on too much there especially if it's certain political figures they don't
[11:08.320 --> 11:12.480]  talk about who comes there they do release now a list of attendees they pretended for
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.240]  a very long time that it didn't exist and so did the press but now in response to this
[11:18.240 --> 11:25.800]  article we had a reporter at Bloomberg a Dave Weigel says whoa if true that's his series
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.280]  or Jeb Bush Bilderberg and the secret rulers of the world a very sarcastic article talks
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.960]  a lot about us being right wingers that we believe there's reptilians they're ever spurting
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.320]  founts of Bilderberger panic that are coming from our radio show now you know what they
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.640]  deny that it existed for decades they didn't cover it for decades Jim Tucker talked about
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.560]  the fact that it was very strange that you could have the most powerful people and politics
[11:52.560 --> 12:00.320]  in the military and corporations all meeting together in secret no oversight no press coverage
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.760]  isn't that interesting that that would happen for decades and it would not be covered and
[12:04.760 --> 12:09.320]  they would laugh if you had suggested that it existed just about 20 years ago even if
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.720]  you suggested that Bilderberg existed you or a ridiculous conspiracy theorist well what
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.560]  happened in this story was he tweeted our story and he tweeted it to Jeb Bush's campaign
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.600]  and he said Tim Miller quickly saw the tweet and responded and he said no and I guess that
[12:26.600 --> 12:31.200]  just settles it so maybe we could settle what's going on with Walmart by asking them why they
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.640]  closed five stores suddenly I guess they could give us a one word response plumbing and it
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.640]  would be done no matter how ridiculous we've got a special report Alex called in from the
[12:39.640 --> 12:45.440]  road with a special report about this Bilderberg let's go to Alex Jones right now that's right
[12:45.440 --> 12:48.840]  David I'm coming to you via cell phone out there working on a story that will be breaking
[12:48.840 --> 12:52.880]  on the next few days shooting some important videos appreciate you doing a great job with
[12:52.880 --> 12:59.360]  the broadcast how am I coming through to you come through good okay fantastic I call things
[12:59.360 --> 13:06.480]  Rosetta Stumps or basically decoder ranks and this story in Bloomberg opens a whole
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.440]  window into how they control people a as you said how they said Bilderberg didn't exist
[13:11.440 --> 13:15.560]  all these years now they have to admit it but larger than that we're not saying Bilderberg
[13:15.560 --> 13:20.440]  is even the only top of the pyramid it's just one spot where this shadow government global
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.000]  corporate system shows itself and the victory of the new media in the last 20 years especially
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.360]  forcing it out of the open but there's a huge media feeding frenzy every year when it takes
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.480]  place I'm sending call Watson to Austria I may go myself right they send you or someone
[13:36.480 --> 13:42.280]  else that I make that decision in the next week or two we sent you to Copenhagen Denmark
[13:42.280 --> 13:49.400]  last year obviously but when you read the article and they say well it's all settled
[13:49.400 --> 13:54.520]  there are no secret groups making decisions there are no secret elites influencing politicians
[13:54.520 --> 13:59.880]  everyone knows the powerful interest in secret groups meeting smokey rooms for hundreds of
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.240]  years well for thousands of years but five hundred years since tobacco was imported to
[14:04.240 --> 14:10.000]  Europe as cigars so so we know all of this goes on we know it's happening and here's
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.640]  Bloomberg in the same packaging a lecture and stated how oh haha it exists but you know
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.080]  Jen Bush has said he's not going so there's your answer there's no secret stuff going
[14:21.080 --> 14:27.040]  on they imply that Hillary and Obama weren't at Bilderberg I watched the secret service
[14:27.040 --> 14:32.960]  drawn by as they pointed MP5 submachine guns at us it's on video and Obama deception I
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.880]  watched as as as as all of this unfolded he disappeared they put the press corps on
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.320]  an airplane and float to Chicago he was there Hillary then stepped down two days after and
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.440]  then she wasn't going to run anymore they were both there that even later came out of
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.160]  some of the European press so so we're doing the media's real job we're not idiots getting
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.800]  Shanghai on an airplane being told that Clinton and Obama are going to Chicago and they all
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.480]  get on the plane on the Obama plane and they close the door and Gibbs gets up and says
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.880]  you know uh well he had a you know a wish to be alone so we put you on the plane and
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.480]  basically kidnapped you Hillary back in the nineties going to Bilderberg meeting was fined
[15:14.480 --> 15:19.480]  several hundred thousand dollars for power in the Logan Act okay Rick Perry went when
[15:19.480 --> 15:25.000]  I was two years ago in England north of London covering Bilderberg with three thousand plus
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.840]  demonstrators a helicopter you know came in with world leaders and the prime minister
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.600]  drove in you know an armored motorcade this is all in video so they sit there and act
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.520]  like this isn't happening the truth is Bilderberg's down on public because they couldn't hide
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.880]  it Davos is now their public front that the International Bank of Settlements and other
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.600]  groups are all chaired by the same people just like this Pacific partnership trade deal
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.640]  secret just like the takeover of the internet was secret it's all secret and they sit here
[15:53.640 --> 15:59.240]  and lecture us like we're children it doesn't work anymore but you read that article which
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.520]  is crazy but here's the good news somebody like Jed Bush a major power broker you know
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.840]  one of the two major crime families that share the crown of power that share the ring of
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.680]  power here you are having to respond to something that they said didn't exist before so it's
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.000]  just crazy Clinton a little known governor 1991 those to Bilderberg two years later he's
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.360]  president I could go on on Tony Blair a little known member of parliament those to Bilderberg
[16:24.360 --> 16:29.440]  three years later he's prime minister I could go on for day after day mentioning all the
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.920]  major deals we have been given secret papers from the sixties when I was at Bilderberg
[16:33.920 --> 16:40.080]  a few years ago in Virginia by a federal archivist that that was Bilderberg taking over the unions
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.400]  in the sixties to actually destroy labor and all this stuff I mean ladies and gentlemen
[16:44.400 --> 16:49.720]  this is a fact we're exposing the shadow oligarchy that controls things they don't like it and
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.560]  it's just important that we put an article out countering them and showing all the places
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.840]  that the major power brokering goes on that we do a piece on the nightly news showing
[16:58.840 --> 17:04.080]  the clips from Obama deception where Gibbs has them all basically hijacked Shanghai with
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.760]  a proper word it's simply amazing that we've gotten to this point and we're having victories
[17:09.760 --> 17:15.240]  and so now all they can do is make fun of us and make jokes and imply that we're insane
[17:15.240 --> 17:19.120]  it doesn't work that's why their ratings go down our ratings go up it's holding people
[17:19.120 --> 17:25.840]  support and prayers because the enemy we are literally in probably 15 to 20 major publications
[17:25.840 --> 17:32.560]  today sometimes hundreds we're attacked on CNN MSNBC by the White House media matters
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.800]  now on a weekly basis ladies and gentlemen this is not fun to say this was true we are
[17:36.800 --> 17:40.760]  now when it comes to fighting tyranny at the very top of the spear thanks to your support
[17:40.760 --> 17:45.880]  and prayers I prayed to God to help us in a position to fight the war God has granted
[17:45.880 --> 17:50.440]  those prayers but now that we've prayed that the day that we put up against Goliath on
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.200]  the field now we have to pray that we begin in the skill and discernment to make sure
[17:54.200 --> 17:59.040]  these rocks hit the enemy right between the eyes politically so this is a big deal folks
[17:59.040 --> 18:07.440]  we are now openly in contention to really expose large sectors of the globalist operation
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.400]  and I'll end with this remember two years ago when the military through info wars.com
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.800]  the noncommissions officers also officers by the thousands put out images saying I won't
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.240]  fight overseas for al-Qaeda I won't be part of this I won't go into Syria then the head
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.080]  of the Joint Chief said to go into Obama they couldn't launch that operation that's the
[18:26.080 --> 18:31.760]  type of thing we're info war we're truth we're David against Goliath can absolutely expose
[18:31.760 --> 18:37.240]  these incredible evils that are going on and it's the same thing with the situation with
[18:37.240 --> 18:41.120]  the Bilderbergs a great job David Knight and crew on a lien mechanism is coming up live
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.120]  in studio I know you also have a state rep on who's leading the fight all over the country
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.480]  to repeal asset for which are seizure laws so we're on the march the umpires on the run
[18:49.480 --> 18:50.480]  thank you so much.
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.760]  Thank you Alex yes so you mentioned that rep that we're going to have that's a Kindle
[18:54.760 --> 19:00.840]  Crocker from Wyoming of course there was a civil asset forfeiture bill that would reign
[19:00.840 --> 19:05.600]  in that process in Wyoming that was passed in both houses it was vetoed by the governor
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.640]  some Republicans changed their position but Kindle Crocker was very outspoken on that
[19:10.640 --> 19:14.840]  he talked about all the different aspects of the Bill of Rights that civil asset forfeiture
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.680]  destroys and so we're going to have him on in the second hour we're going to talk to
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.960]  him also about other efforts that are going on there as well as in other states to essentially
[19:23.960 --> 19:29.600]  establish our rights to do process to say that you're not going to have a property taken
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.640]  away from you unless you're actually charged and convicted with a crime imagine that imagine
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.000]  that they wouldn't give you excessive fines wouldn't that be interesting to live in an
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.960]  America like that stay with us when we come back I've got an amazing story about the
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.640]  Miami Herald and how they covered up the Bay of Pigs of course that was just a conspiracy
[19:48.640 --> 19:59.480]  theory at the time we'll be right back

[24:19.240 --> 24:34.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday April 21st 2015 I'm David Knight your host today before I get back to the news and I have more to say about this ridiculous Bloomberg article before I do I want to let you know that at our
[24:34.240 --> 24:56.240]  Info Wars Life Store we have a special on Silver Bullet right now 50% off it's usually $29.95 it is $14.95 save you about $15 on that and of course that's preparedness grade Silver is concentrated to a powerful 30 parts per million we've been sold out for months at a time right now we have it in stock it's a good time to stock up for 2015 again
[24:56.240 --> 25:14.240]  half off right now at info wars life.com that's how we support this operation and of course that allows us to actually have a voice here you know for years I would hear that we I remember the early 90s and the Libertarian Party people would bring up the
[25:14.240 --> 25:29.240]  Bilderberg group and I would laugh at them I didn't believe it existed we didn't have internet then as early 90s and of course the media is completely controlled there are a few people like Jim Tucker who are laboring in the wilderness Daniel Estlin writing
[25:29.240 --> 25:45.240]  books covering it mainstream media pretended that it didn't exist and so now what they do is they mock anybody that talks about it that's what this Bloomberg article is talking about the New World Order is dictates are being hammered out at Bilderberg according to us and we're always spurting
[25:45.240 --> 26:00.240]  thoughts of Bilderberg panic that's the way he puts it interesting thing is is that as he tweeted our article to the Bush campaign they come back and he says and this is the subtitle of his article the likely Republican candidates campaign debunks Alex Jones
[26:00.240 --> 26:18.240]  you know what he did to debunk us he just said no oh that's it the royalty has spoken the Bush campaign has spoken all they have to do single word they debunk us and then of course this idiot who works for Bloomberg writes a little mocking
[26:18.240 --> 26:34.240]  story well let me tell you how the press really works let's take a little bit of a history lesson this is a mea culpa from the Miami Herald they say the Miami Herald the CIA and the Bay of Pigs scoop that did not run this is a story that ran the end of last week
[26:34.240 --> 26:50.240]  and they start out with a quote from JFK says it was the beating of our lives Kennedy said a few days after he wondered why nobody had talked him out of the Bay of Pigs and so this article says well could the Miami Herald have done that could we have talked him out of it
[26:50.240 --> 27:05.240]  actually seven months before it had happened they had a story talking about how it was going to happen and it's pretty amazing how they came across the story they had a 16 year old his name is John Keough and he was working on a farm
[27:05.240 --> 27:20.240]  he had a bunch of his friends are going to come over and gather up some chickens for somebody that they were going to sell them to the person never showed up so they all these 16 year old kids are kind of hanging around with nothing to do they decide they're going to drive into town and just kind of hang around see if they can find somebody to talk to
[27:20.240 --> 27:32.240]  have some coax or whatever one of the guys said hey I saw something really weird there's this camp of migrant farm workers and they're dancing around the fire at night and acting really weird so he said so we thought we'd go by and see what they're doing
[27:32.240 --> 27:47.240]  and when they got there one of the guys said hey I've got some firecrackers it'll be funny to see what happens if we throw some firecrackers and scare these guys so they light some firecrackers and they throw them and guess what happens they take out as they say in the article here a host of weapons
[27:47.240 --> 28:03.240]  including a 30 caliber machine guns opened up from inside the camp one of the bullets came through the window of Keough's pickup truck hit him in the back of the head and left him blind over the next 72 hours he had to have three surgeries to survive
[28:03.240 --> 28:19.240]  now when the police got there they were told that these are members of a Cuban counter-revolutionary army that was training to overthrow Castro the police were not impressed they picked these guys up they arrested 15 of them they charged two of them with attempted murder
[28:19.240 --> 28:35.240]  but they never went to trial these charges just kind of sat there they say even the most routine legal proceedings were unscheduled then they found out when a cop told a reporter saying why isn't anybody being charged with this what's going on
[28:35.240 --> 28:47.240]  a cop whispered to him and said the State Department has asked for us to throw these things out well then you had a reporter doing his job today he would be called a conspiracy theorist
[28:47.240 --> 28:56.240]  but he started doing his job so he started calling around they said try to find out what's going on with the State Department well they didn't want to talk to him but the Justice Department did
[28:56.240 --> 29:11.240]  he had some contacts in the Justice Department they said they had a feud that was going on between FBI director J.R.G. Hoover and the CIA the CIA wanted to train an army of Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro but the FBI was charged with enforcing the Federal Neutrality Act
[29:11.240 --> 29:23.240]  so that kind of made it illegal to do a military expedition right we have laws that the FBI is trying to enforce they're charged with enforcing that but the CIA wants to do it anyway
[29:23.240 --> 29:34.240]  so the bottom line is they do a story and Dulles calls up the owner of the newspaper and he says spike that story the story never ran
[29:34.240 --> 29:46.240]  what would have happened if we had known that they were trying to overthrow the Cuban government what would happen if we knew that our government was trying to overthrow the Constitution and enact martial law
[29:46.240 --> 29:48.240]  say with us we'll be right back
[29:48.240 --> 30:06.240]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:06.240 --> 30:34.240]  we're on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[33:19.240 --> 33:29.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[33:29.240 --> 33:40.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're going to be joined in the next hour with a representative from Wyoming who worked very hard to try to overturn civil asset forfeiture there
[33:40.240 --> 33:50.240]  we need to understand that if we don't uphold property rights for people then we become essentially slaves that's what you call people who don't have any property who don't have any rights
[33:50.240 --> 33:57.240]  and of course civil asset forfeiture not only directly attacks our property rights but it attacks all of our rights to do process as well
[33:57.240 --> 34:05.240]  it takes away our right to have a trial and be found guilty you know to be charged with a crime it just confiscates our property
[34:05.240 --> 34:15.240]  and of course there's no sense of proportion as we pointed out many times they'll go in for example and take a family's home as they try to do in Philadelphia
[34:15.240 --> 34:23.240]  take the entire family's home because their teenager sold $40 worth of pot to somebody on the back porch that's the way civil asset forfeiture works
[34:23.240 --> 34:32.240]  so we're going to talk to him about the process there we need to understand there is a pushback at the state level it's very important he'll be joining us in the next hour
[34:32.240 --> 34:41.240]  right now I want to continue with what I was talking about in terms of the lap dog media just as we had this Bloomberg mocking report about our questioning
[34:41.240 --> 34:49.240]  whether or not Jeb Bush was going to be going to Bilderberg as he's traveling to that area of Europe at about the same time
[34:49.240 --> 34:58.240]  a good question to ask just as people are asking what's going on with Walmart of course they're telling everybody it's plumbing that absolutely nobody believes that
[34:58.240 --> 35:07.240]  they haven't pulled any plumbing permits in any of these cities we've seen video where they have it heavily guarded with police some people have gone in and taken shots of it
[35:07.240 --> 35:14.240]  you can see that they have cleared the shelves and they have barricaded with visual barricades the rest of the stores so you can't see it
[35:14.240 --> 35:23.240]  so we don't know what's going on there's an article on info wars dot com asking if this is in retaliation to the unions the people who are trying to get minimum wage raised
[35:23.240 --> 35:35.240]  that's one possibility there are also other possibilities of people have talked about in terms of how this might be turned over to the government to use in these military exercises or whatever we don't know
[35:35.240 --> 35:46.240]  when you give people implausible stories when you flat out lie to them as Walmart is lying to people as the government lies to people that's when people start to investigate
[35:46.240 --> 35:57.240]  and then they dismiss that calling it a conspiracy theory let's look at what's going on with Sony because you know for years we were telling you at info wars Alex Jones is telling you
[35:57.240 --> 36:09.240]  they're listening to everything you say they're watching everything you do on your computer on your phone they can turn on the camera on your monitor and they can watch and record you
[36:09.240 --> 36:19.240]  oh you're a bunch of paranoid conspiracy theorists with tinfoil hats we were told nobody questions that anymore and the sad thing is we're not stopping it either
[36:19.240 --> 36:29.240]  now there's a story on RT about the new Sony picture they bought the rights to Glenn Greenwald's book about Edward Snowden and they put out a press release
[36:29.240 --> 36:41.240]  and the internal emails that were hacked out of Sony have all been released now by WikiLeaks so we can get a glimpse into their internal workings there at Sony
[36:41.240 --> 36:49.240]  very interesting to see what they did in this particular case when they put out this press release for the book that they're going to make the movie out of it
[36:49.240 --> 36:59.240]  the book is No Place to Hide Ed Snowden the NSA and the US Surveillance State that was Glenn Greenwald's book they're going to make a movie out of that so they put out a press release
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.240]  and this is what the person who reviewed it on the inside said he says I have a few concerns
[37:05.240 --> 37:16.240]  in the second paragraph first sentence instead of saying US government's illegal spying operations I would propose US government's controversial intelligence gathering
[37:16.240 --> 37:25.240]  so don't call it a spy operation don't say the US government is illegally spying on people say it's controversial it's not illegal it's controversial
[37:25.240 --> 37:32.240]  it's not spying it's gathering intelligence oh you know because of our safety you know national security and all that
[37:32.240 --> 37:41.240]  second change second paragraph last sentence I would replace the term misuse of power with actions
[37:41.240 --> 37:48.240]  actions it's not misuse of power it's not illegal it's just actions that our government takes
[37:48.240 --> 37:59.240]  that's the way they cover it up and Sony is one of the worst companies at doing this of course with the interview they were pushing for an assassination agenda as regime change
[37:59.240 --> 38:09.240]  they were they were propagandizing the American public the South Korean public and hopefully they thought the North Korean republic to
[38:09.240 --> 38:19.240]  it's not a republic whatever you want to call North Korea they were propagandizing everyone in a comedy film that they needed to have assassination
[38:19.240 --> 38:28.240]  they explicitly said that back and forth in the emails that's the way they propagandize you it's not just in the news that they don't cover
[38:28.240 --> 38:34.240]  it's not just in the news that they mock it's also in the movies that they put out
[38:34.240 --> 38:40.240]  here's another one one of the other things they found when they looked at these hacked Sony emails they found out
[38:40.240 --> 38:52.240]  surprisingly that Sony had on its server pirated ebooks imagine that wow how's that for hypocrisy the same people who want draconian
[38:52.240 --> 39:00.240]  measures in place where they can shut down entire websites and take over the internet shut down anybody that they don't like just by alleging
[39:00.240 --> 39:07.240]  and again we're back to the kind of mindset that we have a civil asset forfeiture you don't have to prove that somebody's guilty or something
[39:07.240 --> 39:15.240]  you just merely have to be a large powerful company or individual and alleged that somebody did wrong and then the government will step in for you
[39:15.240 --> 39:24.240]  and make it happen just like that they will shut down an entire website based on an allegation that's the way these copyright things are going to work
[39:24.240 --> 39:32.240]  they haven't been able to get that through the congress through the legislature so they're going to push it through with the trans-pacific and transatlantic partnerships
[39:32.240 --> 39:40.240]  that's the kind of thing that they're putting in there to push through so Sony doesn't like pirating they want to be able to shut down entire websites
[39:40.240 --> 39:50.240]  if they alleged that you have pirated some of their material and of course they believe these few media companies these five media companies they believe they own the world
[39:50.240 --> 39:59.240]  they think they own everything you know from happy birthday tunes to you name it they think they own everything so they'd be able to shut down anybody that they want
[39:59.240 --> 40:08.240]  well it turns out that they had pirated ebooks on there and here's the irony okay the books are books about how to hack
[40:08.240 --> 40:18.240]  that's what they had on their server site there you go they didn't pay for the books they stole them and they had books on hacking on their site there you go
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.240]  now we're talking about surveillance there was an interesting story that I saw that we had at the end of the week last week
[40:24.240 --> 40:33.240]  Mikhail Thelen put up on Friday Intelligent Street Lights that we see in Jacksonville Florida this is another aspect of the corporate surveillance state
[40:33.240 --> 40:42.240]  and the way that they co-op the corporations the large preferred corporations and of course this is one of the most preferred corporations general electric
[40:42.240 --> 40:52.240]  the one that has perhaps the closest ties to the Obama administration of course a no tax paying corporation of course general electric
[40:52.240 --> 41:01.240]  now in Jacksonville Florida the city government is preparing to install Intelligent Street Lights it's going to be about 150 of them it's a pilot program by General Electric
[41:01.240 --> 41:10.240]  they call it the Intelligent City Initiative now they're going to have Intelligent LEDs they say they're going to be a gateway to city changing technology
[41:10.240 --> 41:17.240]  and no doubt sensors controls wireless transmitters microprocessors all inside the LED systems we've talked about that as well too
[41:17.240 --> 41:25.240]  that even your lights are being used to spy on you Petraeus was bragging about it actually said it in a speech and when we reported it we were
[41:25.240 --> 41:34.240]  attacked by people like Bloomberg for saying that we were conspiracy theorists the internet of things is actually a way to get everything in your house
[41:34.240 --> 41:42.240]  collecting and reporting data to the government to corporations now in this particular case GE's got some software that they call pre-dix
[41:42.240 --> 41:50.240]  sounds an awful lot like minority reports pre-crime doesn't it so it's going to collect and analyze data from these street lights
[41:50.240 --> 41:58.240]  and they say it's going to deliver optimized tools for city challenges I wonder what kind of city challenges those would be I'm sure they'll find some way to make money off it
[41:58.240 --> 42:06.240]  but here's the deal here's the way this works and you need to understand this because this is the way Syspa is set up to why we have Syspa
[42:06.240 --> 42:16.240]  they say data will be hosted on GE's network city and GEA whatever that is I don't know what the acronym is anyway I guess that's Jacksonville something
[42:16.240 --> 42:26.240]  but the city officials can request that data and they can use it internally I'm sure they'll have to pay for it but that's the fiction that they use to get around
[42:26.240 --> 42:34.240]  they say the fourth mint requirements they say well this data that you have with your cell phone company this data that you have with your internet service provider
[42:34.240 --> 42:46.240]  this data that we collected in public that's not you that belongs to GE or it belongs to AT&T or it belongs to your internet service provider
[42:46.240 --> 42:54.240]  they own that information even though it's your private information even though it's something about you the corporation owns it so all the government has to do
[42:54.240 --> 42:59.240]  is ask the corporations this is the corporation's data they can just turn it over to you they don't need to get a search warrant
[42:59.240 --> 43:07.240]  see that's the way they're doing this they're saying that it's the corporation's data it's an outright lie and we need to call them on it
[43:07.240 --> 43:19.240]  but that's why they're putting out Syspa Syspa's Cyber Intelligence Sharing Protection Act okay they put it out several times it was defeated by Aaron Schwartz
[43:19.240 --> 43:29.240]  they depending on who you believe he was either driven to suicide or he was murdered to keep him from opposing it in the future
[43:29.240 --> 43:37.240]  they fail several times to do this and you gotta understand it's coming back now the Republicans are very much into this entire surveillance state
[43:37.240 --> 43:46.240]  pretty much everybody except for Rand Paul they're calling it Syspa this time they've taken out the P maybe it's because people kept asking well where's the protection
[43:46.240 --> 43:55.240]  the only protection that's in Syspa the only protection that's in this legislation Syspa is protection for the corporations because if they collect information on you
[43:55.240 --> 44:04.240]  like this GE program in Jacksonville if they collect that information on you spy on you let's just call it that it's not intelligence gathering it's spying
[44:04.240 --> 44:14.240]  okay they're a bunch of creepy illegal voyors we need to call them what they are if they collect this information on you and turn it over to the government
[44:14.240 --> 44:25.240]  then you're not going to be able to sue them if they get this bill passed Syspa which is again the multiple instantiation of Syspa
[44:25.240 --> 44:32.240]  there was also another article that came out this weekend the end of the license plate this was linked on the drudge report and actually came from Cato Institute
[44:32.240 --> 44:47.240]  and when I saw this my first response was a to Cato I mean talk about betrayal the whole premise of this is that because we have cameras everywhere license plates are now a threat to your privacy
[44:47.240 --> 45:00.240]  well yeah no doubt everybody is looking at this the problem though is not the license plate the problem is the cameras but that's not their solution their solution is to go one level further into a surveillance state
[45:00.240 --> 45:11.240]  get rid of license plates and give all of your cars RFID transponders so you can't even get rid of your spy phone that you've got in your pocket
[45:11.240 --> 45:21.240]  you know the I watch from Apple the I watch you is what ought to be called you can't even get rid of that they'll put it into your car make your car spy on you
[45:21.240 --> 45:29.240]  and the guy says I've testified to Congress about these cameras I've said that they are a big brother infrastructure yeah they are
[45:29.240 --> 45:38.240]  so get rid of the cameras put rules on the cameras but no we will go through and we'll do RFID and this is an interesting thing that he pointed out he said if a law were proposed today
[45:38.240 --> 45:48.240]  requiring people walking on sidewalks to wear name tags Americans would strongly reject such an attack on the freedom to move about anonymously yes they would I think they would
[45:48.240 --> 46:02.240]  well I know maybe they wouldn't maybe they wouldn't understand that that's important but I think perhaps that they would I agree with him the trade-offs he says don't make sense in name tagging because people who are walking have far less capacity to harm another person
[46:02.240 --> 46:14.240]  than someone who's behind the wheel of a car there you go there you go Kato Institute making the argument that you should give up your liberty for security for safety
[46:14.240 --> 46:24.240]  Kato the libertarian think tank supposedly selling the idea that we need to give up our freedom our liberty for security
[46:24.240 --> 46:34.240]  as we said many times if you give up your security as Benjamin Franklin pointed out you don't deserve liberty but you know what history has shown us that you don't get it either
[46:34.240 --> 46:49.240]  if you give up your liberty you're just a slave you're putting yourself in a maximum security prison that's where this is all headed so he says there's a few obvious alternatives to automobile licensing and he talks about the RFID thing
[46:49.240 --> 47:06.240]  he says however he says we could make laws against people recording and taking pictures of your automobile license but you know that would essentially be futile so what we'll do is we will we can enforce laws against people
[47:06.240 --> 47:16.240]  snapping your license plate so what we'll do is we'll require that you put a spy transponder on your car and then that will be broadcast only to the government because we can trust the government
[47:16.240 --> 47:26.240]  remember this is the Kato Institute talking this isn't Hillary Clinton talking this is the Kato Institute Libertarian think tank saying okay we're going to report this back to the government but don't worry
[47:26.240 --> 47:42.240]  you can trust the government it's just other people that you have to worry about look if you can't enforce privacy through automobile tags you're not going to be able to enforce it through RFIDs you're creating an infrastructure of tyranny that is even more horrific
[47:42.240 --> 47:52.240]  and just as we look at this article that came out yesterday district attorney says encrypted phones may make you a terrorist because they can't be accessed by law enforcement
[47:52.240 --> 48:00.240]  what do we say about a society where all of our leaders do everything in secret I mean that's one of the aspects of the Bilderberg group right
[48:00.240 --> 48:18.240]  there's a secrecy the fact there's no press there there's no coverage allowed it's Davos as they said without press passes that was what the Bloomberg article said yeah that ought to concern us when you've got the wealthiest most powerful corporations
[48:18.240 --> 48:29.240]  meeting with the most powerful politicians and there is no oversight you don't even have an accurate record of who all is there they tell you some of the people that are there you don't get a complete listing of that
[48:29.240 --> 48:40.240]  we ought to be concerned about that we ought to be concerned about a society where everything the rich and powerful do is secret but everything the rest of us do is an open book
[48:40.240 --> 48:51.240]  just as they're saying that PayPal wants to take a look at they want to implant passwords into our stomach and into our brain they view us as cattle
[48:51.240 --> 49:07.240]  treating us as if we were prisoners in a concentration camp as if we were their slaves that's the bottom line they want to get rid of these Apple phones you know quite frankly I don't necessarily believe that the Apple phones do give you anonymity perhaps
[49:07.240 --> 49:22.240]  they're just saying that so that they'll get you to buy them again because we had those slides that got released as part of the Snowden documents that showed the NSA laughing about the fact the connection between Steve Jobs Apple in 1984
[49:22.240 --> 49:37.240]  of course they use the famous 1984 commercial to announce the release of the Macintosh in 1984 and they said who would have thought in 1984 and they show that that commercial that this would become big brother and they show Steve Jobs holding an iPhone and then they show the crowd
[49:37.240 --> 49:51.240]  lining up like a manic crowd to purchase iPhones I said and that the public would pay for it so now they're telling you don't worry Apple has created a phone that is dark they cannot be accessed by law enforcement
[49:51.240 --> 50:05.240]  even when a court has authorized us to look at its contents complains the government which has been working with Apple and Google and the rest of these companies to spy on us they say that's going to be terrorist communications device of choice
[50:05.240 --> 50:21.240]  well I don't know I think that maybe that's true I seriously doubt that they don't have access to that I don't think anybody finds it credible anymore that the government is not spying on us we know they're spying on everything as a matter of fact Twitter now has moved their
[50:21.240 --> 50:35.240]  non-US accounts to Ireland just to get away from the USA they're required to turn over all this stuff by US law to comply with NSA driven requests but if you're not an American you get privacy from the NSA
[50:35.240 --> 50:48.240]  of course they say Ireland there's also another motive to this because Ireland doesn't have as stringent privacy regulations as they do elsewhere in Europe so there may be an economic basis of that but good for Twitter at least they get some of the people away from the NSA
[50:48.240 --> 50:58.240]  stay with us we'll be right back

[53:59.240 --> 54:08.240]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[54:08.240 --> 54:37.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're going to be having a Wyoming state legislature representative joining us in the next hour
[54:37.240 --> 54:52.240]  we're going to talk to him about the efforts in that state to try to stop civil asset forfeiture of course it was stopped in new mexico we had the legislature there bipartisan both houses the senate and the house passed it unanimously
[54:52.240 --> 55:04.240]  one of them is controlled by one party the other ones controlled by the other party and the governor signed it at the last minute we're all wondering if she's going to do a pocket veto she waited so long never said anything about it but she did sign it so that's now become law
[55:04.240 --> 55:15.240]  new mexico was one of the worst states in terms of abuses of civil asset forfeiture but this is a national problem this is something that came to us out of the war on drugs
[55:15.240 --> 55:25.240]  and it is a bipartisan movement there is a bipartisan movement to push back against this is something that's happening at state legislatures it is something that's happening at the national level
[55:25.240 --> 55:41.240]  we're going to play a couple of clips here from a couple of senators ran paul as well as senator mike lee talking about asset forfeiture and it's also very very much in the news right now because the presumptive attorney general jessica lynch the one who's been nominated to take
[55:41.240 --> 55:56.240]  eric holder's place that's now coming to a head it looks like they're going to move forward with these hearings she is firmly on the side of continuing civil asset forfeiture so here's what ran paul says about loretta lynch and civil asset forfeiture
[55:56.240 --> 56:11.240]  well basically the government can take money from you without ever convicting you without ever even charging you in fact the most famous u.s. attorney for doing this is loretta lynch she confiscated a hundred and ten million dollars worth of people's stuff
[56:11.240 --> 56:31.240]  never tried them never even took them to court just kept their money and it turns justice on its head because you're presumed to be guilty until you prove that you're innocent and so I'm very opposed to this I've met with a president about this and we're putting forward legislation that says they shouldn't be allowed to take your stuff without a conviction
[56:31.240 --> 56:45.240]  absolutely and most also have this is a senator mike lee talking about why asset forfeiture has exploded again we're going to have a state rep joining us in the next hour to have that clip ready
[56:45.240 --> 56:49.240]  okay let's go that clip of senator mike lee
[56:49.240 --> 57:11.240]  the constitution says that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law despite this product this protection that we have in our constitution the testimony today and recent news reports indicate that due process is often ignored when it comes to civil asset forfeiture
[57:11.240 --> 57:25.240]  well we all agree that crime should not pay the federal forfeiture laws have enabled and even in some cases incentivize law enforcement practices that have great potential to threaten our liberty
[57:25.240 --> 57:45.240]  that's why I'm a co-sponsor of the fair act along with my colleague senator ran paul I look forward to working with my fellow legislators to eliminate the profit and incentive that forfeiture creates and to adopt procedures that have a greater capacity to protect our constitutional rights
[57:45.240 --> 58:00.240]  that's right and we're going to talk to a state representative who's working on it at the state level now when the governor in Wyoming vetoed what representative Kendall croaker who's going to be joining us in the next hour when he vetoed what was passed there by both houses
[58:00.240 --> 58:12.240]  representative croaker who are going to be talking to the next hour said civil asset forfeiture violates the fifth the sixth and the seventh amendments to the US Constitution this is a discussion we need to have very very important
[58:12.240 --> 58:27.240]  and so we're going to be talking to him in the next hour and I want to remind you that if you're not a subscriber to prison planet TV please consider supporting our operation is where I typically hang out it's where Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson are doing reports
[58:27.240 --> 58:40.240]  and of course Leanne McAdoo is going to be joining us in the third hour as well so the next hour we've got representative croaker coming on to talk to us about civil asset forfeiture stay with us we'll be right back

[59:49.240 --> 01:00:00.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:32.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're going to be joined in the next segment by a representative Wyoming to talk about civil asset forfeiture
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:44.240]  I want to go over some news at the top of the hour here as I mentioned earlier in the program the article that we have on infowars.com the U.S. is helping commit atrocities in Yemen yet pretending that it's Iran's fault
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:59.240]  Now Noam Chomsky had an interesting comment on all of this very specifically about Iran because we had Secretary of State John Kerry saying that what Iran is doing is destabilizing the area
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:06.240]  Yet we are the ones who are sending a massive fleet there practicing gunboat diplomacy
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:15.240]  Noam Chomsky said this he said the most interesting one is the charge that Iran is destabilizing the Middle East because it's supporting militias that have killed American soldiers in Iraq
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:26.240]  That's kind of as if in 1943 the Nazi press had criticized England because it was destabilizing Europe for supporting partisans who were killing German soldiers occupying those countries
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:40.240]  In other words the assumption is that whenever the U.S. invades it kills a couple hundred thousand people it destroys the country it elicits sectarian conflicts that are now tearing Iraq and the region apart that's stabilization
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:47.240]  That's stabilization yet if someone resists that pact that is destabilization
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:57.240]  That's the insane world that we live in that's I guess another example of American exceptionalism that is pushed by the American press that whatever we do there's a different standard
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:11.240]  Of course we know there's a different standard for our government in the way that it allows its employees to work as opposed to the way it allows civilians who are not in the military who are not in the militarized police to operate
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:22.240]  But truly this country is digressing into insanity listen to this article we've got a judge in New York that gives chimpanzees human rights for the first time
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:31.240]  We've got a New York judge that said two apes are covered by habeas corpus habeas corpus you know when are we going to get that kind of protection for human beings
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:44.240]  When are we going to have rights I mean what kind of you know what first I said was this a kangaroo court we have plenty of kangaroo courts actually we have kangaroo courts pretty much in every one of the bureaucracies
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:52.240]  But now they're going to give special rights they're going to get recognized human rights for chimpanzees when they don't recognize human rights for human beings
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  That's precisely what we're going to be talking about in the next hour you know when we when this was vetoed in Wyoming the governor there who is a former prosecutor said we have a right to do this
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:17.240]  In other words the government has a right you don't have rights only the government has rights and so the government grants you privileges if you're a good little ape but otherwise they don't
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:27.240]  Now just to understand fully the kind of brave new world that we're living in this article on info wars dot com school under fire for transgender kindergarten lesson
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:44.240]  Kindergarten lesson that they never informed the parents about of course this is these are officials at the Mitchell primary school and this is a situation where they have a book about a transgender trial that was read to most of the schools
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:04:00.240]  Kindergarten through third grade students they say we have a practice of if a topic is considered to be sensitive parents should be informed so you know they're not going to fire them they're not going to not do that maybe in the future they will just tell you
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:16.240]  We're going to talk to your kindergartner about transgender issues listen I don't want government officials I don't want teachers who aren't the parents of my kids okay I don't want some stranger talking to my kids about
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:37.240]  heterosexual issues at kindergarten age end of story this is a brave new world scenario you know when they talked about sex education that that's where this is leading into this type of thing where they preoccupy the society with this type of sexual preoccupation
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:52.240]  That was a strategy of brave new world when we look at it are we living in George Orwell's 1984 we live in in brave new world the answer is we're living in both we get different approaches depending on what level of society you're in what
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:05:04.240]  But we're getting brave new world and 1984 at the same time stay with us we'll be right back with representative Kroger Tyrus bird recently won the mayoral race for the small town of Parma Missouri on the platform of cleaning up the city
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:20.240]  Mayor elect bird beat the 37 year incumbent by 37 votes and immediately upon taking office five of the town's six police officers resigned along with the city's attorney clerk and wastewater treatment supervisor the Huffington Post has jumped on this story saying it's all because of racism well according to them everyone white is racist unless you're a
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:35.240]  Lisping MSNBC contributor just look at the headline police officials resigned after small Missouri town elects first black female mayor now let's look at the facts the town has one police officer for every 123 residents total overkill she was elected by the citizens of Parma where she once worked as

[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:33.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host we're joined now by representative kindle croaker and he is a representative from wyoming we want to talk to him about the civil asset forfeiture bill that was passed in wyoming of course this was a
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:49.240]  reform bill that would stop this practice we played in the last hour comments from senator ran paul and mike lee both talking about the dangers of civil asset forfeiture how it destroys our basically our not only our rights but our legal system
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:09:04.240]  it encourages the police to act in a corrupt way it gives them incentives to confiscate people's property without even charging people with a crime let alone finding them guilty of a crime so we want to talk to him and see what the situation there in wyoming is
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:20.240]  because it was vetoed by the governor is being reported by freedom works that wyoming lawmakers may take another shot at offering some kind of a protection for people and their property so i want to talk to him about what the current situation there is
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:37.240]  thank you for joining us representative croaker hello hello hey how you doing thank you for joining us first of all can you tell the audience so what the current state is right now are they going to come back with a another law about civil asset forfeiture
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:45.240]  we're working on it's i'm a member of the judiciary committee and it has been picked up as one of our official interim topics
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:56.240]  okay all right good let's go back and talk about the basic problem we had senator ran paul and mike lee we had a couple of short clips in the last hour they kind of laid down some of the problems for it
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:11.240]  would you talk to the audience and explain why we should be concerned about civil asset forfeiture this is something that affects we seem bipartisan support in the mexico as it got passed their democrats and republicans and yet we still see that with
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:25.240]  the nominee for attorney general eric holder at the replacement for him jessica lynch she is very much an advocate of continuing civil asset forfeiture so can you explain that to the audience why that is a problem
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:41.240]  well it's a major problem because it basically just shoots a hole in the bill of rights the fifth amendment among other things says that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process and to me due process means that you get your day in court
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:56.240]  your innocent well proven guilty to be on the government where they can take your possession away and with civil asset forfeiture none of those protections are there and it's interesting because the cases aren't even against the person
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:08.240]  if you have your some cash seized from you the court case in wyoming it's it's not the state of wyoming versus you know joe blow it's the state of wyoming versus five thousand dollars in cash
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:17.240]  yeah it's kind of like an allison wonderland situation yet they're charging inanimate objects with being accessories to crime is absolutely amazing what they do
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:29.240]  yeah it is it's just something that you just I can't even comprehend that this happens in america I think this is another sign that our country really is on life support for the great country that we know
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:39.240]  the you were mentioning earlier about the government thinking that they're the one that grants rights I mean our original founding document the declaration of independence says that
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:51.240]  that to secure these rights governments were instituted among men so the only purpose that we have is for government is to protect our individual rights and they've just flipped that upside down
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:12:00.240]  yes it absolutely is upside down it's very interesting because the governor there who vetoed this and again you had a bill that would have stopped civil asset forfeiture in wyoming
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:09.240]  and the governor had a couple of different ways that he approached this when he vetoed it number one we need to understand that he is a former federal attorney is that correct
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:21.240]  that's correct he's a former prosecutor so he's coming at it from that standpoint because it was after all the federal government that gave us this legal fiction of civil asset forfeiture so he says it's important and it's a right
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:31.240]  so the first thing he says just as you mentioned there is that the government has a right to take your property without charging you of any crime without giving you a trial without finding you guilty they just take your
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:44.240]  your property and they don't have to make it proportional to whatever the crime was that's also something that's in the bill of rights but then it goes on to say crime should not pay especially drug crime
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:52.240]  well it seems to me representative croaker that crime is paying for the law enforcement agencies it's paying very well for them isn't it
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:13:05.240]  yes it is and it's some parts of the country most more so than others luckily in wyoming we haven't seen the the gross gross abuses of this process most of the amount seized or smaller but to me that's that's still criminal
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:18.240]  and somebody has you know two thousand dollars taken from them and they never get a day in court and they have to if they want to get their money back they have to hire an attorney and sue the government to get it back to me that's not due process
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:30.240]  that's that's that's not innocent until proven guilty and and to me that that is a crime right there one of the other things that he said so first of all he says the government has a right to take your property he says crime should not pay
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:46.240]  especially drug crime but this kind of civil asset forfeiture is funding a lot of police departments a lot of attorneys prosecuting attorneys departments and then he goes on to say that it's not a problem in Wyoming anyway you don't have that kind of problem like you do in
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  other states but of course if we allow this kind of legal structure to exist even if you didn't have even if that were true in Wyoming that it it's never happened in Wyoming we were warned by Madison that if you know this famous thing
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:18.240]  in Federalist 51 he said hey if men were angels no government would be necessary but if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary in other words we have to remember that government is comprised of men
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:34.240]  who are just a cross section of the population like Frank Cerberco said you're going to have crooked cops as well as honest cops it's going to be a cross section of society and so the question is do we set up controls to keep from having systemic corruption that's the real issue
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:42.240]  it isn't whether or not somebody has abused this yet in Wyoming but are you setting up a structure that allows them to I guess that's really the question isn't it
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:54.240]  yeah and that's really the issue for us I mean we as lawmakers our job is to make sure that the law is right and just and fair and this law is not the law itself is abusive
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:06.240]  even if it hasn't been abused further then that means now's the exact right time to change it let's change it before it does get abused if our current law enforcement community in Wyoming is doing an honorable job well that's great
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:20.240]  but who's to say who's going to be behind the badge 10 years from now 20 years from now and so it's our job to protect future generations as much as as our own generation and that means fixing a bad law and changing it now
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:36.240]  yeah I know when when Rand Paul was talking to people about some of these types of issues he said to them he said I'm not saying that Obama is necessarily a bad man what I'm saying is you don't want to have a legal system that requires on having good men in office to keep from having abuse
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:54.240]  that's the whole reason that the founders like James Madison set up checks and balances that's the whole reason we have the Bill of Rights as you pointed out these rights come from God and we had them formally recognized in the Constitution so that the government would not take them away
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:10.240]  and now they're ignoring that Constitution as you pointed out when the governor vetoed this you said civil asset forfeiture violates the fifth the sixth and the seventh amendments to the U.S. Constitution I think you talked about the fifth talk about the other two talk about how it violates those amendments to the Constitution
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:26.240]  well between the sixth and seventh amendments to the Constitution it provides for somebody who cannot afford an attorney to have one appointed for them and that's not the case at all if a person wants an attorney in a civil case they have to hire it themselves
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:40.240]  and one of the scary things of Wyoming is that the median amount seized was around $2,000 and for $2,000 you can't hire an attorney and go to court and have it cost less than that so it's just not practical
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:58.240]  the other protection there is the right to a jury trial and in civil matters and amounts over $20 I believe is what the Constitution says and oftentimes these people live in gets a court our attorney general in front of our committee meeting last week
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:12.240]  I asked him about the due process issue and his response was well the Supreme Court has ruled that sending a notice to somebody in the mail that their assets are being seized is due process
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:32.240]  to me that's the opposite of due process and I think just saying that a Supreme Court has decided something makes it right I think that's a scary precedent to go down I remember at one point in our country the Supreme Court had ruled that black individuals were property and not people
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:44.240]  and so if you're saying that just because the Supreme Court says something it's right well then I think that there's a lot of decisions in the past that have been overturned that you don't want to agree with
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:54.240]  absolutely I don't need nine politically appointed judges to interpret the Constitution for me it's not like it's written in a foreign language I can read it myself and it's pretty clear
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:06.240]  and we have to understand that these ideas are coming from Washington I don't know that we're going to see a solution coming out of it in spite of senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee and of course they're joined as a bipartisan effort
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:21.240]  there's some Democrat senators who have joined with them to stop this this is just a Republican thing actually interestingly enough civil asset forfeiture began with Ronald Reagan as part of his war on drugs we ought to we ought to recognize that and we ought to correct that
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:34.240]  but I wanted to talk to you about what's going on right now because I think really the solutions are going to be coming from the states and that's why I wanted to get a state legislator like you who understands and appreciates and
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:47.240]  the Constitution and obeys the Constitution stands up for it I think that's really our only hope there's so much corruption in Washington that even if we have a handful of Democrat and Republican senators who want to stand up for our civil liberties
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:19:02.240]  I'm still very skeptical that's going to happen let's talk about what's going on in Wyoming now this was vetoed by the governor when it was passed and then there were some Republicans who defected and did not over so you couldn't override the veto at that point
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:16.240]  is this coming back in a another form this civil asset forfeiture legislation I can promise it will come back and for me that the Senate choosing not to override the veto is most frustrating part of the process
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:30.240]  it passed the Senate with a vote of 26 to 3 and out of the 26 senators who voted for it originally after the governor vetoed it 20 of the 26 changed their vote and voted not to override his veto
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.240]  and that was what was really hard to take and hard to swallow
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:51.240]  Wow political pressure definitely being brought to bear there that reminds me what happened here in Texas with the bill to stop the TSA stay with us we're going to be right back with Representative Crocker from Wyoming we're talking about civil asset forfeiture efforts to reign that in at the state level we'll be right back

[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.500]  integrity restoration act, they call it fair.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.920]  Now, to look at the points of what they've come through with this, first of all,
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:48.840]  there's a profit motive.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.480]  Remember, the Wyoming governor said crime should not pay.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.400]  Well, crime does pay for the police departments that support their operations
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.480]  with what they confiscate for people.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.800]  It was Lysander Spooner who said the difference between the government and
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:06.120]  a highway robber is that a highway robber merely steals your money.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.320]  The government steals your money and
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.000]  then follows you down the road nagging you, okay?
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.360]  So that is not even a hyperbole anymore.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.960]  It is quite literally true.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.600]  They pull you over, they search you until they find some cash or
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.920]  something that they want.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.920]  And then they notify their buddies in another jurisdiction.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.880]  They pull them over and they take their $17,000 and
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.040]  their car and leave them standing on the side of the road.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.880]  Okay, that's highway robbery.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.560]  And that's how they fund their police departments in many cases.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:35.720]  So first thing the fair act would do would be to, and this is what,
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.160]  any legislation that's gonna pull this down at the state level needs to attack
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.960]  these individual points as well.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.800]  And it helps you understand really how bad this is,
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.080]  how far off the rails the American system has gone in fighting this futile war on
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.080]  drugs and I say it's futile because I'm talking to the people who think that
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.000]  that's going to stop our youth from abusing drugs, okay?
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.240]  That's not done that for 40 years.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.040]  It isn't going to do it.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.160]  It makes everything worse.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.680]  It doesn't affect drug use whatsoever.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.040]  It just destroys our legal system and corrupts the government.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.920]  So it is doing what it was designed to do and
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.880]  that is to make a lot of money for the government to provide a justification for
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.280]  virtually any kind of authoritarian police state they want to construct.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.800]  So the first thing you gotta do is remove the profit motive from them.
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:24.040]  The second thing you need to do is have a standard of proof.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.800]  Right now, the government just has to say, well,
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.840]  we've got a preponderance of evidence.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.680]  No, they would have to have a clear and
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.320]  convincing evidence that the property is even subject to forfeiture, number one.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.040]  Number two, you would be considered to be innocent until proven guilty.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:40.880]  What a novel idea.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.640]  I mean, we have had a lot of people die to establish these principles hundreds of
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.440]  years ago that we would be innocent until proven guilty,
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.080]  that we would have a trial by jury of our peers, we would have due process.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.040]  So that would restore that.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:55.720]  So you got profit motive, you got standard of proof,
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.880]  you got innocent owner defense and then structuring.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.480]  This is where they take your cash because they say that you
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.760]  deposited less than $10,000 so you could avoid filing a report.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:14.680]  Well, that was put in, ostensibly, to try to get to people who were laundering
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.280]  money for criminal actions.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.320]  But now they're taking money from people who are just business owners.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.800]  Who maybe were not even trying to avoid all the paperwork involved in
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.240]  depositing $10,000 for their restaurant.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.280]  They just go in and they confiscate that money.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.080]  And of course, the money was legitimate.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.240]  They can show that it was legitimate.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.040]  And they're not trying to launder money for a criminal operation.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.280]  So first of all, they would have to show that the owner knowingly sought to
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:47.360]  avoid bank reporting and that it was not derived from a criminal source.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.520]  The next thing is proportionality.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:55.120]  The idea, as supported in the Bill of Rights, directly expressly protected in
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.120]  the Bill of Rights, saying that when you were found guilty,
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.360]  you will not have excessive fines or punishments.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.840]  So it would be proportional to it.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.280]  Then also legal representation.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.680]  That's also in the Constitution.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:10.200]  We're ignoring that with the civil asset forfeiture.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.000]  Again, that's the idea is that they do it civilly.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.640]  They charge the property.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.840]  They do it as a civil, not as a criminal process.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.240]  And that's how they get around this.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.200]  And then finally, they would report what is actually happening because this
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.800]  stuff is going on and for the most part, it's not being reported.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.200]  And it's been going on for decades.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.480]  We need to understand that there have to be checks in place and
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.120]  we have to have a government that is going to respect the law.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.920]  But of course, it's not just confiscating your cash along the side of the road.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.120]  We actually have a banker, the chief economist for
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.960]  Citigroup, who is saying we need to ban cash all together.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.080]  Now, this is a guy, his name is Willem, I think it's Beuter.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.000]  Is that the way he pronounces his name?
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:58.920]  Beuler, Beuler?
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.320]  Anyway, it's B-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.760]  He's the same guy that last year told us that gold was in a 6,000-year-old bubble.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.320]  If it's lasted for 6,000 years, it's by definition not a bubble.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.040]  But nevertheless, he is the chief economist.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:20.400]  That's the brain trust there to say they've got gold in a 6,000-year bubble.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.720]  He doesn't believe that.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.000]  Greenspan doesn't believe that.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.040]  Greenspan said gold is real money.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.320]  He made that very clear.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.160]  He said that, I think it was at a CFR meeting, a Council on Foreign Relations meeting.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.680]  They first didn't put that up on their website.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.640]  They edited that out.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.920]  Somebody else that was there recorded it and put it up.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.040]  And then they said, well, that was just an oversight.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.760]  Yeah, right.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.960]  No, they actually did put that up.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.800]  And he actually did say that gold is real money.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.600]  It's the only thing that is real money.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.280]  Nevertheless, they will lie to you about it.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.800]  Because they don't want, this is part of the deception.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.440]  Now he's coming out and saying that we need to ban cash.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.160]  Now, here's the rationale for it.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.480]  They're saying that one of the ways that they can control the economy,
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.480]  that they can stimulate the economy, and this is Keynesian economics.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.760]  They can stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.480]  Well, they've played that card.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.080]  They don't have that anymore.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.080]  They've kept interest rates down at about 0% now for a long time.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.720]  And guess what?
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.640]  The economy is still flatlining by real measurements.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.000]  Of course, Obama will tell us that we're doing great.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.560]  And of course, the stock market is doing great.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.920]  They can pump money into the stock market, and they are doing that.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.680]  But in terms of other measurements, real measurements,
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.880]  in terms of the quality of jobs, the wages that people have in their disposable income,
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:36.400]  many, many, many real metric, it's not doing well.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.520]  So they're looking at other ways to stimulate it.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.320]  And of course, the very fact that they're looking at ways to stimulate the economy
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.320]  tells you that it's not doing well.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:45.880]  So he says, so we have to have something else.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.800]  We've got zero interest rates, that's still not doing it.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:49.960]  So we've got to go to negative interest rates.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.800]  We've got to force people to spend the money because if they save it,
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.080]  we're going to charge them a fee.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.400]  That's what negative interest rates are.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.840]  They're going to charge you a fee for the money that you actually save.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:04.120]  So it's not enough that we have a tax code that rewards you for borrowing money
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.840]  and punishes you for saving.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.280]  It's not enough that we have banks who now give you no interest at all.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.400]  Now they're going to charge you a negative interest rate to have your money in the bank.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.640]  But he goes, but the problem with that is if we charge people a negative interest rate,
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.360]  they're going to take the money out in cash.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.960]  So what do we do?
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.800]  What is a central bank to do?
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.240]  Well, he's got three proposals.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.160]  Number one, they can abolish currency.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.160]  Just abolish it, okay?
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.880]  That's one way that they can confiscate your money.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.280]  The other way is they can tax currency.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.000]  Third way is they can remove the fixed exchange rate between currency and central bank reserves and deposits.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.920]  Well, let's talk about that first one, abolishing currency.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.720]  Now he says, there's a couple of problems with abolishing currency.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:49:00.000]  And again, this is the chief economist for Citibank, very highly connected in the elite financial circles, Willem Buter.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.040]  He says, abolishing currency will constitute a noticeable change in many people's lives.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.240]  And change often tends to be resisted.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.080]  Yeah, that's why you see all of these drills about martial law.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.880]  They're very concerned about that.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:23.800]  They're very concerned about what happens when this fiction called the petrodollar that was created between Richard Nixon and Saudi Arabia back in the 1970s.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.960]  When that thing pops, that's the bubble.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.000]  It's not gold. Gold is not a 6,000-year-old bubble, the petrodollar.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.560]  Now that's the bubble.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.600]  That's a bubble that supports the entire American economy.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.520]  When that bubble bursts, you're going to have massive economic consequences.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.440]  And that's why they're training for martial law.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:49.080]  So, you know, that would be a downside of abolishing currency because that would kind of upset people.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.720]  Yeah, I think it would because they would understand what's behind that.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.280]  He says, currency use remains high among the poor and older people.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:04.640]  So he suggests to keep low denomination cash and circulation, nothing higher than a $5 bill, he says.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.680]  That might solve the problem.
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.560]  And so he goes through a whole bunch of different scenarios.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:13.600]  He's got about five of them here, but he dismisses each of these things in turn.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.960]  They say in the article, this is zero hedge.
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:24.000]  He says, in summary, we therefore conclude that the arguments against abolishing currency are rather weak.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:30.880]  In other words, in plain language, he's saying, we have a good case to abolish currency.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.480]  So all of these objections, they're actually pretty weak, but yeah, we got a good case to do it.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.120]  Now, of course, we've got Bloomberg and the same people who mocked us today about reporting
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.160]  about Bilderberg say, well, the chances of an administration taking the decision to abolish cash
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.840]  seem vanishingly small.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]  Oh, really?
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.360]  Really?
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.520]  You think so?
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:49.280]  Stay with us.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:49.960]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:51:13.320]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources, is it time to convert paper 401Ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:21.160]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our US politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.680]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.040]  Arm your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:29.240]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.840]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.320]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.960]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.880]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:43.680]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.600]  I know, right?
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.880]  You love it too!
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.360]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.400]  Let's go get some.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:53.200]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:58.720]  That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.400]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.480]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.280]  When you can use this?
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:12.240]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:19.440]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:25.440]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:29.160]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:33.840]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.600]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals and research institutions have all shown
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.320]  supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.600]  Supernatural silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.480]  I am Mark Hattie.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.600]  I will never be again.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:01.600]  Fly, fly, fly!
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.600]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:11.280]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:14.040]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.520]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:23.880]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:29.040]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.560]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.560]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:39.680]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.160]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:48.680]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.640]  essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:18.320]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.320]  We're going to be joined in the next hour with Leigh Ann McAdoo and of course she is one of the anchors here
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.320]  at the Infowars Nightly News.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.320]  It's something if you're not a subscriber to Prison Planet TV, please subscribe to that.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]  That supports our operation.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.320]  Of course, it gives you access to not only the nightly news each night as it happens,

[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:45.320]  It's now up to 20 people you can share that with at a time.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  That's one way to support our operation.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  Another way is with the products that you'll find at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.320]  That's at the InfowarsStore.com.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:17.320]  Water filters to make sure you've got clean water and have access to that if there is an emergency as well as an emergency food supply.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.320]  You never know what's going to happen. This is what we're talking about.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.320]  They got the city bank chief economist talking about how he wants to ban cash.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  And look at what's happening in Greece.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.320]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  The fact that the Greek government in order to satisfy the bankers is confiscating all government cash everywhere.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.320]  They're confiscating reserves from local governments.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.320]  They say the government, this is the opposition party talking.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:49.320]  They said the government's decision to seize our reserves not only raises legal and constitutional issues, but also moral ones.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.320]  Yeah, absolutely. They're taking it from the municipalities there.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:56:00.320]  They say no government before this has ever dared to touch the money from municipalities, from cities.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  But of course, we've seen this, interestingly enough, in Venezuela.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:11.320]  And this is a radical leftist party that is taking control of Greece as well.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  They thought that the leftists would stand up to the bankers.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:21.320]  And you would think, wouldn't you, that Hugo Chavez would have stood up to the bankers in Venezuela, but he didn't.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.320]  They bragged about how they got a 700% return on investment.
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:30.320]  How the people there had to go to another country to get their food, their water, their medicine.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.320]  That's why you need to prepare because you never know when that's going to happen here.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:42.320]  They think that these leftists in Venezuela, these leftists in Greece are going to stand up to the central bank.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  And yet they totally up to them even more so than the other guys.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.320]  That's what's happening here.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.320]  They're actually going in and taking the money away from municipalities.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:56.320]  And they're not going to be able to follow through with their commitments in order to satisfy the central bankers.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  That's one of the things we need to be very careful.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:06.320]  Looking at this Trans-Pacific Partnership, as I mentioned yesterday, the fact that they're now pushing the people in Europe,
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:16.320]  telling them that the only way they're going to solve these financial problems is for the individual nation states to give up sovereignty to become a United States of Europe.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.320]  Alan Greenspan has said it.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.320]  The head of the largest bond fund has said it.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:23.320]  But there is so much more in these trade agreements.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:31.320]  As I said earlier, we see corporations like Sony who want to be able to shut down your website if they merely allege a copyright violation.
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  Of course, there's a lot of that type of stuff in these trade agreements.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:43.320]  There's also stuff that would require countries to not would prohibit them from banning things like GMOs.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:49.320]  It would also force a lot of other multinational corporation products on people.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.320]  Isn't it interesting that that's their model for how they operate anymore?
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:59.320]  It used to be that the crony capitalism model was they would go to Congress and they would get legislation passed.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:06.320]  That would be a burden to the small competitors that would essentially cut off the bottom rungs of the ladder of competition.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:09.320]  They would keep people from starting up new businesses and competition to them.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.320]  They would also get direct subsidies by getting contracts.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:21.320]  But now what they do is they hold a gun to your head and they force you to buy their product just like they're trying to do with vaccines.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:26.320]  If they can force you to buy health insurance and define what kind of coverage you're going to have,
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:30.320]  they can force you to take medicine, inject that into your children.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.320]  They can force you to do anything.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:43.320]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:18.320]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:54.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:09.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:12.320]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:16.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:24.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:26.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:30.320]  We'll be joined in the next segment with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:37.320]  We're going to be talking about the current surgeon general who wants to inject infants at a much higher rate with vaccines.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:40.320]  And he's going to use Sesame Street characters to do it.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.320]  Yeah, how about that?
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.320]  That's what I was talking about.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:45.320]  That's what we see now.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:53.320]  We see not only is the government engaged in the kind of crony capitalism that we've seen going back even to before the Civil War.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.320]  Of course, that was one of the major issues of the Civil War.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:04.320]  And that was what they called internal improvements, the idea that you could tax one state and then build something in another state.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.320]  For example, tax Virginia and build the Erie Canal up in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  The people in Virginia didn't think much of that idea.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.320]  But of course, we've gotten completely used to that.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:22.320]  We don't even question whether or not the federal government should reward its friends in different places by punishing other people.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  We just accept that.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.320]  That's good for all of us, we're told, and we've been fed that line so long that we don't even think about that anymore.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  And of course, the corruption that we saw after the Civil War with the robber barons, the railroads,
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  they were already the corporate sponsors of Abraham Lincoln before he became president.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.320]  So we've seen that kind of crony capitalism for a long time.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.320]  The kind of crony capitalism that we saw with the bank bailouts.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:47.320]  But this is a different kind.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:54.320]  This is a kind of crony capitalism that holds a gun to your head and says, you're going to buy my insurance policy.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  And I'm going to define what it is.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.320]  I don't care if you're a single male, you're going to get a maternity policy.
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.320]  It's that kind of crony capitalism.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:08.320]  That's what's behind this removal of informed consent that people are fighting in all these different states,
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.320]  desperately fighting in California with SB 277.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:18.320]  They're playing all kinds of legislative games there, but it is not only a conflict of interest.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.320]  I mean, the state senator there, Dr. Pan, he's taking money from Big Pharma.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.320]  He's part of the AMA.
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.320]  They're forcing this on people taking away their informed consent.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  If you can do that to people, you effectively make them slaves.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:35.320]  And that's what we're seeing over and over again.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:36.320]  Look at this.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.320]  Look at what the automakers are doing.
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:44.320]  And this will kind of give you an idea of the way the large corporations are going to be forcing us to buy their products,
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.320]  whether or not we like it.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:50.320]  And they're going to be using these trade agreements that are being passed off as free trade.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.320]  This is a story that Kit Daniels put up over the weekend.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.320]  I wish, actually, I think it was right after the weekend.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:00.320]  There was an auto show that I went to this last weekend here in Austin.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.320]  And I really wish I had known about this.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.320]  I would have talked to the people that were there about it.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:09.320]  Automakers want to outlaw gearheads from working on their own cars.
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.320]  There you go.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:17.320]  That's the 21st century dream of the mega corporations that they own everything.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.320]  Even after you buy the car, they still own the car and you can't do anything to it.
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:25.320]  Now, this is an association of global automakers.
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:26.320]  That's the name of the association.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.320]  The Association of Global Automakers, AGA.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.320]  It's a lobbying firm for 12 manufacturers.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.320]  They're asking the U.S. Copyright Office to prevent car owners from accessing computer programs
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.320]  that control the functioning of a motorized land vehicle.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.320]  They say, hey, it's too complex for you to fix anyway,
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.320]  but we're going to stop it with copyright violations.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.320]  Copyright violations.
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.320]  They say, in order to modify the automotive software for the purpose of diagnosis and repair
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:57.320]  or for aftermarket personalization, modification,
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.320]  the modifier must use a substantial amount of copyrighted software
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.320]  that you have paid for.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.320]  You paid for that when you bought the car.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:08.320]  Copying the software is an issue after all.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.320]  Not wholly replacing it, they say, because of the heart.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.320]  It's not in the entirety.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  The copyrighted work will remain in the modified copy.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  So the amount and substantiality of the portion copied strongly indicates the proposed uses are not fair.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:26.320]  A lot of legal talk which basically says, you don't own your car that you paid for.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:27.320]  We own it.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  We're going to maintain ownership of it.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:34.320]  The Electronic Freedom Foundation said it's not a new thing to be able to repair and modify cars.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  It's actually a new thing to keep people from doing it.
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:41.320]  But that's the kind of corporate fascism that's what we've got to be concerned about
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:46.320]  with the trade agreements that are being negotiated and secret by these corporations.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.320]  We know exactly how they're going to use it,
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.320]  and we know why the mainstream media is not covering it.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320]  Stay with us.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.320]  We'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo talking about forced vaccinations.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:02.320]  A man who was viciously attacked last week by Baltimore cops,
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:07.320]  seemingly for no reason other than being in a high crime area.
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.320]  Well, he has lost his struggle for life in the hospital.
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:18.320]  Freddie Gray, only 25 years old, has become the latest victim in the epidemic of police murders of American citizens.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.320]  The aftermath of the attack was captured on video.
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:27.320]  You can see it right now at infowords.com, and it shows Gray getting picked up off the ground,
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  clearly with a broken leg as the officers dumped him in the back of a police van.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:37.320]  Gray was hospitalized and put in critical condition with a shattered vertebrae,
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.320]  a broken spine, a broken leg, and a crushed larynx.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:48.320]  Gray underwent emergency spinal surgery yesterday where he died and was pronounced dead at the hospital.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:54.320]  For more details on this story plus updates, be sure to check out infowords.com.

[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.320]  We've also launched the Alex Jones Challenge Pack.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.320]  The three info wars like products that help take me to the next level.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:44.320]  Oxy powder to flush out the upper and lower intestines.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:51.320]  Survival shield, nasoni and inax too, and super male vitality fused together have given me and many others amazing results.

[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:00.320]  I want more candy. I want everything again.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:07.320]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:10.320]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.320]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:17.320]  Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:23.320]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.320]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:42.320]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:49.320]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:14.320]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:19.320]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:24.320]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:29.320]  It's not about food, it's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:41.320]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:52.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, April 21st, 2015.
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:53.320]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:56.320]  Joining me in the studio right now is Leanne McAdoo.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:01.320]  And she's here to talk about our new surgeon general, who is...
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:10.320]  We began the program, Leanne, by talking about how Bloomberg was attacking us for exposing Bilderberg.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.320]  Oh, your conspiracy theorist, right?
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:22.320]  But of course, what they do is not only not report that, but they advocate injecting infants and using Sesame Street characters to do it.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  It's an amazing story by Jeffrey Jackson. You're going to have an interview with him this week, talking to him about the different aspects of this.
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.320]  Tell us about it.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:33.320]  Yeah, well, he does some really great work over there on the website.
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:40.320]  And this one kind of came across my desk, and it was just so creepy, just so creepy, the video in general.
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:47.320]  But it was there to kick off National Infant Immunization Week, and so they're targeting everyone there with us.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.320]  Okay, hang on a second. They lost your audio, so they're just picking it up on my mic right here.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  Yeah, it was something that he pointed out. There's not only is there a conflict of interest in this, but it is something that...
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  This is what we really have to be concerned about, because we know how the regulatory agencies have been captured.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.320]  We know how our congressmen have been captured.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:17.320]  It was just last week that they said, we're going to let corporate lobbyists write massive trade agreements with Europe and Asia that the public can't see,
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:22.320]  that we're not going to have any input into it, and it's going to be put up and it's going to be a total up or down vote.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  There's not going to be any amendments. So they're abdicating their responsibility to these corporate lobbyists.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:37.320]  And now we've got the Surgeon General out here with Sesame Street characters basically selling big pharma products.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  Yeah, exactly. They're targeting your children.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  And we already know that they target adults with their behavior placement and everything, and they advertise directly to adults.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:56.320]  But that's against the law to advertise to children, especially when you're not providing a fair and balanced, letting them know what the troubles could be with getting a vaccination.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:03.320]  So I guess they're kind of skirting around that law by not specifically saying, oh, get a measles vaccine or get the flu vaccine.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:15.320]  They're just telling them about vaccines in general. And the way he goes about explaining to Elmo is that the only way that his body can be protected from germs is by getting a vaccine.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:25.320]  That's the only way. Yeah, because they're going to stop doing all the other medicines because it's so much more profitable for them to sell vaccines because they have absolutely no liability if it hurts anybody.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:33.320]  If they harm you with an antibiotic, they've got legal exposure. But not in the U.S. if they harm you with a vaccine, they have protection.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:44.320]  So we've got the Surgeon General selling their products. We've got state legislators all over the country trying to remove informed consent, renaming it a personal belief exemption.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.320]  Right.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:12:02.320]  They're trying to mandate that you, I mean, that in and of itself, apart from the fact that they're doing this on a product for which they have assumed the liability for all these pharmaceutical products, that right there should cause people to stop and ask what's going on.
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:12.320]  We should never have our right to informed consent taken from us. You know that they're lying to you when they do that. You know they're lying to you when they give legal immunity to these corporations.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:22.320]  And the Surgeon General didn't point out to Elmo that, well, you know, GlaxoSmithKline just paid out $63 million to vaccine damaged children in the UK.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:32.320]  They didn't point out that the U.S. has has paid out about $9 billion to vaccine injured. And, you know, so he doesn't really point out, point that out to Elmo.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:41.320]  He just sells it as this great thing. So let's go ahead and take a look. We'll kind of get to the middle of the clip there to the meat of it all where he's selling the idea.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:48.320]  Just like an umbrella protects you from the rain and a helmet protects you from hitting your head, a vaccine protects you from germs.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.320]  What's a germ?
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:54.320]  Germs are tiny microscopic creatures that can get into your body and make you very, very sick.
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:13:02.320]  Oh, no. Elmo doesn't like being sick because Elmo feels bad when Elmo can't play outside but Elmo screams.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.320]  Well, the good news is your body can protect you from these bad germs.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  Oh, good. Okay. So Elmo doesn't need a vaccination. Fine.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  Well, not exactly. In order for your body to fight those germs, it needs information.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.320]  Elmo has information on his computer. Elmo will go get it.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:23.320]  Oh, wait, Elmo. That's not what I mean. A vaccine has information about germs to help your body make antibodies to fight them.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.320]  Antibodies? What's that?
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  Antibodies are like superheroes. They can spot the germs a mile away and kick them out before they ever make these things.
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:40.320]  Why do we even need a surgeon general? I'm looking at this guy and it's like, what a useless, you know, why would he even be there?
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.320]  I mean, what does a surgeon general do? I mean, it is just, what is it, just propagandizes?
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:52.320]  Yeah, he goes in and he sells it right to the experts there, the children, the people who really need to know how all of this works.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:14:03.320]  And also, he doesn't point out that if you read the package insert, like we always say, it doesn't say the safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established,
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:11.320]  has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for the impairment of fertility, hasn't been established,
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:14.320]  measles vaccine in infants below six months or 12 months.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  Why would they bother? They don't have any legal immunity. I mean, they don't have any legal exposure.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:25.320]  They've got immunity from the government through this vaccine court. So why would they even bother to see if it's safe, let alone effective?
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:33.320]  Hey, guys, there's this article that came up on NPR. See if you can pull this up. FDA ponders putting homeopathy to a tougher test.
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:40.320]  I think this says a lot if you just get a screenshot of this headline here at the very top of this particular page.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:46.320]  This is where NPR puts their medical news and it doesn't show up on my paper printout of this, but it's called shots.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  There you can see it on the screen. People were looking at it as a hypodermic needle and it's called shots.
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.320]  And that's what they call their medical reporting at NPR.
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  Now, if that doesn't tell you what the agenda is, it's all, I mean, all medicine now is vaccinations. It's all shots.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  Okay. And the other part of that is that headline where now the FDA regulatory capture again, they've been regulatory captured by the pharmaceutical companies,
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:19.320]  the AMA, they're now going to go after the homeopaths. Okay. They're going after everybody that is their competition.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:27.320]  That's the way this has always worked. It's always worked by using the government to attack your competition to keep your competition out of business or to shut them down.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:33.320]  But now the other model is to force you to buy their product. That's what's really behind all of this.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  Right. And that's what it doesn't point out is that vaccines are a private company's medical product.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:47.320]  And that's what this is. And they've got these patents on it, you know, so they can protect their product and patent all their genetically modified plants and everything like that.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:53.320]  So it's not just for the safety and effectiveness. It's for more money in their big Pharma's pockets.
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:16:05.320]  But this is just a, you know, a larger or a small part of a larger problem, which is this whole behavior placement that they're putting in television shows, all sorts of television.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  And of course, they don't really understand the power of advertising and how they're being targeted.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:16.320]  But adults now with the invention of Tivo and things like that, people are skipping past their commercials.
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:22.320]  So now they're having to find a way to get their message across to people within the programs.
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.320]  And so it's not just that the character will drink a soda or something like that.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:40.320]  It's actually behavior placement and NBC Universal, for instance, will plant eco-friendly themes into a scripted television shows so that they can start pushing that green agenda.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:44.320]  And viewers won't even realize it because it's their favorite character.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.320]  Which is what Sony did with that stupid comedy, the interview, okay?
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:55.320]  Instead of having a product placement of showing a Coke can sitting there subtly, you know, subliminal and subtle.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:02.320]  Instead, what they do is they have this very explicit thing where they kill Kim Jong-un, okay?
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  And they coordinated with it, we see from the emails, they coordinated that with the State Department, with the RAND Corporation,
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.320]  talking about how they were going to do that, very consciously doing that.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.320]  So they put that propaganda in there.
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  They removed the prohibitions of having Radio Free Europe and, let's see, organization that ran that.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.320]  Voice of Liberty?
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:21.320]  Voice of America.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:26.320]  Voice of America, they removed the prohibitions of them propagandizing us in America.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  So they're going to be explicitly propagandizing us.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.320]  That's exactly what this was when we see the Surgeon General.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  It was just very blatant because it's at a Sesame Street level.
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  It's propaganda at a Sesame Street level.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  So it's not as subtle as when they put it in a comedy film, you know, so that you will all think about, hey, yeah, we got to get rid of that guy.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:47.320]  And the only way we're going to do it is to kill him.
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  That was exactly what they were conspiring to do.
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  And that's the danger of it because no one can argue with, oh, what's the problem if someone, if a TV character throws their plastic bottle in the recycle bin?
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.320]  That's a great message for people to have.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:02.320]  And of course, nothing wrong with that.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.320]  But then where are they going to go with that?
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  And just like you say, they're kind of that small drip of like, well, we need to assassinate Kim Jong-un.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:17.320]  Or for instance, in Common Core, students are being targeted with genetically engineered crops.
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.320]  And they're not being offered any alternative science.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:25.320]  They're just being slowly incorporated into their schooling of like, here's what a genetically engineered crop does.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  And it's really great for you and less bugs.
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:29.320]  And, you know, there's no alternative.
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.320]  They're going to be able to feed the world with soil and grain.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  Exactly.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:39.320]  And that's another aspect of this trade agreement that's being constructed in secret by corporate lobbyists is the GMO aspect.
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  They're saying, oh, this is really going to benefit American agriculture.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  Well, it's going to benefit the American agriculture that sells people franken foods that have been outlawed in other parts of the world.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.320]  And they're going to cram it down their throats with this so-called trade agreement.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  That's the whole purpose.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.320]  That's what's really behind this.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  Yeah.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:07.320]  It's just, I mean, I know that our audience is really savvy and quite aware that they're constantly being targeted and propagandized to through television and the media and everything.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:11.320]  But it's just, it's really sad when they're explicitly now going after children.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  And I don't know if we have enough time to show the part where the surgeon general and talks to Elmo at the end.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.320]  But just the look that they give the camera.
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  We'll do that when we come back.
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:24.320]  It's about 60 seconds and we're coming up pretty close to a break here.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.320]  But it's about 16 seconds, she said.
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.320]  Okay.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.320]  Yeah, go ahead and play it.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:31.320]  Go ahead and play it before we go after break.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  Yeah.
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  It's done, Elmo.
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.320]  We have.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.320]  All right.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:38.320]  Thank you.
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:39.320]  That was so easy.
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:42.320]  Why doesn't everybody get a vaccination?
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  That's a good question, Elmo.
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  Maybe we should force them, Elmo.
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  See, and they just do the stare and it's like the dead stare at you parents that are not vaccinated.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:52.320]  It's so easy.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:53.320]  It's so easy.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:55.320]  Yeah, that little puppet.
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  Oh, they're both puppets.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.320]  That's right.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:59.320]  We're going to be right back with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:28.320]  Stay with us.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.320]  Thanks, Hillary Clinton's running for president.
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:36.320]  My buddy Mark says to me, hey, didn't Hillary support the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban?
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.320]  And I'm thinking, yeah, 1992 presidential campaign.
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.320]  Oh my God.
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:42.320]  A gun grabber in the White House.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:46.320]  So at guns80.com, they've come up with the Hillary Clinton special.
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:47.320]  They just call it the Hillary.

[02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.320]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:05.320]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:11.320]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:16.320]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:17.320]  The phone line.
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:22.320]  You shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long term contract and think you're safe.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:26.320]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:29.320]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:26.320]  One of them is Elmo from Sesame Street.
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:29.320]  The other puppet is the Surgeon General.
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.320]  And we know whose hand is up that puppet.
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.320]  It's the big pharmaceutical companies.
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:40.320]  Before we continue, I just want to let you know that we have a sale on Infowars Life Silver Bullet.

[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  Now is a good time to stock up for 2015, while it's in stock.
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:01.320]  Again, 50% off Silver Bullet at infowarslife.com.
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:03.320]  Saved you $15 per bottle.
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:07.320]  Now Leanne, as we're looking at this and other food news,
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:11.320]  looking at this other article from Jeffrey Jackson about booming organics,
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:17.320]  US farmers are forced to import organic crops to meet non-GMO demand.
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.320]  I mean, people have gotten the information.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  That along with the fact that Kraft is removing synthetic colors from iconic macaroni and cheese.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  That's another article that's up on infowarslife.com.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:30.320]  That's something that Food Babe has been fighting for quite some time.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:32.320]  So people are getting the message.
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:35.320]  They understand they don't want a lot of pesticides in their food.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.320]  They don't want genetically modified food.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:41.320]  People have a right to make these decisions.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:46.320]  But then again, on the other hand, you've got the surgeon general shaming parents
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:53.320]  into getting their kids vaccinated with a product for which the pharmaceutical companies have no liability.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:55.320]  That's been removed from them by the federal government.
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:26:00.320]  And NPR reports the FDA is looking at putting homeopathy to a tougher test.
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  In other words, they want to crack down on it.
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.320]  We can't make up our own minds.
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.320]  Okay, we can't have the freedom to choose whether or not we want to use a homeopath
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.320]  or to choose whether or not we want a vaccine or not.
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:15.320]  They're going to force that on us because they own the FDA.
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  They own the federal government and they own this trade process.
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:21.320]  That's where they're going to force genetically modified foods on us.
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:22.320]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:26.320]  And they know that those organic foods are so much more nutrient dense.
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:29.320]  They're so much more beneficial to our bodies.
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:34.320]  They've known for a long time that the food coloring in Kraft mac and cheese and other kind of products
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:37.320]  are exacerbating ADD symptoms in children.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:40.320]  But they continue to say, oh, no, it's safe and effective.
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:43.320]  But we're going to go ahead and take it out just because you guys really want us to.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.320]  No.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:47.320]  When you think about what they do to our food and what we drink,
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.320]  look at the situation with Pepsi and Coke.
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.320]  Okay, Pepsi refused to take out this food coloring that was there.
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:55.320]  That's been banned in a lot of countries because they believe it's a carcinogen.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.320]  Okay, but they refuse to take it out here in America.
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:02.320]  Even after they pointed out a Coke, took it out, but Pepsi's like, I don't care.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:03.320]  We're going to leave it in.
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:04.320]  Yeah.
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:05.320]  Why?
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.320]  I mean, it's brown.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.320]  Who cares?
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.320]  Right.
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.320]  You know, and who cares if you've got bright orange glowing Kraft macaroni and cheese?
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:14.320]  I mean, why do we have to have this?
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:17.320]  Do they think that gives them some kind of a competitive advantage?
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:19.320]  I mean, I know that they stick preservatives in their food.
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.320]  They stick it in the vaccines because it gives them a little bit longer shelf life
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  and they can make a few more pennies and everything comes down to dollars and cents for them.
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.320]  But I don't understand this about the food coloring.
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.320]  Why they have to make people sick?
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:37.320]  It makes you kind of think there might be some kind of a population control agenda behind that.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  Yeah.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:46.320]  And they're just so afraid of people understanding how beneficial homeopathic medicine is for people.
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:50.320]  I mean, they don't want you to understand that you can just go out into the wilderness
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  and pick dandelions, you know, if you're having stomach problems or something like that.
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  I mean, the earth is perfect.
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  God created everything for us to use and they don't want us to have that power for ourselves.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.320]  Well, that's what David Simpson said about his legislation to remove marijuana from the Texas Legal Code.
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:08.320]  Just remove it completely.
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:09.320]  We're not going to regulate it.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:11.320]  We're just going to remove it because God created it.
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:12.320]  Right.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.320]  And so the government needs to fix it.
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.320]  And there's a difference between use and abuse.
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:17.320]  There's a difference between use and abuse.
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  And what the government is doing is they're abusing their power.
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.320]  And that concerns me more than an individual who is abusing something.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.320]  You can take anything and you can abuse it.
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.320]  I mean, they used to, it was nutmeg.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:33.320]  People used to get high on nutmeg back at the time of, I think it was Abraham Lincoln.
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:34.320]  I don't know.
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  Somebody called one of the presidents when he was running, they called him a nutmeg head
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.320]  or something, you know, said he abused nutmeg.
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:41.320]  You can take anything and abuse it.
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.320]  Right.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.320]  We should not allow the government to ban it.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:47.320]  And quite frankly, the government doesn't have, as I pointed out many times,
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:49.320]  they don't have the constitutional authority to do it.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  And the evidence of that is the fact that we've got two amendments to ban alcohol.
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.320]  I think it was the 18th and the 21st, if I remember correctly.
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:59.320]  Why would you need an amendment to ban alcohol, but you can ban anything else that you want?
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.320]  And that includes things for medicinal use.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  It's not just recreational drugs.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:07.320]  And it's also, that's the thing that concerns me most about marijuana,
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:10.320]  is the fact that they would ban it for medicinal use.
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:12.320]  And that's what David Simpson was concerned about.
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:16.320]  He knows that there are constituents in his district that the only way they were able to get help
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.320]  was with medical marijuana.
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:19.320]  Right.
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:20.320]  So why would we take that from people?
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  Exactly. And why would you ban something that, for thousands of years,
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:26.320]  has been proven to have these medicinal qualities?
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:32.320]  Yet you won't ban food coloring that is banned in other countries as a possible carcinogen.
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:33.320]  Exactly.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:36.320]  Well, is crony capitalism with a gun to your head?
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.320]  That's where we are right now.
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:41.320]  It's not just using government, but it's actually using government to put a gun to your head
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:43.320]  to force you to buy their products.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:46.320]  Thanks for joining us, Leanne, and we'll look forward to that interview.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:51.320]  Stay with us.
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:22.320]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:23.320]  and not the state.
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:27.320]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:31.320]  It's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:36.320]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:40.320]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:43.320]  And not because they had any interest in women's rights,
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:47.320]  but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:52.320]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age,
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:55.320]  and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:24.320]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:33.320]  I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:38.320]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:44.320]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfowarsLife.com,
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.320]  the results were incredible.

[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:30.320]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.320]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.320]  They're never going to stop.
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.320]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.320]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:26.320]  I'm going to take your phone calls if you want to call in and talk about the subjects we've covered today.
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:29.320]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:33.320]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.320]  Now in the last segment with Leanne, we were touched on the different ways
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:42.320]  that corporations are using the government to force you to buy their product
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:46.320]  to prevent you from making decisions about your health, about your family's health,
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:51.320]  removing your informed consent, saying that they're going to come after homeopathy,
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:55.320]  saying that they're going to, well, as Marco Rubio wants to do and Chris Christie,
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:59.320]  they're going to come after even those states where they've allowed medical marijuana.
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:02.320]  Marco Rubio went on with Hugh Hewitt.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:08.320]  I guess that's where the Republican candidates go on to brag about how they're going to create war,
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:11.320]  step up the police state.
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.320]  That seems to be the place where they roll those things out.
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.320]  And so he's talking to Hugh Hewitt.
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.320]  And he says, well, a lot of, Hugh Hewitt says,
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:21.320]  a lot of people are criticizing the president for not enforcing immigration laws,
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:23.320]  but he's also not enforcing drug laws.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:24.320]  What do we do?
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:25.320]  And Rubio says, yes, yes.
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.320]  Yes, well, I think, I think, well, I think we need to enforce our federal laws.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.320]  Yeah, let's start with the Constitution.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:37.320]  Let's start with the fact that you don't get to just prohibit whatever you want to.
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:39.320]  You don't have that power.
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.320]  Everyone recognized when they did the 18th Amendment,
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.320]  they realized that the government did not have the power to ban alcohol.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:51.320]  But Rubio says, now states do have a right to do what they want.
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:53.320]  They don't agree with it, but they have their rights.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:54.320]  They do.
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:55.320]  States have rights.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.320]  Well, actually, individuals have rights.
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.320]  States do have some jurisdictional authority under the 10th Amendment,
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:04.320]  and that's why this is legal as well.
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:06.320]  They're exercising a constitutional right.
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:10.320]  The federal government is usurping a right that they don't have in terms of banning it.
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:14.320]  He says, but they don't have the right to write a federal policy as well.
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:18.320]  See, the federal government in Rubio's mind is above the states.
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:19.320]  It's above the individual.
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:21.320]  It's not a servant of the states.
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.320]  It's not a co-power share of the states.
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:27.320]  It's not a servant of the people.
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:28.320]  It's over the people.
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:32.320]  He says, they shouldn't be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants.
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:33.320]  You hear that?
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:37.320]  Additional intoxicants, because we've already got alcohol legalized, right?
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:41.320]  Because he says, for the primary reason, when you legalize something,
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:43.320]  you're sending a message to young people it can't be that bad.
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.320]  Because it was that bad, it wouldn't be legal.
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:53.320]  So I guess because we have legal alcohol, it's okay for young people to have alcohol in this country, isn't it?
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:54.320]  No.
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.320]  That's not the way it is.
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.320]  We do have a lot of people when, every year, when college begins,
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:06.320]  you'll see articles about some new co-ed that drinks themselves to death.
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:10.320]  Some guy or girl at a college, they go to a party and first time they've been away from home.
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:12.320]  So they drink so much alcohol, they die.
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:13.320]  They overdose on it.
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:15.320]  You don't see that happening with pot.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:18.320]  We need to understand there's a difference between abuse and use.
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:21.320]  We need to understand there's a difference between vice and crime.
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:26.320]  Lysander Spooner pointed that out. He said, you know, crime is something you do that harms other people.
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.320]  Vice is something you do that harms yourself.
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.320]  Government cannot stop vice.
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:36.320]  If it tries to stop vice, it only corrupts itself.
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.320]  It can never stop it.
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:42.320]  And we've seen for 40 years this argument that you're going to send the message that this stuff is okay.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:44.320]  We're not sending the message it's okay.
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:49.320]  What we're saying is, is that, you know, this whole gateway argument that it's a gateway drug,
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:53.320]  this whole reefer madness nonsense that's being sold to us by people like Rubio.
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:58.320]  What we're saying is, is that the war on drugs is a gateway to tyranny.
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:02.320]  Medical marijuana is not a gateway to harder drugs.
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.320]  But this is, and we have seen how it has been with the SWAT teams, with the suspension of due process.
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:10.320]  But of course, Chris Christie now is kind of sitting on the fence.
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:15.320]  He kind of moderated this a little bit when he was confronted by a New Jersey marijuana activist.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:20.320]  Again, yesterday was 420. So that's the day that I guess the New Jersey weed man came out.
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:23.320]  I've actually interviewed Ed Portion, the New Jersey weed man.
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:25.320]  It was a very interesting interview.
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.320]  I interviewed him not so much because of the marijuana issue,
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.320]  but because of the effective way that he used jury nullification.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:39.320]  See, we need to nullify the federal government's abuses and overreaches of power by attacking them from the outside.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:45.320]  And jury nullification is the way that you can stop federal abuse of power and the way that you can stop state abuse of power.
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.320]  And what the New Jersey weed man did was he had one trial.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:55.320]  He pulled up the New Jersey law that said that a jury has the right to judge not only the facts of the case,
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:00.320]  but whether or not it's a just law and whether or not the way that it's being applied is just.
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:05.320]  And so he pulled up the state constitution and the judge told him, he said, take that down.
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.320]  If you put that up again, I'm going to throw you in jail for contempt, but they had already seen it.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:14.320]  And he knew. See, he couldn't get a lawyer to represent him, so he represented himself.
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:23.320]  He knew that at least half of the people, he said 60% of the people did not agree with the drug laws for marijuana,
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:25.320]  particularly was what he was there for.
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.320]  So he figured that they would, he would get at least one person out of the 12.
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:34.320]  That's what I call the 8% solution. That's the way we need to shut this thing down.
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:39.320]  But anyway, he did get a hung jury. It was seven voted for acquittal, but they came after him a second time.
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:45.320]  And the second time he went to a judge that allowed him to leave that up and show the jurors that, yes,
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:52.320]  according to New Jersey law, see, the first judge didn't want the jury to even know what New Jersey's law was about jurors.
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:58.320]  He didn't want the jurors to know what their duty was, not only what their right as jurors was, but what their duty was.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.320]  So when he was allowed to leave that up, they acquitted him 12 to nothing and they couldn't come after him again,
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:06.320]  even though the amount that he had was about a pound.
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.320]  I mean, I think it's a really large amount.
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:16.320]  Anyway, so he pulls up and he kind of, he uses a bullhorn on Christie as Christie's walking out of his house
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:20.320]  and asking him if he's going to veto legislation to decriminalize marijuana.
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:23.320]  And Christie, you know, why are you still locking people up and he goes,
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.320]  well, I'm not throwing people in jail anymore.
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:31.320]  So I don't know, Christie has also said with Rubio that he wants to ignore what the voters in the states have said.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:36.320]  He wants to ignore what the state legislatures have said and he wants to reinforce prohibition.
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:39.320]  So we'll see whether or not that happens or not.
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:45.320]  Just a couple more things and I'm going to go to your calls, Truth Raider in Oregon will be the first one coming up.
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:52.320]  In terms of these political figures, I do want to talk about the attacks that are coming on Rand Paul from Lindsey Graham and John McCain.
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:53.320]  I think it's interesting.
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:40:00.320]  I criticized Rand Paul yesterday and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for signing onto this fast track of these trade agreements.
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.320]  I don't think that they're free trade agreements.
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:08.320]  They're crony capitalists managed to trade agreements being negotiated as we said in secret by corporate lobbyists.
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:15.320]  So I think that was a big mistake, but it is good that Rand Paul is bringing up things that other people are not talking about.
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:24.320]  Substantive issues that are typically not even a part of the debate and putting them up in a very thoughtful way for the American people to think about it.
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:28.320]  I really want to see him in the process because he really has brought this stuff up.
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:35.320]  But of course, he's getting attacked by John McCain and by McCain's puppet Lindsey Graham.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:39.320]  And this is what Rand Paul had to say to their comments.
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:43.320]  Let's play that clip that he had on Fox News.
[02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:45.320]  Lindsey Graham said this about your worldview.
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:48.320]  Generally speaking, you have done more wrong than right.
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.320]  John McCain says you don't understand.
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.320]  You display this kind of naivete since you came to the Senate.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.320]  What's going on there?
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.320]  This comes from a group of people who have been wrong about every foreign policy issue over the last two decades.
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:06.320]  I'll give you a couple of examples where they support the president's foreign policy and I don't.
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:09.320]  They supported Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:13.320]  They supported President Obama's bombing of Assad.
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:17.320]  They also support President Obama's foreign aid to countries that hate us.
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:22.320]  So if there's anyone who is the most opposed to President Obama's foreign policy, it's me.
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:28.320]  And these people who call loudest to criticize me are great proponents of President Obama's foreign policy.
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:30.320]  They just want to do it ten times over.
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:34.320]  But I'm the only one actually standing up and saying the war in Libya was a mistake.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:37.320]  The bombing of Assad would make ISIS stronger.
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:40.320]  The arms to the Islamic rebels would make ISIS stronger.
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:43.320]  So I'm really the one standing up to President Obama.
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:46.320]  And these people are essentially the lap dogs for President Obama.
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.320]  And I think they're sensitive about that.
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:53.320]  Yeah, I think it was interesting when Marco Rubio came out and he was kind of angling for Hillary Clinton
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.320]  and saying that he was the guy who was the new young guy.
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:03.320]  So, you know, Hillary Clinton is going to be your female choice if you want a New World Order puppet.
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:08.320]  And Marco Rubio is putting himself out as the young choice if you want a New World Order puppet.
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:13.320]  But, you know, really he may be young, but his ideas have been failed,
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:18.320]  and they are failed ideas that have been tried for decades unsuccessfully.
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:23.320]  And that's the point that Rand Paul was making is that the same foreign policy that we see from Obama,
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.320]  the same foreign policy you're going to get from Hillary Clinton, except you may get more of it.
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:31.320]  You know, they may instead of, you know, trying to get into six countries, maybe they'll start wars with ten countries.
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:33.320]  Maybe they'll start a war with Russia. I don't know.
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:35.320]  These guys are truly dangerous.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:41.320]  John McCain, Lindsey Graham is absolutely amazing that anybody would even pay attention to these guys.
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:45.320]  I believe that they can get reelected. It's just amazing to me.
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.320]  As Paul said, why did we ever go to Libya in the first place?
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:56.320]  Every time we've toppled a secular dictator, a secular strongman, we've gotten chaos and the rise of radical Islam.
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:02.320]  The other thing he had to say was he said it's time for the GOP to defend the whole Bill of Rights.
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:06.320]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Defend the whole Bill of Rights.
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:10.320]  And that's why it's important for Rand Paul to be there, I believe.
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:17.320]  Like I've said many times, I don't think that we're going to fix the situation in Washington by sending a Mr. Smith there to straighten everything out.
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:23.320]  But I think it's important that we have somebody who's going to bring up these issues so they can be talked about at a national level.
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:32.320]  And of course, he also talked about the fact that Jessica Lynch, who is the nominee by Obama for replacing Eric Holder, is all about civil asset forfeiture.
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.320]  And we spent a lot of time talking about that last hour, so I'm not going to go back into that again.
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:41.320]  But again, we need to look at the entire Bill of Rights. I want to go to your calls right now.
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:45.320]  Let's go to Truth Raider in Oregon. Truth Raider, go ahead.
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:47.320]  Hi, David. How are you today?
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:48.320]  I'm good.
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:55.320]  Well, this is my take on Jane Hill. I think what's going on, and I hope I'm right about this.
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:08.320]  My gut tells me that this is an exercise and a practice against the radical movement from the south from Mexico trying to regain their claim to the seven southern states as Aztlan.
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:22.320]  And I think, yeah, there's many other factors that are involved, but my gut feeling is that the troops are going there and doing this drill in order to try to squelch this potential civil war situation.
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:25.320]  That's the best way I can describe it.
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.320]  Well, I don't know. I think I haven't heard anybody in the government express any concern about the Aztlan movement.
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:39.320]  As a matter of fact, I've seen a lot of people cozy up to La Raza, which really means the race. They're the ones who are really pushing that.
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:46.320]  And I've heard officials like Nancy Pelosi say we don't have, we just have two communities.
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:52.320]  It just happens to have a border running through it, but it doesn't really matter. I mean, it's kind of like the border that runs between Texas and Oklahoma, right?
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:54.320]  It's not anything, it's not any issue to them.
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:45:02.320]  I think that just as Petraeus said, and as I mentioned yesterday, they no longer see America as America. They just see North America.
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:09.320]  They think that we've been consolidated in their mind. It's not just a trade agreement. It is a sovereignty agreement.
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:24.320]  I think they see the three countries together. We already see them handing over the right of imminent domain to a Canadian corporation to be used in the Keystone pipeline against American farmers who've had their farm for 100 years.
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:28.320]  That's what they see. They see corporate governance. They see a loss of sovereignty.
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:37.320]  I don't think they're concerned about people coming across the border. They may try to sell it to us as this is ISIS coming across the border and we need to be protected against that.
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:45.320]  Maybe that's the way they're going to try to sell MRAPs to people, but right now they're using the war on drugs or using the war on terrorism.
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:56.320]  They may try to sell ISIS, but I haven't heard anybody speak about the people coming across as being a threat and that we need to stop a civil war to reestablish Aslan.
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:01.320]  So I don't know. Thanks, Truth Raider. Let's go to Blake in Nebraska. Blake, go ahead.
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:16.320]  Hey, David, I just wanted to address the whole weed thing. I'm a 19-year-old kid, so I can really offer a perspective around young people who are for marijuana legalization.
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:31.320]  I was working out at the rec center at my college the other day and I saw on CNN the stuff about what's a new revolution, weed. Here's the problem with the liberals wanting marijuana. It's all about the weed itself.
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:48.320]  These liberals don't understand is that the legalization of weed should be really about the freedom to do as you please. I like to refer back to John Stuart Mill's harm principle, a man connected as they want as long as they don't harm anyone else.
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:47:01.320]  The problem with these liberals, they think, you know, you legalize weed. Oh, that's it. We can let the government do whatever they want as long as we get their weed. I call these liberals sort of half right.
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:13.320]  But when you think about it, they're not really right at all. But I will say this, a good way to wake up young people and liberals is to just basically ask them, hey, you ever tried freedom and liberty?
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:21.320]  I think it's a really good way to wake people up the way I've seen, you know, being young and as I am.
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:30.320]  Well, you know, the thing is, is that, you know, Marx said that religion was the opiate of the masses. So he tried to ban religion.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:39.320]  I mean, we could try to ban television or we could try to ban movies or video games because that basically people will just do that and drop out of society.
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:49.320]  And of course, that is going to be a major thing. That's going to be the next thing coming. Video games are going to be so engaging with virtual reality that they will be like a drug.
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:57.320]  People will just drop out of society. They'll just hook up to the matrix and, you know, maybe they'll just use their body heat to run the power grid. I don't know.
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:03.320]  But the bottom line is, is that you can make that argument about anything just because you're going to have people who abuse it, just because you have people who are going to drop out about it.
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:14.320]  What I've always been concerned about as a non-user of marijuana and I always, I don't, that's my personal choice. I encourage my children not to use that, not to use alcohol.
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:21.320]  I want to have the option if certain things were to happen. I would want to have the option to try marijuana as a medical treatment.
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.320]  I don't think any medical treatment should be off base to anybody for any reason whatsoever.
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:35.320]  I don't agree with forcing medical treatment on people and I don't agree with withholding medical treatment from people by force.
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:40.320]  So that's one of my issues with it. The other issue is we can see and there's not even speculation now.
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:48.320]  We can see how this has corrupted our legal system, how it has militarized our police, how it was the basis for the surveillance state.
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:49:01.320]  We now learn that for decades before 9-11, for decades before the NSA started using their Section 215, I think it is, to spy on people out of the Patriot Act, that they were doing this with the war on drugs.
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.320]  So this has been a horrific destruction of our country, locking people up, destroying people.
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:12.320]  We have the most number of people per capita in prison and it is primarily for marijuana.
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:23.320]  So I've talked many times to law enforcement against prohibition, former prosecutors, judges, police officers, some of them still in that capacity who say they started out as drug warriors.
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:30.320]  They realized that the right way to discourage people is not using the hammer of law enforcement.
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:35.320]  This is really a psychological problem, a medical problem, a spiritual problem.
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:42.320]  That's the way it needs to be handled and it's really sad that in this country, our response to everything is there ought to be a law.
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:51.320]  And we need the federal government to step in here and do something. Every time there's a problem, that's the way we want to tackle it, is with the federal government, with the federal law.
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:56.320]  That just doesn't solve most problems and we see that that hasn't really solved that either.
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  Thanks. Let's go to John in Minnesota. John, you want to talk about Jeb Bush and Bilderberg?
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:11.320]  Yeah, I want to say something first though to you because I've been listening for weeks and haven't been able to get through.
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:24.320]  And that you guys engage as well as the mainstream idiots with propaganda words like lawmaker, authorities, patriot.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:32.320]  I'm sick of the word patriot, man. The Patriot Act that was all of false BS and you guys still say patriot.
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:38.320]  I mean, it's confusing. What's a patriot? A person who steals your identity, watches you all the time?
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:42.320]  Well, hang on. We've got to go to a break. I want to come back to you.
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:48.320]  But you know what? I'm not going to give up my language choices to the people who misuse it.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:55.320]  They use that. They deliberately chose patriots so they could lie to people so they could misrepresent it. But I'm not taking that out of the lexicon.
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:51:21.320]  Stay with us and we'll be right back.

[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:29.320]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:33.320]  Before using heart and body extract my energy level was very, very low.
[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:36.320]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:38.320]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:42.320]  But after taking heart and body extract my energy level has improved greatly.
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:45.320]  And I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on David Knight.
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:14.320]  We're going to go right back to our callers and as a matter of fact we were just talking to John in Minnesota.
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:17.320]  He took exception to the fact that we would use the word patriot.
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:20.320]  Well, you know, language is very powerful.
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:22.320]  Labels are very powerful.
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  I'm not going to give up the long term meaning of patriot because George Bush cynically tried to redefine it with a patriot act.
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:37.320]  It doesn't like they came up with a description of what they were going to do and just, oh, look, that spells patriot.
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:38.320]  Wow, who would have thought of it?
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:42.320]  That was a very cynical way to try to redefine the debate and we've seen that with many other terms.
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:48.320]  Before I get back to him, I just want to let you know that my patriot supply is at infowarsstore.com.

[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:08.320]  And when I talk about patriot, I mean people who take care of themselves, who take care of their countries, who defend individual liberty,
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:12.320]  who defend their country against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:15.320]  And that can sometimes mean your own government.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:17.320]  Frequently it does because they're the ones who come after you.
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:20.320]  Now I want to go back to John in Minnesota.
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.320]  And I just want to say, John, that we look at the term, for instance, liberal.
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:31.320]  Again, in the 1800s, a liberal was somebody who defended economic freedom and who defended civil liberty.
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:34.320]  That all changed in the early part of the 20th century.
[02:55:34.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  There was a split in the libertarian faction, if we can call it that, that came about during World War I and the Palmer raids.
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:50.320]  And we had people start calling themselves liberals who supported a lot of very strong government programs, but they were against the war, against World War I.
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.320]  Then you had other people who would support property rights, but they were very much pro-war.
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:58.320]  So that kind of, that World War I experience kind of divided the camp.
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:04.320]  So a lot of people will refer to themselves now as classical liberals to try to go back to the 1800s definition.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:11.320]  Some people came up with the term libertarian to try to distinguish themselves from liberals, but it's the labels.
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:15.320]  And I think that we need to fight for these labels instead of just running from them.
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:19.320]  I think we need to make sure that we keep the high ground of terminology.
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:22.320]  So yeah, I'm not going to run from the label of patriot.
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  Go ahead, tell me what you think we should do.
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:33.320]  Well, liberal, from what I remember looking up in the dictionary, means open-minded and generous.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:38.320]  And I think that's where a lot of American liberals today think that they're open-minded.
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:39.320]  Well, they're not.
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:43.320]  The Democrats usually suck up most of the liberals in the voting society.
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:48.320]  And Democrats are the most tyrannical group of people I've ever seen besides the SS.
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.320]  Yeah, it used to be that you get a liberal education that meant that it was a very open mind.
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:57.320]  And then that sense and not in the political sense is what I was talking about in the sense that you're talking about.
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:01.320]  That would be going to college and getting a liberal education, getting a liberal degree.
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:05.320]  But now there's a lot of intolerance. There's a lot of control in the school.
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:08.320]  So yeah, labels change.
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:13.320]  And I think, though, that we should not give up labels like patriots that easily.
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:21.320]  I think we need to not be afraid to identify with the people who have gone before and pushed back against the cynicism
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.320]  of the label that George Bush came up with in the Patriot Act.
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:31.320]  Well, man, I wish I could listen to Alex Jones on the radio up here in the Twin Cities.
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:37.320]  But instead, they keep giving us Rush Limbaugh during your time slot and then Sean Hannity.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:45.320]  These two shills for the Republican Party year after year, going almost 20 years now, keep telling their listeners,
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:52.320]  Oh, Hillary's bad. Oh, Obama's bad. John Kerry's bad. But they keep telling you that this Republican guy is going to be good for you
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:57.320]  when Republicans have defecated on their own base so many times.
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:04.320]  I mean, why would anybody be a Republican? That's why I have a hard time wondering why you're even kind of hoping for Rand Paul.
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:12.320]  I mean, no, actually, no, I pointed out that I disagree with them strongly on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:17.320]  And how did that work out for Republicans when they elected these guys this last time? Immediately.
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:22.320]  Immediately, they threw the base under the bus. They didn't do anything about Obamacare. They didn't do anything about the borders.
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:26.320]  That was what they were elected for. Immediately, they passed a continuing resolution.
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:31.320]  So that would be off the table. They wouldn't have any leverage on that. I absolutely agree with you.
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.320]  And I am not in either party. I would say that I'm like Gerald Salenty. I'm a political atheist.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:41.320]  That's it for today. Join us tonight at 7 Central for the Nightly News.
