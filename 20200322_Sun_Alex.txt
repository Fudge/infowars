[00:00.000 --> 00:18.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:40.000]  Lights out, ladies and gentlemen, lights out. The curfew is going into place.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  Incremental martial law. But it's an authoritarian state, we don't tell you it's martial law.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  We just tell you we'll lock you up for six months unless you've got the proper pass to be out after dark.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  And then, at nine o'clock every night, lights out, lights out, lights out.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  Conserve energy here in the fatherland, here in the homeland.
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.000]  They've announced in Europe last week that they're going to order Netflix and YouTube and Google and others
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  to only put out less than HD because it might hurt the bandwidth of others. That's just a test of power.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  And now they're announcing here in the United States, don't play video games during peak times in the morning or the afternoon or night.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  Other people need their internet while they're locked up in their houses, video gamers.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  You're bad as well. The state is going to tell you what you can do.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  You know, you read about martial law and tyranny in Celsius, Romania, where they told people lights out at nine o'clock at night,
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  and then a few years later, he just took electricity away from them altogether.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  And so you get it two hours a day if you behave yourselves.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  It's all about power and all about control, but in the central city of the Romanian dictator's palace,
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  it was lit up like a Christmas tree, and he'd stare down when the sun set at night and everything was darkness.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  And the people in the communist country didn't even have money for candles.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  And if they saw light coming from your house at night, you might get up.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  Why do you have a light? You're not allowed to.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  Seriously, look at the history books. And so you're all learning right now, aren't you?
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  Trump, seven weeks ago, did not want to have the big crackdown.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  So everything was OK. The media said that he was bad and going to make it worse.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  Then he said, OK, I'll block Chinese flights. He was bad then, even though the left now is saying he hasn't done enough.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  I got a call from a text.source today and someone well known to me,
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  and he was saying that they've been told that they're going to start having nighttime curfews.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  I know other states have been announcing those. But Governor Abbott said that 200 plus Texas counties,
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  we have so many counties here, the most finished state, big state, second largest state in the country after Alaska,
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  that is geographically the amount of square miles, that he wants the big cities like Houston, Dallas,
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  San Antonio, Austin to lock down and shelter in place, but not the rest of the state until there's cases there.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  So I guess he isn't around to that yet. Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for the virus. It's feeling fine.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  And so we're going to be laying all of this out and more.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  And step aside, Bernie Sanders, with the guaranteed personal income and all the rest of it,
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  and all the free money that leads us in Bobway and Weimar Republic inflation.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  Trump first was going to have a trillion dollar stimulus five days ago and $2,000 per family.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  But the stock market plunge is so great with the media hysteria, he's now saying $4 trillion into the economy,
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  directly to big corporations and individuals, but you know, the big corporations look at the lion's share,
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  and that $3,000 for a family of four. If that doesn't create inflation, I don't know what will,
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  but the media and the chai comms and the EU and everyone hyping up that it's the end of the world,
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  do you want the depression to just absolutely be a certainty? I'll say this.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  He passed the point of fiscal responsibility a long time ago.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  They're devaluing currencies worldwide. There's now a race of devaluation,
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  and all that matters is whose currency is left standing at the end.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's the last currency standing, the last man standing scenario, but we are in the new world order right now.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  And all these different factions of the globalists are pushing to set up a surveillance grid,
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  legitimize the surveillance grid, get rid of cash, break up the family, force inoculation,
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  medical tyranny. The list goes on and on, and the Justice Department, it turns out.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  I looked into it. It's true. I'll just believe something's as unpolitical as Rolling Stone.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  Quietly went to Congress and said, we want to suspend habeas corpus and access the courts
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  and have citizens disappear for a year, not just for corona, but for anything.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  Yes. Dangerous times.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  I made four police state films more than a decade ago, specifically warning
[05:07.000 --> 05:13.000]  of the plan to suspend habeas corpus, the right to even have access to a court,
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  the right to not be secretly arrested, and secretly disappeared.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  And I warned the Patriot Act that claimed it was for terrorists,
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  was really for the American people. Well, now they admit it is.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  And bipartisanally, the Justice Department is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  Americans whenever they want under the guise of coronavirus.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  But they just say during the emergency, it'll be for every other crime you can imagine.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  It's the chairing on top of a nice big fudge Sunday called martial law.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Oh, and the sprinkles on it, it's the big, great depression everybody's going to have.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  So folks that are all excited that you're getting time off work, oh, you're going to get time off
[05:53.000 --> 06:22.000]  from your whole future, your family, your health and forced inoculations and gun confiscation.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  And here we are, my friends, broadcasting worldwide with the biggest audiences we've ever had.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  And you know why? It's because everything we've talked about is happening just exactly as we laid it out.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  How do we do it? Well, I'll lay it out today and tell you what's coming next if the globalists continue on their path.
[06:51.000 --> 07:00.000]  You know, if I was a person and found a sea captain's chart planning his next voyage across the ocean,
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  that he say left at a bar or left at a library, and I looked at it, I would know his next mission that he was getting ready for the next week.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  And if I wanted to get a ship and follow him, I would know where he was going.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  That's how I knew all this, because the globalists are very arrogant and they're in our face and think we're stupid.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  I think we won't actually read their white papers and battle plans.
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  What the Council on Foreign Relations of the UN, the IMF and World Bank say, but I do read what they say.
[07:31.000 --> 07:39.000]  Five years ago at Davos, up on a mountain top in Switzerland, the public Bilderberg Group, Davos Group met,
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  and the headlines were World Technocrats to Rule the Planet, New World Order World Government to Replace National Governments,
[07:48.000 --> 08:02.000]  Technocrats who are unelected will soon control the planet using economic crises, migrant flows, and wait for it,
[08:02.000 --> 08:13.000]  a Disease X outbreak, probably a respiratory disease, probably out of China.
[08:13.000 --> 08:28.000]  Those criminals love to brag, the globalists up there, the George Soros, the Herman von Rumpi, all of them.
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.000]  They love the head of the EU and all of them to get up there and just tell you what they're going to do years later.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  So then about a year and a half ago, UN says Disease X coming, it's going to come out of China, probably respiratory, probably coronavirus.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  It's going to kill 65 to 100 million people worldwide and you will accept world government out of it.
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  And then in November, five months ago, Bill Gates came out and had his tabletop exercise, 201,
[09:01.000 --> 09:11.000]  65 million die from a coronavirus event, 201, and he had a vaccine ingredient, I mean, it's ready.
[09:11.000 --> 09:20.000]  The coded virus of COVID-19, the Chai-Kong attack weapon, and they incubated it in China and they had the big freak out
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  and it's been scanned by major universities, it's man-made, and we first told you that eight weeks ago,
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  and now you see the Communist Chinese are saying on their official national TV that it's Trump's fault, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:33.000 --> 09:46.000]  that it's all President Trump's fault and that the US government launched it and the media is actually trying to agree with it.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  But when I said it was the Chai-Kongs and the globalist deep state, oh, I was bad.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  That's just crazy that Jones is saying that.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  Go back eight weeks ago, seven weeks ago, six weeks ago, there's all these London Guardian and New York Times and others
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  have articles saying that this evil Jones is saying it's man-made with no evidence.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  Oh, no, just major universities in the United States, in Europe, in India, scanning it,
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  and the author of the US biological weapons law that then became world law, Dr. Francis Boyle,
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  and all these people are saying the same thing, but I'm just up here, you know, seven weeks ago, eight weeks ago,
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  telling you this before anybody else.
[10:25.000 --> 10:36.000]  And it's not about me sitting up here saying, oh, look, I told you over and over again, it's about understanding the reality of what we're facing.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  Whether this virus kills 200,000 people or 30,000 people, we're told 4,000 died in China,
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  over 4,000 have now died in Italy.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  We're told it peaked in China.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  The flu kills 35,000 every year in the US alone.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  Why are we panicking then?
[10:59.000 --> 11:08.000]  Because it's the response and the hysteria and the lockdowns that are already causing us to go into a depression.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  And now Trump is saying four or five days ago they're going to inject $1 trillion into the economy and give each family $2,000.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  Now it's $4 trillion and it's $3,000 per family.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  Will that stop the stock market sliding tomorrow?
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  Is there no end to what we've gotten into?
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  You watch the press briefings and the press is frothing like pit bulls starving to death,
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  trying to snap at the president like he's a giant side of beef that's been rotisserie on a spit.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  And you did a terrible job.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  China's done a great job.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  You're a horrible person.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  You need to declare martial law.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  You need to do more knowing that will take the economy.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  The Chinese saw up weapon cripples US economy.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Panicked Trump injects $4 trillion into the US.
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  They say the next 90 days and the media that said G.G. Ping did a wonderful job lines up against our president and our country
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  because they're enemies of the nation who hate the country's existence and who said they wanted to see the president and America fail
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  because they're globalists.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  And the fact that they even operate and the fact that their sponsors operate.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Imagine if I was on air saying I hate America.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  I wanted depression.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  The president's terrible.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  G.G. Ping is good.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  Washington Post headlines.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  G.G. Ping should crush Trump and save the world.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  How have we gotten into a position like this?
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  Well, we've tolerated people that are absolutely against this nation and that are scum of the earth.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Now let's start getting into the clips.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  And I'll tell you about all the big guests we've got today and so much more.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  But here's DHS chief, nationwide lockdown under consideration.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  Well, I'll tell you why it's under consideration in a moment, but here is that clip.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  So let's get to the very latest.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  The U.S. closing its border with Mexico, closing the Canadian border effective this weekend.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  Is the president considering a full shutdown of the country for a period of time, sir?
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  Not at this time.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  The president, again, the vice president and the task force has been very aggressive and very forward leaning and providing a number of guidance,
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  information to the American public.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  We have the 15 days to slow the spread.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  So there's a number of measures that we're asking the American public to take.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  You will see that there's been another pair of governors, particularly in New York and California,
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  that have taken the extra step and imposed some additional strict measures.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  And we certainly agree with those measures.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  There's going to be certain communities that have widespread community transmission that need to take more aggressive measures than perhaps other communities.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  So again, we're working with them.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  We're working with the state and local and the governors to do that.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  And we continue to encourage them to take those aggressive measures.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  Now, as I predicted seven weeks ago, they're going to say Trump didn't respond enough.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  I said he should respond with rhetoric, but also with funding for whoever is actually sicker for masks.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  But that is his role as federal executive leader to not take over the states, but to give them aid and to help coordinate.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  But it's up to the governors of the states.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  Trump is right.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  But see, the Blasio and Rachel Maddow and Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, they know that their constituents don't know the three branches of government
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  and don't know the federal system and how our law and countries operates.
[14:31.000 --> 14:39.000]  So they're saying Trump isn't lifting a finger, not lifting a finger of $4 trillion over the top, massive aid to the states.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  That is not lifting a finger.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  Here it is.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  I feel like we should inoculate ourselves against the harmful impact of these ongoing false promises and false statements by the president
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  by recognizing that when he is talking about the coronavirus epidemic, more often than not, he is lying.
[14:58.000 --> 15:09.000]  Even when he's talking about what he has done or what he will do, he is consistently lying and giving you happy talk that is stuff that the federal government isn't actually doing.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  And it's making people around the country count on the fact that the federal government is doing that stuff when they're not.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  I mean, there may be other people in the federal government who are saying things that are true, but these daily briefings from the White House are a litany of things from the president.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  That would be awesome if they were true, if they were happening, but they're not.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  And so the sooner we come to terms with that, I think the better for all of us.
[15:31.000 --> 15:41.000]  If it were up to me and it's not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV, not out of spite, but because it's misinformation.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  So there you go. She wants to censor the press and censor the president.
[15:44.000 --> 15:59.000]  And when we come back, we've got the clip of the governor and other Democrats and the mayor of New York coming after the president saying he's not lifted his finger. Stay with us.
[15:59.000 --> 16:09.000]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines.
[16:12.000 --> 16:31.000]  I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives, and I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc, zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life.
[16:31.000 --> 16:46.000]  And that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities, including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[16:46.000 --> 16:59.000]  So do yourself a favor. Search engine, zinc and antiviral. Three words. Zinc, antiviral. Zinc, antiviral. Do yourself a favor. Zinc, antiviral.
[16:59.000 --> 17:06.000]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe.
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.000]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city, and we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper.
[17:12.000 --> 17:25.000]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3,
[17:25.000 --> 17:39.000]  body's ultimate turmeric formula, and of course our high quality silver gargle products and super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil and of course iodine as well.
[17:39.000 --> 17:52.000]  There are so many other amazing products at infowarstore.com ready to ship. Our shipping department is getting every order out within 24 hours and shipping it directly to your door.
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  So get prepared and get ready now with things you really need at infowarstore.com.
[18:23.000 --> 18:32.000]  The rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders. And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blues cities here as well.
[18:32.000 --> 18:44.000]  Tens of thousands released. And now Governor Newsom says he made the clear martial law and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses or six months in jail.
[18:44.000 --> 18:54.000]  But publicly stated, illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so called migrants and of course the homeless are all exempt. I'm not getting.
[18:54.000 --> 19:02.000]  Look it up. Welcome to slavery. They think they own you and now they're about to show you one of the products that I'm very proud of.
[19:02.000 --> 19:12.000]  I don't talk enough about because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it. It takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth through your throat and lungs are really thin. It's a little bit of alcohol if you wanted to essential oils, not our lung cleanse.
[19:22.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it. You take a few sprays in your mouth lightly inhaled and it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[19:39.000 --> 19:47.000]  It's just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[19:47.000 --> 20:11.000]  So get your lung cleanse discounted at infowarstore.com and get yourself and your family prepared while at the same time funding the info war, a total 360 win infowarstore.com.
[20:18.000 --> 20:32.000]  We are back on this live incredibly important Sunday transmission, March 22nd, 2020, 225, 225 days out from the election.
[20:32.000 --> 20:41.000]  Okay, we have Norm Pat as constitutional lawyer scheduled to join us next segment.
[20:41.000 --> 20:51.000]  He first talked about on the air a week ago that the Federalist Society has been meeting with Trump and the Justice Department and others are wanting the president to basically declare martial law interstate travel bans.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  That's now in Politico and in Rolling Stone over the weekend.
[20:57.000 --> 21:06.000]  And so we're going to be going over some of that DOJ wants to suspend certain constitutional rights during coronavirus emergency like habeas corpus.
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  So we're going to talk to him about that and then Robert Barnes, other constitutional lawyer, both very prominent individuals, very smart.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  We'll be popping in next hour.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  We have a special report.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  We're going to premiere about the nature of evil in the bottom of the rabbit hole in the final segment tonight.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  But there is so much I want to get to right now.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  Look, I understand why the president's doing this because of the hysteria.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  He tried to tap it down seven weeks ago, six weeks ago, five weeks ago, four weeks ago.
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  But the Democrats said, oh, you're not caring about people that are going to die knowing the virus would come here.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  Knowing it would kill some people, mainly the very old and sick.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  And so Trump then said, OK, states under the Constitution, you do it will give you the funding and support.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  That's not enough.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  One trillion dollars and $2,000 per family.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  That's not enough.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  Four trillion dollars.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  He's announced and three thousand per family.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  That's not enough.
[22:02.000 --> 22:09.000]  And I want to play this de Blasio clip where he's saying Trump has not lifted a finger.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  Well, this is beyond anything Bernie Sanders ever said he'd do with free money.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  This will be value of the dollar.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  And this will cause inflation.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  Now, I understand we're going into a depression that lowers prices, but it could easily get out of control.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Now, I understand desperate measures.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  If somebody's dying on the operating table, you give them a shot of adrenaline, might make them have a heart attack.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  But they're going to die if you don't.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  So might as well try it.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  It's like a defibrillator.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  It might have a heart attack when their heart restarts, but you don't have a choice.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  So this is crazy times right now, folks.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  And Trump doesn't want stock buybacks to big companies like when Obama did bailouts that were much smaller than this.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  That the companies would then take the money and buy their stock back.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  I mean, Trump said, I want to go into the workers, I want to go into the economy, and he'll make sure that happens.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  He does what he says he'll do.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  So they're going to have bailouts.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Wow, why not have one actually the people?
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  But it's the left and the globalist exacerbating all of this as much as they can.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  So here's the blosio and what he had to say, the New York mayor.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  Chuck, the truth is and New Yorkers and all Americans deserve the blunt truth.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  It's only getting worse.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  And in fact, April and May are going to be a lot worse.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  Right now we are a third of the cases in the country.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's going to get worse.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  We're about two thirds or more of the cases in New York state.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  That's going to get worse.
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  But Chuck, the president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  And I don't get it.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  I don't get it right now.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  I have asked repeatedly for the military to be mobilized for the defense production act to be used to its fullest to get us things like ventilators.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  So people who can live who would die otherwise.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Chuck, I can't be blunt enough.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  If the president doesn't act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  What is it that you want?
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Teenage citizens, folks who are members of families.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  Right.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  And we can't get action from the president of the United States.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  What is it that you want the military to do immediately?
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  What would it be a specific thing you'd want the military to do immediately?
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  Chuck, the military has extraordinary medical capacity of its own that's been honed in fighting wars.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  They can handle any situation.
[24:20.000 --> 24:28.000]  All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep like New York right now.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  The military is the best logistical organization in the nation.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York, not weeks from now or months from now.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  In the next 10 days, and the only force in America that can do that is the military.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  Why are they at their bases?
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  Why are they not being allowed to serve?
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  I guarantee you they're ready to serve, but the president has to give the order.
[24:50.000 --> 25:01.000]  Now, two days ago, we showed you video of the military, thousands of troops and medical corps rolling into New York, more rolled in yesterday than today.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  And they took over hotels, sports stadiums, and are setting up ventilators and beds.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  They were ordered two weeks ago.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  Trump gave a speech the middle of the week talking about the Defense Mobilization Act and ordering companies to do it.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  But he said, I've met with all of them, and they're doing it without me ordering them.
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  And I'm not going to put the military inside their facilities and order them. They've already agreed.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  But see, de Blasio knows the public, especially in New York, I'm sorry, it's constituents, don't pay attention.
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  So he just says, Trump hasn't lifted a finger we want the military.
[25:36.000 --> 25:48.000]  Meanwhile, the military's rolled in to Texas, Ohio, New Jersey, California, New York, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, everywhere.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  And the National Guard's been called up.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  And again, it's the level of Democrats lying.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  If you're a TV viewer, you see us putting AP Reuters, New York TV, everything.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  The troops were rolling in to DC and Maryland and New York Friday.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  We played some of the first videos here.
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.000]  Now there it is. That's for Friday. Deploys the FedEx Center, Maryland. Deploys the DC. Deploys the New York. Friday.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  De Blasio goes on the Sunday morning show. Two days later, his office knew the army was there. He's the mayor.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  And says, we need the army here. They just commandeered a bunch of facilities.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  And he's lying about that. These people are bold, man.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  That's all I can tell you. And again, they're going to be ventilator shortages if as bad as they're saying, regardless.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  And they're going to have trouble shipping them around.
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  And then when they get people bitching about it, because everything just doesn't work perfectly in the universe.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  See, Venezuela doesn't have any health care. Cuba doesn't have any basic health care.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  They've got more doctors than any country in the world per capita.
[26:56.000 --> 27:07.000]  But see, De Blasio wants to tell people that there's a magic leprechaun that craps out gold and fuel and food and ventilators.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  And the president's got all of these companies there that built this stuff saying, you've switched over production.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  I've seen the press conferences. You're on it. The mask, the ventilator is a great job.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And they go, you have it done your job, Trump.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  Show that he'll go ahead and declare that because they just want to be able to tell him what to do when they couldn't get the economy out of recession.
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  But they're the Democrats that celebrated and said, we hope there's a recession or depression. It's worth it.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  CNN, MSNBC, HBO, Bill Maher, not going to play those clips again and subject you to it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  You all heard it. And now you understand what's happening as good as I do or better.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  But Democrats don't because they're helpless, mindless, childlike idiots.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be old, they could be young, they could be Hispanic, they could be gay, they could be straight.
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  But what they are is dumb followers that believe people like Hillary and de Blasio and Governor Cuomo.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  Trump's been saying for a week, oh Cuomo, you've done so great, you've done so good.
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  Cuomo gets up, I've got that clip and says, quite frankly, Trump hasn't done a good job.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  Pushing him to federalize these responses, when Trump knows you give the federal aid, they back up the locals, that's the Constitution,
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  or it's basically federal martial law, they want to trick him into taking over the situation.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  So everything can be blamed on him. They want to pass the buck and say he hasn't lifted a finger when he's done a great job.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  Trying to stop the hysteria that they hype up and say they want.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  They're publicly betting against America, hoping this crashes things.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  They're getting success now and they were so dumb they're going to blame conservatives and Christians and gun owners, everybody else.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Oh, and they're coming for the guns too, so much coming up on the other side.
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  We're going to get the truth out despite big tech censorship.
[28:59.000 --> 29:08.000]  It's been the globalists, the chai comms and Democrats that they control that have been pushing for coronavirus hysteria
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  and suspension of basic rights for the last eight weeks.
[29:14.000 --> 29:22.000]  And now Governor Newsom has come out publicly and said they're ready to declare martial law.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  Well, that's a word game.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  When you tell 40 million people they can't leave their houses, period,
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.000]  and you scare monger and say that almost 60% of the population will have it in just six weeks,
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  you're engaged in psychological warfare and you've already declared martial law.
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  About a seven on a one to ten Richter scale.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Get ready, folks.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  The Democrats, just like the chai comms, are setting the bar for martial law.
[29:52.000 --> 30:00.000]  Full on secret arrest, FEMA camps, you name it, but the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt.
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  We've all heard of the strike.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  It's a socialist and communist tactic, but sometimes populist movements have used the strike.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  You can have labor strikes.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  You can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a company or a service.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  And many times when the people actually get together and move and master the strike,
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  it has a great effect and some good things have come out of it.
[30:25.000 --> 30:35.000]  But now we are seeing a globalist corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times,
[30:35.000 --> 30:44.000]  led by big tech over a month ago to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world.
[30:44.000 --> 30:51.000]  But notice the big globalist corporations and the big box stores, they are all exempt.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  This is more than just martial law training.
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  This is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they can blame on Trump,
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.000]  and they even admit they're doing it.
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.000]  The globalist and the enemy of the people, corporate media, have worked overtime like the devil
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  to destroy all independent pro-America truth-based media.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  And chief amongst their enemy has been in full wars.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  But thanks to you spreading the word and thanks to you supporting in full wars,
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  we are still on the air and have actually expanded in the face of their tyranny.
[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  It is now more critical than ever that you take this opportunity to share BAN.VIDEO and infowars.com
[31:29.000 --> 31:33.000]  and the articles and reports that are so critical because the world is waking up
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  and needs this information now more than ever.
[31:35.000 --> 31:41.000]  For myself and the info wars crew, you have our undying pledge and commitment
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.000]  to fight these tyrants harder than we ever have before
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  and to defend basic freedom and justice and the American way of life.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  This is the Crossroads, America and the planet in the balance.
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  Whatever you do, please take action and spread the word.
[31:56.000 --> 32:19.000]  God bless and good luck.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Tens of thousands released.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  And now Governor Newsom says he may declare martial law
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  or six months in jail.
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  But publicly stated, illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so-called migrants,
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  and of course the homeless are all exempt.
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.000]  I'm not kidding. Look it up. Welcome to slavery.
[32:57.000 --> 33:25.000]  They own you and now they're about to show you.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  You can talk patriot, populist, pro America, pro freedom, pro Constitution, capitalist media.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  But when you spread the word about info wars dot com,
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  forward slash show and band dot video,
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  when you spread the word about the local stations that carry our broadcast,
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.000]  it overrides that in our audience that tunes into our actual servers
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  and systems is triple what it's ever been right now
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  because people know we predicted all of it and they're spreading the word.
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  So I salute you all.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  We are defeating the globalist propaganda despite overwhelming odds
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  because we have the truth and we have God on our sides and we have will.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  We're the doers. We're the people that actually take action.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  All the little jellyfish and their masters know it.
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  All right. I've got a stack of news here that I'm going to be getting to
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  at the start of the next hour where AP Reuters, the New York Times,
[34:16.000 --> 34:24.000]  they have articles saying the FDA has not approved for the coronavirus
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  what President Trump's talking up this malaria drug drug chloroquine,
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  which pushes zinc into the cells.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  And they're even saying he should be quiet.
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  When the European governments have come out and said it's worked really, really well.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  When China had a lot of success with it, when it's known to be antiviral in general,
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  because zinc is antiviral.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  And if it can push that in, well, then there you go.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  So Trump wrongly claims FDA approved drug chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  That's that's CNN, folks.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  Criticizing the president when the EU is using this massively having big success,
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  it's approved for malaria 60 years ago, 70 years.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  It's an old drug, very inexpensive. Bayer donates two million bottles of it to the U.S. government.
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  And the Democrats are fighting to make sure you don't learn about it or you don't get it.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  I mean, they're just evil.
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  And saying he shouldn't be allowed to stand up with all those doctors and talk about a promising drug.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Again, that's the FDA, that's the bureaucrats, that's the Democrats.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  You, the president, shut up.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  We played it earlier. What did Matt I'll say?
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  He shouldn't be, no one should carry his press conferences, the president.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  She's the authority. First ban Alex Jones.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Now let's silence him. Don't cover him.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  He's bad. He's going to hurt people.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  He said chloroquine is saving a lot of people.
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  It's a month ago, China was reporting that.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  A month ago, Europe, Europe's all over.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Hey, it's really working and almost everybody.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  It's amazing. And also something's happening.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  You watch all these different news channels and you see nothing about zinc.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  Nothing on the national news, nothing in print media.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  There's a big famous virologist came out and told his family take zinc.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  And then the media got the, got the letter they found on Facebook that family republished.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  It was a private letter and they all attacked the guy and tried to get him to say it doesn't help.
[36:30.000 --> 36:38.000]  He goes, no, it's well known in hundreds of studies again.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  There's no cure for anything in the world.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  There are treatments for things, but see, they don't want you to know zinc is antiviral.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  They don't want you to know that if you take zinc and all these big studies,
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  you're 90 plus percent, you know, lower level of getting all these different cancers.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  They don't want to, they don't want, they want you to know about chemotherapy,
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.000]  bug poison. You pay $1,000 for treatment for it. It costs them 30 cents.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Think about how sick that is. They won't tell you about zinc.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  They won't tell you about any of this.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  But I know a medical doctor who's gone and prescribed himself chloroquine,
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  but he says that's only when he starts to get sick and is found to have it,
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  because he said all it does is push zinc in.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  And what's he doing? He's just taking 30 milligrams of zinc a day,
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  about three times a daily allowance.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  He'd die without zinc, folks.
[37:31.000 --> 37:37.000]  By the way, I noticed on Thursday, I'm like, why is Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  our multivitamin mineral with pregnant women? Find out why this is so special?
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  I said, why isn't it in the best seller list?
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And they said, well, people are selling out of zinc everywhere.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Oh, yeah, zinc sold out of stores all over the country.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  Our multivitamin has a big nice dose of it that works with all the other vitamins and minerals
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  synergistically for your body and your cells as well.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  Is it a treatment? Is it a cure? Is it a silver bullet?
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, no. Zinc is bad and evil.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  No, it's not a silver bullet. It's not a panacea.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  That's actually what that microbiologist said, the famous guy said to his family,
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  zinc isn't a silver bullet, but he said they can't go into the cells as easy
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  and order the mitochondria to mass produce the viruses.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  And it coats the cell. So again, they don't want you to know that.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  Well, we have our multivitamin mineral with preglinone.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  This is for adults because it has a preglinone.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  And we have the Real Red Pill Plus that has natural, healthy, organic stimulant in it
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  from different types of a naturally occurring caffeine.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  And this is going to sell out in three weeks at the current rate of sales.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  But that was being sold at full price.
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.000]  I said, since everybody's getting it, I want to sell it at 50% off.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  So we will sell out of this in about a week and a half, two weeks.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  Real Red Pill is a Red Pill.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  The Real Red Pill Plus is a Red Pill in a green background.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  It's got the vump, vump to it.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  You truck drivers are folks.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  And that's how we also fund this operation.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  It's great products like that.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  We have the super silver wound gel that is topical.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  This is private label.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  This is sold in stores everywhere.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  This is the FDA approved this company to sell this over the counter.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  We have it private label.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  It's American Biotech company.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  And it's a very strong, not for ingestion, silver topical hospital.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  They also use this.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  It creates a shield on your hands.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Everybody's into hand sanitizer.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Alcohol goes away in about 30 seconds.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  The nano silver, the Pentagon tested it, lasts for, well, if it's not wiped off the surface, weeks and weeks.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  But pretty much all day if you have this on your hands.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  So we've got it at infowarstore.com.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  The strongest approved over-the-counter silver you can get.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  This is the super silver, the same nano silver that's in our super blue toothpaste.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  But at super blue toothpaste, I say way, way, way, way lower amount.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  Okay, you do not ingest this, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  This is for topical at infowarstore.com.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  And we have vitamin mineral fusion has zinc in it as well.
[39:55.000 --> 40:02.000]  But you need all those vitamins and all those minerals for your cells to operate an optimal function.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  So it's all available infowarstore.com.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  This is a great way to get into your children because it tastes great.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  Okay, let me now get back into what I was talking about.
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.000]  Mnuchin says that the U.S. government in conjunction with the private federal reserve
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  is going to lend $4 trillion to businesses and they go on to say in the report
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  and then forgive the loans.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  So free money if it goes to your employees.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  We've never had a bailout that actually goes to employees.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  We'll see what happens, but here's what he had to say.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  Let me just walk you through the highlights of the package
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  because the president is very determined to protect American workers.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  We've ordered a major part of the economy to shut down and the president wants to protect them.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  So the first part are what I call small business retention loans.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  If you're a small business, you'll get two weeks of cash flow to pay your workers.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  You need to retain them.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  You'll also get some overhead.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  And if you do that, those loans will be forgiven.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  That's about half of our workforce.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  That will allow small businesses to keep people and make sure when we open the economy, they're up and running.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  The second part is direct deposits.
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  The average direct deposit or check for a family of four will be approximately $3,000.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  This you can think of as a bridge for them to get through this quickly.
[41:22.000 --> 41:29.000]  The third component is enhanced unemployment insurance for people that are laid off due to the coronavirus.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  And the fourth component is a significant package working with the Federal Reserve.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  We'll have up to $4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  And that's it.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  Those are broad-based lending programs under section 13-3.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  We can leverage our equity working with the Federal Reserve.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  Wow.
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  $4 trillion in loans to businesses the rest of the U.S. economy mentioned says.
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  Now, when I stayed at Trump Hotel and other ones, almost every time you're there,
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  someone pulls a fire alarm at 2 a.m. that people harass Trump.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  They're ghost towns now.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  He's lost billions being under attack.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  And here's Trump admits coronavirus is hurting his family business.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  The question is, is he allowed to get a bailout though?
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  Because he's the president and this is the package.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  Here it is.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  Mr. President, on the economic front, there are reports that the coronavirus is really hurting your businesses, especially your hotels.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  My businesses?
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Yes.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  Is that true?
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  Well, I wouldn't say it's thriving when you decide to close down your hotels and your businesses.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  No, I would say, but you know, I'm very underlevered in everything, so that's good.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  But is it hurting my, yeah, it's hurting me and it's hurting Hilton and it's hurting all of the hotel chains all over the world.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  We know why.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  I just asked the wrong question.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  He's not going to get a bailout to his companies.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  They're going directly to the employees.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  So it's not going to matter.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Ah, see how that works?
[42:53.000 --> 43:00.000]  We'll be right back with Key Intel.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  Our constitutions, our health is our most valuable asset.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  And we've got to take care of our bodies.
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  We've got to take care of ourselves.
[43:13.000 --> 43:31.000]  And all the products at infowarstore.com have been researched deeply and had been developed with some of the top experts in the country to maximize what God's given us through Mother Nature to help our bodies boost their defense against all the
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  insane things that have been artificially introduced into our environment.
[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize it's not toilet paper or flashlights that you really need.

[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at infowarstore.com.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  The noose is tightening around America's neck.
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  The supply chains have been cut off.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  We are under globalist attack.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  And President Trump understands this.
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  I'm here to tell listeners now is the time to spread the word while we're still on air at infowarstore.com.
[44:14.000 --> 44:34.000]  And now is the time for modern Paul Revere's to also protect themselves and their families by getting high quality, nutraceutical products that boost your overall defense of your health.

[44:48.000 --> 44:59.000]  But we do have them in stock right now. Check out infowarstore.com and get ready and fund the info war at the same time. Good luck and God bless you all.
[44:59.000 --> 45:15.000]  France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the list goes on and on. They've all declared martial law and said that if you leave your house without authorization, you'll be put in jail for up to six months.
[45:15.000 --> 45:31.000]  But they've been releasing by the tens of thousands per country the hardened criminals, the rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders. And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well.
[45:31.000 --> 45:43.000]  Tens of thousands released. And now Governor Newsom says he may declare martial law and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses or six months in jail.
[45:43.000 --> 45:59.000]  But publicly stated, illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so called migrants and of course the homeless are all exempt. I'm not getting. Look it up. Welcome to slavery. They think they own you and now they're about to show you.
[45:59.000 --> 46:18.000]  Listen to me very, very carefully. I am involved at very high levels with supply chain management and talk to a lot of executives and they are confirming to me that the supply chain is starting to break down because they're running out of the raw materials for food and things like high quality
[46:18.000 --> 46:37.000]  supplements that boost you and your family's defense. Ladies and gentlemen, you need to get your orders in now at infowarstore.com for X2, X3 living defense, DNA Force Plus and all the other great products.
[46:37.000 --> 46:51.000]  Many of them are about to sell out in the next few days to the next few weeks. Others are going to be running out as well in the next month and we're not sure if we'll ever be able to get them again in the foreseeable future.
[46:51.000 --> 47:11.000]  That's how crazy all of this is. So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need and fund the info war. Take action now.
[47:21.000 --> 47:33.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alan Jones, your host. We're here every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I did a special three hour broadcast yesterday at 2 to 5. So much is happening commercial free.
[47:33.000 --> 47:53.000]  And of course, that week they broadcast 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. You have David Knight performing your only employers network 8 a.m. Central and Owen Schroyer 3 p.m. with War Room. His co-host Roger Stone has his ongoing gag order even after his fake conviction for lying to Congress by this corrupt judge.
[47:53.000 --> 48:09.000]  And you've got these massive pushes for no one to have free speech. This this is all martial law implementation by stealth. Trump is leaving to the states and in New York and in California and other areas they have declared what is basically a form of martial law.
[48:09.000 --> 48:25.000]  According to Black's law dictionary in psychopedia Britannica, Wikipedia and Webster in psychopedia and dictionary definitions of constitutional lawyer Norm Patis about to join us. But I wanted to just show you some of these headlines.
[48:25.000 --> 48:39.000]  DOJ wants to suspend certain constitutional rights during coronavirus emergency. Now, I don't just believe something when I see it in the New York Times or in Rolling Stone or in Politico.
[48:39.000 --> 49:01.000]  But I did some poking around and indeed found the links to reports that in one of the documents, the department proposes that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience or other emergency situation.
[49:01.000 --> 49:14.000]  I love the it's not act of God, a meteorite or a flooded, you know, damn. It's any other emergency situation that goes on to keep you in jail for years without ever seeing a magistrate.
[49:14.000 --> 49:26.000]  So that's the end of habeas corpus and it's very serious that stories up on info wars.com. So in the DHS chief says nationwide lockdown on under consideration, the president is going along with the states doing it.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  He's doing that so they can't criticize if we're not responding enough. Well, here you just run it, which is constitutional. He just supports. But that's the federal system.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  But US Army enters New York on Friday to convert hotels and dorms to hospitals.
[49:38.000 --> 49:56.000]  In the mid COVID-19 pandemic, Trump has directed major industries to produce more respirators and things like that and a mask in 95 mask. But you saw the mayor and also the governor of New Yorkers saying Trump's not lifting a finger. They're just lying to the public.
[49:56.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's not about defending Trump and I find it very disconcerting that the attorney general bill bar is trying to push this through.
[50:04.000 --> 50:12.000]  It's been going on for a long time with the Patriot Act and the rest of it. And this is all a giant power grab. The big banks want to get rid of cash, track everything you do. The total surveillance period.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  They have apps coming out to track where you are and make sure you social distance. China's the model.
[50:17.000 --> 50:27.000]  But the scariest thing so far is not just Rachel Maddow. It's all over the news. The Atlantic Monthly put it out. That's the establishment mouthpiece of the left.
[50:27.000 --> 50:37.000]  They said we want no one to cover Trump's press conferences. He's not authorized to talk about medical issues. This is the cult of the FDA and all of it saying who can talk.
[50:37.000 --> 50:50.000]  They're saying he shouldn't say chloroquine in European studies. The government says that. It's really helping. It drives zinc into the cells. They're saying, oh fact check, he's wrong. It's not good. It's bad. It's not FDA approved.
[50:50.000 --> 51:00.000]  You can't say this drug might help because the FDA hasn't approved. Now the president can't say. And now doctors are coming out saying take zinc.
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  And I've seen articles saying, don't you say that? Don't you give them hope? There is no hope.
[51:06.000 --> 51:24.000]  Really, just type in zinc. Antiviral. And you'll just get hundreds of Harvard and Yale and John Hopkins and the Tokyo University and Cambridge. It's ridiculous. Zinc's amazing. And it's cheap.
[51:24.000 --> 51:33.000]  But they won't tell you that. And now the president's the bad guy. We'll talk to Norm Patis about this here for a few segments then.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  Robert Barnes is joining us. He was on fire during the special transmission. The law of stations didn't pick up because it was unannounced.
[51:39.000 --> 51:48.000]  He'll be with us coming up as well. But Rachel Maddow calls on networks to censor President Trump's coronavirus briefings as his approval climbs.
[51:48.000 --> 51:57.000]  The president shouldn't be heard from with a group of doctors behind him. He isn't allowed to. Have the FDA sanction him.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  Man, the bureaucracy is really too big for its britches. Here she is.
[52:03.000 --> 52:16.000]  I feel like we should inoculate ourselves against the harmful impact of these ongoing false promises and false statements by the president by recognizing that when he is talking about the coronavirus epidemic, more often than not, he is lying.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  Even when he's talking about what he has done or what he will do, he is consistently lying.
[52:21.000 --> 52:31.000]  Let me pause, please. Back in 10 seconds. Like about how he is a Russian agent. Rand Paul is a Russian agent. Alex Jones is a Russian agent. Remember all that, Maddow?
[52:31.000 --> 52:45.000]  And we've got the documents. He's a Russian agent. Well, you're a globalist agent. That's proven. You're the liar. But we elected him. You aren't the one that silences him because you say he's a liar. Here is Maddow.
[52:45.000 --> 52:57.000]  He is talking about the coronavirus epidemic more often than not. He is lying. Even when he's talking about what he has done or what he will do, he is consistently lying and giving you happy talk that is stuff that the federal government...
[52:57.000 --> 53:09.000]  Pause again. Tell us the lies. Show them to us. Oh, you never do that. You just show big packages of gumballs. Every one of these gumballs is a lie, like we're three years old.
[53:09.000 --> 53:18.000]  He's happy talking, saying we've always gone through this. We're going to be tough. The only fear we have is fear itself. Let's not crash the stock market. Let's make it through this together.
[53:18.000 --> 53:29.000]  And you don't want that because you want to crash the market to get rid of the recovery because you're a globalist agent. You chicken-necked witch. You pesed a Spencer. Let's go back to him. Here it is.
[53:29.000 --> 53:45.000]  This government isn't actually doing. And it's making people around the country count on the fact that the federal government is doing that stuff when they're not. I mean, there may be other people in the federal government who are saying things that are true, but these daily briefings from the White House are a litany of things from the president.
[53:45.000 --> 53:55.000]  That would be awesome if they were true, if they were happening, but they're not. And so the sooner we come to terms with that, I think the better for all of us.
[53:55.000 --> 54:06.000]  If it were up to me and it's not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV. Not out of spite, but because it's misinformation.
[54:06.000 --> 54:18.000]  If the president does end up saying anything true, you can run it as tape. But if he keeps lying like he has been every day on stuff this important, we should, all of us, should stop broadcasting it. Honestly, it's going to cost lives.
[54:18.000 --> 54:28.000]  Well, that PES dispenser is not a very good actress issue. We're going to go to Norm Patissier just a moment for two segments. Then we've got the other gentlemen joining us.
[54:28.000 --> 54:40.000]  But I want to play one more clip. This is Trump in a briefing on Friday. And this is where an NBC reporter is the same thing. People are panicking. They don't know what to do. We want you to help us freak out and drive the market.
[54:40.000 --> 54:52.000]  Why won't you freak out? They were all dead. That's the talking point. By the same people that have all told you, they hope the economy plunges to get rid of Trump and the populist movement.
[54:52.000 --> 55:04.000]  They're like buzzers circling over us in the desert, hoping we die. The Oasis is realizing they're all frauds and scammers and exposing them and never even supporting them or listening to them in any way.
[55:04.000 --> 55:11.000]  Here is the reporter being stood up to by Trumple.
[55:11.000 --> 55:21.000]  What do you say to Americans who are scared, though? I guess nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions, as you witness, who are scared right now.
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?
[55:25.000 --> 55:35.000]  I say that you're a terrible reporter. That's what I say. I think it's a very nasty question. And I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people.
[55:35.000 --> 55:44.000]  The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope. And you're doing sensationalism and the same with NBC and Comcast.
[55:44.000 --> 55:52.000]  I don't call it Comcast. I call it Comcast. Let me just ask for whom you work. Let me just say something that's really bad reporting.
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.000]  And you want to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let's see if it works. It might and it might not.
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I've been right a lot. Let's see what happens, John.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm going to go back to the science and the logistics area. The units that were ordered, are they for cleaners?
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  Trump's sending him another press conference. We'll carry the start of it when he gets the meat and potatoes.
[56:14.000 --> 56:23.000]  We'll have that live for you on infowars.com. But that's what this is. The talking point is, Trump, the president, shouldn't be able to talk to the people.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  He should just sit there. Trump's going live right now. We've got Norm Paterson in a moment. Let's go to the president right now as we go out to break.
[56:29.000 --> 56:40.000]  Before we begin, I want to mention we're working very hard long on getting a young group of people out of Peru.
[56:40.000 --> 56:47.000]  We've removed some, and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government.
[56:47.000 --> 56:58.000]  And we're also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up, and we are working on that very well.
[56:58.000 --> 57:05.000]  Again, with the Honduran government's work, and they're working with us, so I appreciate that.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Monitoring all of this, if anything substance comes out of this, any new announcements we'll let you know.
[57:10.000 --> 57:16.000]  But the White House has said they're not going to declare a national lockdown because that's pretty much unconstitutional, and I agree with that.
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  It's up to the states, but by fiat, it's still happening regardless.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  But again, they want total clampdown that'll kill the economy, have a depression, and then he's smart.
[57:27.000 --> 57:34.000]  He's going, OK, you guys just do it. And then they go, no, you do it. You do it. You do it because they know what it's already doing.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Now we've got a $4 trillion bailout package aimed at the people.
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.000]  All right, Norm Pattis straight ahead then. Bob Barnes is going to be popping in as well.
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.000]  I'll take a lot of calls on the weekday show tomorrow, but today we're going to look at all these pushes from the Justice Department for martial law.
[57:49.000 --> 57:56.000]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe.
[57:56.000 --> 58:02.000]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city, and we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper.
[58:02.000 --> 58:08.000]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration,
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  and they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus, X2, and X3,
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.000]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, and of course our high quality silver gargle products,
[58:22.000 --> 58:29.000]  and super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil, and of course iodine as well.
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.000]  There are so many other amazing products at infowarstore.com ready to ship.
[58:35.000 --> 58:42.000]  Our shipping department is getting every order out within 24 hours and shipping it directly to your door.
[58:42.000 --> 58:50.000]  So get prepared and get ready now with things you really need at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[58:50.000 --> 59:00.000]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines.
[59:03.000 --> 59:10.000]  I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives, and I couldn't find hardly anything,
[59:10.000 --> 59:17.000]  except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc, zinc,
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  the element on the periodic table that is essential to life.
[59:22.000 --> 59:29.000]  And that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  by the most prestigious universities, including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and antiviral.
[59:42.000 --> 59:50.000]  Three words, zinc, antiviral. Zinc, antiviral. Do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Trump is doing some cheerleading right now for the economy, saying that once we're over this virus in a few months,
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  that the economy will rock it back into this big $4 trillion stimulus package.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  China is already saying that they've peaked and it's going down and they're back to usual.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  The left says 18 months, America's dead, depression, which they've been cheerleading for.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  What a group of criminals, but they're so arrogant they just do it and think that you'll put up with it.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Warren Pattis is a well-known constitutional and criminal lawyer, and we know they've been pushing the president for martial law.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  He hasn't done that federally yet, but we saw these really frightening articles in Politico and Rolling Stone
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  that the Justice Department and now this part of this has been confirmed, because they've done this before,
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  have been seeking the suspension of habeas corpus.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  I know most listeners understand this, but how big is it saying we'll just arrest you and you'll never be seen again?
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  It's basically transforming the country into Guantanamo Bay where we are all unclassified enemy combatants of the government.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I mean, it's outrageous that habeas corpus can be suspended in times of an invasion or insurrection, but not in response to a so-called national emergency.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Now, whether coronavirus is or is not, it seems to be to me, I understand there's a difference of opinion about that.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  I worry about the precedent that we're setting, though, and here's what I think.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I think the deeper story here is we are in the midst of what I will refer to as an algorithmic coup.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  What do I mean by that? We're turning everything over to big data and we're being habituated to it.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I'm in the northeast, right next to New York City, about 80 miles out of New York, and the hospitals there are frantic.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  There are open discussions in the local media now about the need duration.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Not everyone is going to be able to get the care that they want.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  We're being habituated to being manipulated by data that we don't know.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  What are the standards for determining where and whether a person is going to be treated?
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  If hospital X isn't going to treat a person over 70, should we know so that a 71-year-old can go to hospital Y if it may treat it?
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Stop right there. I want you to reintroduce this. This is powerful. Algorithmic tyranny, algorithmic martial law,
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  where the globalist and the think tanks and the bioethics board program the computer, and then we're told,
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  oh, and you know, even the courts now, it's all turned over to big data, turned over to however they extrapolate it.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  It's the new ruling class.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  It truly is because we don't know. The algorithms are proprietary or they're secret.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  We can't know because they'll panic us, but yet they decide our fate.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And these are really just the same sort of phenomena as the social credit score in China.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  So let's suppose Alex, your sources are right and the supply chains are deteriorating, and only so much flower arrives in a community.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Is it going to be first come, first serve, or are you going to get it depending on who you are?
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  In our hospital emergency rooms to date, it has been first come, first serve.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  A rationing regime says no, and now we're presented with the very real possibility that a person's care might be stopped
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  because somebody more deserving, more worthy walks in.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Somebody has to make that determination about worthiness and dessert.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And that's what a rationing scheme does.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Will they pass it off on big data and say, you know, we're going to do a calculation about a person's social utility
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  to determine whether they get access to care?
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Well, then the next step is access to food.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  And in a situation of scarcity, well, I guess somebody has to decide.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And then if you're going to do that, somebody has to impose the rule, because if you end up on the short end of the distribution stick,
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  you may have something to say about it, and thus, martial law.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  So you're talking about like death panels or martial law for the elderly or the infirm.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  And this is what Bill Gates, the globalist, big tech, say they're doing.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  This is what Davos five years ago said, we're setting up a worldwide technocracy where unelected bureaucrats program the planet.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I worry about that.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  You know, we've talked before on your show, Shoshana Zuboff, stage of surveillance capitalism.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  You know, I don't know what caused the virus.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  I know you have sources that tell you it's man-made and so forth.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  I'm not going to take a position on that.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  That's beyond my pay grade skill.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  But I know that there is something that we're calling an emergency now, and there are a number of people who are sick
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  and a number of people who are dying and who will die.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  I don't know whether we need to shut down the entire economy over that.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  You know, I've been looking carefully at the experience of Philadelphia and St. Louis with respect to the 1918 pandemic, the Spanish flu.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Philadelphia didn't do anything and its death rate spiked.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  But thereafter, there was almost total immunity among its population.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  In other words, the incidence of disease after 1918 approached zero.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  St. Louis.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Stay there.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Let's come back and start over with this because you're really a guy that gets into the numbers.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And that's true.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Now we're told we're going to have vaccines forcibly injected, digital tattoos to prove we've had the vaccines under the skin.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Yes, implantable, chips sewn into your skin.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  This is all happening.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  That said, people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock. We wish that wasn't sold out.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  They've confused that with the food.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in stock and we are only one day behind in shipping.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on a Wednesday.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  And that's just as of today.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Most days we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order that day in the morning. A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense against what's going on.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to the live Sunday Worldwide Transmission.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  The mayor of New York, the admitted communist who's run the city on the ground.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  Blasio has come out and said Trump has not lifted a finger.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  He refuses to send a military to New York.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  He refuses to send respirators or gloves.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  All of it's a lie.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  I have all the articles, government reports.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  It's like saying Trump didn't wear a red tie at the press conference he's giving right now.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  And the Democrats are everywhere saying ban his press conferences.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Don't let the president talk to you.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  These people are like beyond Kim Jong-un.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  They are unbelievable liars and authoritarians.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  And that's why Trump's approval rating is going straight up.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  These people exacerbated this. They hyped it up and I'm talking to constitutional lawyer,
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  national figure, highly respected Norm Patis right now from Connecticut where it's hysteria-ridden.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And he was just getting into numbers of the Spanish flu.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  He was just getting into numbers of what happened in 1918 and other big events.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  The spike and then straight down.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  And the idea of forced inoculations, the idea that Bill Gates wants a digital chip
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  where it's put as a tattoo into your skin, an invisible tattoo,
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  to prove you've had the shot or to be able to travel.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  This is a big algorithmic coup, as he was saying.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  An algorithmic big tech takeover modeled by the Chinese but really run by the globalist.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  So get back into what you were just saying.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Some stations don't care that last five minutes and recap what you're saying
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  because should we sacrifice the whole economy and the Great Depression,
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  the 7 million star of the university's estimate, for something that might kill 100,000 people
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  and when shutting everything down, they admit we'll just make people get sick over a longer period of time.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Let's talk about this situation. The only fear we have to fear, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, I used to think.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  But now we're just told to run for the hills and if Trump tells us to be confident, he's the bad guy, Norm Patis.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  This is an open discussion that I'm having with any number of people that I talk to around New England right now
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  because everything is shut down.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Lawyers are permitted to go to work but courts are closed. I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Argue with one another and build up by the hour for it.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  But things are shut down. People are bracing either massive layoffs in Connecticut and other places around the country.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  So here's a discussion that people have begun to have.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Philadelphia in 1918, they were warned of the influenza was coming. They did nothing, had large public events.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  There is a large spike in depth and then thereafter, the immunity was developed throughout the city of Philadelphia
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  and there were scarcely any cases for the next year and after so.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  St. Louis did what the country's doing right now. It locked down at social distance and as the first wave of the flu hit, it was great.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Their death rate was probably a third and incident rate was far lower than Philadelphia's.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  The incident rate was probably a third of Philadelphia's. But something odd happened.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Rather than herd immunity being spread throughout the population, the influenza remained a large and discernible presence
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  when it was dead in Philadelphia and it actually peaked a little bit in the second year. It didn't go back to the same level.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  So St. Louis embraced a short-term solution with long-term consequences.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  It flattened the curve but at the cost of keeping the disease alive are longer.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Philadelphia took the hit and went on and it didn't suffer the same sort of consequences.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Open question here, are we destroying the economy for sufficient cause?
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, you know, got in a press conference the other day and said,
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  look, you know, your people are going to be upset once that I've shut everything down.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  If you want to blame somebody, make me accountable. Hold me responsible.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  If all of this saves one life, it's worth it. Really?
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  We're going to crash the economy for one life for 10,000 lives for 100,000 lives.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  You begin to wonder who gains as a result of all of this.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Well, that's my next question. The very same media. I've got like four and five and ten minute clips when I'm trying to play.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  I've played them already. But I've got MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, all of them saying we want to plunge the economy to hurt Trump and the American people.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Two years ago, a year ago, and this year's saying we hope this comes to America and really hurts things and hurts Trump.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  I've got all the clips. I played it last week. What type of villain?
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  If I said that, I would never show my face again. But they just do it and then they don't.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  It's like, where is the culture saying you people are like super villains or something?
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Well, they don't get deep platform for that. Isn't that hate speech? You want to take the elected president?
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  You want to wish harm on other people so that he'd be out of office? Where's the deep platforming effort there?
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  The algorithmic coup is real. I don't know who, you know, benefits in the end.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  I'm not sure ordinary people do. But I think right now the game is on.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  You want to talk about the gates and the digital ID. We've had national debates about national identification cards,
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  let alone something implanted in the body. Now, I'm not sure that that can stand as a matter of law.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  But here's where I'm really worried. Look at the parallel between what we're hearing now and 9-11.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  In 9-11, we worried about a crackdown on civil liberties and there was.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  And then the Fourth Amendment was rolled back and people began to use the following term.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  The Constitution is not a suicide pact. We have to give up some liberty for the sake of security.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  All right, that was Chapter 1. What's Chapter 2? Better give up more liberty for the sake of life.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  At the end, the motto of New Hampshire, live free or die becomes a mockery because we're so scared to death we'll give up anything.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  No, Norman does. Listen, the Democrats, when we had drug-resistant TB, kids coming in, putting school next to our kids,
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  hundreds of thousands of cases, thousands of deaths, all these other horrible diseases, they don't care, they cover that up.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  But now something comes in that's killed a couple hundred people here, 4,000 in China, 4,500 in places like Italy.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  And man, you think it's the other world. Okay, let's say it kills 200,000.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Martial law and total lockdowns, I'm sorry. It will make the curve go longer, but they admit even in documentaries on PBS, doctors admit it probably won't cut the number of dead.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  As the data grows and testing becomes more extensive, you see that about 89% of people who had coronavirus have already recovered.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  But the number everybody wants to talk about is the increase in deaths.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  I'm not sure what the overall mortality rate is. We're told in the flu, but yet we don't really know because we're saying there hasn't been extensive testing.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  We never know how many people really have it. And I was told by, I mean, people always think I work for the CIA.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  I don't work for the CIA and they don't have all the answers either, but it's a huge government agency and other groups that it was here six months ago that probably half the public does have it.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  There's been secret testing and that's why Democrats are telling people, oh, it's going to infect half the public because it already did and it's a low death rate.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Here's what I want to know. Where's Corona Joe Biden been? I mean, you know, the guy looks like the concierge for high-end...
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Oh, by the way, you said this last week, I said it weeks ago. It's now election limbo as coronavirus outbreak upends US primaries, AP, the Hill, Democrats grow nervous.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  They're talking about suspending the election now. And I mean, this is just, and it's the Democrats that pushed, and I'm not just defending Trump.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  If Trump does something wrong on the latter, hey, let's talk about this. What the hell is the Justice Department doing?
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  I went and did research. It's coming out in Congress that they had the approach Congress wanting to be able to secretly arrest and disappear people.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Trump better not endorse this. I don't think he will, but this is scary as hell.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  It's hard to get into a court right now. They're open for so-called emergency proceedings because I don't know anybody who's had one yet.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  You know, my office has been a number of lawyers who are trying to figure out how we're going to...
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Well, that's another thing. The NICS system. I've talked to police officers, retired police officers this weekend from Florida and Texas.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  They can't buy guns right now. The NICS is down because they're saying, well, we can't have people in a group operating phones.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Well, that's essential. So how do you have an emergency court where people gather to make you disappear, but you can't have a court? I mean, this is BS.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Well, it's crazy. In Connecticut, the governor himself, the executive branch, basically extended deadlines and said that even speedy trial claims, constitutional claims for speedy trial are suspended.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  That's not within the prerogative of the executive branch. That's a judicial function. So there are going to be separation of powers.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  So this is the greatest threat ever.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  This is the greatest threat ever.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Do you agree to American freedom? A seismic, so far, capitulation to classic authoritarianism?
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, because we're scared to death and on the calculation of how much liberty we give up for survival, the answer is every single bit of it.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  I'll stay home and have my food delivered to me by drone.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Because every zombie movie begins this way and people are really buying into it.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And what did we produce three months ago, but a little promo about rabid? We've got the president countering DeBlasio's lies as well when we come back.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  And we are also have Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Norm Pattis, thank you so much. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  The talking points are all the same. Everything is choreographed by the Western media and every authoritarian regime on the planet that lusts ever power and control.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Their globalist system has been challenged. Humanity has awoken to them.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  And so they use the manmade virus to create scenes out of a science fiction dystopia novel to scare the population into submission.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  And then they launch their global corporate strike against the Western world and against the average person and the average saver, the average homeowner, the average small business owner.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  That's why the big megacorporations are exempt and they all get to stay open.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  The mom and pops all have to close according to them. It's a corporate strike against we the people.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  It's a corporate strike. The Wuhan virus and the whole operation is a globalist corporate strike against the nation state and individuals.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  It's been the globalist, the chai comms and Democrats that they control that have been pushing for coronavirus hysteria and suspension of basic rights for the last eight weeks.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  And now Governor Newsom has come out publicly and said they're ready to declare martial law.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Well, that's a word game. When you tell 40 million people they can't leave their houses, period, and you scare them under and say that almost 60% of the population will have it in just six weeks.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  You're engaged in psychological warfare and you've already declared martial law about a seven on a one to 10 Richter scale.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Get ready, folks. The Democrats is like the chai comms are setting the bar for martial law, full on secret arrest, FEMA camps, you name it.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  But the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the list goes on and on. They've all declared martial law.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  And said that if you leave your house without authorization, you'll be put in jail for up to six months.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  But they've been releasing by the tens of thousands per country, the hardened criminals, the rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well. Tens of thousands released.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  And now Governor Newsom says he made declare martial law and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses or six months in jail.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  But publicly stated, illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so-called migrants, and of course the homeless are all exempt.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  I'm not kidding. Look it up. Welcome to slavery. They think they own you and now they're about to show you.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Last Sunday, info was exclusively reported from White House sources that Trump was considering an interstate travel ban inside the United States,
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  a form of martial law that's never been implemented in our history.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  Some folks said when it didn't come true that we made it up, what we said was he was considering it.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  And days later, it came out in mainstream news that indeed that was happening.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Well, now we're getting intel that Trump's looking at declaring an actual emergency this Sunday and doing just that.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  But is it sure if it's the right move? And boom, Governor Newsom comes out, says 40 million people can't leave their houses.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  That's martial law and says he may officially declare martial law.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  The globalist, the leftist, the chai comms, the EU, they're all setting the bar for massive martial law or Trump hasn't done his job
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  and they'll blame every death on Trump. This is extremely dangerous time.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  We're covering it live on the radio right now.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  And now that same media says our country and our presence bad and they hope it will bring down the U.S. economy.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  I'm not going to play all those clips again. You've seen them.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  And now DeBlasio says no militaries here, no respirators, no hospitals, days after it all rolls in.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  They're just lying on the Sunday news shows.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  Robert Barnes is a constitutional lawyer, famous national figure, criminal lawyer as well.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And he's been on fire. We did a special live three-hour show yesterday.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  He joined me for like him to lay out, recap somebody said there and get into the latest developments.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  But Barnes, we didn't choreograph this. I haven't talked to you. It's to talk to you yesterday live on air.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  I want your snapshot right now, thinking on your feet.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  What's really behind this? Because it's obviously choreographed, it's scripted.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  You can see the rollout in the eight weeks. You can see them saying we hope this destroys Trump because they talk on national TV
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  like it's their own private show. It pretty much is. The viewership's so low.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  But the MSM, the globalists, the Chai comms are all coordinated against America.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  And Trump's got this balancing act. And I don't like giant stimulus packages.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  But if he doesn't, these are tailored to go to the people mainly.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  I believe Trump, he's done that so far. We're going to go into total depression.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  I know you've laid out the numbers with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan are saying,
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  how would you quantify the moment in history America is right now and all these leftist governors and people
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  setting the bar so low on the Constitution demanding martial law and saying that Trump,
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  while he says, oh, you're doing a great job. Cuomo, Cuomo says he's doing an horrible job.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  The mayor of New York says you haven't lifted a finger that you're not helping us at all.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  You're a liar. And the troops are pouring in the respirators.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  It's all happening there on TV saying the sun isn't yellow.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  What in the hell is going on here in just your deepest level of understanding?
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  Just as a gestalt, what's happening?
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  So I think that the fear is that this actually large parts of this are not planned.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  That's actually more problematic than the degree to which it all has been planned.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  So I think there's an aspect of it that is something that has been on the shelf of a lot of government and
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  status for a long time, which is we, they could use a pandemic to suspend constitutional liberties.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  It's always been a loophole in the system because courts have refused to enforce
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  constitutional rights in the context of biological health, virus, pandemic kind of risks
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  with great degree of disturbing regularity and frequency around the world, not just in the United States.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  So there's no question that they're using it as an opportunity and seizing it as an excuse
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  to exercise extraordinary the government powers against individual civil liberties.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  As I wrote about today, basically the Constitution has been quarantined in large parts of the country.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  You have no First Amendment right to publicly protest.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  You can't even get together in groups of two in some places, groups of five, groups of ten, anywhere,
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  even in your own home in some of these orders that are being issued by cities, counties and states across the country.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Not only that, you don't have a First Amendment right of freedom of religion anymore
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  because you're no longer allowed to go to church.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  You're no longer even to have a church in your home because the old religious statement
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  my mom brought me up on as to why we always had to go to church every Sunday
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  was, thou shalt not forsake the fellowship of thy fellow believers.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Well, now the United States government, not the United States government,
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  people within the United States and particularly states and counties
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  are ordering you to forsake the fellowship of your fellow believers.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  You are not allowed to even go to church or form or associate.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  That's right. We were always told, worry about the federal government.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Now it's Democrat, blue cities and states demanding total martial law
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  and attacking the president and lying about him.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And it's the most effective means of executing it in the United States.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  In the United States, the reason why public health is mostly at a local, county and state level
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  is because they're much closer to the action.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Well, the flip side is also true. The converse is also true.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Their ability to enforce something that is the equivalent of martial law
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  is much more powerful and potent at the local, county and state level.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Though they didn't stop the governor of New York for first calling for the military
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  to be involved daily in the state of New York.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Secondly, for issuing an order that suspended almost all constitutional liberties
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  in the state of New York, his stay home order created that.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And on top of all of that, you know, not only is he blaming things on Trump
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  that really aren't adequate or accurate to blame him on,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  today he said the president should nationalize and the government take over
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  the entire medical supply industry.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  That's a huge section of the country.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Well, I stopped there. They're not going to stop there.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  There's talks now of nationalizing other aspects of the economy of just printing cash.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  There's no question people are in great pain and huge amounts of money need to go out to people.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  The problem is there's no real economy to support it because it's being shut down
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  by the cities, counties, states and by various governments around the world
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  for employing the same strategy.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  And what I think is part of a common pattern or plan in the sense of
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  let's see how much the government can get away with,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  how much power governments can seize anywhere in the world.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  I think a large part of it is being justified.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  And by the way, explain that. Explain that because you're on fire right now.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Zimbabwe, people, the average bum had trillions of dollars, you know,
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  a decade ago when Zimbabwe was peaking in its collapse,
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  but they couldn't go buy a piece of bread with it.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  So we could have all the money in the world if they shut the real economy down.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  That money is worthless.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Exactly. That's what the current belief is amongst many financial elites
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  is that they can print their way out of any problem.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  They learn this, they learn the wrong lessons from 2009.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  So it is like Zimbabwe, or as a friend of mine put it,
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  if you're writing a check could solve a problem
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  without having a real economy to support the writing of that check,
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  the U.S.R. would still exist.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  It doesn't because that can't suffice, and yet that is precisely the solution.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Many of my friends, even on the political right and others,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  the editor of human events, other people really appear to believe this.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  They really think that you can just print your way out of the problem.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  In fact, to give you an example to show people how dangerous it's becoming.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Today, for example, they have the futures trading on the Dow.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Within five minutes, they reach their limit as to how much it's going to crash.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  We are now in a stock market that looks like October 1929.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  If the stock market, the only thing holding them up right now
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  is the Fed infusing absurd amounts of cash.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  The Fed had originally committed to $50 billion a day in what's called the overnight market.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Most people don't know our entire economy is completely dependent
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  upon these overnight markets that trade on Wall Street
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  because almost every company and government in the country
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  is dependent on overnight cash.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Well, what the Fed has done is they have gone in and committed
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  to spend up to $1 trillion every day in that market just to hold it up.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  The talk is of the Fed basically buying up indirectly.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  They loan the money and they get it as collateral,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  but buying up basically and propping up every stock and bond in the country.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  They're talking about spending four times more in 30 days
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  than they did in the entire 2008 and 2009 scandal.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  They're talking about spending as much as the entire national debt is.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  That's the kind of amount they're going to print.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  Now, you look at these stimulus bills that Schumer is talking about.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  They're talking about giving people enough money as if it's their whole paycheck for six months.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Without a real economy, where is that coming from?
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  That's just printing cash.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  In fact, how are they going to do it by issuing debt on Wall Street?
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  But how do they keep that debt manageable?
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  They keep the interest rates low.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And by the way, as you know, Wall Street is now all individually following suit.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  Disney just issued $6 billion Friday of new debt and people instantly bought it up.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  So now this is the beginning of the Weimar race.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  I predict within what, three to five years that finally the meg mega bubble is going to pop.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  They could have had new industry.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  They could have built up industry and they could have hopefully created new bubbles,
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  new industries to keep this from imploding too bad.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  But I think now there's no way down the road that we don't see an absolute collapse.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  This is insane.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  There's only one person who is resisting this at any level who can salvage and save us from this.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  And that's President Trump.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  If Trump reverses course within the next 30 days and puts an end to this,
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  then he can save the country and save the economy and save the world.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  If he does not, remember in the stock market,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  it only took about three months before the damage was irreversible.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Stand there.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Stand there.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  I want to start over when we come back.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Robert Barnes is a smart guy and I'm pretty smart as well.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  I'm going to ask the question and war game it.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Can Trump turn it all around or is the greatest depression imminent?
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Can Trump stop the greatest depression?
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Listen to me very, very carefully.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  I am involved at very high levels with supply chain management
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  and talk to a lot of executives.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  And they are confirming to me that the supply chain is starting to break down
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  because they're running out of the raw materials for food
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  and things like high quality supplements that boost you and your family's defense.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to get your orders in now
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  at infowarstore.com for X2, X3, living defense, DNA force plus,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  and all the other great products.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  Many of them are about to sell out in the next few days to the next few weeks.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  Others are going to be running out as well in the next month
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  and we're not sure if we'll ever be able to get them again in the foreseeable future.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  That's how crazy all of this is.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need and fund the info war.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Take action now.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  The noose is tightening around America's neck.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  The supply chains have been cut off.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  We are under globalist attack.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  And President Trump understands this.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  I'm here to tell listeners now is the time to spread the word while we're still on air
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  at infowars.com forward slash shell and band on video
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  on local radio stations and TV stations your area.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  And now is the time for modern Paul Revere's to also protect themselves
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  and their families by getting high quality,
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  nutraceutical products that boost your overall defense of your health.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  Like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  We also have DNA force plus back in stock.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  We also have X2 and X3 that are so important and powerful.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Research it for yourself and a lot of other great products that in the future
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  we may not be able to get from the suppliers,
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  but we do have them in stock right now.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  Check out infowarstore.com and get ready and fund the info war at the same time.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Good luck and God bless you all.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  So far in invaders and the homeless are all exempt from the martial law
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  that they've already implemented.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  They just haven't publicly put that name on it yet except for the California tyrant Newsom.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  He's come out and said he may declare it.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  And if he catches you outside your house, you're going to prison
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  because if you're not a hardened criminal, you are not allied with him.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  If you're a good hard working American, he's here to show you he's your master
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  and use this man made virus to destroy your freedom forever.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the list goes on and on.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  They've all declared martial law and said that if you leave your house without authorization,
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  you'll be put in jail for up to six months.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  But they've been releasing by the tens of thousands per country the hardened criminals,
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  the rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blues cities here as well.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  Tens of thousands released.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  And now Governor Newsom says he made declare martial law
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  or six months in jail.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  But publicly stated illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so-called migrants
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  and of course the homeless are all exempt.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  I'm not getting.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Look it up.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Welcome to slavery.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  They think they own you and now they're about to show you.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host here during this unfolding 1984 situation.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  Robert Barnes is a really good lawyer, but he's also really smart when it comes to politics in the world.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  He's very informed.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  I've done a lot of research.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  I know what somebody's informed.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  I respect his opinion.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  I wanted to ask him, because you heard me in the last segment of Alex Jones here back live,
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  just tuned in.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Can Trump turn it around?
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  I asked, can we avert a Weimar Republic or a Zimbabwe-style devaluation?
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  With them, damn do you do, damn do they don't.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  Doesn't make a stimulate.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Things implode.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  It's already a big bubble.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  If you do stimulate though, then it just gets insane.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  It just kicks the can down the road.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  It makes it even worse in some ways.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  But who did this?
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  The deep state.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  The Democrats.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  I'm not going to play the clips.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  We played the compilations probably 50 times.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  We played a new one last week.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  It was just new clips of Bill Margo and, yeah, I hope this crushes it.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  The corona is going to get Trump and CNN, MSNBC saying it.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  They're so villainous and so tone deaf.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  But is this a case of careful what you wish for?
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Because they prayed to their father, the devil.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  And I guess now they think they're getting their prayer, but it's not going the way they wanted.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  His approval ratings going up because he's acting like an adult.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  So has Pence.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  The troops they asked for already in New York.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  They're already delivering respirators as if the feds can just snap their fingers and things happen.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  They've been able to so far.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  They're hoping it's so horrible.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  De Blasio is going, it's going to get worse week after week, month after month.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  And he hasn't responded.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  It's his fault.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  Smiling.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Looking like American psycho.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Looking.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Well, he looks like Brian Stelter.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  He looks like, he looks like this guy.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Dr. McCam shot, please.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  I mean, look, remember this guy a few years ago was coming out saying, I'm full of it.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  There's no such thing as pedophiles.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  There's no such things as pedophile rings.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  Dr. McCam shot, please.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  Remember all that?
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  And I said, man, that ours technical guy.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but he sure as hell looks like one.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Got busted in a sting.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Going to a woman he thought had toddlers he could have sex with.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  Well, let me take one look at that guy.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Well, let's take one look at Brian Stelter or the Blasio.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  When he's up there looking totally excited about, and it's going to get worse.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  It's like, what's his name?
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Beto O'Rourke.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  He goes, he goes, go back to me real quick, please.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  He goes for TV viewers.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  He goes, yeah, and a bunch of kids got killed.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  And of course, the arse technical guy, left wing arse technical journalist, Dr. Pizza,
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  nickname.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  They'll call themselves Pizza This, Pizza That.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  The FBI says it's a code word, convicted of pedophile offense, trying to get a woman
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  to bring her babies to them, little girls.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  So, I mean, it's the eyes, folks.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  It's the eyes, Chico.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  The eyes always have it.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Always a little limp look.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting, Barnes.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  We'll go on to the next segment.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  I'm going to be nice now.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Your message to the world, your message to the president, your message on the economy,
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  recap that and what you think the president, as you said, the only person right now that
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  might be able to turn this around.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  The president has to reverse course within 30 days, or we may be sunk.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  And the reason for that, and the basis for that is historical evidence, the nature of
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  our current economy, the financial aspect of it.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Our economy is entirely dependent on confidence and credit, and often overnight confidence
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  and overnight credit in the Wall Street repo and other debt markets.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  And if those collapse, then with it comes capital access and consumer confidence, and
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  with that comes the collapse of the economy itself.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  That was the script for 1929.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  And people need to remember what happened.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Within short order, not only was there a U.S. depression, there was a global depression,
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  and that birth, Nazism, fascism, communism, World War II, the Cold War,
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  and a decade of depression around the world.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  So those people who think you can just turn the engine of the economy back on like you
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  just turn your car engine on, do not understand the scope and scale of what's happening economically.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  In addition to that, the liberties that are being lost or endangered are extraordinary.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Right now, your First Amendment right of political activity is being suspended.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Your First Amendment right, you can't do a public protest.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  You can't do public association for political purposes.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  You can't do religious association for religious purposes.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Your Second Amendment rights are being effectively suspended.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  New Jersey, California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, these states that are imposing
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  shutdown orders are excluding gun shops from those orders.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  So that from being necessary businesses.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  So they're not letting them be exempt.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  What does that mean?
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  It means you can't purchase a gun.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  And while you can't purchase a gun, we're seeing unique levels of release of prisoners.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  There's a judge in Montana talking about releasing prisoners.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Orders out of Philadelphia, New York, California, other places where they're going to start considering,
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  or how already have.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Oh, thousands have been released in LA alone.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  No, yeah.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  They're talking about releasing people from Rikers Island,
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  so the most dangerous people in New York City.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  And they're talking about locking us up if we are outside without our papers and not going to an approved place.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Exactly.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  So while you can't leave and you can't protect yourself by purchasing a gun,
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  the other thing that's happening is they're basically shutting down background check departments.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  So one of the long time concerns was that background checks were just a guise,
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  both for surveillance purposes, but also ultimately to use them as a pretext to deny people access to guns.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  Where you have state governments across the country in different places,
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  effectively shutting down furloughing or laying off or limiting the people who work in the background check department.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  So even in those places that don't have a shutdown order, you still can't go out and get a gun
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  because you can't clear the background check because it's been inescapably delayed
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  and the FBI has played ball with this by saying they won't process a background check
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  where the local government office isn't up and running.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  You have your Fourth Amendment rights being violated.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  They developed technology in Singapore that secretly and silently monitored everyone's movements,
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  who they were talking with, who they're interacting with, and the guise of monitoring the disease.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  There's talk about launching it here in the United States.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  We've been talked about about the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  That's how serious and substantial it is.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  That would be the end of your Fourth Amendment rights.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Absolutely.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  So what does Trump need to do to where they can't say he's not acting enough,
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  even when he does act decisively, they lie and say he isn't.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  I think he needs to go after de Blasio because he's been being nice and saying,
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  you're all doing a great job and people like Cuomo and others are attacking him, lying about him as well.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  I think he needs to say, hey guys, don't be political in this emergency.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  You need to stop it.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  There's three steps that the president can take.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  First, do not do the ban on interstate travel in the 14-day quarantine order
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  that his advisors and many of the people around him are trying to get him to do.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Do not do that.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Do not accelerate the problem.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  Do not pour gasoline on this economic fire that's going to bring arson to our economy.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Second, start to reverse course in terms of the language used and some of the highlighted issues used
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  and use your success.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Say, look, we've looked at the data.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  We did a temporary stall.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  In order to gather the data, we now know we do not face the degree of risk that everybody talked about
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  and we do know the economy will sink and tank if we continue on this path.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  So I'm reversing course, ordering businesses back up and going, ordering the economy back up and going.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  And then third, target all relief towards ordinary families.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  The Fed already has plenty of relief for Wall Street, so you don't need to worry about that.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  Whatever is going to happen there is going to happen there anyway.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  If the Fed can't stop it, no one else can stop it.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Target money to getting real cash into real people's hands because what's happened is their property, their business,
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  their livelihood has been taken from them in contravention of the due process clause and takings clause of the Fifth Amendment
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  and they should be afforded direct remedy and the people that should be taxed for it or have to pay for it ultimately
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  are the Wall Street types and the rest who helped facilitate this in the first place and encouraged it and incentivized it
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  by playing ball with deep state actors and others.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  I was about to say it was Wall Street and Big Tech that all sent their people home on purpose and said this is a depression.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  So a lot of the top players wanted this to crash it, kick Trump out, then buy it all up like Rothschild did in 1815.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  They've often used excuses like this to seize power in terms of those who have deep institutional power.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  And then I think some are just completely incompetent. They misread the situation badly.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  Stay there. We've got to go to break. I want to come back and I'm going to give you the floor or whatever topics you want to get into surrounding this
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  instead of me asking questions. But boy, do I agree with you.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  And I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central with a regular four hour Alex Jones show, David, at 8 a.m. before me.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Please don't forget. Zinc, zinc, zinc, zinc, zinc, zinc, zinc, zinc. It's sold out pretty much everywhere in stores
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  and we happen to have it in our great multi-vitamin, multi-mineral that has the preglonone as well.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  It's for adults and that has the preglonone and it will, it has a big dose of zinc with all the other vitamins and minerals
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  and they all work synergistically together. But zinc is so good to boost your overall defense.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Look it up yourself. There's nothing better out there. But you need to take it before you come in contact with these type of things.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Also, we have Real Red Pill Plus. It has an actual stimulant in it, living defenses back in. It's all 50% off right now
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  when you talk about the Real Red Pill. So take advantage of that. We have Tumor. It's so good for your body as well.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Bodies back in stock, 40% off. And we have the one ounce Super Silver back in stock as well.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  And the Super Silver is coming back in, but not for about a month.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  I made four police state films more than a decade ago, specifically warning of the plan to suspend habeas corpus.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  The right to even have access to a court. The right to not be secretly arrested and secretly disappeared.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  And I wanted a Patriot Act that claimed was for terrorists, was really for the American people.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  Well, now they admit it is. And bipartisanly, the Justice Department is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear Americans whenever they want.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  Under the guise of coronavirus, but they just say during the emergency, it'll be for every other crime you can imagine.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  It's the cherry on top of a nice big fudge sundae called Marshall Law.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Oh, and the sprinkles on it, it's the big, great depression everybody's going to have.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  So folks are all excited that you're getting time off work.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Oh, you're going to get time off from your whole future, your family, your health and forced inoculations and gun confiscation.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives and I couldn't find hardly anything.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  Except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc, zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  And that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities, including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and antiviral.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Three words, zinc, antiviral, zinc, antiviral. Do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the list goes on and on.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  They've all declared martial law and said that if you leave your house without authorization, you'll be put in jail for up to six months.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But they've been releasing, by the tens of thousands per country, the hardened criminals, the rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  And it's the same thing in Democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well, tens of thousands released.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  And now Governor Newsom says he may declare martial law and has already ordered 40 million people in California to stay in their houses or six months in jail.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  But publicly stated, illegal aliens, Islamic invaders, so-called migrants and of course the homeless are all exempt.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  I'm not getting. Look it up. Welcome to slavery. They think they own you and now they're about to show you.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago, the ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  People don't need toilet paper to survive, but people do need high quality water filtration and they need high quality supplementation.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  By products like DNA Force Plus, X2 and X3 bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And of course our high quality silver gargle products and super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  And of course iodine as well.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  There are so many other amazing products at infowarstore.com ready to ship.

[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  All the threats real. You're seeing it.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Shia total panic.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  Global depression.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Let's track the global deaths. Mainland China 3,261. Can't believe a damn thing they say.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  Italy 5,476. Why is that?
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  US 409. Spain 1,756. Germany 93. Iran 1,685. France 674. South Korea 104. Switzerland 85. UK 234. Netherlands 180. Belgium 75.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Austria 9. Norway 7. Sweden 21. It just goes on from there. Australia 7.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  35,000 a year on average died of flu in the United States. About 150 a day on average.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  And again, man made virus. We looked at it. Really weird. The whole thing. All the crazy stuff out of China.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Some of the videos were fake. Two people just laid out and started flopping and stopped.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Come on. You know stage when you see it.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Not saying the virus and killing people, but the way it's been hyped, the way the media seized on it said we hope it brings down Trump.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  I don't think they knew it would drive this approval rating because people would see right through it.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Everybody I talked to, even liberals are now against the Democrats because they saw them hoping this would hurt America.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  They see them fear mongering. They see them acting villainously.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  So I wonder why the unified corporate chiefs that own the media are still telling their reporters to create hysteria.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Do you agree that this is backfiring on them, Robert Barnes?
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  I mean, it has to a certain degree, but the problem is that hysteria is mostly working at the local county and state governmental level,
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  and that's putting things into motion that are irreversible.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  So the short term gain the president experiencing now will be long term pain if he doesn't reverse course.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  And if anything, some of the initial polling reaction that the public had and liking the way he was reassuring people of taking action
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  and the manner in which he was taking it won't matter if they don't have any means to pay their bills next week
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  or a month or two months from now, and the economy is completely tanked.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  And so that's, I think, the core issue he has.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  I think he's recognizing that, but I think he's the only one in the White House resisting calls for 14-day quarantines,
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  resisting calls for shutdown of interstate travel, resisting calls to accelerate this shutdown that's happening across the globe.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  For example, what's interesting is, look at the countries that are shutting down and the ones that are not.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  Those countries that do not need a pandemic to seize political power,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  or those countries that are outside of sort of the deep state, five eyes, western world areas of control,
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  none of them, for the most part, are doing anything like what is being done here by the various Democratic governors of shutting down the economy.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  The Singapore didn't shut down the economy. They didn't even shut down their schools. Hong Kong didn't shut down their economy.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  They shut down their protests, thanks to China, but they didn't shut down their economy.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Japan did not shut down their economy. South Korea did not shut down their economy.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  Russia, all they did was shut their borders, for the most part.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  And because they have strict visa controls, they've had almost no pandemic problem at all.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  That's right. They shouldn't impudiate globalism, but instead, the Democrats are still saying, bring more people in, just lock everyone up in their houses.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Border, stay open, but you're locked in your house.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  In only that, here's going to your point. The media has deliberately hyped this to create false information trails.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  So they should have been focused on the rising death count, and whether that rate was declining over time,
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  in terms of whether it was exponential or actually flattening curve, but they haven't.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Instead, they've misled people into saying, jeez, imagine if we had done this.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  We have discovered a disease that has a 10% for mortality rate and a 20% hospitalization rate.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Amongst those who confirm, we have a test for it. We better test everybody.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  And then all of a sudden, they started testing everybody, and it turned out there's almost 100 times more people that had that disease.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  It would create a crazy panic. Well, that describes the flu every single year.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  What they did is they took the confirmed test rate for the virus and said, oh, look, this virus is killing about 3% of the people who have confirmed test for it,
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  and that's higher than the flu rate for those estimated to have the flu, which is an entirely different stat.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  If you looked at confirmed test rates, the flu death rate was much higher than this virus rate, but they didn't report that.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  So they deliberately chose data, and they're also using charts to make charts across countries look the same.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  And the way they do it is they frequently will change the number on the left versus the number on the bottom.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  So if you go to other world meters or other places, you'll see these charts that seem to show everybody with a dramatic increase,
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  exponential increase, but you dig into the data that's not happening.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  If you look here at the chart we have, you'll see this death rate is declining in all kinds of countries.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  In fact, what happens is the death rate starts out as soon as the virus hits a region.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  It starts expanding at triple, it doubles every three days at a minimum in the first like three weeks to four weeks.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  Because like past viruses, this is one of the things people don't know.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  A great article by Peter Hitchens, brother of Christopher Hitchens in Today's Daily Mail,
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  pointing out that the last six major pandemics, the same people they were relying upon in the UK and elsewhere,
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  falsely exaggerated by a large number the amount of deaths that were going to occur.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  They got it wrong in 1997, again in 1999.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  And then, though, when it doesn't happen, they're the saviors for locking everything down,
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  and now every new virus will be like a weather report or a hurricane.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  We'll have to lock down all the time.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  We'll have to take force inoculations.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  We'll have to turn our guns and we'll have to have digital tattoos under the skin.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  I mean, this is the wet dream of Bill Gates and these people.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Exactly. What they figured out is that they, I think there's always been a belief by status
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  that a virus would be far more successful and effective at controlling the domestic population
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  than any other threat could be.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Then crime could be, then terrorism then could be, then anything else could be.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  The economic collapse can be.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  The most effective means is a virus, something you can't see, can't know, can't witness,
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  and say at any moment could kill everybody around you.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  And that's what they were spreading stories.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  There hasn't been a virus that has reached 50% of the population in more than a century.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  So the idea that this virus was going to hit over half of America was going to maintain
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  the same mortality rate as it did amongst the earliest confirmed test rate people,
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  never made sense.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  We've already seen, I was arguing with people two weeks ago, that as we tested more people,
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  the United States death rate would decline.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  That's a static.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  And all of these experts were telling me, no, no, Bob, you don't know biology.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  You don't know science.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  You don't need to know biology to know how stats work or to know how history works.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  By the way, the state wants 18 months shut down when China is already back to business.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  I mean, this is so obviously a deep state move to nationalize the economy or bank arise,
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  fascize the economy where these big mega banks take full control.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  We know who else could seize power here.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Remember in the United States, the way we are able to seize economic dominance was that
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  we used World War One to seize supply chain control over a wide range of products and
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  manufactured goods.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  And we replaced Europe and Asia in that role.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  And we were able to stay dominant for almost 20.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  That's right.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  And now special mega corporations during a total lock now will be the only ones allowed to continue to operate.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  And only that, where are they going to be operating from?
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  They're going to be operating from China.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  So China is not shutting down its factories.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  China is right now ramping up its production capabilities.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Stop.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Your sky's breaking up.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Your sky's breaking up.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  Stop for a moment because this is we're ending the show right now.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  And I want you to repeat that because that's confirmed.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  China hypes it, lets people videotape the freakouts on purpose to create as much fear with a real virus,
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  but maximizes it, gets us all scared, works with a deep state and the media to then attack Trump when they
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  praise Xi Jinping.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  We are told we're shutting down for a year and a half.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Total depression.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  Our lives are over.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  China is right back to normal.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  You can see exactly China and the global is trying to win the trade war.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  They just lost.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  Repeat that.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  Exactly.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  So during World War II, the opportunity presented to the United States was to replace all of western
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Europe and Asia in the supply chain for key manufactured products and goods.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  We are, and in fact, it led to us dominating large parts of that supply chain for the better part of a quarter century.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  China right now is ramping up its productive capability while we in the west are shutting down our productive capability.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  The large parts of the world are still going to need those products and goods.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  And the only way in which to be able to get those products and goods increasingly during the shutdown will be from China.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  So by the, even if we restart our engines a couple of months from now, it may be the case that China has already replaced us
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  and has a de facto monopoly on large parts of supplied goods like they've achieved in other areas over the past two decades.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  And all of a sudden China is like U.S. after World War II in a completely economic dominant position.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  And the globalists that are backing China, the big banks get to restrict cash, promote their surveillance grid, bring in the Chinese social score worldwide.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Gigi pings the hero, America's bad and we lose the trade war and it becomes a Chinese century no matter what we try to do.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Barnes are popping back in with us tomorrow on the weekday show.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Great job.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Absolutely.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Folks, as listeners and viewers, we're in information war, America's fighting for its life.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  We can win, but you've got to take the live feed links at band.videonewswars.com.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  Infowars.com.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  And you've got to send them out on your Twitter, your Facebook.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  You've got to send them out on private text message, email word of mouth.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Tell folks what the local radio stations really plug those hard.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  It's a war.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  People want the truth right now.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  They're ready to understand what's happening, but you have to be the Paul Revere.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  What are you doing?
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  I'm getting chills.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  Nobody will.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And again, the media won't tell you the globalists won't tell you about zinc.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  They won't tell you because they don't want you to know they want this to be as bad as it can.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  Like Bill Maher said, to teach you dirty Americans to bow to the globalists and lick their boots.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  But you're going to get the word out and we're going to defeat their ass.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  Even the globalists, the chai comms and Democrats that they control that have been pushing for coronavirus hysteria and suspension of basic rights for the last eight weeks.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  And now Governor Newsom has come out publicly and said they're ready to declare martial law.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  Well, that's a word game.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  When you tell 40 million people they can't leave their houses, period, and you scare monger and say that almost 60% of the population will have it in just six weeks.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  You're engaged in psychological warfare and you've already declared martial law about a seven on a one to 10 Richter scale.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  Get ready, folks.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  The Democrats just like the chai comms are setting the bar for martial law.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  Full on secret arrest, FEMA cams, you name it.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  But the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  We've all heard of the strike.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  It's a socialist and communist tactic, but sometimes populist movements have used the strike.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  You can have labor strikes.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  You can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a company or a service.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  And many times when the people actually get together and move and master the strike, it has a great effect and some good things have come out of it.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  But now we are seeing a globalist corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  Notice the big globalist corporations and the big box stores, they are all exempt.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  This is more than just martial law training.
[1:59:41.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  This is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they can blame on Trump and they even admit they're doing it.
