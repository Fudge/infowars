[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:30.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.600 --> 00:41.640]  well it's here we are live by the grace of God it is Friday February 10th 2012
[00:41.640 --> 00:45.840]  and we're going to be live here for the next three hours Bob is not with us
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.800]  today we'll be back with us next Friday but we do have Lyndon LaRouche joining us
[00:50.800 --> 00:57.240]  to give us his breakdown on the continuing financial implosion with the
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.920]  world economy by design and what's happening of course with the war drums
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.280]  beating louder and louder in the Middle East and Central Asia there is open
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.200]  talk now of basically having a war with Pakistan and expanding drone attacks
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.800]  inside that country the Washington Times and others are reporting there's open
[01:17.800 --> 01:25.000]  talk as you know and troops and hardware ships aircraft massing around Iran
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.360]  proxy wars using known al Qaeda groups are launching attacks in Syria they've
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.760]  taken over Libya and they're now launching attacks inside Iran and it's in
[01:38.760 --> 01:46.560]  Associated Press NBC Washington Post they're going Israel is running al Qaeda
[01:46.560 --> 01:53.760]  groups in Iran Israel is running al Qaeda groups in Syria and they're
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.160]  admitting it's al Qaeda but something strange is happening you never hear the
[02:00.160 --> 02:06.080]  United States or NATO are involved or England they're all involved so you're
[02:06.080 --> 02:12.400]  seeing this stand back position in rhetoric from the United States from
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.120]  England from NATO from France and from some of the other Arab states who've
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.560]  all got commandos and assets involved on record to just say Israel's doing and
[02:22.560 --> 02:30.800]  that's part of a wider double game but it is certainly bizarre that the globalists
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.720]  are this reckless but they don't think like we do and they know that because
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.960]  they're in control of the governments no matter how big the crisis gets they
[02:39.960 --> 02:44.400]  believe they can continue to pose as the saviors and manipulate the public to the
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.440]  controlled media to give them more power to give up more of our liberties as
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.000]  these crises deepen it's like the six global megabanks openly setting up the
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.320]  derivatives fraud putting their people in government over the last few decades
[02:59.320 --> 03:06.880]  buying up most of our society our infrastructure from media to military
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.680]  from energy to raw materials and farming as the Ponzi scheme expanded and now as
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.760]  it implodes holding everyone hostage saying give us unlimited funds or
[03:16.760 --> 03:22.720]  everything will melt down and in the very groups that engineered the fraud the
[03:22.720 --> 03:30.880]  authors of our of our pain the authors of our current predicament our dire
[03:30.880 --> 03:38.320]  straights posed as our saviors and the talking-head teleprompter reader painted
[03:38.320 --> 03:48.760]  tarts and others sit up there on television and go along with the
[03:48.760 --> 03:56.520]  absurdity that is our modern culture now I'm going to go to break and again we do
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.640]  have Linda LaRouche joining us I'm gonna have Derek Bros popping in who's
[04:00.640 --> 04:05.880]  within the Fed in Houston I've met him and they were just having a little

[04:10.800 --> 04:14.480]  on them and stuff and it fits into all this other crazy video and the cops say
[04:14.480 --> 04:18.480]  they say hey we've got freedom Constitution and they said your freedom
[04:18.480 --> 04:26.240]  ends now and are like cock the shotgun and get off on it just because people are
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.360]  yelling at him and saying we have freedom let me tell you folks this is a
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.560]  kind of thing that's going to lead to civil war all it's going to take is an
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.400]  event like this with the police attacking some type of patriot or liberty
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.720]  event it's not going to be like Waco next time when you guys are burning down a
[04:43.720 --> 04:48.400]  church with some kids you need to understand I'm trying to really diffuse

[08:31.200 --> 08:35.920]  world former CIA director under Reagan said that and it's certainly true today
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.080]  as it was then and he has predicted much of what's happening in our society
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.360]  doesn't mean I agree with all of his solutions a little bit of a centralized
[08:45.360 --> 08:53.000]  government-centered system but I do agree with his overall analysis of the
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.280]  problem so Lyndon LaRouche will be joining us coming up to talk about the
[08:57.280 --> 09:04.600]  world crisis that's deepening in the third hour today now I do want to take a
[09:04.600 --> 09:08.760]  lot of calls today and so I'm going to give the number out now and you're
[09:08.760 --> 09:14.840]  welcome to call in about any subject you wish toll free number to join us is
[09:14.840 --> 09:25.640]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 now if you go to info wars.com there's
[09:25.640 --> 09:29.400]  an article that I'm going to read much of in the second hour today but I want to
[09:29.400 --> 09:34.720]  direct your attention to it right now the state has declared war on the
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.080]  American people is the headline says US citizens are now the primary target of
[09:40.080 --> 09:48.000]  the war on terror by Paul Joseph Watson and I also contributed to the report with
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.280]  the announcement that 30,000 drones are expected to fill American skies the US
[09:52.280 --> 09:55.160]  government has officially declared war on the American people turning to
[09:55.160 --> 10:00.560]  technology normally used to hunt down insurgents abroad as the whole arsenal
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.000]  on the war on terror is refocused domestically it was always designed for
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.200]  that and we have the FBI training manuals we have the New York Times
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.360]  reporting on Boy Scouts training to spy on their parents I mean this is this is
[10:13.360 --> 10:18.600]  this is you know how to be honorable now telescreens going up saying trust no
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.440]  one but big brother TSA chatting up checkpoints on highways it's all happening
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.640]  and this report goes over that fact and this is the most important thing I can
[10:30.640 --> 10:38.520]  say because it's on record and it's a fact globalist outside special interest
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.600]  have come in just like a foreign government and paid off politicians
[10:44.600 --> 10:50.040]  paid off bureaucrats put their people into power run their politicians and
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.920]  have taken over almost the entire country now they're demonizing anybody in
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.480]  government or anybody in law enforcement by the military who is aware of basic
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.880]  facts and not some mindless American Idol viewer or sports fan who only cares
[11:06.880 --> 11:12.280]  about sports and we bash sports a lot here not because sports are bad but
[11:12.280 --> 11:16.440]  because we notice that most people who are totally uninformed and don't care
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.080]  about liberty and support tyranny will tell you I'm a sports fan I don't care
[11:21.080 --> 11:28.280]  about politics this isn't politics this is your life this is the world this is
[11:28.280 --> 11:35.000]  having a population worldwide that isn't engaged and isn't informed being
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  dominated and usurped by special interest guys I know you printed it for me
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  yesterday I never got to it will you repull me that Cicero quote I want to
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.640]  read that today because it is it is so central this it's a Cicero quote on the
[11:50.640 --> 11:57.000]  trader is the plague so good that was last night's nightly news quote as well
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.920]  sure put a full screen up and I will read it to the radio listeners and
[12:01.920 --> 12:09.760]  obviously prisonplanet.tv viewers can read it for themselves on the screen but
[12:09.760 --> 12:17.680]  we are at the big crossroads in fact we're leaving the crossroads soon the
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.080]  future of our society is being decided right now and the system knows you're
[12:23.080 --> 12:27.880]  waking up they know the people are getting upset and that's why they're
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.960]  dispensing with any pretense of freedom and going yeah we're gonna start
[12:31.960 --> 12:35.560]  censoring the web yeah the troops are on the streets for the American people
[12:35.560 --> 12:41.600]  yeah we'll arrest you if we want the Washington Post has an article about a
[12:41.600 --> 12:49.080]  CIA torture base in North Carolina with the double barbed wire and the torture
[12:49.080 --> 12:55.280]  base and the and the aircraft and the fact that US citizens are picked up and
[12:55.280 --> 12:58.880]  taken to it there's your FEMA camp right there
[12:58.880 --> 13:05.200]  Washington Post see but it still doesn't exist and I'm bad to talk about it
[13:05.200 --> 13:11.080]  because I say it's wrong just like no exaggeration if you type into a search
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.120]  engine like Google and click news and type in world government in the news
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.840]  section every day there's around some days there's thousands but but most days
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.440]  there's a hundred or more mainstream articles calling for global government
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.240]  and global taxes and there's also articles side by side with the word
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.760]  global government attacking yours truly saying I'm insane and you know what I
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.200]  guess I am insane because I get angry about my liberty being destroyed about
[13:43.200 --> 13:48.160]  dungeons being set up about open criminality the police being trained to
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.680]  trample my rights I know danger when I see it I just got chills just got chills
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.920]  again you get chills when you're at the edge of a cliff you get chills when you
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.280]  see a car run a red light and hit somebody in front of you I've seen
[14:02.280 --> 14:08.840]  that you get chills when you're seeing something super dangerous you've ever
[14:08.840 --> 14:15.840]  been out in the woods walking by yourself back towards the farm you walked
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.560]  a little too far the moon's coming up it's gotten dark you're a mile away from
[14:22.560 --> 14:32.160]  home you're a mile away from grandma's house and you hear 20 30 coyotes howling
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.520]  and barking and getting all fired up for the night's hunt and even though you've
[14:37.520 --> 14:53.840]  got a 308 bolt-action Remington 700 you still are scared as old instincts not
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.920]  even scared you're awake you feel that tingle
[14:58.920 --> 15:06.720]  where you're walking through the woods in the early morning and a mountain lion
[15:06.720 --> 15:14.320]  about 60 yards away just runs like a ghost in between some brush and you see
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.560]  that big old mountain lion and even tell the deer hunters when you get back
[15:19.560 --> 15:23.800]  later that you saw it or we sound like somebody telling fish stories because
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.840]  you only saw it for two seconds saw it look at you by the time your eyes
[15:27.840 --> 15:34.160]  focused that mountain lion was looking right at you see that's why you get
[15:34.160 --> 15:40.840]  those chills it's called basic instinct got CBS news and I had a feeling when I
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.840]  saw this last night at drudgereport.com I had a feeling that when I saw this
[15:45.840 --> 15:52.040]  that if I typed in police war room that I would see it all over the country
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.120]  because they always announce it at once and there were a whole bunch of
[15:55.120 --> 15:58.360]  articles around the country where the police are now watching the cameras
[15:58.360 --> 16:04.600]  face scanning license plate reading in a war they're now warriors fighting crime
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.360]  no you're not your warriors collecting revenue to give it to the city that gives
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.000]  it to the city manager who's an operative of the mega banks who takes the
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.040]  money into investments steals all of it and you'll never get your pension fund
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.800]  and I've got articles from all over the world including the US where the police
[16:20.800 --> 16:23.880]  are being told you're not going to be getting your pension fund or you're
[16:23.880 --> 16:31.320]  going to get a tiny bit of it you're being robbed even by the masters that
[16:31.320 --> 16:39.000]  use you to enforce this crime syndicate and because you're under groupthink most
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.320]  of you're gonna go along with it I saw an article out of Europe where I was at
[16:42.320 --> 16:49.520]  Belgium where the firefighters are battling police because they are
[16:49.520 --> 16:53.560]  basically being told that they're gonna have 90% of their pensions taken for
[16:53.560 --> 16:56.880]  austerity because everything must go in the banker bailout to the bankers that
[16:56.880 --> 16:59.960]  created the derivatives and got government to sign on to it but instead of
[16:59.960 --> 17:04.760]  them going to jail and losing their you know five six seven eight ten 20 30 40
[17:04.760 --> 17:08.720]  billion apiece that these criminal bankers have of stolen money no you're
[17:08.720 --> 17:15.680]  not gonna get your pension fund and there's the cops Billy clubbing the
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.760]  firefighters and the cops are gonna lose their money too but the firefighters are
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.120]  heroes they actually go out and do risk their lives and are public servants like
[17:24.120 --> 17:31.240]  police used to be not just revenue generating tax collectors and and want
[17:31.240 --> 17:34.040]  to be tough guys
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.560]  yeah Brussels brought to stand still is protesting firefighters turn their
[17:39.560 --> 17:43.760]  hoses on cops they were protesting last week some cops Billy clubbed them so the
[17:43.760 --> 17:50.000]  firefighters came back with fire engines and blasted them with water cannons
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.800]  and one of the cops gonna do shoot them you idiot police are gonna lose your
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.080]  pension to you morons oh but it has to happen because government's too big I
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.960]  don't even like big government because always whatever you invest in the pension
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.840]  gets stolen like social security any of it the bankers aren't gonna let you have
[18:08.840 --> 18:12.080]  that those of you that have been on social security think it's such a great
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.240]  deal if you put it in a guaranteed investment of three and a half percent
[18:16.240 --> 18:20.200]  a year you would have gotten more than double on average what you get out of
[18:20.200 --> 18:28.760]  social security but you think you're getting a good deal so the point is
[18:28.760 --> 18:34.200]  though that now the money's been stolen and now that you put it in there the
[18:34.200 --> 18:41.400]  point is you shouldn't lose your entire way of life in the economy all to bail
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.280]  out the bankers you know now they're calling people's pensions that they've
[18:45.280 --> 18:51.480]  paid into entitlements and welfare that's a new thing I'm hearing and of
[18:51.480 --> 18:55.640]  course I've got to pay more taxes I got to pay my fair share always more more
[18:55.640 --> 19:01.120]  more as if as if I haven't paid enough there's never enough for the bankers
[19:01.120 --> 19:06.040]  they want to destroy the economy they know over taxation destroys economies
[19:06.040 --> 19:13.240]  they know what they're doing but here it is LAPD watching everyone in a war room
[19:13.240 --> 19:20.080]  against the population and here's the Washington Post ten years later CIA
[19:20.080 --> 19:24.440]  rendition program still divides North Carolina town oh there's some people

[24:43.960 --> 24:47.320]  telescreen saying don't trust your neighbors tsa at the
[24:47.320 --> 24:52.680]  super bowl and local sports events grabbing your your private parts
[24:52.680 --> 24:56.840]  but there's no truth to a police state
[24:56.840 --> 25:03.160]  or a plan to put americans in femacamps
[25:03.160 --> 25:06.360]  but there are secret sites where we grab people and hold them
[25:06.360 --> 25:09.880]  in the u.s and put them on aircraft and fly them out of the country
[25:09.880 --> 25:13.240]  and then aircraft out of this very base crash in mexico
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.400]  full of pure cocaine and diplomatic community i mean that's
[25:17.400 --> 25:22.520]  who the government is at the top and you've got all these naive
[25:22.520 --> 25:28.840]  sheep-like feds you know the fbi has been here before with a
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.840]  subpoena dealing with somebody moronically on the comment section
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.280]  threatening to kill police and giving out their names and home phone numbers
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.480]  not very smart but when they got here they wouldn't tell me why they were
[25:39.480 --> 25:42.840]  here they just had a subpoena for us some ip addresses
[25:42.840 --> 25:46.280]  and so but but the cops were asking me oh what's the or
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.560]  there's an austin cop with them as well what's the uh obama poster on the wall
[25:51.560 --> 25:54.360]  and i go you know who i am they're like yeah we know who you are well i'm a
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.800]  talk show host that's a film they're like oh i'm like oh you're trying to
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.200]  imply i'm doing something wrong so i just bowed up to them and i said
[26:02.200 --> 26:05.480]  you know the government's on record shipping drugs in and congressional
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.640]  hearings and the fbi people are like no we're not
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.160]  i'm like i don't like that the fbi's been calling here asking my
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.960]  office people uh in the last few days about the obama deception
[26:19.960 --> 26:26.520]  and it just went on from there and i'm sitting there talking to them
[26:26.520 --> 26:30.360]  and i'm going over all of the admitted
[26:30.360 --> 26:34.120]  crimes that are going on yeah that's some new new new aircraft that crashed
[26:34.120 --> 26:36.280]  with cocaine guys that you put on screen
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.280]  the the the uh the cia aircraft i'm talking about was 2008
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.600]  it was four tons of it in mexico but i guess that's some new
[26:44.600 --> 26:49.320]  new aircraft but but the point is the reason it matters is if we show some
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.360]  other aircraft that's crashed with cocaine people go look that up
[26:52.360 --> 26:55.960]  and then if it's not the cia aircraft they'll think we were showing that
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.480]  and that it wasn't the uh one i was talking about and then they'll say
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.640]  that i was trying to give them disinfo there it is
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.640]  daily cost cia torture jet wrecks with four tons of cocaine
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.520]  2007 and then there was a roiders report on it as well that's where that comes
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.040]  from okay thank you good job now continuing here
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.120]  i start lecturing them and the guys like i'm getting tired of this
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.080]  and it just and it just goes on and on until i basically
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.880]  after about 30 minutes henpeck them out of the office and follow them out to
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.200]  the car i mean i've not done anything wrong

[33:37.640 --> 33:40.600]  for about 10 minutes then i'm going to your calls for the rest of the hour
[33:40.600 --> 33:43.400]  the entire second hour and much of the third hour
[33:43.400 --> 33:46.680]  lynn larouche coming up today but here it is
[33:46.680 --> 33:51.240]  10 years later cia rendition that's a kidnapping and torture center
[33:51.240 --> 33:55.960]  program still divides north carolina town and describes the hangers and the
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.120]  prison base and the barbed wire and the people being driven in the planes
[34:00.120 --> 34:03.800]  landing and taking off but there's no camps
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.560]  though there's just rex 84 the civilian and mate labor camp program
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.280]  camps we've identified camps i've been to newscast where they put protesters in
[34:12.280 --> 34:17.560]  the fema center i mean i played four clips of newscast talking about
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.720]  people put in fema camps at protest
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.560]  i've had one of my reporters taken to a military base people were being taken
[34:25.560 --> 34:28.520]  off trucks with bags on their heads their crime
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.440]  filming police at the g20 a day after it was over
[34:32.440 --> 34:35.960]  marching on to the university park at eight o'clock at night with people out
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.640]  there eating hamburgers at the park and saying get out of here and everybody's
[34:39.640 --> 34:43.480]  like but it's the university and they attack everyone
[34:43.480 --> 34:49.320]  i mean it's so shameful to watch this type of stuff
[34:49.320 --> 34:52.680]  and then i remember seeing this uh footage a while back and the police
[34:52.680 --> 34:55.080]  defended it but it turned out the man was in a coma
[34:55.080 --> 34:59.800]  a diabetic coma he's not resisting and they're kicking him in the head
[34:59.800 --> 35:03.800]  full power saying stop resisting and the guy's in a coma
[35:03.800 --> 35:07.720]  that happens all the time to retarded children autistic people
[35:07.720 --> 35:11.400]  and then they went ahead and charged him with assaulting them but then their own
[35:11.400 --> 35:15.160]  dash cams came out and so now the city's had to pay
[35:15.160 --> 35:18.600]  hundreds of thousands of dollars
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.160]  who's in diabetic shock
[35:23.400 --> 35:27.640]  but good for nevada actually paying in fact later i'll show you some of that
[35:27.640 --> 35:31.000]  footage or a radio listener just go online but
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.760]  in a lot of cases i've seen cases now in new york and illinois on the news
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.000]  where cops will be at a bar and just beat up the bartender or beat up somebody
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  else sometimes in uniform or cold cock a woman for no reason
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  and then they go we're no building it you're just allowed to
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.560]  well look when there's no justice in the courts it's going to start being
[35:49.560 --> 35:56.520]  justice on the street and uh it's just incredible
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.120]  oh the all the different videos of them cold cocking women and beating people
[36:00.120 --> 36:03.720]  up in bars and being allowed to
[36:03.720 --> 36:10.280]  i mean i mean all this is is thugs who were cowards and who were out of
[36:10.280 --> 36:14.200]  control and who were tough guys you know if you want to beat somebody up go
[36:14.200 --> 36:18.200]  join golden gloves or go if you're young or go join a boxing club
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.200]  or go join a jujitsu club or a crab manga club i mean
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.480]  believe me there's a lot of people in there who want to fight with you
[36:25.480 --> 36:30.360]  oh but it's not some motorist you get to beat up in taser for no reason
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.000]  or some or some old woman it's a it's actually guys that like to fight
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.360]  men yeah yeah and don't play the audio though because it's just so much
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.440]  profanity uh but uh yeah the guy is in a diabetic shock
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.000]  and again there's earlier video too of when
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.640]  he's he's he's in the car and they're kicking him through the window
[36:55.640 --> 36:59.160]  the cop is like karate kicking him through the window in the head
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.320]  i mean what is the point of that well they want to beat somebody up
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.640]  oh six guys on a guy in a coma and going into diabetic shock
[37:07.640 --> 37:10.600]  who went into a coma

[40:29.400 --> 40:32.360]  20 million years old under the Antarctic ice sheet
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.640]  thinking we're going to find new life forms this is like going to their planet
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.240]  this is cool uh so we're going to be uh we're going
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.000]  to be going over that uh i've got uh new news on jant
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.560]  napolitano and what uh what she's up to i've got
[40:47.560 --> 40:53.560]  spying on farms with satellite and drones oh yes how did we know the drones
[40:53.560 --> 40:58.360]  would be used to spy on your farm make sure you don't build that that barn
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.040]  under the new sustainability rules that aren't even really laws
[41:02.040 --> 41:05.960]  oh because the drones and by the way they're just announcing this now i saw
[41:05.960 --> 41:11.640]  articles a decade ago i don't know 2002 or so yeah a decade ago
[41:11.640 --> 41:14.680]  where they've got drones
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.080]  over farms in australia england the united states canada you name it
[41:19.080 --> 41:24.440]  and nsa satellites and department of defense satellites
[41:24.440 --> 41:28.680]  of course they're watching us and there was a big furor in congress
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.480]  these drones and these satellites are for defense only outside the united
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.720]  states but now we have north com
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.440]  and so you pay your tax money to have the drones watching you on your farm
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.280]  what did i tell you a month ago in north dakota where they had the farmers
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.280]  being watched by the air force with the predator drone i told you folks
[41:50.280 --> 41:54.440]  you're the enemy what did lou rockwell say yesterday
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.360]  anybody family religion any group you owe your
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.280]  allegiance to that isn't the disgusting new world order god forsaken government
[42:04.280 --> 42:08.440]  anybody you owe allegiance to is the enemy that's why the hollywood in the
[42:08.440 --> 42:13.160]  culture attacks the family attacks men and women men bash women
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.000]  women bash men i was just doing it because the stereotypes but
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.760]  again people play into these stereotypes so there's truth to it
[42:20.760 --> 42:25.800]  when a man isn't the species a woman isn't the species
[42:25.800 --> 42:30.680]  a man and woman joining are the species and you know i don't like santorum he
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.560]  does what he does for rhetoric but when he gets up there and says
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.280]  you know the family is sacred and important and
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.840]  and your marriage is an important institution and i saw the media
[42:40.840 --> 42:43.640]  was a washington post you know calling him a
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.960]  marriage or like it's a birther or a truther oh he's into that marriage
[42:47.960 --> 42:55.080]  ha ha ha ha ha i mean that's what humanity is
[42:55.400 --> 42:59.960]  and and those of you that don't want to get married great just don't attack us
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.160]  but the system makes it fashionable they say it's fashionable
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.800]  to get rid of the millerites time magazine newsweek new york time seeing
[43:07.800 --> 43:10.680]  in it's fashionable let's get rid of it
[43:10.680 --> 43:14.600]  let's get rid of it they openly say that now and i hear trendies now
[43:14.600 --> 43:16.920]  going oh no that's oh we're doing what's trendy
[43:16.920 --> 43:20.760]  so i talk about trendiness if they said it was trendy to jump off cliffs people
[43:20.760 --> 43:23.560]  would do it i'm telling you if madonna or somebody
[43:23.560 --> 43:29.400]  said jump off cliffs her idiot fans some of them would do it to be trendy
[43:29.400 --> 43:33.400]  what is trendiness oh we've got new styles out this year that's to make you
[43:33.400 --> 43:36.200]  buy a whole new wardrobe and then have people laugh at you if you're wearing
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.720]  the old style wear what you want you want tattoos all over
[43:39.720 --> 43:42.760]  you do it you want to wear a cowboy hat or a fedora
[43:42.760 --> 43:46.520]  do it you want to just wear what's simple and easy black t-shirt
[43:46.520 --> 43:49.560]  do it i don't care how you look or what you do
[43:49.560 --> 43:52.920]  it's the content of your mind but this idea of doing whatever is
[43:52.920 --> 43:55.960]  trendy i see these magazines around austin it says you don't want to be
[43:55.960 --> 44:01.240]  trendy you want to do what's trending and i see these people who aren't even
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.000]  real people they're just into what they supposedly
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.400]  what what outfit they put on whatever the system tells them to be
[44:09.400 --> 44:13.240]  now now i want to go to this footage it's all over the houston chronicle
[44:13.240 --> 44:17.240]  it's all over local radio i saw the fbi in the newspaper saying
[44:17.240 --> 44:21.560]  the police did a great job uh the in the fed
[44:21.560 --> 44:27.240]  local group if you go to info wars dot com you can
[44:27.240 --> 44:33.640]  see the full full write-up
[44:33.640 --> 44:38.280]  is basically uh demonizing demonizing the group and
[44:38.280 --> 44:40.920]  talking about how bad they are it's houston free thinkers that they also
[44:40.920 --> 44:44.680]  are involved in in the fed and they were just having an event
[44:44.680 --> 44:49.800]  on private property and the h pd is now investigating class between officers
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.560]  and partygoers at houston free thinkers event
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.600]  and so the police show up and start grabbing people
[44:56.600 --> 45:00.120]  and and it's just watching this video of the police strutting around
[45:00.120 --> 45:04.360]  and then cocking his shotgun and i like the fact that it doesn't intimidate
[45:04.360 --> 45:07.400]  people when he cocks his shotgun on them they start
[45:07.400 --> 45:11.000]  howling at what cowards they are and see that's the thing
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.480]  americans by and large are not really scared of the system they're just lazy
[45:15.480 --> 45:19.720]  but this type of stuff from the police especially at first amendment events
[45:19.720 --> 45:22.680]  this is the type of stuff that could spark off something really bad
[45:22.680 --> 45:51.640]  let's go ahead and go to that video and audio here it is
[45:52.680 --> 46:03.640]  all right let's go to derrick bros joining us
[46:03.640 --> 46:06.920]  via video skype for this little segment the next and i promise
[46:06.920 --> 46:09.560]  i'm going to your calls for the entire next hour
[46:09.560 --> 46:13.000]  i interspersed with a lot of key news i haven't gotten to yet but i mean derrick
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.840]  you know this compared to cops stomping autistic kids heads for no reason
[46:16.840 --> 46:20.120]  and and and obviously getting off on their beating a homeless man to death and
[46:20.120 --> 46:23.080]  then lying about it and those cops have been charged
[46:23.080 --> 46:26.280]  uh i mean this is people getting out of control
[46:26.280 --> 46:29.480]  and i understand you can get out of control in emotional situations
[46:29.480 --> 46:32.520]  so i'm not even trying to particularly judge them generally
[46:32.520 --> 46:36.760]  but the fact that cocking the shotgun and waving guns around at people
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.520]  is being defended in the local media just shows
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.240]  that the establishment media is going to defend this stuff exactly what happened
[46:45.240 --> 46:48.760]  okay hey alex how you doing um we were having an event here in houston
[46:48.760 --> 46:51.960]  now houston free centers we do events every three weeks we raise money for
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.920]  local charities and this one was just a big free party kind of thanking the
[46:54.920 --> 46:57.960]  community to help us we're having a lot of success out here
[46:57.960 --> 47:02.280]  as you know and so we had we had 20 bands we had a bunch of
[47:02.280 --> 47:05.720]  you know drinks and free food provided by food not bombs houston
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.480]  the police showed up around 1015 i was notified i went around the back side to
[47:09.480 --> 47:13.240]  try to talk to them and like they about 10 officers
[47:13.240 --> 47:17.000]  showed up for a noise complaint supposedly and i tried to work with them
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.200]  myself in the order of the venue the compound which is actually private
[47:20.200 --> 47:24.040]  property that he lived on and owned we were telling them we would shut down the
[47:24.040 --> 47:27.160]  back outside stage and they didn't want to work with us at all so
[47:27.160 --> 47:30.840]  he kind of went back and forth about five to ten minutes and then i saw the cops
[47:30.840 --> 47:33.960]  starting to walk around property around the closet property and i asked the
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.480]  day out of war and about that time one of the other officers asked me if i had an
[47:37.480 --> 47:40.760]  id on me and it's just sort of me exercising my
[47:40.760 --> 47:43.880]  right but i don't carry an id on me i'm not operating a motor vehicle
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.560]  but i told them my birthday my full name and i made sure they heard me say i'm
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.560]  not failing to identify myself and one of the officers asked me to come out to
[47:51.560 --> 47:53.560]  the car and i asked him if i was being detained
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.600]  he said i was not so i told him that i would stay where i was at
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.800]  and at that point he grabbed me by the arm and tried to pull me and i sort of
[47:59.800 --> 48:02.680]  set back and told him that you know what i respect that you know you're an
[48:02.680 --> 48:06.040]  officer of the law you're a human being just like me and you gotta follow the
[48:06.040 --> 48:08.440]  law and here's the deal now they take people to your
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.360]  rendition sites so in the future it's going to get to the point when there's
[48:12.360 --> 48:15.960]  no real law and order in government that you don't have a choice you can't go
[48:15.960 --> 48:19.720]  with them because you could disappear definitely that's kind of what we're
[48:19.720 --> 48:21.560]  trying to avoid i mean we have the NBA this past
[48:21.560 --> 48:25.000]  recently we've done a lot of action and we're very well known by hkd so
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.720]  i don't want to be going with them anywhere if i'm not being investigated
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.480]  and at that point he grabbed me both arms and started pulling me and i turned
[48:31.480 --> 48:34.280]  to the crowd that was there and told them i'm being illegally detained and
[48:34.280 --> 48:37.480]  everybody pulled out their cameras and their cell phones and they took me out
[48:37.480 --> 48:39.880]  to the street and kind of threw me on the back of the hood of the car
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.160]  and that's where one of the videos that you can see where michael jackson the
[48:43.160 --> 48:45.240]  other person he that was involved in this
[48:45.240 --> 48:48.040]  he started filming me we did a quick little interview on while i was on the
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.240]  back side of the cop car and after that our article on
[48:51.240 --> 48:54.360]  he's from freightingers.com and after that they everybody started coming to
[48:54.360 --> 48:57.080]  the streets and people were obviously very upset they know us through the
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.160]  group and they know us from bringing these events on
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.440]  and i was being taken away basically kidnapped all private properties into
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.160]  the public street i wasn't told what was going on
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.800]  and then i guess when the cops realized the situation was escalating they
[49:07.800 --> 49:10.360]  quickly shoved shoved me in the back of the cop car
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.080]  and i was stuffed back there i was never told you know what was going on or
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.520]  what i was being charged with and while i was in the car the officer that put
[49:16.520 --> 49:19.160]  me in there he was trying to get the district attorney to accept felony
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.080]  and telling the riot charges on me um but she wouldn't go for it
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.920]  so i i was just because you politely up front said
[49:26.920 --> 49:29.640]  i don't have my ID on me you have a fifth amendment by the way you don't have to
[49:29.640 --> 49:32.840]  that failure to ID stuff's all been thrown on a court but they don't care
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.760]  uh they still think it's their right to do it you're there they've come to you
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.000]  this is all happening and now he's trying to get you for
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  inciting a riot wanting to show you by putting you in jail
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.240]  and we've got six million people in prison uh and so we are now the new
[49:49.240 --> 49:51.800]  prison economy now when did it get to the point of
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.040]  pulling the shotgun out and you know waving guns around at people
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.160]  so i'm i'm in the back of the cop car while while the cop is sitting there
[49:59.160 --> 50:02.440]  describing to the da that there's a couple hundred people we're all drunk
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.840]  and just not trying to make it sound like a mad mob um michael jackson a good
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.760]  friend of mine is outside of of the car and you know rightfully so people were
[50:10.760 --> 50:13.000]  very upset so they're expressing their first amendment
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.960]  and a lot of people think that that gives the cop justification for what
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.000]  follows but michael is out there telling him this is what a police state looks
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.400]  like this they don't give it they don't you know they don't care about authority
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.000]  or about you they care about authority and at that point one of the officers
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.440]  which you can see in the video walks up behind with michael with his back to the
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.480]  woods officer he grabs him from behind swings him around
[50:31.480 --> 50:34.600]  and if the mother officer is joining and they slam him on the back of the cop car
[50:34.600 --> 50:37.880]  where they slammed him was exactly where i was sitting so i saw him face plant on
[50:37.880 --> 50:40.920]  the window right there yeah let's be clear because of his
[50:40.920 --> 50:45.080]  speech they assaulted him these guys would be at home in north korea
[50:45.080 --> 50:48.440]  and then they pull out the shotguns and stuff to let you know hey
[50:48.440 --> 50:51.080]  and there's also you can hear in the video they say you're freedom ends
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.640]  tonight yep yeah they want to live in a country that
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.280]  doesn't have any liberty they think that's going to be a great place
[50:56.280 --> 51:00.600]  because they can waddle around with shaved heads and giant potbellies
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.400]  hello i'm alex jones myself my family the info wars.com team

[54:41.400 --> 54:46.680]  places in downtown austin and people noise complain and the police come
[54:46.680 --> 54:50.120]  why'd you buy an apartment right above where a bar has been
[54:50.120 --> 54:53.640]  for 60 years but the point is this is a big
[54:53.640 --> 54:57.640]  facility they've had parties there they had a bunch of bands there hundreds of
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.960]  people here come the cops and our guest uh derrick
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.840]  brose was being nice saying look uh you know i've told you who i am
[55:06.840 --> 55:09.800]  i'm just trying to talk to you about working with you and then things
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.680]  escalate and then they start grabbing people and slamming them into things
[55:14.680 --> 55:17.880]  for saying this is what a police state looks like well
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.240]  that is what a police state looks like when you see this big
[55:21.240 --> 55:27.240]  bald obese cop comes stomping over and grabbing him
[55:27.240 --> 55:31.640]  and then slamming him into the car assaulting him like like we're scum
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.960]  because someone dared talk back to you and then that's when things escalate
[55:35.960 --> 55:39.960]  that's what's going to cause the riot is the cops escalating
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.800]  the situation because you're on such power trips and you can't talk to
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.560]  lowly scum citizens who are just here to pay your paycheck
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.480]  now finishing up uh derrick we've gotten to the point of the shotgun
[55:51.480 --> 55:54.920]  there's a lot of videos online of this tell us what happened then and then
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.000]  where it went from that point all right so i'm in the back of cop car like i
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.280]  said they started grabbing michael they slammed him on the back of the car
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.200]  and the same cop and as you can see in the video the same cop that grabbed him
[56:06.200 --> 56:09.640]  initially is also the same cop that turned around and pulled up a shotgun
[56:09.640 --> 56:12.680]  he pulls up a shotgun cocks in the air and you can hear him yell to everybody
[56:12.680 --> 56:15.560]  get back now and i'm in the back of the cop car
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.440]  you know i kind of lost it there i started yelling at the top zone you know
[56:18.440 --> 56:23.000]  you you're accusing us of starting a riot at every step of this uh process
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.440]  they they escalated the situation by grabbing me taking me out of the
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.960]  street by grabbing michael and handcuffing him without a reason telling
[56:29.960 --> 56:32.680]  him they were going to charge him with inciting a riot also and then they
[56:32.680 --> 56:35.160]  told them they were going to charge him with resisting arrest
[56:35.160 --> 56:38.840]  and you know he was never even resisting that he was he wasn't even part of it
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.200]  and then to point out the shotgun every step of the way they made things worse
[56:42.200 --> 56:46.440]  and like you said you can hear the cop tell mica your freedom in tonight
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.320]  so after that i was arrested i um finally when i made the police station they
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.480]  told me that i would be charged with a classy misdemeanor failure till day of
[56:55.480 --> 56:59.000]  lawful order from a police officer but i was never told what that lawful order
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.520]  was and uh so i i just felt guilty to get out i
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.960]  sat 15 hours and got out and since then we started collecting videos and we
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.040]  sent out our press release a couple days ago and
[57:08.040 --> 57:10.520]  all the local media came and interviewed us we were interviewed by every
[57:10.520 --> 57:13.960]  station here in most of the media outlets a couple of them have kind of
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.680]  of course said that a local group of conspiracy theorists were attempting to
[57:18.680 --> 57:22.280]  fight with the police or clash with the police and some people are saying that
[57:22.280 --> 57:26.040]  that we even called the cops on ourselves to create this event so
[57:26.040 --> 57:30.280]  they're doing their best to to malign us and make our groups sound crazy but
[57:30.280 --> 57:33.480]  they do that now they're like they want to get rid of the federal reserve their
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.480]  conspiracy theorist now having a political view
[57:37.480 --> 57:41.160]  outside the establishment brainwashing is a conspiracy theory
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.000]  i've seen it in the news where being groped if you don't like being groped
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.920]  you're a conspiracy theorist so now having an opinion
[57:48.920 --> 57:52.280]  you're not allowed to have it i mean it's just total mind control and yes i
[57:52.280 --> 57:55.640]  did see that in the newspaper and they're like well the conspiracy
[57:55.640 --> 57:59.560]  theorist you know they deserve it good job like i saw some
[57:59.560 --> 58:03.880]  comments in one publication people are like you use a shotgun on that scum
[58:03.880 --> 58:07.720]  they don't believe what they're told by the government i mean wow folks look
[58:07.720 --> 58:11.640]  look what doing what the government has said has done to us it's wrecked the
[58:11.640 --> 58:14.680]  country and it's only going to get worse i'm sorry go ahead

[58:24.200 --> 58:27.720]  morning we were going to do that i was contacted by local media and apparently
[58:27.720 --> 58:31.880]  somebody sent the video into htd so now they're being forced to make a

[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.960]  look up the ratings fox tv their average shows got about 800 000
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.120]  average show in msnbc about 100 000 some of the shows have three million
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.240]  viewers on fox some of the shows have 900 000 on
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.920]  mr madel and others do um but it was just a waste of his time
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.000]  there's all the prestige of ooh a fancy studio
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  and ooh i mean he's a good host but it's just all he had more listeners on xm
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.040]  he has i don't know probably 20 times the listeners
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.040]  when he comes on this radio show but i don't put on big airs
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.280]  oh fox news oh i mean fox news calls me to be a
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.720]  guest on there and i don't even return the phone calls
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.040]  now people like you don't go on fox news no
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.640]  it's not even worth it to get in the car and drive to the satellite uplink
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.800]  and i get calls from japanese iranian tv british tv now
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.920]  i don't even get in the car i don't even care it's just i just don't even have
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.760]  time for it i can shoot a youtube video on my iphone
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:38.360]  in five minutes upload it and it'll have on average 100 000 views
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.120]  more than these shows do oh i go on a fox show at night ooh
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.440]  a million and a half people see me oh somebody on the streets as i saw you on
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.000]  fox it's always some subject that doesn't
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.840]  matter anyways and they're interrupting me the whole
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.600]  time people accused me of interrupting i've
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.200]  actually done a study and tested it on average unless i'm moving quick
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.120]  i let a guest talk for about two minutes before interrupting
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.200]  i'm just not good at going um excuse me um hold on i want to
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.120]  say something you know cutting in gently i go oh i have a point i want to make
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.560]  you know it's the excitement but that's why i have the most listeners because
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.720]  it's unscripted it's real i do stuttering go ah i have a
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.440]  point i want to make that's the fact is it's teleprompter free it's
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.640]  real and people talk on average two
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.840]  minutes sometimes it's longer years sometimes the guest talks for 10 i don't
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.680]  interrupt it's when they start going off in other
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.160]  areas no no it's about what i think's interesting it's areas i want to go into
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.800]  and you can't argue with success but that's a little meme
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.720]  nitpick point is the uh no no fox news are seeing in
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.280]  you're getting interrupted every 35 seconds if you get 35 seconds to talk
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.240]  it's shocking but nobody's like let them talk
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.880]  because it's short attention span theater you'll have the host you'll have
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.600]  another guest on host will talk for a minute
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.760]  you'll talk 30 seconds guest talks 30 seconds host talks 30 seconds you talk
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.440]  30 seconds yes other guest talks 30 seconds host talks
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.560]  a minute they play a clip they go to some other guest
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.320]  go to you for 30 seconds other god 30 seconds you're done
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.840]  you've talked two minutes you've spent three hours
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.200]  30 minutes driving in sitting there for an hour while you wait somebody's trying
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.840]  to put makeup on you and then you start talking to them
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.040]  that's why last time seeing anyone to me on and it was a taped interview i knew
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.720]  they were going to take me for like an hour and try to edit it down
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.560]  so i went in there and just told them i thought they were scum and trash
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.920]  and i never wanted to be on their filthy channel ever again
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:48.520]  and uh videotaped it and posted it on youtube them interviewing me
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.680]  because i don't need you scum and that's why you want to shut the free web

[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.560]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.760]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.000]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.240]  i will give you the news we've talked to him today he says he'll come on
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.680]  next week uh he just got the word and said this is a you know
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.160]  obviously a lot going on right now judge andrew napolitano a great guy a great
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.720]  legal mind a patriot a friend of liberty a guy that's
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.480]  questioned the official story of 9-11 on this show
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.840]  and george soros sent letters george soros's groups sent letters to fox
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.080]  demanding he be fired and i think that probably has something to do with it
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.320]  he also had the number one show on fox business and
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:11.000]  it was tied basically with uh another good guy um
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.200]  lou dobbs and he has been axed from fox business i guess for
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.000]  pointing out that people want liberty and that was the top rated show
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.720]  um 200 000 viewers or so you're like that's nothing tv i thought the whole
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.960]  world watches it no no 200 000 is good on msnbc fox business
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.800]  has never really taken off it's been a big industry uh problem
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.920]  for news core and uh it's really sad that this has happened in
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.680]  napolitano but it's kind of much to do about nothing i guess i'm
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.160]  already talking about it i mean 200 000 listeners judge
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.600]  you're a talented guy do a syndicated radio show
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.880]  i'll guarantee you and i think ted anerson on talked to me about this
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.320]  so the people always spin their wheels with like big outfits
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.760]  well big outfits already have their main host on all their stations
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.360]  you come on genesis people like why would you want to bring competition onto
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.920]  your own network it's not my network i always try to bring people
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:21.560]  on air i always try to build people up i'm looking for other voices
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.760]  it's i'm not about oh i've got to be the king of everything
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.400]  but i think ted ought to offer him a job here genesis has over 1000 affiliates
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.360]  i've got over 100 1000 affiliates now between the
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.040]  gardening shows and the political shows and everything else so
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.040]  people are looking for an alternative a lot of stations are picking us up
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.680]  but again the glitz the glamour the the fancy set
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.120]  oh my gosh fox news 200 000 viewers on a good day
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.040]  and of course ted never bragged about this but it was ted anerson
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.880]  who actually got judge andrew napolitano on the air
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.920]  he was the big thing to push him onto the air
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.320]  and obviously the judge will probably still be an analyst on fox news
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.400]  i hope uh but you know him having his own voice of liberty
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.680]  covering the new world order really affecting change
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.200]  that's not the direction fox news once like i'll just talk about it now
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.560]  then go to your calls briefly here
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.920]  it's on record you can pull this up it's come out in the news that
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.200]  since rupert murdoch the last year went under investigation
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.560]  for spying and hacking and paying off police
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.160]  in england and don't just think it's england the new york post is well known
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.680]  for saying you know came out years ago give me money or i'm gonna write bad
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.720]  stuff about you in the tabloids or give us money we'll write good stuff about
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.880]  you very bizarre and that's rupert murdoch so there's a lot of dirty stuff
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.160]  going on and so yeah they've got fast and furious they
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.240]  can use against the democrats but the democrats in the brits
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.800]  and the labor party over there they can use all the corruption on murdoch
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.720]  and so that's why the word has gone through fox and i've talked to multiple
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.560]  fox insiders and then this has been in the news the last year
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.720]  it's also come out in the news don't bash obama as much
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.760]  don't be so partisan that's part of the deal was getting rid of keith oberman
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.640]  but you notice msnbc isn't following the deal
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.560]  the political establishment has said all this fighting
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.720]  is really getting americans angry we need to deescalate all this and put
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.560]  everybody to sleep but rupert murdoch's got a fine
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.240]  line to walk he needs to co-op libertarian conservatism that's
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.840]  the hottest thing in the world he needs to be able to profit off that he knows
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.800]  that's where the big audience is and so how does he have enough of that to
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.400]  have the audience while at the same time being a big globalist
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:53.000]  continue the party so glenbeck's gone for bashing george soros
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.760]  and i know that soros has got his dossiers on
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.440]  roger ailes murdoch and on uh becky poo they've got an investigative reporters
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.840]  gum shoes you name it digging up stuff that make fbi files look tame
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.400]  and so don't worry the news corps mafia's got all its dossiers as well
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.120]  and it got so dangerous they had meetings and hillary clinton was in the
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.400]  meetings others and part of this has come out again
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.840]  you can search all this and pull it up and they said let's stop this so
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.240]  part of that is throwing judge napolitano overboard
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.960]  and that also sends a message to everybody else
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.040]  toe the line that's why you've got huckabee saying
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.600]  obama's a really good guy i think he's a good christian man who loves america
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.360]  you got bill o'reilly saying you don't talk bad
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.680]  about obama the system is circling the wagons
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.440]  okay and they've had some real fights with each other
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.680]  over the power but they just like mafia will but does the mafia come out and
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.440]  admit they're selling drugs to little kids no they'll fight over the turf
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:04.120]  to sell the drugs but they aren't going to go tell the parents hey we're selling
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.680]  your kids drugs you know when they're 14 so when
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.280]  they're 18 they can be hookers for us
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.360]  you keep the sheep in the dark
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.880]  see this whole corrupt system can't report on itself
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.800]  because then the whole fangle come down so the very worst elements of corruption
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.840]  go to the top because no one can stand in its way
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.600]  and then you get total tyranny total collapse
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:34.840]  and it's here it's here except america has
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.240]  it's more than 200 million guns now well 400 million guns 200 million
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.120]  uh gun owners conservatively and uh it isn't going to be like nazi
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.480]  germany or soviet russia or kameroosh polpot
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.600]  you guys are going to do all the same stuff and have drones and little
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.440]  robots and all this tech junk but you're not once people get mad
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.320]  and just decide to come after you they're not just going to wait at the farm
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.240]  they're not going to just wait in their apartment
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:08.280]  once people start coming after you not waiting in their den
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.800]  all your potbellies all your mustaches all your armor
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.400]  is not going to mean anything and i don't want to have a war
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.080]  with people that work for the system the system doesn't care about you
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.440]  it's going to destroy you i'd rather you wake up choose sides and be with the
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.680]  good military and good police that are awake and know what's going on
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.280]  and some police departments the majority are awake on average i hear about
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.080]  half the police are awake from captains and commanders and
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.880]  police chiefs i talked to on and off the record
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.400]  sheriffs and others but in some departments they say it's about 90
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.040]  percent are ready for war with the american people
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:52.040]  that's like getting in the ring with mike tyson and his prime i mean you're
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.240]  that's like jumping in front of a truck and i'm not here
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.600]  trying to intimidate you you know what i'm telling you's true
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.520]  i mean you want me to really talk about stuff
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:07.480]  you want me to tell you what people can do to you let's say you got all our guns
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.680]  we could take get all the guns we ever wanted with a baseball bat
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.000]  the will to kill people the will to go ape on somebody is where all the powers
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.320]  at tony montana says it there's only one thing in this world that gives orders
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.000]  it's called guts understand that and you keep pushing
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.600]  and your little banker masters are going to sit offshore who are so full of
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.080]  hutzpah and bravada that they make 40 to one bets with people's private pension
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.400]  funds
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.480]  you got a bunch of oily bankers who sit in palaces in switzerland in places
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.080]  trying to march you up against the american people who you think are afraid
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.200]  of you no they're drugged out on fluoride and cheeseburgers
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.200]  and drunk and watching the super bowl but you keep pushing they're not going to
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.240]  be you understand that and then the gloves come off
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.760]  just like the redcoats thought they were going to win you didn't win did you
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.800]  because once the fight starts it's all about the fight
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.320]  once the war starts it's not about a football game anymore
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.080]  then it's about scores to settle then it's about
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.040]  killing then it's about blood it's about death that the nearer civilization
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:17.240]  burns off real fast because the truth is americans are the most violent
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.240]  vicious mixture of people the world's ever seen americans like to kill
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.600]  that's why the new world order came here and took over they knew this was the
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.720]  place to get and you think you're going to turn this
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.560]  war machine against the american people think again we're natural born
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.720]  killers we're gut stomping gun shooting
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.080]  fast car driving macho killers and you think just because you're a bunch of
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.600]  macho american killers that you're going to come in against the american
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.120]  people and not get sure you know what handed to you new
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.880]  world order okay excuse me i don't want this to
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.680]  happen let's go to your calls i'm going to shut up now we're going to break it
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.320]  i'm just going to the calls john and was virginia you're on the air
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:08.200]  hi i don't want to sound petty but uh i'm concerned about uh the nightly news
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.960]  show um i really think that everybody should
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.800]  dress formally um i've seen that uh erin dykes a lot doesn't wear a tie and
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.880]  uh sometimes people are on the show like yourself
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.520]  look like you just came up in from boating at lake travis or something
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.280]  and what you have to say is like very important i think you should dress
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.560]  formally i agree with you that presentation is
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.320]  everything and then i should try to build like a fox studio just because
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.400]  people people fall down and worship it i mean we actually have the audience and
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.320]  i do wear a sports jacket some i i've i've lost so much weight i've got to go
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.240]  buy new clothes i hate going and buying clothes i don't like
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:56.280]  buying things but i need to um i guess i could ask erin to start wearing a tie
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.120]  i agree with you they're neat i mean you know i'm so lax around here i tell
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.000]  the guys when they do the news hey uh you know button your shirt up more and
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.720]  it's like whoa you're telling me what to do but yeah i mean people don't know
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.000]  that in tv news and stuff they're telling them what type of tie to wear
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.040]  the chicks what type of lipstick you know they tell them that look like you're
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.920]  sexually sexually aroused looking at the camera
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.960]  i mean yeah no that's all they do yeah we got the guys that work in tv who work
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:23.320]  here now i mean the whole thing is tell now look at the camera like you want to
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.440]  want to you know like you're about to kiss it and it's all about the chicks
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.720]  looking at the camera like they're in love with you and men sit there i watch
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.080]  them actually looking at the chick like oh she loves me she like you know there's
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.400]  about to be that embrace it's all manipulation so we're teleprompter free
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.040]  but i agree with you i should go out and buy a bunch of nice sports jackets and
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.760]  suits and i guess i'm getting skinny enough to wear a tie
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:48.200]  i mean i got a big neck it's like 19 inches around even i've lost weight
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.240]  so that's another issue when i wear it looks like a football player's neck that's
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.160]  all with the tie but you're right anything else you want to add there uh
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:03.000]  john uh uh just that uh erin type see the new jacket i had tried everything i'd cut
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.680]  back the amount of food i was eating i was lifting weights and jogging but
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.920]  nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace

[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:14.360]  yeah that last caller i've heard of being dressed down but he was dressing us up
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.280]  on air uh no i agree with you i mean it
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.880]  millions of people every weekend up watching uh the news show that subscribers
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.960]  see first and we probably should actually wear ties and stuff in there
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.960]  we've just been beta testing it i mean a lot of nights the show is two hours long
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.040]  i'll assure you we're not voting on lake travis in between doing this radio show
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.880]  in the nightly news it takes us all day to prepare for that a lot of nights were
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.280]  up here till 10 o'clock uh we put a lot of energy into it and it's the
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.320]  information you know people say i shouldn't be
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.280]  self-deprecating in some of the comedy videos
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.840]  i do over three or four months you know we have some fun here too
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.760]  this is about our creative expression as well
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.840]  so i think one reason we are so popular is we are teleprompter free
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:06.040]  and sometimes i'm not wearing a suit and tie and it's not that same stuffy media
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.720]  system so i started thinking during the break maybe he's wrong
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.760]  maybe that caller's wrong maybe we shouldn't wear nice sports jackets and
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.520]  or ties maybe we should do the news naked
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:20.760]  or maybe we should do it in a big big uh easter bunny outfit
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.920]  i'm joking a kebler elf outfit i'm gonna stop right there
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.480]  who knows it's about the information but i agree this the the magnitude of this
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:34.440]  info is so important and and and is so key to
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.680]  everything because the general public does take it even more
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.000]  serious if you're an authoritative outfit people love crowns
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.760]  that's why queens wear them in kings people love uniforms is why the police
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.960]  wear them people just just see that as
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.240]  oh you're you know you're part of a a gang your subconscious mind sees a
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.160]  uniform as that you're part of a larger group
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:04.520]  we could dress up like george washington i mean native americans when they went
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.960]  on the warpath they they they dressed up in certain regalia
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:13.400]  i think a lot of the dressing up too is about getting yourself in a mindset
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.480]  of course i don't even really put makeup on i don't even worry too much about the
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.040]  lighting i you know what you're right we need to
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.360]  worry more about the overall packaging it's just that
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.360]  then i can get so caught up in that that i don't even worry about the
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.160]  information so we're kind of on the other extreme
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.000]  maybe i should ask listeners we can have a poll on info wars
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.920]  do the news in the nude that's a joke folks for the new york times runs an
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.920]  article saying i mean that's for real
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.080]  do the news in a porcupine outfit a santa claus outfit
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.200]  a police officer outfit uh and if we get a female reporter she's wearing
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.000]  nurses outfit uh she's nursing the constitution back
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.680]  to uh you know back to uh you know from its death
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.600]  bed or i can wear a fox news uh outfit
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.640]  you know the the pinstripes suit and the blue and red
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.000]  reptile and i can answer all authoritative and read off a teleprompter
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.760]  i'm alex jones reporting for info wars nightly news
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.320]  and just authoritatively tell you what is the government's good torture is good
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.240]  checkpoints on highways are good giant banker bailouts are good
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.240]  the president is good world government is good but if you don't like it it
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.960]  doesn't exist and you're an extremist and then you know the men all act
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.840]  really confident and authoritative so all the guys watching it feel like
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.040]  they're authoritative because they watch it they all kind of smile back at the
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.160]  guy who's like i'm brit hum i'm really confident
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.000]  you know there's the producer look confident good do a satisfied smile
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.320]  well you know while the guest is talking the uh if they say something that the
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.960]  fox person doesn't like they'll kind of go
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.840]  but if they like it they're like
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:03.080]  hmm which is a satisfied uh look of a total chump fake for a fake nation
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.680]  watching it i mean i i could actually like one night
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.520]  a week do it as establishment news i thought for satire
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.600]  one night a week i could do it like i was a neocon
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.480]  and and then or maybe once a month and then one night a week as a fake liberal
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.960]  who's really a fascistic killer uh selling total evil
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:28.120]  i could do it like a cnn host like a cia guy like uh
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:31.640]  what's that twit's name that aster airs name uh anderson cooper
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.480]  i mean i could sit there and of course have a
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.640]  a little announcement of this is only a dramatization of globalist brainwashing
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.440]  the information here has been twisted and spun
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.800]  to manipulate you and to sell you on the new world order paradigm
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.040]  and then go into the whole news tonight tonight
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.920]  the terror threat america is on the edge check points are being set up
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:01.800]  everywhere only by having extremely well-trained patriotic
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.960]  professionals um do the light pat down and then just show
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.040]  them grabbing somebody and it's light it's reasonable
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.120]  and then cut to news articles we're talking about actual chest x rays to fly
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.640]  by the way we're going to break and i will go to the calls when we come back
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:21.240]  the denver post this is not a joke is reporting that when they don't have
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.720]  women tsa agents now women aren't allowed to fly
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.000]  because as i told you it's not a grope down
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.400]  when you refuse the body scan i've been seeing them do it to everybody
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.440]  now it's body scan for everybody at most airports
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.440]  and grope down and so they said well a man can't grope you
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.480]  and so you can't fly this is actually in the denver post
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:48.280]  they admit it but it gets worse why is it okay to have someone of the same sex
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:52.680]  molest you we're on the march the empires on the
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:30:00.520]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.720]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.160]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.400]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.360]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.240]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:44.360]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.960]  for criticizing obama because in america
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.680]  you don't do that you get punished for free speech
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.760]  because we don't have that uh here america and now judge depolitano
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.840]  he for having the number one show on fox business he's been fired
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:10.360]  or lost his show i don't know if he's still gonna be uh
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:14.040]  i was just talking to him via text
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.560]  i don't know if he's still gonna be uh uh corresponding on there but what's the
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:20.920]  point of that i guess money and i guess he does
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.840]  give some good commentary but this is the system circling the wagons
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.840]  that's why they want to control the resources
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.440]  that's why they want you poor so you can only have free speech
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.600]  if you work for them and say what they want and it's not really free speech
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.000]  speaking of max keiser he's on with us next week
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.160]  financial holocaust looms is germany storms greece and they
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.280]  announce what we told you they do they're announcing total control over the
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.160]  whole country um that's just some of the news i'm
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.240]  going to be getting into and again steve watson has the article fox
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.480]  news access freedom watch the judge and depolitano cutting too close to the
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.200]  bone for the establishment that is the question
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.640]  and if you go over to info wars dot com
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.600]  you can see some of our other top stories there but let's hurry
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.160]  through your calls uh right now let's go to john in texas john you're on the
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:17.560]  ear hello yes sir uh i'm the first john uh
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:20.920]  yes sir all right good to talk to you alex again
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.440]  uh kind of something that i want to talk to you about i don't know where to
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.800]  begin first of all let me say this real quick i i mentioned three the first
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.440]  time i talked to you the only time we talked on the phone
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.960]  that you reminded me of aerosol book three chapter seven
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.040]  uh you also remind me of edgar casey something that i know you will appreciate
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.200]  like i did when i read it he said that destiny or karma
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:45.400]  depends upon what the soul has done about what it became
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:50.440]  about what it has become aware of and when i found the knowledge i found 21
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.800]  years ago i've been on a mission just like you have every sense to help wake
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.080]  people up the first conspiracy i was uh exposed to was a medical
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.080]  conspiracy i'm a wellness consultant now i've been doing this for 21 years now
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.360]  in houston i coached rudi tom johnovich back in
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.880]  2003 when he had bladder cancer and uh i met you when i when you came into
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:14.040]  houston you may remember me oh yeah you're the
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.560]  fellow that does the sports medicine for for athletes
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.440]  that's right and um i had a dog and um but anyway uh
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.880]  when i called you initially i was telling you about how you could bump up
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:30.760]  your spidey sense and and that's really what that's the
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.000]  piece of the puzzle i found a long time ago i found out that we're doing
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.160]  something that destroys our spidey sense and i've been on a mission every
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.880]  sense and i've actually done what no person has ever done in the history of
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.880]  mankind as far as i know i've i've been looking for every piece of the puzzle
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.240]  and and figure out how it relates to everything i've actually created a six
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:55.960]  spot system that has 18 portals and 203 pieces and now i can i've
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.720]  created like a schematic that shows where every piece of the puzzle fits
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.440]  and what i find really interesting because i've been studying everybody
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.480]  who thinks they found the solution to our problems
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:09.560]  for the last 21 years and what i found is very few people really
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.320]  have found the two most important pieces of the puzzle
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.480]  and then a lot of people have found the third most important piece of the puzzle
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.080]  and that's the piece that you have found alex in fact you probably know the third
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.280]  piece of the puzzle better than almost everyone else
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.640]  and the third piece of the puzzle of course is the globalist
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.400]  it's the number one source for piece number two and that's false knowledge
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.840]  and as long as we have false knowledge we cannot learn
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:40.120]  what we need to learn the truth and people don't have open minds so once
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.600]  they have the false knowledge they just stick to that
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.440]  even when you can prove that it's wrong and as for esp six cents
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.200]  women's intuition whatever you want to call it here's discover magazine
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.600]  headline could esp be real and there's just all these studies coming out
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.880]  scientifically proving esp
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.000]  and you made a comment at one time that really
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.680]  perked my ears up because you said that that everybody has those body sense that
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.560]  they got to focus on it well that's only because their body
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.640]  sense is too low it's a lot like it's a lot like
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.600]  having poor vision and you got to squint your eyes to see
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.120]  you're not supposed to have to squint your eyes to see any more than you have
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.080]  to focus on your body sense it should be an automatic
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:25.080]  if your body sense was at the adequate level but we're doing something that
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.840]  destroys our body sense and there's a natural way of bumping it up and that's
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.080]  my mission in life is to help people bump up their
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.840]  body sense and i know you've made some changes lately and you saw
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.960]  some great results but if you would have done what i teach
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.240]  people to do to bump up their body sense you would have seen the same type of
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.120]  results within one month instead of two months
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.280]  but your body sense would have increased by a factor of five or six
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.600]  and if you want to wake everyone else up alex you've got to get them to bump up
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.440]  their body sense that's piece number one well i mean i call that just waking up
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.880]  becoming aware uh people become more aware when
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.640]  they pray when they eat healthier there's a lot of when you get out in nature
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.200]  get away from all the hustle and bustle the globalists throw so much stuff at us
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.760]  so that we just basically stay unconscious and and it's it's complex
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.520]  but it's also simple you want to do a youtube video about this or you want to
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:20.280]  mail me uh your you know your schematic or or you
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.640]  should talk about it and present it now because even if people don't totally
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.760]  agree with it out there it's good to just think about how the world
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.960]  works and think in systems that are outside the box
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  because this new world order system is such a tiny limited
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.880]  spectrum of what's going on god bless you i appreciate your call send us the
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.840]  information it's it was good to meet you down at the
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:47.160]  in the federally uh earlier last year you can uh write to me at po box one nine
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.200]  five four nine austin texas seven eight seven six zero
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.520]  po box one nine five four nine austin texas seven eight seven six zero
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.560]  and i try to go over all the mail everybody reads everything that comes
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.960]  in here i don't get a chance to read everything
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.240]  but but everything does get read and and and looked at
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.920]  and we appreciate all the mail that comes in emails another story i mean we
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.280]  try if something super important send it repeatedly
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.320]  because but then everybody sending stuff repeatedly and it kind of becomes a
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.600]  problem it's crazy
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.520]  i could have like five people on top of the folks that are looking at the
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:26.440]  email trying to go through all of the information
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.400]  i've had famous musicians movie stars when they finally get ahold of a say
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:37.080]  i've been emailing you for two years i had my manager try to get in touch with
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:40.360]  you for six months you were hard to get ahold of
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.520]  and i just can't think of how many lost opportunities of interesting people and
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.880]  folks we could have had on and and and it's not that i don't care about
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.520]  celebrity it's just that i'm so into my own research
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.240]  and when i'm doing that i don't even really realize the power of celebrity
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.760]  consciously i mean i i realize it but i don't even
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.600]  try to follow those leads now or even try to get all the famous people on the
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:07.640]  show every week i get contacted by some famous person
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.160]  or i'm giving their phone number and i don't even
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.360]  tend to call them because then you got to call them and play phone tag and then
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.680]  you get them on and they tell you you're great
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.800]  you tell them they're great and a lot of times they just want you to know that
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.920]  they appreciate what you're doing hey i love everybody
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:27.160]  so there's really no need to even contact me i mean you know i got it
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.280]  i mean i'm just but but the point about celebrities
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.800]  whether they're famous writers or movie stars or sports people
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.920]  is it does give you an idea how many people are awake
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:44.360]  i mean if i was contacted by kurt vonnegut
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:50.600]  and he sent me some artwork he did and said for you alex and then just said
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.200]  well i don't want to come on the show but i want you to know i appreciate what
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.680]  you're doing
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.280]  i mean i read a lot of kurt vonnegut books that's a great mind parents are big
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.000]  fans of him that's really cool but then he's like no i'm too old i'm
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.080]  done i'm i'm giving one more speech and i'll never
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.360]  speak again and he gave a speech at his university
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.320]  and six months later fell hit his head and died
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.960]  it was and i didn't pressure i didn't throw please come on kurt vonnegut please
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.080]  you know come on you know since i moved
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.360]  that isn't even out of the box my kurt vonnegut lithograph
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.760]  of a bird cage open with the birds flown away symbol of freedom it's actually a
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.560]  was used in the french revolution as a symbol of freedom
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.680]  but it means i'm not in the box it means i'm not caged and i'm not bragging
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.560]  about the kurt vonnegut thing uh it's just that
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.840]  that guys if you google alex jones kurt vonnegut
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.280]  kurt vonnegut art it's a prison planet
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.440]  article it was also posted on jones report you can see a scan of the
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.280]  of the lithograph and if you don't know who kurt vonnegut is he wrote
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.920]  a lot of great satire on the police state and on corruption and on governments
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.760]  and on elites and wrote a lot of dystopic science fiction stuff
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.440]  a very very interesting person
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:16.520]  yeah here it is we'll put it up yeah there it is for alex
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:22.680]  and it's kurt vonnegut picture of himself and then signed a signature
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.440]  making the eye and his hair and then there is the
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:33.160]  there is the one-of-a-kind lithograph very cool
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.320]  vonnegut was no stranger to the methods of dictators you fought in world war two
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.600]  was a prisoner of war and then bombed that's what slaughterhouse fives about
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.200]  side issue i said i'd take calls and i'm you know i'm
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:51.560]  digressing linda in texas linda welcome and thank you for holding
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:55.800]  thank you alex for years you've been speaking out against
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.240]  fluoride so about three years ago some of us in austin your hometown
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.680]  started fluoride free austin and we have battled and battled and battled silly
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.480]  counsel the bigger the cities the harder they fall but we want to encourage
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:18.200]  people in little towns lago vista has banned fluoride calgary's done it that
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.880]  big county that tampas in a million people they've
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.400]  they've removed it because the feds are striking back at the state level
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:31.640]  as you know arkansas and now also new jersey have passed laws
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.960]  saying you will drink fluoride by law so before they would just lobby and get
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.160]  cities to buy it and put it in the water for those that don't know and the
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.720]  hundreds of other chemicals that are in it i think it's time to start suing
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.880]  the smiley face mayor and other smiley faces that laugh at the medical doctors
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.200]  and toxicologists and top professors you've brought in to austin i mean
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.080]  they're assaulting us and it'll come out in the court
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.920]  hearing that there's all these other heavy metals and stuff in the toxic
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.840]  waste they call fluoride and then that'll force it all out i mean look
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.520]  that's not even aggressive enough they're assaulting us and force
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.040]  medicating us and every time the scumbag city council
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.400]  laughs at you it makes me want to throw up i've seen it on
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:20.280]  the local cable uh and it's disgusting there they are they are just pigs
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:25.800]  is that cities all over the united states this weekend your listeners can go
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.720]  do a little research go to dr paul paul connet's website
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.560]  fluoride action network go to fluoride free austin
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.040]  go to fluoride free fare banks they just got rid of their fluoride and do a
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.160]  little research and then all the listeners go to your
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.160]  city council call your city council call your water utility office
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:48.920]  and ask them do you put fluoride in our water because this is
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:54.120]  about freedom from being force medicated i hear you and i appreciate
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.080]  your call i do all i cover fluoride every week
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:02.360]  uh you know all i can say is if i went to the city council
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.840]  while they were in recess and walked up to the mayor
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:12.680]  or or other city council people and put a teaspoon
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:21.000]  or even a a thimble full a couple grams of what they put in the water supply
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.160]  in their coffee tea water whatever it was i would be
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:31.480]  arrested and indicted for poisoning them with a
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.800]  i intend to kill with a deadly poison it is listed as one of the most
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.960]  deadly poisons and it gets worse it's not just sodium fluoride
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:48.200]  that a tiny a few grams of pure sodium fluoride will kill an adult human
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.040]  it will kill you that's why they say on the toothpaste don't swallow this
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.520]  i mean it's a joke but on average it's over 200 chemicals as you look at the
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:01.000]  reports even from the epa some of them have as many as 350 plus
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.840]  chemicals lead mercury arsenic but because they call it
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.600]  a medical additive and we contract to buy it
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:14.920]  it's suddenly legal no it's not i saw an article today where the house passes
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:19.640]  a bill making it illegal to insider trade
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.960]  in the congress it's already illegal i've read the laws
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.120]  they're not exempt when they got caught they came out and said we're exempt
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.880]  and the new law they're trying to pass actually opens it up
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.000]  to where they can do a lot of different types of insider trading see when they
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.120]  get caught torturing they say oh we're allowed to torture no it's not it's
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:41.880]  illegal so they try to pass a law saying well now we can torture
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:46.440]  but they sold the bill as anti torture bill that actually allows torture
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.480]  they get caught spying on you without warrants it's illegal oh we're going to
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.200]  pass a bill stopping this the bill actually lets them do it
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:59.000]  these are criminals and they are putting poison in your water
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.800]  and again hypothetically if you or i or anybody else tried to make the
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:10.040]  mayor of wherever you live drank the fluoride they're making us drink
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.680]  we go to jail
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:17.240]  and we don't need to make it illegal there's no law
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.960]  the city going back to the late 40s when they had all this extra toxic waste
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:27.480]  from nuclear weapons production aluminum production and sulfur mining
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.320]  the fertilizer mining industry they cannot put that on the crops because it
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:35.400]  kills them so whatever they have left at the uranium
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.800]  mines because same place they get the fertilizer
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.880]  stuff out of the out of the wine stone they put it in your water i mean
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.960]  who can make this up and and scientists go before the austin
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.080]  council and they sit up there like the giant
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.800]  bags of treasonous maggots that they are
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.960]  and laugh at people because there's because again
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.200]  if one card gets pulled out of the house of cards it all comes down
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:07.480]  if they did admit yeah this is crazy we pay a million plus bucks a year
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.680]  we've got the city contracts to put this in the water
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.960]  in my town in your town
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.800]  and the hoax would just come down
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:25.320]  the giant hoax would just come down i mean i remember about 15 years ago i
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.960]  remember reading this i didn't believe it and then i went and found the
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:33.160]  Pulitzer prize winning book and i went and i dug it up and
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.280]  found it was true that the soviets by the 20s were putting fluoride
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.640]  in the water at the camps to make people docile
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.480]  and then the nazis did it i mean they really did it and at Nuremberg they
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.680]  learned about that and thought this is great for our population
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.880]  did you know the 1968 gun control act senator dodd at the time
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.720]  not the current dodd the previous dodd you can look this up
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.640]  took the nazi gun control act it's actually why my republic the nazis
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.000]  expanded it and just changed a few words and passed that
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.360]  that's how lazy these crooks are and and and and and these crooks
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.040]  shit up there in these city councils and laugh at you like
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:18.360]  like like like like assaulting you is funny
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.720]  and i think people should walk in with toothpaste in their hand and read off
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.000]  the back to the mayor in your town and say it says it's poison right here
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.760]  here's what this toxicologist says increases bone cancer seven times here's
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:34.920]  bbc news here's associated press you know mayor if i tried to put
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.280]  some of this fluoride in your coffee i could be arrested for trying to poison
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.400]  you but you're poisoning us stop assaulting me
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.360]  stop attacking me just because you're wearing a suit

[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:42.440]  at the five after break but this article deals with the total and complete
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:46.360]  militarization of america and the fact that the government is openly
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:49.000]  announcing
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.160]  that it is going to engage in warfare against the america people
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.240]  the headline is the state has declared war on the american people please get it

[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.240]  invasion just like they said Saddam threw babies out of incubators it wasn't
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.640]  true they're saying the same thing about the syrian
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:19.320]  government I'm not saying Assad's a good guy but it's clear war propaganda
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:24.600]  also mortgage settlement is just another stealth bank bailout
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.800]  it's all up there right now at info wars.com
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.000]  now I want to read this quote I mentioned it in the first hour
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.680]  dealing with the fact that it's traders within that are dangerous it's
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:39.720]  it's foreign interest foreign corporations and others
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:45.160]  that come in and infiltrate and take over your government
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:51.080]  that are the threat and roman senator and statesman and historian
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:57.320]  and philosopher marcus sissaro said the trader appears not a trader he speaks
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.800]  in accents familiar to his victims and he wears the face
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:07.480]  and their arguments he appeals to the baseness that lies
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:10.760]  deep in the hearts of all men he infects the body politic
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.920]  so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to fear
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.760]  the trader is the plague and that's not the full quote he talks about in the
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:21.560]  beginning of the quote that an enemy at your gate with a banner
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:26.040]  openly furl is not the enemy it's those within who
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.960]  sneak around and creep around and manipulate they
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.680]  are the threat they are the problem uh the tickets are now more than half

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:57.000]  it doesn't matter how you're dressing so that's number one then i have two ideas
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.440]  for you and one plus if you allow me sure
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.040]  okay first idea is you know how you're looking for a catch how first like
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:08.120]  prostitutes for your uh media thing yeah i think dung beetle media
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:13.160]  sewer stream media trader media yeah okay well it's a combination of two words
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.280]  it's real simple the first word is enemy the second word is media and a
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:21.160]  media in a media enemy media just enemy media
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:25.560]  yeah any media yeah that's it any media yeah
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:30.440]  yeah like like enemy and media enemy media i think it's good i like it
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.400]  all right and the second idea i have for you
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:37.640]  is that maybe we could have a money bomb for a we the people law firm
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.280]  and get somebody like one of your guests i think the thing was that would grip
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.920]  them before the sheriff that's a lawyer and kind of like get our own little
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.680]  constitutional law firm going to help out with the cases that are out there
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:51.640]  i hear you you know there are a lot of great constitutional law firms out
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:54.920]  there it's just actually defending lawsuits or getting into them
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.600]  i mean you know can be hundred thousand dollars or more pursued
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.280]  i mean i know that constitutional lawyer um
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:07.480]  is steward roats and he's uh suing pittsburgh for rob do
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.160]  i mean i defended rob do in court i think it's about five thousand dollars
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:15.000]  i had to get him to drop the case against him it was about five thousand i paid
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.080]  out so i defend my guys when they get arrested

[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:48.120]  year go ahead yeah um i'm a newly awakened individual
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:51.880]  and personally i'd like to go back to bed pull the covers up because it's scary
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:58.360]  out here but um anyways i was wondering i don't i don't
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.760]  know exactly what i'm trying to prepare for what's going to be the depth of it
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:07.160]  or how long so i was wondering if you could give me some ideas as to
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:10.840]  as to what i should you know what i should do to prepare
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.920]  and then i just had a comment about um also
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:20.920]  oh why hasn't anybody tried to bring up charges of treason against president
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.240]  obama for all the list of things that he's done i mean every other president
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.160]  i think bush sneezed and they wanted to put him up on trees and charges and so
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:34.280]  along or impeachment charges i mean so why hasn't anybody tried to
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:37.640]  do that impeach obama for all the things that he's done
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.640]  you know that's a great question um and the answer is the establishment likes
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:44.840]  what he's doing the establishment owns the republican and
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.680]  democratic parties at at the top and they're demonizing
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.200]  good people like ron paul uh and uh bernie sanders who's an independent
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:58.360]  anybody who's independent they go after i mean i've read the case
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:03.800]  lynn larouche uh you know famous uh statesman uh researcher
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:08.360]  they set him up and put him in prison uh on trumped up you know garbage
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.680]  this is what they do whether you're left right libertarian american system
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:19.880]  whatever it is uh all of this stuff is going on
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.520]  uh now chris hedges is the public surprise winner he is suing obama over
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:30.520]  india but as for your very important question
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:35.000]  how will the crises look there's different permutations of it but we're
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.240]  in a global meltdown and the reason all the economies are going down
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.160]  is because of the fiat currency derivative system
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.080]  and so what will the ruling elite do to try to
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.680]  divert people away from what they've done they'll start wars
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.200]  okay so i'm going to answer that question with lynn larouche on the other side

[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:14.120]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.400]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted

[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:38.440]  for us earlier he could speak on all these issues
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.600]  who doesn't need any introduction linda louge obviously everybody knows who he
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:46.520]  is uh if you don't know he is you must have been hiding under a rock
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:50.840]  he is very accurately from my own separate research
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:55.240]  i mean i don't just believe what he says broken down how this global elite is
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:09:01.560]  functioning what their goals are eugenics world population reduction
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:06.200]  post industrial world they want to shut down development
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.640]  as part of a global corporate takeover to consolidate power
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.720]  and they see anyone being informed or independent
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:19.720]  as a threat to them they use poverty just as ancient feudal lords used poverty
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:23.080]  to control their populations you know handbooks were written on this
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:26.920]  in europe they were written on it in england uh the japanese had a similar
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.720]  system to it during their feudal periods this is a system of control
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:36.280]  and now they're announcing 63 billion dollars to militarize the airspace in
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:42.040]  the next five years with 30 000 drones that's associated press
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:45.880]  weaponized drones spy drums watching farmers
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:49.800]  same plan it's a unified global agenda look at europe bbc
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:55.480]  spying on europe's farmers with satellites and drones bbc
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:00.440]  show there's a method of the madness linda louge is accurately 20 years ago
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:03.640]  or more predicted how the meltdown would happen
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.480]  what the derivatives would do that they would precipitate big
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:14.120]  a big wars um out of that but the but the issue is the the angle american
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.760]  establishment that carol quigley and others that work for them
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.560]  you know basically concurs with london louge's analysis
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.640]  they believe they're going to navigate the controlled crisis
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:26.840]  and that they're going to use the implosion to pose as saviors
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.080]  takeover europe have the nation states sign over all their rights to the bankers
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:34.680]  just like they do in third world countries and they're planning it here
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:37.960]  they're now admitting they want to secretly arrest citizens with n d a a
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:42.040]  that they want to censor the web they're firing people like andrew napolitano at
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.000]  fox so he can't talk about the new world order
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  all of this is happening so we can see the globalists are moving with proxy
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.480]  wars all over the middle east with iran linda louge it's all it looks
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.880]  like coming to a head uh and so i want to understand the
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:01.240]  method to their madness i want your breakdown on
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.520]  are things going well for them and what do you predict
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:10.760]  is going to happen next sir well what we're faced with is an intention
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:16.920]  and it's complicated in one sense the upfront danger
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.640]  is the likelihood that in this early period no it could be weeks it could be
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.760]  almost any time the factors that determine
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.440]  whether this happens or not and what time it occurs in
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.120]  but generally i would say the trend right now is it's going to happen
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:36.040]  now you know that the u.s navy has in its submarine fleet
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.640]  enough capability in some nuclear weaponry
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:43.400]  to win a single throw destroy most of this planet
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.240]  the you know the whole idea of nuclear warfare is now
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.720]  it's almost a joke relative to what the potential has become now
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:57.080]  now what this is being steered from london and also from wall street
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:00.520]  well they're pretty much the same thing they represent the same mentality you
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:03.880]  see what they've done to our our economy already
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:07.800]  we have a period right now going into the middle of the
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.080]  spring and summer that if we don't get a new planting
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:15.320]  of the type we need some people are going to start dying from hunger
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.280]  it's that bad look at the whole categories of things we used to manufacture
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.600]  as a leading part of the world's nations we don't have we don't produce it
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:28.920]  anymore we we what we have is we have a gigantic
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:33.320]  population of wall street types who's nothing but parasites they don't
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:36.760]  produce anything they produce promissory
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.560]  notes that can never be redeemed but this system is now coming to an end
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.880]  that is the economic system it is present form and unless we make certain
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.080]  changes which are consistent actually with the intention
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:52.200]  or the formation of this united states constitution
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.280]  unless we go to that kind of direction this world is not going to be a very
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:00.440]  pleasant place to live in very soon now the particular danger is this
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.600]  the center of the problem lies in london it lies in the british empire now some
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.720]  people think that the london represents or the british
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:12.440]  empire represents the people of england or scotland and wales and so on
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:18.600]  it's not the british empire is actually based on a monetary system
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.200]  that is the basic power of the british empire is
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.720]  monetized for example all of africa is controlled
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:29.160]  by the british they control it by administration
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.360]  they control it by mechanisms such as financial mechanisms and things like
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:36.840]  that it's easy to see but what we're headed for
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:41.480]  the big the big number is we've seen that since the
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:47.800]  killing of mormad qaddafi of libya now i say why did they kill him
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:53.320]  here's this guy he's they they defeated him he's he's running away he's leaving
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:57.160]  the country he's no problem to them anymore
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:01.000]  why should they kill him well what they did is they got him in a
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.680]  kind of a ravine-like situation they shot him down
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:09.000]  he was wounded then they came up to him and they killed him
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.360]  so in other words he's a man who has been taken prisoner
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:17.080]  a former leader of a nation he's wounded he's helpless
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:23.160]  he's in their hands and they execute him now the orders for this came from the
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:29.000]  trio of london france and the united states that of president obama
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.080]  they killed him then the explanation came out of france
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:38.440]  and the reasons this happened was the powers that be did not wish to have to
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:43.640]  have obama alive or rather qaddafi alive
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:48.520]  because they argued that if he were alive they'd have to put him on trial
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:52.520]  and if they put him on trial that would interfere with their program
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:56.600]  they intended to go directly from the killing of qaddafi
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.640]  into starting the war with israel launched against
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.680]  iran and against syria now these were not the real targets
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:08.360]  these were targets very real targets and by the way sir as you know
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.760]  hillary made a joke about we came we saw he died
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.840]  uh basically imitating what julia caesar said and she laughed about it
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.120]  so not only are they engaged in barbarous war crimes
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.560]  now they're making jokes about it and to make it worse she's not even a
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:27.320]  military person which just adds to the obscenity
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.520]  it's bad enough to be a warrior in brag about killing somebody
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:37.160]  but to be a a sack of sycophantic globalist filth it's amazing
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:41.320]  well no she take her case and look at it what actually happened
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:47.000]  she was she had a policy of being a restraining influence against obama
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.680]  and she did a fairly good job but what then they came down on her
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:54.680]  now you have to understand that the people around obama threaten assassinations
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.920]  and similar kinds of things she was terrified and you will notice
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:03.480]  that since that terrifying of her which is on the record
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.880]  she changed her personality that doesn't mean she changed herself in her
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:10.920]  character it means she's now submitted to the monster
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.160]  let me stop you it's always so complex when you get on because it's so well
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:17.800]  documented there's a lot between the lines
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.280]  you had a Freudian slip almost twice and it kept saying obama assassinated
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:25.240]  and it's funny you mentioned that because i was going to raise that later but
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:28.840]  didn't know if i should because i was rereading what
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:32.600]  the big jewish-atlanta newspaper editor said
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:36.200]  he said i've met with the massad people you know they are looking at killing
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:39.080]  obama i'm serious about this that they better
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:42.760]  attack iran that was pretty much an open threat
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:45.960]  and that's the word i'm getting is that they could use an assassination of
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:49.400]  obama as some type of false flag to launch a
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:53.320]  wider war and blame it on the iranians well listen this is all
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.800]  part of the pattern but i look at this thing from i look at from the end game
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:01.960]  what's the end game here not one of the details of things that come up on the
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:04.760]  side what we're headed with is something very
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:09.880]  soon it's coming out of london but the united states plays a key role in it
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:13.320]  the united states has the greatest terminal pure power
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:18.440]  for weaponry on this planet a lot of it concentrated in the pacific ocean
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:22.120]  in our submarines we can virtually obliterate
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:27.000]  much of this planet with one shot that is one barrage
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.320]  properly aimed now that's the threat that we're facing
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:36.120]  the timing of that threat comes before the next election inside the united
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:40.280]  states this was intended earlier but it was
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:43.240]  postponed we have people in our joint chiefs of staff
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:47.240]  who said you can't do this you have other people saying you cannot even think
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:51.000]  about this because if you're thinking about a war
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.280]  with the parties that you're indicating which include the british empire and the
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:58.280]  united states under obama working for the british empire
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:02.200]  on this policy you realize that you have the greatest threat to humanity
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:05.800]  imaginable now whether the british do it or not
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:09.240]  under get by controlling obama who controls the
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.240]  submarine fleet ultimately is commander-in-chief of the u.s of forces
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:17.160]  although they do that or not is uncertain my view is the british have two
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.960]  intentions i don't obama is doing what he's doing
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:23.320]  he's not really very intelligent he's a sick man
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:26.040]  but he's he's doing it for this british monarchy
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.040]  who have a whole policy reducing the human population
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.640]  from seven billion people to one billion people in a very
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:37.400]  rapid order and that's where the evil is coming from
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:40.280]  now the threat the british of course are now
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:43.720]  in their policy are threatening to compel
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:50.040]  us forces to be used to obliterate the targeted nations they intend to obliterate
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.960]  and we have in there our naval capability the submarine capability
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:58.040]  a typical typification of what our capability is
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:02.200]  to do that without us without the united states and its forces
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.240]  being complicit with the british the british couldn't do it
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:08.920]  even though they're the inspiration of the policy so
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.040]  our situation is we've had our military
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:15.800]  and other people in other parts of the world recognize what this problem is
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.240]  and know we've got to stop stop the british attack
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:22.920]  we know the only efficient way to stop this and it could stop it
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:27.160]  is to get obama out of office now he's not only impeachable
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:30.200]  because he's violated most of our constitution they could
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:35.560]  he could take a track check but the key thing here
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:40.120]  is that he is clinically insane this man i know i did back in
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:44.920]  april of 2009 michel aroush i apologize for interrupting you let's come right
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:48.920]  back on the other side and continue looking at this
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:53.240]  because uh he's not mincing words here and he's not he's not hyping it
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:56.840]  so many mainline analysts say this could lead to world war three
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:20:00.760]  the russians are sending spit snats and the iranians are sending special forces

[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:15.960]  here in a moment very important to visit a lot of great information
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:19.320]  this is a short little five six minutes segment long segment
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:23.240]  coming up we'll get to some of your calls then but we had a lady who was on hold
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.880]  that i talked to before you came on with a sir and
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:29.480]  she was saying well what's the crisis what should i prepare for
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:33.480]  what could happen you were getting into obama being an insane puppet and i want
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:37.000]  you to finish with that but i mean one of the different scenarios
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  that we could see unfold the buildup to war with iran
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.920]  the iranian and russian troops going into syria
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.880]  hillary beating the drums for war obama this whole thing is escalating and then
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:54.600]  we hear people saying well obama is not wanting enough war he's liberal
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.000]  that sounds like a bunch of you know left cover garbage i mean i mean he's doing
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.520]  everything the big corporations wanting to do
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:07.160]  of course but i think i should be very careful now because even while the facts
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.640]  i will state are all true i've got to think about the
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:16.120]  your listeners for example that i don't absolutely terrorize it
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.680]  a time what exactly what the situation is
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:21.960]  first of all the british are running this operation the british empire the
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:26.200]  british empire is not a kingdom it's an international financial power
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:29.560]  which includes wall street for example your own country
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:35.560]  and that's the power europe gets they want to maintain the imperial tradition
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.040]  of rome which is what the british empire's tradition is adopted later
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:43.800]  now therefore you have to understand the way the british think
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:47.720]  and very few americans understand how the british think they hear how they talk
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:52.360]  they don't understand what's behind that talk at least on the high level
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.560]  there are two options we face right now apart from the obvious option we desire
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:01.320]  is obama should be thrown out of office now before he gets anywhere near an
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:03.720]  election he can be thrown out for a number of
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.560]  reasons for violations of the constitution and he can also be thrown
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:11.320]  out as an insane person for which he's qualified
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:15.000]  this man is actually a man of that type
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.120]  he under the section four of the 25th amendment
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.440]  this man is qualified to be suspended from the office of the president
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.040]  all it would be required is the vice president of the united states
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:30.200]  would utter such a finding presented to members of the cabinet
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:34.040]  and if they agreed then the president would have to step back
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.960]  while the matter was being challenged that would be the best solution
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:42.360]  or if he simply would resign for some reason i want to stop you briefly why
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.560]  is it so important for him the figure had to be brought down a
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:48.600]  but b i agree with you i've seen a lot of stuff that shows
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.320]  he's more than just a narcissist he says there's 57 states he bizarrely
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:27:00.040]  does full bows to anybody he you know who's royal uh he's he's saying more
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.800]  and more weird stuff i mean i mean what's your intel
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:06.440]  so now you have an incredible intelligence network i mean are you
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:08.520]  hearing he's actually completely nuts and
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:13.400]  what is the form of psychosis well he is he is he's actually the same thing as
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:17.560]  the emperor nero he has in history an identity
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.720]  in a profile which i presented in april of 2009 warning about what this guy was
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:26.200]  going to do he is actually somebody picked a guy
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:30.760]  whose mind mental state was that of the same as the emperor nero
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.680]  and who you know in the end killed himself when he was losing the case
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.840]  at that point but in this case what's happening is
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:41.880]  the british are in control of this thing and obama's nothing but a british
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:46.760]  puppet he's also insane in his significance is that as president of
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:51.160]  the united states with his insanity and the power he's
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.920]  using with the direction of the british he could cause
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:02.120]  world war three semenukia world war three so if we don't remove him from power
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:06.520]  as it stands now here we got two options you have to think of what's the british
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:11.160]  option the british option is if they can't win it any other way
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:16.600]  they are now prepared to order through the president of the united states the
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:21.720]  launching as of our submarine fleet in the pacific to launch the greatest
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:25.640]  capability in terminal clear warfare that exists on this planet
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:30.360]  without the united states under control of the british under obama's control
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:35.640]  that could not happen therefore we have to get obama out
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.160]  because the most likely way to save this nation
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:44.360]  if we continue to tolerate obama if he's continued to be president
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:47.800]  they're not going to wait for the next election in the united states
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:52.360]  the danger comes now because we don't know the exact date but we're close to that
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:55.960]  point now two things are the british have two objectives
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.880]  now the british know what the command knows exactly what they're doing when
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:04.440]  they're prompting the united states to unleash forces such as the
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:08.040]  submarine terminokia capability in the pacific
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:11.400]  and also the atlantic they know what they're doing
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:14.760]  they are obviously not anticipating a pleasant trip
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.240]  with that they would prefer to use the threat
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:23.400]  as hitler did in germany to the germans to use the threat
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.400]  mr roose stay there that was a short segment long when coming up this is key
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:31.400]  that's what i wanted to ask you when we get back why are they openly announcing

[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:27.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:28.760]  eight hundred nine two nine seven five six six
[02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:33.880]  or larouchepac.com there's also uh other websites they have as well but
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:39.000]  larouchepac.com and uh he joins us now uh okay so we're
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.440]  going to break and we were talking about understanding the city of london
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:52.200]  the the venetian black nobility uh vestigial remnant of the roman empire
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:55.960]  and in Byzantine system that survived
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:02.360]  and was taken in to uh europe and then finally settling
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:05.880]  after i guess the Templars purge uh in london
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:09.560]  and scotland for that matter but in london in the city of london the city
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:13.400]  within the city uh one of those again cities on its own
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.160]  a sovereign saying that they're above everyone what is their mindset so people
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:20.760]  can understand it and what this great game is and why
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:24.520]  do they have the the u.s military openly menacing
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:28.520]  the communist chinese who our own government
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.080]  has helped give the mirv technology and icbm long march technology to
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:37.720]  what is this great game that while the game includes the elimination of the
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:44.360]  russia china india and so forth the immediate target for weapons attack
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:48.200]  is from the united states if it's working under the british direction
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.560]  which obama represents in that case then the
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:59.000]  the target is principally against the russia china the other leading nations
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.480]  of Asia including uh including india those are the targets
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:09.000]  now the british prefer not to take the risk of the repercussions
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.760]  of a full-scale thermonuclear attack on that part of the world
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.960]  and any other places they think is a threat to them
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:20.600]  they would prefer to have us assign a treaty agreement
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:24.520]  with the british empire that is with wall street and london
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:29.400]  and thus submit to the dictatorship of those powers
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.320]  that way the british would get everything it would be a bit slower than
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:37.240]  winning a thermonuclear war but they would accept that because they don't
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:39.960]  want to be killed too they just want the people they
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:44.120]  want to kill to be killed so therefore we have two options
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:50.600]  if we allow the this president obama to continue in the presidency
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.480]  we are doomed because the full repercussion of launching the thermonuclear
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:37:00.600]  war our military are not guilty our military our
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:03.800]  joint chiefs of staff and people like that and people in the intelligence
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:08.200]  community are all the same persuasion they are fighting like the devil
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:11.560]  has so far have helped to prevent this from happening
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.880]  it was supposed to happen soon after the killing of qaddafi
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:21.080]  but we are our best military people were a key factor in preventing us and some
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.000]  of our intelligence community were a key factor within the limits they have
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.160]  of power in this system have delayed this thing so far
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:32.680]  but we're now coming to the point that the british are getting desperate
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:36.840]  and they're now pushing hard against russia against china
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.080]  for a total submission and sir i want to be clear because neocons and others
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:43.160]  write articles about myself and they say
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.040]  jones doesn't want war with the russians and chinese
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:50.760]  he must work for him i mean my family on both sides
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.080]  came over on the mayflower on my dad's side the captain of the mayflower
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:58.280]  you know the battle of san jasinna texas founding
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:02.600]  how dare these banker operatives these people that are helping sell out our
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:06.360]  bill of rights our constitution i know you come from an old american family as
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:09.640]  well how dare these type of people claim that because
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:14.360]  we don't want nuclear war and we don't want 30 000 drones in the skies
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:18.360]  and secret arrest of citizens the system is is showing us it's a bunch of
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.720]  tyrants and then if we don't want war and conflict
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:26.680]  weird traders no they are the traders and is it not treason
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:30.520]  when they're launching wars under un authority they're not going to congress
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.320]  they're saying we'll arrest citizens and kill citizens i mean i saw
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.560]  lindsay graham on tv he goes yeah of course the ndaa's for citizens we won't
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:45.560]  just arrest you we'll kill you without a trial i mean they are trying to
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:49.560]  come out in the open and hide their tyranny in plain view and appeal to
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:53.560]  authority and it's just it's so real you talk about nuclear war
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:56.840]  all the elites as you know sir but for the audience you're not hyping this
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.920]  they're building bunkers the chinese are saying prepare for nuclear war
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:05.320]  the russians are are are are are threatening saying don't go into syria
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.440]  i mean i've not seen rhetoric like this even at the height of the cold war
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  i mean it's just it's crazy and it's like world war one or world war two but
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.080]  now we got nukes and bio weapons we're sleep walking into oblivion
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:23.720]  and i've just gotten so used to it and people are watching football games
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:28.520]  it has that same eeriness that i saw historians write about before the great
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:32.840]  wars i know you were in world war two so i mean i mean
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.040]  is that what your gut is telling you and your intellect as well sir
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:41.960]  i'm saying that the problem lies with our responsibility as americans
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:47.720]  our responsibility here is to throw this president obama out of office
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:52.440]  because if we are not willing to do that we are not going to survive
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.280]  you're saying that's a signal to the world that there's big changes and the
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:58.840]  power structure is being reversed
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:01.880]  the point is the british uh the british empire
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:05.880]  is it which controls wall street remember wall street has been from the
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:10.680]  beginning a british proper faction most of our president
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:15.000]  say they meant i could go through the they set up cfr in new york to control it
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.400]  on record it's all british intelligence
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.120]  sure it is but the point is if the problem is the killing of kennedy
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:26.920]  and the entry into a long war of about 10 years in indochina
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.400]  was intentional and kennedy opposed that and he was killed to get him out of the
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:37.560]  way to get that war enclosed that war destroyed an impetus which was existed
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.160]  under kennedy for projects which would rebuild this
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:44.040]  nation in a way which we would today envy
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:48.440]  what has happened we have essentially three generations of people
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:52.120]  who do not know as adult adult experience
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:55.800]  they do not know what the united states represented
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:59.560]  under eisenhower and kennedy and of course
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:03.240]  also rose up before they don't know that
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:06.760]  they've been terrorized by what a succession of wars
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:10.840]  wars all over the world we have our troops are being slaughtered
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.240]  what by perpetual warfare we don't need that warfare
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:19.400]  and i think you'll find that any leading military officer
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:23.960]  of our system well that's my next point sir all the top brass has come out and
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.440]  said a war on iran is insane uh most of the israeli people
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:31.880]  the head of massad was fired a year ago because he wouldn't go along with it
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.720]  i mean this is so insane the way i've heard it described by top ci analysts
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:40.520]  rey mcgovern is it is a roll the dice and and and and
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:45.000]  there isn't a good number on the die it just runs from bad to worse you know a
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:50.200]  six is total nuclear war a one is doubling of gas prices regional war
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.560]  terror attacks economies going under but that's the
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:59.080]  neo feudalistic uh a british imperial model and they say it's a
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.040]  post-industrial world they're digging in they've got
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:06.760]  seed vaults they're building bunkers i mean the the establishment as you know
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:10.360]  is acting like they're getting ready for world war three
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:13.960]  absolutely but the point is i look at it for the standpoint i can't
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:17.400]  complaining doesn't get you anywhere what do we do
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:20.600]  about it what do we do then and the point is we have to
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:25.480]  arouse the american people in a different way than we usually do
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  we as we you know like what happened after pearl harbor
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:33.720]  we had a situation where rosevelt knew
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.720]  the attack on pearl harbor was coming but he also knew
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:42.040]  that most of the americans would not fight the japanese
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:45.320]  under those conditions and others so therefore
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:50.920]  we did not act to defend pearl harbor even though we know it was happening
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:55.240]  because the naval and army forces commanding the position
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:00.680]  in pearl harbor for example we're not going to do anything to stop it
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:06.040]  so therefore rosevelt was mobilized to mobilize us to war
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:10.840]  because he knew under those conditions of an actual direct attack on the united
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:14.920]  states by japan would mobilize the american forces now was i was in
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:18.200]  new york at that time when this happened that sunday
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:21.080]  and i was walking across the from midtown Manhattan from
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:25.000]  what east side to west side for a business appointment
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.480]  and as i walked into this place i got this hotel i went to
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:34.760]  to meet my people i heard the voice of rosevelt coming over the
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:38.360]  phone over the reports on rosevelt coming over
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:41.880]  and i looked at what happened to the people and you would in this two or three
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:49.240]  hours following that news noontime report i saw a transformation of the
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:52.520]  american people in new york city as elsewhere
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:55.640]  they were screaming trying to get enlisted in the army
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:59.240]  to defend the united states and that was not the case
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:05.320]  in the day or so before the pearl harbor event now the problem is we're not i'm
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:08.440]  not looking for a pearl harvard like an event right now
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:13.800]  but i said the problem here is is the lack of competent leadership
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:18.760]  from leading centers people in government as in the senate for example
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:25.240]  in particular who who know this stuff they know it but they're not doing a
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:28.920]  damn thing about it because they don't think it's it's safe
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:32.600]  politically safe for them to do it that is a result
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.680]  of the demoralization of our population
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:41.640]  over three generations that is among adults from the killing of kennedy
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:45.320]  and especially from the the experience of the launching
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.320]  of the actual prolonged indochina war but we have been going through
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:52.440]  war i understand sir so so what is the time frame
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:56.360]  i mean there's a big awakening happening but it's not coordinated
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:00.120]  uh you know the congress has a lowest approval rating this obama's
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.560]  unpopular but it doesn't matter what we want or make sense
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:09.160]  you know 70 plus percent don't want all these wars they just keep going
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.240]  forward so what do you see happening if
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.560]  if the british puppet or the globalist puppet obama is not removed
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.960]  well what you've got now the problem is you have no guts
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:25.960]  especially represented by all of the republican candidates
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:31.160]  and the one and plus minus uh the democratic candidate
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:35.080]  if they you have that list of candidates presidential candidates
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:39.480]  or pre-candidates this nation is demoralized
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:44.360]  that kind of electing that kind of junk to be the leading candidates for the
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.680]  direct election you do that you tolerate that
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:52.680]  you tolerate these clowns well why don't the the the banksters
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:56.600]  send it in around london anyway as you say why don't why do they want us so
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:59.640]  demoralized i mean i guess so that we follow
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:03.000]  every order right they want the forks they're gonna
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.200]  intend to reduce the population of the united states among other places you
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:09.720]  know you don't think we're gonna come out of
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:13.160]  this it was spectators to this great war no
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:18.200]  among the targeted victims of this war and if we can't explain the british
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:21.720]  play everybody off against each other see people think of it as what you
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:25.160]  pick one side of the other no think about the third position
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:28.920]  of the of the group manipulating you that's what the Rothschilds of our
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:32.040]  have always done you've written about them they're all supporting this
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:35.720]  here's david Rockefeller from his memoir we are on the verge of a global
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:39.160]  transportation transformation we're on the verge of a global
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:42.280]  transformation all we eat is the right major crisis
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.120]  and the nations will accept the new world order here's another one
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:51.160]  um speaking in the new york times about how great mouse a tongue is
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:55.480]  here's a quote out of his memoirs page 405
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:58.840]  some even believe we the Rockefeller family are part of a secret cabal
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.760]  working against the best interests the united states characterizing my family
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:05.800]  and me as internationalist and of conspiring with others
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:08.760]  around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:11.960]  structure one one world if you will if that's the
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:15.640]  charge i stand guilty and i'm proud of it but they're not one world everybody
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:19.960]  work together and be friends they're one world corporate global empire
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:25.880]  is monetarism that's that's monetarism i say the problem is the solution is
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:30.840]  my experience internationally and knowing people in other countries leading
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.440]  circles in other countries important important nations
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:39.160]  i know that if the people of the united states would say what they are thinking
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:43.800]  now in large degree they're thinking that this collection of republican
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.240]  private candidates and this democratic candidate
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:52.840]  obama the president that as long as these people are treated with respect
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:57.800]  the american people are going to submit and they will not fight
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.960]  and if they will not fight we're duck soup
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:07.080]  and the problem is our politics stinks as a result of three generations
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.720]  effectively in terms of adults what happened when jack kennedy was killed
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:15.240]  and we went into the intro china war we have never
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.320]  reverse that trend i understand so what about this issue sir
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:25.960]  um you talk about provocations um i was noticing that uh the israeli papers
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:29.000]  reported that the folks that ran the levan affair
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:33.800]  blowing up u.s uh movie theaters and things full of u.s service people
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:37.880]  uh in egypt to try to blame egypt and start a big war
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:41.640]  i noticed they were recently given awards i know they've had like i said
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.640]  that publisher saying you know go after the president if he doesn't launch the
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:49.560]  wars um what about israel or the british or other
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:54.200]  groups we know israel was created by by the big bankers
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:58.200]  israel as such is not a relevant problem
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:02.680]  in this case you have an israeli premier
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:09.000]  and a small circle of british stooges who are carrying the name of israel
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.840]  against the objections of traditional leaders of israel
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:16.760]  the leading traditional leaders of israel up to this point
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.040]  have all opposed this kind of operation
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:23.960]  including against you know iran and so forth they're against it
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:28.120]  what's going to happen if iran gets attacked well if iran gets attacked
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:31.800]  that's intended by the british to be the trigger
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:36.280]  used to to launch the war and it depends on
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:40.520]  the point at which the british are able to get a secure control
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.680]  over ordering to the president of the united states
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:48.440]  ordering the launching of world war three
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:53.720]  as a thermonuclear war concentrated in asia but not limited to asia
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:57.400]  well i noticed they've moved the force to asia the naval and nuke forces
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:00.840]  but the russians and people are starting to concentrate in the mediterranean
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:06.120]  and the persian gulf and syria uh but uh i guess they're thinking china's
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:09.560]  going to come in to back up iran now it's a different
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.480]  it's a whole package the whole asia-centered package
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:21.000]  is one package of nations russia china india and other leading nations japan
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:26.200]  korea and so forth who want no part of this policy now i understand they're
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:29.000]  not going along i mean i know they're moving the fleets and the troops there
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:32.520]  and and australia but when i'm saying ish i see a lot of conflict in the
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:36.600]  middle east too uh how does that kick off stuff in asia
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.720]  what's their excuse me all that middle east case
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:43.960]  that problem now is all comes from britain number one
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:47.880]  and it comes from our presidency the obama presidency
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.320]  that's the cause of all the middle east problems right now
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:53.960]  all right i want to ask you when we come back and take a few calls
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:58.760]  how are they planning on starting a war with the communist chinese then
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:03.000]  we'll be right back you don't need me to tell you
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.160]  that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone can feel it
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.440]  we know a tectonic struggle is now taking place
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:14.120]  between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:18.120]  bondage and enslavement yes my friends evil
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:21.800]  is rising but take heart for every action
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:26.200]  there is an equal and opposite reaction recently new world order operative

[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:56.920]  the hootspa level the bravada level whatever you want to call it
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:01.560]  the megalomania level uh i don't ever get people that just think they're
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:05.000]  100 bulletproof maybe when i was 14 years old
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.360]  but i just don't get these guys that have all this power
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:11.800]  uh i mean i've got a little bit of power with millions of listeners and it kind
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:15.720]  of is a big responsibility freaks me out i try to be more careful about what i
[02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:20.280]  say because i you know i realize that that it affects things
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:23.800]  but there's this opposite where you have all these mad men running things
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:27.720]  who make 40 to one bets and i don't know how they think they're gonna make it
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:30.120]  through a big nuclear war they're just crazy
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.680]  well the corezine case as i know it would give you the answer to that
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:37.880]  corezine is not a thief he's not a bad person
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:41.320]  but he he came up as a person seeking a
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:46.360]  or impulse for a career he took the career he had available to him
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:51.400]  and he what he did as a banker was what was accepted in that time and is
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:53.640]  accepted generally i know that's what i mean it's
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:56.920]  reckless to make 40 to one bets with other people's money
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:00.840]  of course it is but the point is that's the system now
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:04.440]  and you can't blame the individual the whole system is there look at your
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:08.120]  your entire congress i'm saying this is a crazy system with nuclear
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:11.800]  weapons these people are crazy of course but think about the
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.320]  repeal of glass stigl that occurred all the
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:20.520]  the worst damage that has been done to the united states and its people
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.600]  was the read was the revoking of glass stigl
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:31.160]  in the last phase war of that process and the repeal of glass stigl
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:36.040]  opened the gates for all the hell which has burst out since that time
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:39.400]  so you have to blame the people who orchestrated that
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:43.000]  and the people who defended the key bankers that were doing it
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:47.080]  this the audience of this came from london but people weren't thinking about
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:49.880]  loyalty or anything else they were thinking about money sure but that's my
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.320]  point is they knew when they opened up the derivatives
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:56.920]  casino fractional reserve banking to the moon
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:00.120]  that it would cause a global implosion when i'm saying is
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:06.920]  they are trying to ride this this target this you know this bomb down
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:12.120]  to the target like dr strangelove in some cases yes the leading ones the
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:14.360]  brish ones and the key people in wall street
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:17.480]  the top people wall street the real wall street
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.320]  morgan and that interest they've been thieving
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:25.800]  and people have loved them in main admire not love them in the sense of
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:29.160]  physically loving them but admiring them for their achievement
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:31.960]  and wishing that they could have the same thing
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:37.640]  we our morality has been destroyed by the destruction of our characteristic
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.480]  american initiative which is not a money issue we're not
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:46.280]  monetarists not honest americans we believe in a credit system
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:50.200]  our system was based on a credit system and all this stuff is a violation of
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:53.560]  the credit system the thing that we have to think about is the cure of this
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:56.360]  problem rather than the complaint against it
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:00.440]  my point is we are in a situation of crisis where i believe
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:04.520]  that if more people would respond we could first of all
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:07.880]  all of these republican candidates for president a joke
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:13.880]  worse than a joke obama an abomination then why are these abominations
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:17.080]  listed as the probable presidential candidates
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:20.600]  that's where our problem lies linden we've got to go to break will you come

[02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:34.360]  if you're specifically talking about ron paul because he's against the war
[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:37.480]  and he certainly is a man of principle and he's predicted everything that's
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:41.160]  happening as well we'll be right back
[02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:50.200]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:18.040]  all right briefly because i want to jam in a few calls here we're going to twist
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:22.040]  linden's the harm to go even further if we don't do this quickly
[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:25.560]  you're saying all the candidates are a joke the other republican candidates
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.320]  are pure establishment hacks who put out rhetoric but are bought and
[03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:31.560]  paid for look at mitt romney i agree with you but
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:36.760]  you know i know some people have have attacked ron paul saying well if you
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:40.120]  cut everything everything will implode and i understand that some of the
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:44.040]  banksters want to cut things once they've gotten their bankster welfare
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:48.040]  my whole point is is that is that it's the big banks that are getting the
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:51.880]  corporate welfare to begin with and that's who ron paul says he'll
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:55.400]  he'll he'll he'll cut it from he also says he'll lend all these wars and
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.240]  bring the troops home immediately uh briefly what's your view of ron paul
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:03.480]  ron paul is i'm dealing with the real issue before me
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:07.160]  the real issue is the united states cannot be saved
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:10.920]  from its own folly unless we immediately
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:14.840]  enact glass stiggle now not down in the future
[03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:19.560]  now because we're on the point of the actual breakdown crisis of the entire
[03:01:19.560 --> 03:01:22.680]  united states economy and if we do not get
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:30.440]  that glass stiggle renewal in interacted now this nation is finished
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:33.400]  economically well we can certainly see the depressions here they've been
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:36.120]  telling us it's a great economy but they admit that the numbers they're putting
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:38.680]  out are fake and the problem the problem is a
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:43.160]  presidential candidate who does not propose an immediate glass
[03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:47.000]  stiggle enactment is not fit to be a presidential candidate
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:50.600]  because the united states will cease to exist
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:53.880]  unless that change is made that's not sufficient
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:57.400]  when it's necessary without the glass stiggle act you cannot save this nation
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:02:00.120]  now and if you don't if you're not pushing the glass
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:03.080]  stiggle act now you're not fit to be president
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:06.440]  and the second thing this will not be sufficient
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:10.520]  our intrinsic banking system now even the
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:16.200]  non uh the secular type it's so rotted out and so weakened
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:22.200]  we do not have the adequate amount of care of credit needed to be organized to
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:25.800]  save this nation therefore we need to make a change in the
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:29.800]  actual banking system to go to a true credit system
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:34.600]  which was the original policy with the us constitution
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:39.000]  if we go to a credit system take take one project for example take
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:43.960]  no opera no opera will employ four million people
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:47.000]  and it will start to do that the minute you start the project
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:50.760]  the project is fully designed in principle there's some details that
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:54.360]  would have to be worked out but as designed by the by the company
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:57.960]  initially back there in the 1960s that policy
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:02.200]  there are other policies other programs similarly we could restore this
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:08.440]  nation at an accelerating rate rapidly if we pass two laws one
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:12.120]  glass stiggle that cleans up the banking system
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:16.440]  number two the resaved banking system will not be sufficient
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:20.360]  to save the nation if you try to maintain a typical
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:23.640]  monetary system you cannot resave the united states
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:26.520]  it may not die right away but it won't it won't recover
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:30.760]  if we go to a credit system as well as a glass as a glass stiggle
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:35.800]  reform we will immediately be able with a cooperation of other nations we
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:40.360]  can induce to join with us in this we can get we can start a recovery
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:43.640]  of the united states of a united states style recovery
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:47.960]  linden let me ask you this now can you do one more 10 minute segment with us
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:51.080]  so we can finish up and take a few calls from people that are holding and then

[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:57.000]  while like mark and others uh but uh we're going to go to break her a
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.280]  moment but i briefly how do they plan on starting a war in asia
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:06.680]  the plan is as follows the israelis was to start the war
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:10.600]  the israelis are supposed to start a provocation against iran
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:15.000]  in the meantime in the middle of asia east asia
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.680]  oh it's asia you have syria now syria is the most important nation
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:26.760]  in west asia it represents not the most capable military force in terms of
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:30.120]  quality and military force i'm not talking about the the extent of weapons
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:34.360]  or so but the quality the truth it also is tied to
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:37.640]  when most tell us start over when we come back quickly because i want to go
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:39.800]  over all this in one piece and then we'll take a few calls

[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:55.240]  segment so we can get to some of your phone calls
[03:08:55.240 --> 03:08:58.520]  and we appreciate him joining us sir finishing up starting over
[03:08:58.520 --> 03:09:01.800]  the grand chess board why the u.s. is admitting
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:08.600]  is preparing for a war right now uh in asia they're now talking about open war
[03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:13.560]  with pakistan who's got a hundred nukes i mean this is a world war a syria
[03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:17.720]  proxy armies taking over libya it's all barreling forward
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:21.560]  why did the global financial interest centered in wall street london
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:26.520]  frankfort and other areas why are they wanting this why are they doing this
[03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:31.160]  their principle is that they're not concerned about the amount of money
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:34.760]  question or the amount of wealth per capita
[03:09:34.760 --> 03:09:39.240]  they're concerned that they control it whatever it is
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:43.480]  because they know if they control it they can control the future
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:48.600]  they don't care about the number of people who die or do not all live
[03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:52.920]  they care about their faction being immortal
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:57.400]  that their faction must reign as dominant over the planet forever
[03:09:57.400 --> 03:10:01.880]  in the tradition of the roman empire the bizantine empire the excruzator system
[03:10:01.880 --> 03:10:05.240]  the new venetian party which is what this thing is so therefore they're
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:08.920]  concerned about they really think in historical terms
[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:14.280]  but very bad historical terms these empires always think in the terms of
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:17.880]  they're controlling the future destiny of mankind
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:21.800]  and they don't care how many people they lose of their own pro forces how many
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:26.120]  they themselves kill of their own forces what they care
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:29.880]  about is the future that is they they are principled
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:34.600]  as most of our politicians are not principled most of our politicians are
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:38.200]  thinking about the amount of money they get for their pleasure
[03:10:38.200 --> 03:10:42.920]  the british empire is more moral by being immoral is
[03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:46.760]  morally immoral well they're such incredibly vicious control freaks
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:49.320]  they want to win that's why they're in the eugenics
[03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:53.160]  they want to create an artificial habitat control all human activity
[03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:59.160]  and be god basically exactly that's the the word the idea of god
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:05.240]  in terms of pagan belief goes back to the you know things like the
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:10.360]  siege of troi where the question was no matter how many people you kill
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:13.960]  because you get to be the top dog you can kill the opposition
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:18.360]  the remaining opposition which is what they did they kill everybody except a
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:22.120]  few harmless people in troi once they beat the we beat that
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:25.000]  racket and that's the way the british thinks that's their
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.080]  morality they have a morality the problem with our people are
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:33.000]  corrupt people is they have no morality they have only personal greed
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:36.200]  personal gratification they don't give a damn about the future
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:40.120]  that's right the globalist at the top they've convinced us that everybody's
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:43.400]  thinking on a six-month and you know the you know the ruling
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:47.160]  a leader only thinking about themselves and it's everybody for
[03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:50.040]  themselves but really they've got all these
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:53.480]  minions to sell out for money they printed out of nothing
[03:11:53.480 --> 03:11:56.920]  for the globalists for the top controllers they're not even about money
[03:11:56.920 --> 03:12:01.400]  they're about total control long-term strategic
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:05.560]  chessboard and the end game is global holocaust global eugenics
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:09.960]  and then they re-emerge with their whole moon raker scenario
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:14.360]  incredible so briefly how do they plan on starting these wars you're saying
[03:12:14.360 --> 03:12:18.120]  syria and others in iran it's the kickoff going into pakistan and then
[03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:21.160]  china no it's what works differently the plan
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:26.280]  basically is the british intend to destroy the united states by absorbing it
[03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:29.960]  killing off most of the americans and a few things like that you know
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:34.200]  but the intent is for them to do the impossible
[03:12:34.200 --> 03:12:37.240]  at the time that the british system is entirely bankrupt
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:42.520]  rostrel is totally bankrupt they're bankrupt they want to save their
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:47.800]  system for the future therefore they are religious
[03:12:47.800 --> 03:12:52.520]  but they're on the devil's side we're on the other side except we don't have
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:55.560]  any supporters there are many people who claim to be religious but they don't
[03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:58.680]  act religious they act on the basis of personal greed and
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:02.120]  satisfaction and their sexual lusts and things like that
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:05.480]  so that and i'm here i am you know with people like me
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:10.920]  there are a few of us around and i think in terms of immortality too
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:16.920]  but i'm not on the satan side they are well that's right anybody who's truly
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:21.560]  awakened conscious and fulfilled is understanding that we all
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:26.360]  come and go it is the species that matters and it is the building up of
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:29.720]  humanity that is the great work and for the global
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:33.240]  controllers they want to take it all over wreck everything
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:36.680]  so nobody is independent separate from their system
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:40.120]  and they don't even offer mankind a place in their system
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:44.280]  with them running it they don't like populations they don't like people
[03:13:44.280 --> 03:13:48.120]  they want us dead it's like the james bond movie when he says to goldfinger do
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:51.400]  you expect me to talk and he goes no i expect you to die
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:56.040]  they're not giving us quarter and and and as crazy as all this looks
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:13:59.400]  they're they're really moving us forward our things
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:02.520]  and we're going to calls our things going well well for them
[03:14:02.520 --> 03:14:07.000]  linda larouche no they're not the point is if we have a few more people with
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.960]  the familiar guts and we've got it russia and china our and other
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:16.520]  countries like korea like japan and so forth in in asia
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:21.480]  but other countries as well and large movements in people people in europe
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.080]  who are on the opposite side or on the against that side
[03:14:25.080 --> 03:14:28.600]  but so there is there is the potential the potential resources
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:32.680]  physical resources as well to turn the situation around
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:36.520]  to get rid of obama retire him into some zoo someplace where he'd be safe for
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:40.600]  the rest of his life and but and deal get rid of this
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:45.400]  from this problem we can do that it's a good we can do in this time
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:50.280]  the capability of doing it is there if the willingness is there
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:54.360]  we can win we can save this not to grab power
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:57.720]  but the safe civilization their parts of civilization would like to grow and
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:01.320]  improve things and we just remove this problem
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:06.200]  and we could remove it the removal of obama from office
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:09.080]  while he's still president before he starts a war
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:13.960]  would be sufficient to open the gates for the salvation at least in one sense
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:18.120]  of civilization all right let's go to uh...
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:21.000]  dan in florida you're on the air with linda larouche then tini
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.400]  than others go ahead uh... dan yeah how you doing alex good
[03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:28.040]  actually kind of got like a fat question real quick i'm wondering what's going on
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:31.800]  with jason bermas whatever happened to him uh... jason does the nightly news
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:34.360]  quite often he always had said he's done this twice
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:38.040]  came here and made one film went back home he were his family and mother and
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:41.240]  and sister and others are and then he went back so
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:44.840]  uh... i think he was just about a month ago on the nightly news with us
[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:49.240]  okay cool but yeah my question was basically about the rochow family um
[03:15:49.240 --> 03:15:53.480]  my sister had married into their family probably about ten years ago
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:15:56.920]  and you know i'm noticing you know when i first saw the situation i really
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:15:59.800]  think too much of it just that it was a regular guy
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:02.200]  but lately i've been noticing some things something that are really really
[03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:05.320]  strange lately and um you know i can see my family
[03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:08.840]  kind of having some issues here and then not going to talk about them all over
[03:16:08.840 --> 03:16:12.760]  the air but it's it's it's very it's a very
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:15.880]  simple answer there complicated explanations which really don't mean
[03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:19.000]  much but you have to think from the top down
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:24.520]  what happened is there was a a process of successive imperial systems in europe
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:28.760]  and what one came after the Byzantine empire
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:33.240]  and out of this came the what became the Venetian party
[03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:37.880]  the first Venetian party the first Venetian party was then defeated later on
[03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:41.480]  in the course of the change in religious law alignments and so forth
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:45.880]  and we started with the modern time the modern Venetian party called the second
[03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:50.280]  Venetian party the new Venetian party and this was
[03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:53.720]  this was a key factor which led to all the wars and so forth
[03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:57.080]  that came out of the 17th and 18th century
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:02.200]  so in this process the family of Rothschild which was part of the families
[03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:06.200]  of the Venetian oligarchy and were tied to what was called the second
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:09.880]  or the new Venetian oligarchy of you know of the
[03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:13.080]  which became the British kingdom this second
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:18.760]  this group became the central feature of a group of Venetian bankers
[03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:22.840]  international Venetian bankers in which the name of Rothschild became
[03:17:22.840 --> 03:17:27.240]  leading during the course of the Napoleonic wars
[03:17:27.240 --> 03:17:32.360]  since that time the second Venetian party typified by the leadership of the
[03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:35.400]  Rothschild family as a family as a financial family
[03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:39.960]  became a dominant feature in the operations of the British empire
[03:17:39.960 --> 03:17:43.320]  so it's not that the Rothschilds contain some
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:48.600]  magical genius of evil it's simply they've joined a club of evil
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:52.920]  and it is evil absolutely let's go to Teenie and then Michael
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:58.840]  Teenie and Indiana quick question for Lynn LaRouche uh yes if Congress won't
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:02.600]  impeach Obama why can't the American people
[03:18:02.600 --> 03:18:07.960]  impeach Obama yeah that's a good idea how I mean there's got to be other ways
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:12.440]  all it takes is a number of politicians with the guts to push through
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:17.320]  this reform that is the section four of the
[03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:23.320]  23rd amendment that will get him suspended from power
[03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:28.440]  if the cooperation is there the suspension of him from power
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:34.360]  would block world war three which is just insane they are moving towards
[03:18:34.360 --> 03:18:38.600]  giant multi-region wars and nuclear weapons are already being threatened to
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:42.520]  be used the israel in the u.s. are saying we
[03:18:42.520 --> 03:18:46.840]  may use tactical nukes up front against iran it's not israel is a certain
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:49.080]  group in israel which are controlled with the same process
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:53.080]  no i know and then it's sold as patriotic for people that live in israel
[03:18:53.080 --> 03:18:56.840]  but you know to be for this madness and you got a bunch of idiots that don't
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:18:59.960]  even understand military matters who are supporting it thank you Teenie one

[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:05.480]  we need to reverse all this i mean i ran tried to get their uranium enriched
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:10.200]  in europe where it couldn't be used for bombs the west didn't want to do that
[03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:13.400]  let me ask and i appreciate your call sir let me ask little rouge this question
[03:20:13.400 --> 03:20:16.520]  i know that they threw out mohammed mozadek and then
[03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:19.640]  the west was involved at some level actually betraying the shaw not saying
[03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:23.160]  he was a good guy i know they're heavily involved with british
[03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:27.320]  intelligence and certain elements of the wahhabist i'm not saying you know all of
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:30.840]  that muslim sect the majority are bad i'm not i'm just saying
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:34.840]  that that obviously we know al qaeda you know is a
[03:20:34.840 --> 03:20:42.120]  western foil all of that's going on and we know that this system is expanding
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:47.720]  uh on the subject of iran we know that with iran contra there were the
[03:20:47.720 --> 03:20:50.280]  behind the scenes deals with with the moolas
[03:20:50.280 --> 03:20:55.000]  and the cia i mean sometimes i wonder if there aren't elements of the iranian
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:58.440]  establishment aren't still working with the west
[03:20:58.440 --> 03:21:01.640]  uh... in some type of elaborate saber rattling
[03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:06.200]  uh... to try to uh... basically manipulate the price of oil and things
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:09.480]  little rouge uh... we're almost out of time i appreciate it all the time you
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:12.920]  spent with us but please give us your take on that point is you go back to the
[03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:17.320]  issue of this it was delis delis who worked for the british
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:22.440]  who sank mozadeh and that was what started this whole problem was the
[03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:26.200]  british wanted all the oil for free and kermit roosevelt and my six
[03:21:26.200 --> 03:21:31.320]  c i m a six team stage terror attacks on muslims and blamed it on mozadeh
[03:21:31.320 --> 03:21:35.000]  and they use the muslim extremists overthrow mozadeh then double cross
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:38.840]  them and put the shaw in then double cross ten and put the iotolas in
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:43.240]  and tell our our public that the iotolas got in on their own so i'm saying
[03:21:43.240 --> 03:21:47.640]  is that relationship still there i'm sorry are the relationship is british
[03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:52.200]  at all any parts of the whole region and now we have fluctuations where people
[03:21:52.200 --> 03:21:53.000]  who've been
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:56.520]  they're taken down by the british so often as their allies
[03:21:56.520 --> 03:22:00.360]  who they were involved against the british but it is always been the
[03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:04.760]  british empire which was the only significant force
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:08.520]  at in the planet after the fall of the soviet union
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:12.680]  was the united states possibly versus the british and everything how he hangs
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:16.120]  on that we are the axis of the issue
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:19.720]  what if we can do our job and i believe the american people if they're
[03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:25.400]  mobilized properly will respond we can change the direction of history on this
[03:22:25.400 --> 03:22:29.800]  planet in the short period of time but we need some leadership out there
[03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:33.720]  who are not like what we have is as so-called selected leadership
[03:22:33.720 --> 03:22:37.720]  they will not do the job but i know that there are people in the congress
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:41.560]  who are behaving badly or negligently or with cowardice
[03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:45.320]  i know they're not bad people and i know if we can get a little movement going
[03:22:45.320 --> 03:22:47.720]  on this thing those people can be
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:51.640]  mustered together and with that force we can change the direction of this whole
[03:22:51.640 --> 03:22:54.680]  process but we have to do it quickly well you've got a lot of your ideas and
[03:22:54.680 --> 03:22:58.520]  information at larouche pack dot com there's also
[03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:02.920]  larouche pub dot com let's take a one more call for our guest let's talk to

[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:13.800]  hello alex hello mr larouche um it's great to see that um you believe in
[03:23:13.800 --> 03:23:17.560]  venetian mercantilism i also uh i also uh
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:21.960]  subscribe to dr mark holsman view um
[03:23:21.960 --> 03:23:27.560]  um i can see living here for 10 years i can see that the
[03:23:27.560 --> 03:23:31.960]  that the society engineering that's taken place here
[03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:35.720]  um everybody's sort of treading on eggshells just
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:42.280]  just to get ahead you know and um and uh i i saw a documentary years
[03:23:42.280 --> 03:23:46.680]  years back saying that the reason why the world war two was stopped was the
[03:23:46.680 --> 03:23:52.440]  american family values now because they have downgraded us
[03:23:52.440 --> 03:23:55.720]  so much through uh fluoride in the water
[03:23:55.720 --> 03:24:03.160]  and and bale worship and um just engineering us with propaganda
[03:24:03.160 --> 03:24:07.000]  um there's not there's not enough character in
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:11.400]  in your congress and there's not enough character in in countries like this
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:15.560]  to stand up for what is right now but i believe what uh
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:22.120]  alex jones uh believes which is which is stolen valor is not on
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:26.760]  you know people of honor people of integrity should stand up for what is
[03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:31.080]  right and route out these um these uh
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:35.320]  snakes sons of snakes uh grandsons of snakes
[03:24:35.320 --> 03:24:40.200]  and the time has come where where we realize that
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:43.880]  there is there is no quarter given by them
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:48.040]  but unfortunately they've got uh they've got the islamic brotherhood which they
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:51.400]  have founded which they founded back in the 20s
[03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:56.600]  through the mr six and they've put a fire under them
[03:24:56.600 --> 03:25:01.640]  and here we have a a gene pool here we have a society
[03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:08.200]  to all act communally any mature islam a islamic scholar does not
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:11.560]  consider it a religion they consider it an empire
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:14.920]  and they've had a fire lit up lit under their
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:19.240]  their ass and these people do not turn back
[03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:23.720]  they are going to crash the wall all right well let me ask that question then
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:27.800]  i mean i i was almost out of time there is a stirring up
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:32.120]  just by the global implosion and the increase in commodities prices
[03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:36.280]  but there is a stirring of conflict in the middle east
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:40.120]  and throwing out their old you know minions like mubarak
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:43.480]  what is behind that is that just part of order out of chaos linden
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:47.480]  that's the orchestration the way you control you have to look at the seven
[03:25:47.480 --> 03:25:52.120]  years war principle as it was represented in the 1763
[03:25:52.120 --> 03:25:55.800]  the seven years war principle has been the basis of the operations of the
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:01.160]  british empire ever since that date and they always play the same game
[03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:04.680]  get the other parties to quarrel among themselves
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:08.680]  and when they're weakened by their mutual quarreling come in as an imperial force
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:12.440]  and take impose powerful above that's the way they do it
[03:26:12.440 --> 03:26:16.360]  it's always been the same and people are corrupted because they've become
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:21.240]  involved with mistaken passions they're so eager to fight with somebody
[03:26:21.240 --> 03:26:25.880]  else who may be mistaken but is not the real enemy
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:29.160]  the enemy is the way guys waiting for the two competences
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:33.480]  to be knocked down by their mutual exactly there's always a third or fourth
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:35.480]  or fifth player and you go back to Rothschild's
[03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:38.600]  always funding both sides of a war that's how it worked
[03:26:38.600 --> 03:26:42.280]  and then and then and then owning media on both sides
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:45.720]  playing the two off against each other it's so elementary
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:49.240]  and and and they want all of what's left of christendom
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:52.920]  and islam to kill each other and it's just it needs not happen
[03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:57.560]  yes precisely and the point is they're so discredited presently
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:02.440]  that if there's sufficient power mobilized by a leading group of people
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:06.360]  that from different parts of the society to agree we're not going to do this
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:11.080]  nonsense anymore that's all is required and that's why
[03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:15.640]  gutless candidates for president who will not deliver
[03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:19.480]  president if presidential candidates will which will not be what's needed
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:23.640]  but compromise and make compromises which sell us out
[03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:29.800]  it takes as we did it with pearl harbor we reacted to pearl harbor properly
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:34.120]  we won the war and if we if but for truman's follies
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:37.560]  with that was various people but for truman's follies
[03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:41.320]  we'd have still won the war for not for only for ourselves
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:45.320]  but for the planet as a whole well expanding on that it's all coming to
[03:27:45.320 --> 03:27:49.000]  ahead there's no doubt the global social engineers
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:53.400]  are trying to orchestrate a giant multi-region war as the rand corporation
[03:27:53.400 --> 03:27:58.040]  says and nuclear weapons are in the cards it is it is insane
[03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:01.240]  let me know roose thank you for the extended hour and 20 minute
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:08.920]  interview lovrushapak.com or 800-929-7566 thank you so much sir

[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:24.680]  and i've got all this other news i'm going to cover a lot of it on the nightly
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:28.840]  news tonight i didn't get to i mean it's just it's getting bonkers crazy
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:34.120]  how fast all this stuff is happening everything we were worried about
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:37.640]  everything that we were concerned about it's it's either
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:43.640]  happened or is happening and more to come it just
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:48.200]  if you think stuff's crazy now we have just begun
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:54.840]  the slide down into what is the new dark age and and the globalist
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:58.200]  write white papers about a post-industrial world and you know and
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:02.680]  they've sold us to love torture and corruption and abortion and death and
[03:29:02.680 --> 03:29:07.400]  war and just and all this evil and when you're young you think oh people that
[03:29:07.400 --> 03:29:10.760]  don't want you to have sin they just don't want you to have a good time
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:14.680]  the there's not a good time in all this sin
[03:29:14.680 --> 03:29:21.480]  okay they sell sin like it's sexy but it always
[03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:26.200]  sin means you're concerned with petty garbage you worship idols that don't
[03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:30.440]  deliver sin leads to the end of the family the
[03:29:30.440 --> 03:29:34.440]  end of decency the end of just everything wholesome
[03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:37.960]  we need goodliness a word people make fun of
[03:29:37.960 --> 03:29:43.400]  we need to try to be good men lord knows we're already so corrupt if you don't
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:46.360]  try to be good you will go directly to the devil
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:50.360]  i mean it's a struggle and people that don't struggle against evil
[03:29:50.360 --> 03:30:06.280]  give in to it
