[01:59.960 --> 02:05.720]  United States you got to take vaccines it's all a giant hoax and when you find
[02:05.720 --> 02:12.760]  out most zoning laws or hoaxes or don't exist or are misapplied when you find
[02:12.760 --> 02:18.680]  out there's no law to take vaccines it's all based on con artist fraud but they
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.440]  will still send you to prison for not even breaking a law they send people to
[02:24.440 --> 02:28.200]  jail for political signs in their yards under zoning when they're not even
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.000]  under the zoning they arrest people for giving police Ron Paul videos and take
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.400]  them to trial this is how America operates ladies and gentlemen they'll
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.200]  say you gave somebody Iran this is on record a Ron Paul video of him speaking

[10:13.440 --> 10:16.960]  arrogant think the public is so dumbed down watching their football and
[10:16.960 --> 10:20.920]  basketball and baseball and just trying to make ends meet and putting their kids
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.240]  on prozac and riddling that they're not going to pay attention to what's
[10:25.240 --> 10:35.600]  happening the establishment can bring us into crises economic societal military
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.920]  so big that people will get into such fear they'll just sit back and say okay
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.520]  we're turning off the thinking process we'll do whatever you want you want to
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.600]  put youth brigades on the streets you want to put titles tail squads on the
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.800]  streets you want to have federalized local private groups that forcibly
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.720]  inspect your home and ranches and farms and control every facet of your life and
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.160]  do environmental audits weekly on you do it because most of you out there are
[11:01.160 --> 11:05.520]  going to have jobs in this grid they're converting the old wreckage of the free
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.320]  market that the system that the establishment used to consolidate power
[11:09.320 --> 11:14.040]  into a vertically integrated parasite economy a police state economy owned by
[11:14.040 --> 11:19.520]  them complete conversion see first they get you the industrialized independent
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.000]  on a global system and a mercantile system where different forms of
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.520]  manufacturing are in different sectors of the world this is on record David
[11:26.520 --> 11:30.320]  Rockefeller brags about it they put out movies in the 70s throwing in your face
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.920]  how they run it like a rollerball where this city's energy and that city's
[11:34.920 --> 11:42.680]  finance and this city's manufacturing and this city's media where they're
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.520]  phasing out the books and everything's on the computers and in the first phase
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.520]  they let there be free information only to destroy the old infrastructure of
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.320]  paper media then they're going to clamp down and shut down the free internet
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.640]  only have certain control grid news where there'll be no local media to even
[11:58.640 --> 12:02.920]  counteract what's coming in from the central command systems it's all a
[12:02.920 --> 12:09.760]  master game of advanced mega chess with tens of thousands of pieces in flow
[12:09.760 --> 12:18.120]  algorithm computers with specialized idiot savants in key positions running
[12:18.120 --> 12:26.000]  the game with overall generalist masterminds coordinating amongst
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.760]  themselves and fine-tuning a master program it is a formidable group of
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.520]  master psychopaths operating against free humanity but if you break your
[12:37.520 --> 12:43.760]  conditioning turn on you're in you're in eight survival mode jack in to the
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.640]  higher levels of cognitive analysis realize its game on realize the game
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.000]  they're playing the system you're in you can learn it very quick there are more
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.280]  of us than there aren't them and we can defeat the matrix grid that's being set
[12:59.280 --> 13:05.920]  up this is the beginning of the matrix being built and I don't mean the matrix
[13:05.920 --> 13:12.160]  they're talking about I mean the Pentagon matrix just Google that you'll read
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.920]  documents from the 60s where they describe a matrix of control a matrix of
[13:16.920 --> 13:27.160]  false news a matrix of disinformation the head of CIA counterintelligence I was
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.400]  watching a documentary from the 90s on history channel called inside the CIA and
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.440]  they were admitting the matrix false reality grid they're trying to lay down
[13:36.440 --> 13:41.920]  over the world in the American people where they feed on their own people and
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.720]  live in a culture of lies and deceit and fear where they burn their own minions
[13:46.720 --> 13:52.000]  and the CIA itself is just one titular head of a larger complex most the real
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.160]  intelligence and spying and murdering and espionage being carried out by private
[13:56.160 --> 14:03.720]  merc forces and they were four thousand dollar suits they fly around the world
[14:03.720 --> 14:14.360]  in their Gulfstream jets and they lay siege to free humanity so that's coming
[14:14.360 --> 14:21.240]  up today climate bill set for vote deal is reached in the wall street journal
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.920]  Rupert Murdoch owned Rupert Murdoch on record pledging his entire media empire
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.640]  to set up the global carbon tax and the media puts out these little narratives
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.120]  to manipulate people especially women oh he didn't believe in it till his wife
[14:35.120 --> 14:41.200]  his new wife convinced him and now he cares about the earth now he's a mouth
[14:41.200 --> 14:50.000]  piece for the Rothschild Rockefeller Saxe Coburg goth a crime syndicate the
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.320]  NFL says global warming's real Exxon mobile says it's real and calls for world tax
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.360]  and they're gonna give it to you this is absolute bondage where you will pay
[15:02.360 --> 15:08.280]  your taxes directly into the coffers of private interest hundreds of new taxing
[15:08.280 --> 15:12.440]  private authorities government money federal state international your tax
[15:12.440 --> 15:19.040]  money going to build Al Gore's new tin can car company and why not why shouldn't
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.080]  he say he invented the internet we had nothing to do with it why shouldn't he
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.800]  say global warming's man made when it's the sun and a normal 12 year cycle why
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.880]  shouldn't he why shouldn't he say he built the earth they you know they say
[15:33.880 --> 15:41.200]  that Kim Jong-il's father basically created the planet in North Korea why not
[15:41.200 --> 15:49.020]  have total insanity why not just believe anything I give you the analogy the
[15:49.020 --> 15:55.560]  parable the parallel of the Aztecs just one dominant group in the Mayan
[15:55.560 --> 16:02.160]  civilization at the end of its golden era and its collapse and if you were
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.640]  teleported back a thousand years ago and saw the smoke rising and people
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.480]  sacrificing their own children hundreds and hundreds a day but that was the
[16:09.480 --> 16:12.920]  main meat supply and that they the priest class funded themselves
[16:12.920 --> 16:18.160]  predominantly off the sale of human flesh in the markets you would think
[16:18.160 --> 16:22.040]  that was insane but if you were there amongst those lunatics you would be the
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.780]  lunatic this is the key to it and Carl Rove when he was in front of the New
[16:26.780 --> 16:33.220]  York Times and the Washington Post at a cocktail party they said but hundreds of
[16:33.220 --> 16:36.480]  thousands of Iraqis are dead this was only a year and a half in the invasion
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.960]  now it's over a million 300,000 and it really there were no WMD's and he said
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.680]  you don't get it he laughed at him he said you don't count anymore even you
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.600]  our slaves don't we tell you what reality is today you go report it and
[16:49.600 --> 16:52.560]  then tomorrow we'll completely change it again and you'll do it because you
[16:52.560 --> 16:58.040]  don't count we're history's actors now and the arrogant power tripping New
[16:58.040 --> 17:05.280]  York Times Washington Post black op CIA Nellie's didn't like hearing they
[17:05.280 --> 17:12.640]  weren't important anymore that it wasn't a nuanced twisting of society that the
[17:12.640 --> 17:17.040]  old facade of oh well we're still the good guys and if we don't take over
[17:17.040 --> 17:21.560]  somebody else will know it was all look it's all false reality Winston shut up
[17:21.560 --> 17:27.040]  and report whatever I say if 24 hours ago we say we've always been at war with
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.280]  East Asia and when I tell you to 24 hours later we've never been at war with
[17:31.280 --> 17:35.120]  East Asia you're gonna report it you understand you're just a monkey a
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.760]  grocer you do what I say you understand you don't count you don't like hearing
[17:39.760 --> 17:45.800]  that do you spooks you don't like not feeling important when I get up here on

[33:29.600 --> 33:36.800]  know when I first got into this person 15 years ago 16 years ago I was going to
[33:36.800 --> 33:43.400]  city council meetings kind of mainline Republican defend the second amendment
[33:43.400 --> 33:47.240]  don't let the city council steal all these ranches and farms claiming it was
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.640]  for the water supply on the aquifer and then turning around and openly taking
[33:51.640 --> 33:57.440]  the building restrictions off after they had seized the property and building
[33:57.440 --> 34:04.000]  hotels golf courses five-star resorts huge developments openly run by the
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.320]  city council people and mayors just absolute criminal activity and
[34:08.320 --> 34:14.960]  everybody's face I got involved and then 14 years ago got on access TV and then a
[34:14.960 --> 34:21.600]  year later in 1996 got a radio show here locally fell right in my lap they were
[34:21.600 --> 34:32.760]  about to switch formats from rock and roll to talk on 98 9 kjfk it's Spanish
[34:32.760 --> 34:43.040]  music now not even the kind I like the mariachi music it's like that pop stuff
[34:43.040 --> 34:50.240]  I don't like English pop really either so say la vie the issue is the point is
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.240]  that when I got on the air I knew about the Federal Reserve the New World War
[34:55.240 --> 35:00.000]  and a little bit about eugenics and I thought it was amazing levels of evil
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.200]  and corruption and I knew maybe one one hundredth maybe of what I knew now and
[35:09.200 --> 35:12.640]  everything I talk about documented on the record folks and I'm sorry it sounds
[35:12.640 --> 35:20.840]  horrific and horrifying it's admitted fact and we're going into a totally
[35:20.840 --> 35:26.480]  engineered totally managed organized top-down society that will make the
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.280]  Soviet Union and mouse China look freewheeling and libertarian and when I
[35:31.280 --> 35:43.480]  say that I mean it and the evidence is legion now I'm gonna go over climate
[35:43.480 --> 35:49.080]  bill set for vote after deal is reached Wall Street Journal ABC News Obama we
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.560]  will get health care reform this year reform people think of the word reform
[35:53.560 --> 35:57.160]  is good if you run out in front of a Mack truck and it splatters you all over
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.440]  the cement hitting you at 80 miles an hour you're reformed reform just means
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.400]  change see but they've changed the semantical meaning people like oh I want
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.000]  it fixed I want some free health care and Obama's like you know only 20% don't
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.160]  have it and I know 80% don't want it but you know we got to take care of people
[36:14.160 --> 36:18.640]  they're not gonna take care of you they're gonna give you eugenics you're
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.720]  gonna get an aspirin for a heart attack like the Native Americans get you're
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.440]  gonna get sterilized oh you want your health care man well the CPS has got to
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.640]  talk to you first about this baby you're about to have I mean this is what it
[36:31.640 --> 36:36.040]  means oh god I don't want to go into bondage folks I hate these people I
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.960]  hate how they get away with all this corruption it's a sick joke how much more
[36:39.960 --> 36:43.320]  do they have to get away with you think government's bad now you ain't seen
[36:43.320 --> 36:51.240]  nothing yet this is real I mean what I'm saying I said what I meant and I'm
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.680]  faithful a hundred percent ladies and gentlemen I document everything at
[36:54.680 --> 36:59.560]  info wars dot com and present planet dot com and then we're gonna get into all
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.080]  the water grabbing and everything else and take your calls in the zoning trying
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.480]  to take everybody's property and harassing everybody I mean it just it's
[37:07.480 --> 37:12.240]  just mind-blowing I couldn't believe it when I found out they were stealing old
[37:12.240 --> 37:16.360]  people's houses in Austin that they had a database of when they were critically
[37:16.360 --> 37:22.080]  ill with cancer or heart attacks when they were either widowed or widower or
[37:22.080 --> 37:28.480]  single and they have special units of cops that come around and arrest the
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.000]  old people and then they put leans on their houses and foreclose on them
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.880]  they'll run up in two weeks a $14,000 bill on rolling Ellingston I mean these
[37:38.880 --> 37:45.960]  people are as criminal as hell itself I just can't believe that was 15 years ago
[37:45.960 --> 37:51.840]  I just hate these they just get away with evil and I got to watch TV ads and
[37:51.840 --> 37:57.040]  everything worshiping the government paid for with our tax money it's broke
[37:57.040 --> 38:03.520]  we're disgusting we're filthy let's admit what we are have some mourning for
[38:03.520 --> 38:06.640]  what we've turned into have some repentance so we can change what we've
[38:06.640 --> 38:20.040]  turned into and then there's this I'm gonna cover this first for the next 20
[38:20.040 --> 38:28.560]  minutes with Paul Joseph Watson Obama claims CIA involvement in Iran patently
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.600]  false and we've got the clip I forgot to send it to you guys well you YouTube
[38:32.600 --> 38:38.840]  Obama says CIA not in Iran I meant to send it to you this morning I forgot
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.040]  you know just so people can hear the guy saying it before we go over this
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.800]  because because Paul Watson wrote a detailed two-page report that that's
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.640]  each paragraph's got links to their own admissions but this doesn't even cover
[38:55.640 --> 39:01.720]  half of we need some master article Paul that then shows how the BBC put out
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.600]  fake photos and admits it and how Bush put the executive order out to call for
[39:06.600 --> 39:13.440]  revolution and destabilization and because I mean you you read Paul's
[39:13.440 --> 39:18.360]  article it proves this is staged in Iran but there's even more proof and look
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.200]  I don't have a dog in this fight I don't like big government itself almost all
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.360]  government is extremely corrupt in all times in history the moolahs are
[39:27.360 --> 39:32.000]  involved in all sorts of corruption and controlling the economy and profiting
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.520]  for their families standard are they one one hundredth as systematic as
[39:36.520 --> 39:40.400]  scientific and evil and tyranny no they actually rationalize what they do in
[39:40.400 --> 39:43.880]  their ideologues and believe in what they're doing that's what the globalists
[39:43.880 --> 39:48.400]  absolutely hate them they just absolutely can't stand them and the
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.000]  government's are involved in all sorts of corruption and problems and we're on
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.200]  record about that the point is Iran's been overthrown twice by the United
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.720]  States in England on record that's at CIA history you go to CIA.gov and they
[39:59.720 --> 40:02.840]  brag about it now they staged terror attacks and blamed it on the government
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.240]  last time they staged terror attacks on Mosque blamed it on Mohammed Mosadek
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.760]  the secular leader overthrew it then double-crossed the moolahs and put in
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.320]  the Shah whose son they're trying to put in right now and they're gonna
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.840]  discredit this new guy who it turns out is the commander of the Beirut bombings
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.520]  the attacks on the Marines the real terrorist leader but then before that
[40:27.520 --> 40:34.440]  the foreign secretary agent to the U.S. so he's the guy involved in Iran
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.040]  Contra too so this guy's a total spook
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.280]  Mosawi is a piece of work so I wanted Paul to chronicle all of this and run
[40:48.280 --> 40:53.320]  through it right now because he can do it in a measured focused manner I'm
[40:53.320 --> 40:58.160]  always pausing to gasp for breath just how amazing this is so the bottom line
[40:58.160 --> 41:03.960]  is that girl gets killed people get killed it's terrible it's horrible just
[41:03.960 --> 41:06.960]  like when the police shoot people in the face after the Red Sox victory and the
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.960]  young woman bleeds to death and the police seal the footage of that they
[41:11.960 --> 41:14.400]  don't want to show you dead and dying Iraq is they don't want to show you the
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.240]  globalist-funded al Qaeda blowing up mosque and school buses in Iran and the
[41:19.240 --> 41:22.560]  White House admitting they did it and Obama continuing what Bush did that's
[41:22.560 --> 41:29.920]  on record this is all meant not to bring down Iran it's meant to create an
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.440]  image of demonization for the Iranian government so it can be toppled with
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.840]  military bombardment and then even if the Mullahs can stay in power it will then
[41:38.840 --> 41:43.680]  knock them back to the Stone Age and that's what the globalists want they
[41:43.680 --> 41:47.200]  don't want any industrialized first world nation and Iran is a glistening
[41:47.200 --> 41:51.480]  beautiful country in many cases that looks cleaner and more modern than
[41:51.480 --> 41:56.440]  Chicago or New York they do not want it and they want to blow it to a kingdom
[41:56.440 --> 42:00.680]  come like they did Serbia and they used al Qaeda to attack Serbia and when
[42:00.680 --> 42:05.120]  Serbia fought back they said oh my gosh look they're murdering innocent
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.200]  Muslims and it's a setup ladies and gentlemen it's a setup it always is
[42:11.200 --> 42:20.000]  it's divide and conquer they use Sunni against Shiite in Iran and Shiite
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.400]  against Sunni in Iran Sunni against Shiite same thing Shiite against Sunni
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.840]  back and forth all manipulation all to knock that country out and then a lot
[42:31.840 --> 42:37.120]  of Americans go well that's where we stay on top USA number one we've been
[42:37.120 --> 42:43.240]  used to fund this we get the blame it's offshore globalists kamikazeing us into
[42:43.240 --> 42:46.240]  these countries everybody knows the US and England are funding and running all
[42:46.240 --> 42:54.960]  this and then Obama gets up on TV he gets up on TV and says this is
[42:54.960 --> 43:01.840]  ridiculous Paul Watson I mean Obama I Obama a month ago was doing overtures
[43:01.840 --> 43:04.840]  to Iran of peace and I'm on record I wish listeners would find the clip was I
[43:04.840 --> 43:08.320]  don't have a staff to do it but I've been on the air over and over again when
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.640]  he did that overture to Iran I said they're gonna attack Iran or stage a
[43:11.640 --> 43:16.080]  revolution anytime he does something it's the opposite he tells you he doesn't
[43:16.080 --> 43:18.920]  introduce gun bills that's all he does he tells you he's not gonna grab your
[43:18.920 --> 43:21.760]  property it's all he does he tells you there's no compulsory service they try
[43:21.760 --> 43:24.880]  to pass the bills they he tells you he's not gonna hire any lobbyists that's all
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.080]  he does is hire lobbyists he tells you everything he says is a lie Paul Watson
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.720]  hello Ali it's good to be back hey bro god so break it down for us your
[43:35.720 --> 43:39.720]  excellent article Obama claims CIA involvement I ran patently false break
[43:39.720 --> 43:45.520]  it down well that's right a few days ago Obama admitted to the fact that the
[43:45.520 --> 43:51.520]  1953 overthrow of the democratically elected government of Mosa-Dark in
[43:51.520 --> 43:59.680]  Iran was accomplished by means of the CIA now that fact is documented
[43:59.680 --> 44:06.000]  historical fact it's not disputed anymore and yet there are some neocons
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.960]  who like to hang out at the Free Republic site which I came across when I was
[44:10.960 --> 44:17.600]  researching this again earlier today who still deny the fact that the CIA was
[44:17.600 --> 44:24.040]  even involved in the 1953 overthrow of Mosa-Dark so that's the level of
[44:24.040 --> 44:28.840]  denial going on and then with this question that's because they hate they
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.280]  hate radical Muslims so much they can't believe the radical Muslims are the
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.760]  sword of the New World Order the sword of victory over all free societies right
[44:38.760 --> 44:44.640]  and then with the question about is the CIA involved in the current unrest one
[44:44.640 --> 44:50.440]  of the first links to pop up if you research that in Google is this Free
[44:50.440 --> 44:56.400]  Republic thread where somebody post an article asking are the CIA involved as
[44:56.400 --> 45:03.240]  well explain it's not even debatable but then the responses to it are I don't
[45:03.240 --> 45:07.800]  care I hope the CIA are involved I certainly won't shed a tear if they
[45:07.800 --> 45:14.040]  are another one says I certainly hope so of course they are and they're actually
[45:14.040 --> 45:19.440]  this is a horrible irony of it all they're not that we support armored
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.560]  integer and we've had to emphasize that over and over again because some people
[45:23.560 --> 45:28.800]  have difficulty holding more than one thought in the head at one time but these
[45:28.800 --> 45:38.440]  neocons are supporting Mootavi who in the 80s as you mentioned earlier directed
[45:38.440 --> 45:45.600]  the terrorist campaign and selected the terrorist to carry out the Beirut
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.680]  barracks bombing and others in the 1980s they love it guy this is the guy who
[45:51.680 --> 46:00.320]  oversaw the murder of hundreds of u.s. Marines 220 u.s. Marines died in the
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.760]  Beirut barracks bombing that was directed by Mootavi and all these
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.880]  neocons are now supporting him and saying that good the CIA should overthrow
[46:09.880 --> 46:14.480]  armored integer and put in the very regime that slaughtered hundreds of u.s.
[46:14.480 --> 46:24.320]  Marines in the 80s so you have that going on then you've got talking heads on
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.520]  establishment media news networks who have suddenly found this new concern for
[46:30.520 --> 46:36.560]  the mistreatment of protesters which is obviously absent whenever it's anybody
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.360]  protesting against the war in Iraq well here's an example in China all over the
[46:41.360 --> 46:45.280]  place the police are caught dealing drugs killing people running mafia ops
[46:45.280 --> 46:49.640]  whole cities are falling to the Chinese people the police are machine gunning
[46:49.640 --> 46:53.360]  them we have all the YouTube videos of them shooting people attacking
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.600]  villagers and none of our news will carry it because they love China they
[46:57.600 --> 47:01.440]  won't show a young girl bleeding to death there in fact or they'll show them
[47:01.440 --> 47:05.120]  choking some woman taken her to a mobile execution van saying it's good or
[47:05.120 --> 47:11.120]  melting people's flesh down for cosmetics sold in finer cosmetic stores in
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.160]  the u.s. exactly they only show somebody dying in a tragic way when it aids them
[47:17.160 --> 47:22.120]  so they can blow entire skyscrapers up with giant 2,000-pound smart bombs
[47:22.120 --> 47:25.960]  blowing women and children into little pieces then the neocons will say they
[47:25.960 --> 47:31.600]  love it oh but right now they're so upset for her oh I mean again ladies and
[47:31.600 --> 47:35.720]  gentlemen it's a giant chess game they want to overthrow Iran they admit they
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.600]  were in there trying to start revolutions they admit they said that this guy the
[47:41.600 --> 47:48.200]  opposition leader lost well first they were saying he won two hours before the
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.400]  polls close then the government comes out and said no he lost this is all a
[47:52.400 --> 47:58.760]  pure setup and Alex you've got former CIA head on the news there was one on
[47:58.760 --> 48:03.680]  wolf blitz of the other day you know saying that we should track all the
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.000]  mistreatment of the protesters because there's a brutal regime in place that
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.880]  tortures protesters and dissidents a former CIA head it was the CIA that
[48:13.880 --> 48:20.960]  trained savak after the 1953 overthrow train them in torture techniques that
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.440]  they'd copied from the Nazis but now the CIA is all concerned about how
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.320]  dissidents in Iran are treated now obviously we don't want anyone to be
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.600]  mistreated but it shows the rampant level of hypocrisy involved it's totally
[48:35.600 --> 48:41.920]  insane and now the stooge son of the Shaw keeps crying like Glenn Beck on TV
[48:41.920 --> 48:45.960]  with fake crying saying he's so sad for this girl when his father murdered at
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.920]  least 300,000 people ripping children's tongues out in front of their parents on
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.600]  record the CIA is running around torturing everybody but oh with no
[48:54.600 --> 48:59.300]  proof oh they might be torturing this is the just discussed and now boiling up
[48:59.300 --> 49:04.280]  the Marines is good yeah the neocons now support a terrorist who killed
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.960]  hundreds of u.s. Marines that's patriotic now I guess now that the
[49:08.960 --> 49:16.080]  election itself there was an independent American pollster nonprofit
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.400]  organization that went in their days before the election and they published
[49:20.400 --> 49:26.840]  their results on June 15th in the Washington Post they found through their
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.480]  polls prior to the election the armored integer was leading by more than a two
[49:32.480 --> 49:38.000]  to one margin because he was doing an anti-corruption campaign against the
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.960]  other group that is one of the most powerful factions Ahmed energy was
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.960]  actually popular with the people weak with the elite exactly it's the rich
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.240]  elite in Iran that support mousavi but they found that and this is an
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.400]  independent Emmy award-winning American polling company this is not Iranian
[49:57.400 --> 50:02.080]  state TV and they found that armored integer was going to win by a bigger
[50:02.080 --> 50:08.120]  margin than he actually did and in fact his strongest voting block was people
[50:08.120 --> 50:13.680]  aged from 18 to 24 now you've got some the westernized youth and some of the
[50:13.680 --> 50:19.120]  university graduates that are supporting mousavi for their own reasons and then
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.920]  you've got direct blatant CIA involvement which Obama denied yet is
[50:24.920 --> 50:32.640]  admitted and on the record 2007 ABC News London Telegraph and others reported
[50:32.640 --> 50:37.400]  that President Bush had given the CIA approval to launch covert black
[50:37.400 --> 50:43.200]  operations to achieve regime change in Iran stay there yeah it's on record and
[50:43.200 --> 50:48.720]  they admitted four groups three of them Sunni Wahhabi is with the number three
[50:48.720 --> 50:53.240]  in al-Qaeda launching attacks in Iran oh our news didn't show those blown-up
[50:53.240 --> 51:01.280]  school buses and mosque and dams oh no they don't do that they love al-Qaeda

[53:06.960 --> 53:10.400]  and everybody you know here's the story the current administration is committed
[53:10.400 --> 53:14.200]  to nationalizing health care giving 40 million new people free care now here's
[53:14.200 --> 53:17.520]  the bad news the current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by
[53:17.520 --> 53:21.280]  these new demands for free services and procedures Medicare and Medicaid are
[53:21.280 --> 53:24.920]  already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by
[53:24.920 --> 53:28.840]  the prospect of forced procedures all this is creating a perfect storm which
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.040]  could create unimaginable shortages in the health care services folks it's time
[53:33.040 --> 53:36.400]  to be prepared for the worst our friends at solutions from science have
[53:36.400 --> 53:39.920]  recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.680]  you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home it's
[53:43.680 --> 53:47.880]  called herbal preparations and natural therapies and is flat out the best course
[53:47.880 --> 53:51.760]  of its kind I recommend you visit this important new website at make herbal
[53:51.760 --> 53:59.800]  medicines.com that's make herbal medicines.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[53:59.800 --> 54:04.560]  I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the
[54:04.560 --> 54:11.240]  Islamic Republic of Iran and is not interfering with Iran's affairs but we
[54:11.240 --> 54:15.280]  must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian people
[54:15.280 --> 54:20.560]  into a remarkable opening within Iranian society we deploy the violence
[54:20.560 --> 54:26.480]  against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place you can run on for a
[54:26.480 --> 54:35.440]  long time run on for a long time run on for a long time it's just so insulting
[54:35.440 --> 54:45.360]  Paul Watson from president planet.com to have the CIA announce really it was
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.280]  first the news six years ago after the forces were in Iraq that they were
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.400]  destabilizing Iran creating revolutionary groups in the students while at the
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.600]  same time applying pressure on the government from Sunni Wahhabi groups and
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.480]  then two and a half years ago they went ahead and the White House put a
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.080]  press release out and said yeah we're staging terror attacks over there and
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.120]  then it's admitted they're bombing mosques with people in them blowing them
[55:09.120 --> 55:14.520]  all up blowing up Shiites I mean just outrageous crimes and the public so
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.680]  dumbed down they can't find Iran on a map I keep getting emails going I long I
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.600]  want to kill you Alex you just love them camel riders them Arabs they're not
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.200]  Arabs dummies they're more closely to you know Pakistanis or Indians and they
[55:27.200 --> 55:34.040]  are Arabs they're Persians but all I'm doing is saying it's a lie the CIA
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.040]  admits they're there but they're so arrogant that the CIA admits they're
[55:38.040 --> 55:41.240]  there doing it and then go on the news and say they're not I mean it's all
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.720]  about insulting you whether you want Iran to be nuked or not and hate him and
[55:45.720 --> 55:49.600]  want to kill every one of them I mean why just go along with the lie though
[55:49.600 --> 55:54.680]  because it's all part of just being a bunch of morons and the fake conservatives
[55:54.680 --> 55:57.440]  it just reminds me how disgusting they are because I got them emailing me and
[55:57.440 --> 56:02.200]  stuff going oh now you love the Iranians and they'll even say that blew up our
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.520]  barracks while they're supporting the very guy that actually admittedly ran
[56:06.520 --> 56:14.200]  the operation I mean you people are it's total 1984 it's more extreme Paul the
[56:14.200 --> 56:20.520]  1984 the double think the crime stop the and there's so many other points of how
[56:20.520 --> 56:24.160]  this is staged in the poll show it was Ahmed Denizide and people don't know that
[56:24.160 --> 56:32.440]  this guy was really the insider the Masawi please continue Paul yeah we
[56:32.440 --> 56:36.400]  were just talking about the fact that an American polling company went into Iran
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.640]  before the election and according to their studies from an investigation
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.480]  conducted in Farsi they found that Ahmed Denizide was probably going to win by
[56:47.480 --> 56:52.520]  more than a two-to-one margin he won the he won but with a less than two to one
[56:52.520 --> 56:59.960]  margin now before the polls had even closed Musavi was out in the media
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.440]  saying that he'd won not only before they finished counting the votes but
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.360]  before the polling it even closed because it ran over by a few hours it
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.240]  ran late so you've got Musavi claiming he's already won when all the previous
[57:13.240 --> 57:18.120]  poll to play it be easily defeated it be trounced and let's explain this let's
[57:18.120 --> 57:23.440]  explain this the ruling council of experts they decide who can run and
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.040]  international groups that look at elections say they're some of the
[57:26.040 --> 57:32.680]  fairest in the world because it's rigged to begin with they allow you to run so
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.640]  folks you got to find out where Iran is on a map you got to find out about their
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.440]  the Islamic Republic system you got to learn about the ruling council of
[57:40.440 --> 57:46.040]  mullahs this is stage this is this is a tempest in a teapot just like they said
[57:46.040 --> 57:48.880]  where's the missing governor when they knew the whole time to just it you know
[57:48.880 --> 57:55.360]  to discredit him I mean this is a staged event period Watson go ahead well
[57:55.360 --> 58:02.200]  Alex not only the most ignorant neocons think that Iranians are Arabs they think
[58:02.200 --> 58:08.880]  that Ahmadinejad is a dictator when in fact he is selected as he just said by
[58:08.880 --> 58:14.560]  the ruling guardian council as was new savvy they selected both candidates so
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.200]  why would they need to rig an election in which they select both candidates in
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.160]  the first place so you've got Musavi saying he's going to win before the
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.960]  votes are even before the pollings even closed then you've got these SMS
[58:28.960 --> 58:34.160]  messages the text messages being sent to Iranians also before the polls are
[58:34.160 --> 58:38.680]  closed as well as Twitter account yes stay there we're going to break the rest
[58:38.680 --> 58:42.040]  of it down then get all the guests on in five minutes

[59:52.840 --> 1:00:00.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:28.960]  Alex Jones Paul Watson wrote another excellent article NADA the poster girl
[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:34.800]  for a million more tragedies and manipulate your emotions ladies and
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:40.920]  gentlemen this is really for the outside of Iran it
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:46.120]  destabilizes it hurts Iran it allows the globalist to launch military strikes
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:49.880]  even if that doesn't happen it discredits the moral why because the public is
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:53.920]  dumbed down they don't even know how the political system works over there but
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:59.200]  the CIA is on record doing this and yes CIA commanded Twitter the State
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.760]  Department on record admits they're doing it with Twitter giving Twitter orders
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:09.480]  that's that's in the New York Times it's so sick to see these bankers
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:14.720]  manipulate this and get all these people killed knowing that when people attack
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:19.360]  police and start burning their police stations they're gonna shoot them it's
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:25.360]  just Paul it's so disgusting now the the hero is the guy that blew up the barracks
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.240]  just like now they tell us Gaddafi's a hero no I don't like this guy and I don't
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.080]  like Gaddafi either and if you want to say I'm al-Qaeda because I don't like
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:39.240]  Gaddafi and I don't like this Musaoui guy then that's fine I mean that's how
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:43.800]  warped these people's minds are Paul that's right they're supporting the guy
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:49.320]  who helped kill 220 U.S. Marines. Gaddafi launching the attacks over there
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:53.920]  I'll recap everything I'm gonna shut up tell folks about the article. Yeah the
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:59.560]  New York Times are supporting the terrorist John Duller organization which
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:05.400]  is being bankrolled as part of this CIA incursion into Iran this destabilization
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:10.360]  campaign they've bombed buses they've bombed campaign headquarters they've
[1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:15.200]  killed scores of people they're working to destabilize the Iranian government on
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:20.520]  behalf of the CIA this is all admitted they're funding the Mujahideen e-Calc
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:26.440]  which was once run by Saddam Hussein's intelligence services that's now working
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:30.200]  for the CIA in Iran there were people there were members of that arrested in
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.520]  the riots last week you got the form of Pakistani Army General with the
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:40.120]  document saying that the CIA is distributed $400 million inside Iran
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:47.160]  right before this these riots to evoke the revolution you've got the Twitter
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:52.440]  messages being sent out from accounts that were creators the day before no
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.360]  Twitter alerts were sent out from any of those major accounts before these
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:03:03.160]  riots broke out and it created the myth that there'd been vote fraud when in
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:07.400]  fact the independent polls run before by American polling companies clearly said
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:11.400]  that Ahmadinejad was going to win but because Musavi claimed that he was the
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:15.600]  winner these messages went out to the Iranians before the polls closed saying
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:20.920]  that Musavi had won so then when the official result was announced there
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:25.040]  was this feeling of vote fraud which was manufactured completely out of thin air
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:31.000]  there's no evidence for it and yet the Anglo-American establishment media keep
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:35.440]  citing it and they provided no evidence whatsoever then you've got people like
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:42.520]  Kissinger the other day on BBC Newsnight saying that if the revolution isn't
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:47.320]  successful then basically they're just gonna go in and bomb the heck out of it
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:52.600]  anyway so how could that possibly benefit anyone in Iran no matter who they
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.920]  support the big new admitted that they're quote manipulating things very
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:01.400]  smoothly very sleaze on seeing it admitting they're doing it I know they
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:04.800]  got Obama lying to us when the other mouth laughing at us saying they're
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:08.600]  doing it I mean to the American people up being lied to there you're gonna have
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:12.600]  everything you've got taken to they don't care about you either they don't
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:17.680]  care about the Iranians they don't care about you Paul and you've got John Bolton
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.120]  saying that they're gonna create this revolution many months before you've
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:25.760]  got Kenneth Timmerman who's affiliated with the National Endowment for
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:30.520]  Democracy which is one of these NGOs that funneled money into Iran right in
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:36.240]  the day before the election quote there's talk of a green revolution in Tehran
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:41.240]  and this is when Ahmadinejad predicted to win easily and he's predicting a green
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:46.280]  revolution the day before it happens before all this is set up and he's
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:51.400]  linked him with these NGOs that funneling the money into Iran and Watson you
[1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:55.200]  didn't even hit half the evidence with all my interruptions God bless you will

[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.960]  Iran protest was the butcher of Beirut I just want to point that out that this
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:57.040]  guy's as bad or worse than the people they're trying to overthrow so I don't
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:00.800]  know where this is headed missing governor was in Argentina we'll get into
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.680]  that I will also get into how they're trying to pass the takeover of health
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:11.360]  care in the country and the new carbon taxes so quite a bit as big government
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:15.800]  makes its final move to make us more Soviet and Stalinist Russia I mean it's
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:20.840]  just totally vertically integrated society and part of all of this is
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:26.880]  zoning the internationally at the UN right up these zoning laws the federal
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:31.320]  governments of the world adopt them they have these national association of you
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:34.480]  know zoning and national association of governors and county commissioners and
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:38.040]  city planners and the insurance company so you'll get a discount of you adopt
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:43.960]  these zoning laws and then it's all just a sickening mass and so it's
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:47.240]  happening all over the world not just here where here in Austin they put
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:52.520]  $2,000 a day fines on old people's yards that have three inch grass and then they
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:58.000]  come in two weeks it's 14,000 take it I've seen articles in Denver where
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.040]  Christian groups may have seven people over for a Bible study on Saturday night
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:06.880]  and they come and ticket everybody's cars and ticket the house and they can
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:11.160]  have a strip club party next door and in one case they were having rowdy parties
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:14.440]  next door but that was okay with the strippers dancing on the tables just
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:18.680]  don't have a Bible study they've kicked rabbis meetings out of their own
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:26.040]  houses they're seeing rabbis can't have circumcisions at their at their houses
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.520]  or at other people's houses they can't have a Passover at their houses they
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:33.960]  did nothing just they're telling Muslims they can't have meetings at their
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.120]  houses and they selectively persecute religious groups especially Christians
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:42.400]  just like CPS we've had the lawyers on it's been in the news target homeschooling
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:46.040]  families of Christians they don't like people that aren't in the government
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:49.760]  training centers and you remember this case a month ago in San Diego it wasn't
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:54.680]  even a law they were just misapplying because I've read the code and that's
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:01.120]  why we've got Pastor Dave Jones and that's my daddy's name we've got Pastor
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.880]  Dave Jones on and then we've got his lawyer Dean of Royals on the program
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.040]  with us and they stood up and said no but the issue is you think this zoning is
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:15.440]  bad now wait with the Obama green brigades and the home inspections they're
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:19.720]  passing that the feds won't pass awesome just past it where these little Soviets
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:24.160]  come in your house and do these audits of your of your carbon footprint the
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:29.360]  harassment has only begun so we've got to realize this is standardized zoning is
[1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:33.800]  being used to tyrannize everybody and the bedrock of the First Amendment is
[1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:38.120]  that you can do anything you want in your house even the Magna Carta 1215 a
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.920]  man's home is his castle this even the King of England without a warrant
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:47.920]  couldn't come in your house but I've seen cases in Illinois where people wake
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:51.440]  up with police standing over them they do unannounced home inspections saying
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:56.060]  under zoning laws they don't need a warrant and you wake up and above your
[1:11:56.060 --> 1:12:01.320]  bed this was in the Chicago newspapers in some of the surrounding suburbs do
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.240]  this and then if you have more than two toothbrush two toothbrushes let's say
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:08.840]  your house is zoned for two people to be in it and there's more than two tooth
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:13.400]  brushes not even three people they then find you in your bed I'm not kidding I
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.840]  know you can't believe it it was in local newspapers years ago this stuff is so
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:22.000]  insane and now under this new bill to federalize all water including puddles
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.080]  they say no warrant they're coming on your land remember the wetlands project
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:32.200]  so I'm gonna shut up now 20 give you some background the pastor Dave Jones
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:37.840]  predicts upper sides over a flock in San Diego California he was recently harassed
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:42.920]  for having a prayer group at his home and his lawyer Dean broils men thanks
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:46.400]  for coming on thanks for standing up for the First Amendment thanks for having
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:52.240]  us Alex you had to be with you Alex is Dean broils hey hey Dana and hey
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:56.120]  pastor Dave okay you guys got the floor for the next 20 minutes tell me tell us
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:13:00.880]  what happened what this was like well let me do it in a brief way I guess first
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:07.480]  of all on April 10th of this year a coded enforcement officer came to our house
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:18.040]  and asked us if we had a Bible study and we said of course yes we do my wife did
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:25.120]  and then they they told us that was not permitted use according to the code and
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:29.920]  it was a violation of a religious assembly code and so that was 2100 to
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:36.360]  2106 that's where you find that code section my wife thought they were just
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:41.760]  misunderstood you know that we had just simple Bible study with 15 people and so
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:47.400]  she explained we had dinner and in a Bible study and and prayer and and and
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:53.080]  had dessert and the lady asked her well do you say amen do you say praise the
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:58.680]  Lord do you do you sing and my wife was so shocked she's not sure how she
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:02.440]  actually answered that it was kind of like you know what does that have to do
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:08.120]  with it and then she was very clear and adamant that we had two weeks to comply
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:14.960]  if we did not that there would be a $100 fine for a of the first violation 200
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:18.800]  for the second 500 for the third a thousand for the fourth and then that
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.800]  they would take us to court this was our warning you would not get anything else
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:29.160]  my wife said please send a you know something in writing and so we received
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:35.400]  that a week later and the citation of course is posted on the the Western
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:41.720]  Center for Law and Policy and you can see that on their website it was a ticket
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:47.560]  for citation for a religious assembly and that we would deceased and stop
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:51.160]  religious assembly and by the way I was interesting as I listened to what you
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:57.440]  said Alex 7703 is another section and that's the two sections they quoted and
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:02.240]  the paper that accompanied the citation and I just want to read what it says to
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:07.240]  you because it says any deputy deputized anyone specific individual
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:11.200]  deputized by the director and by the way this is the again the paperwork that
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:16.520]  accompanied the citation it says may arrest a person without warrant whenever
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:22.880]  the director or the authorized deputy has reasonable cause to believe that the
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:26.520]  person arrested has committed an infraction or misdemeanor in the
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:29.640]  presence of the violation of you know they've turned themselves into a new
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:34.440]  law enforcement agency just stomping around declaring themselves with imperial
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:39.200]  godlike powers to to violate free assembly you're allowed to have 15
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:43.000]  people over for dinner and pray and you know you're allowed to beat on drums if
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:48.400]  you want how at the moon I mean this is America right well so that's what they
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:54.480]  said that's the accompanying pages of the citation it was never over a parking
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:58.200]  problem they never said this is a parking problem you know I I yeah basically
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:03.200]  we're god we're gonna arrest you if you don't stop doing this well they definitely
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.160]  said they were gonna find us they didn't verbalize that but they sent it in
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:12.360]  writing that they could unbelievable now now your lawyer and I've read the
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:16.280]  these sections myself this is clearly misapplied and they don't have this
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:21.800]  authority correct oh absolutely we sent them a detailed demand letters about
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:27.200]  11 12 pages long and we made three arguments of first was a common sense
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.160]  argument that second third and fourth were legal arguments but our first
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:39.080]  statement was the clear understanding of both what the ordinance said and what a
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:43.320]  common sense view of church is we see we told them this is clearly not a
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:48.320]  religious assembly is defined by the county ordinances and so therefore the
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:52.880]  requirement of a major use permit which costs tens of thousands of dollars is
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:59.440]  not applicable and and pursuant to their own definitions they defined religious
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.880]  assemblies as bigger gatherings like churches and synagogues etc so they
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:08.760]  were clearly interpreting their own laws and ordinances in a very sweeping and
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:14.320]  overbroad manner and and and applying it to the pastors small home group Bible
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:19.400]  study in a completely inappropriate way secondly we pointed out that their
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:23.960]  their interpretation was violating our clients rights to freely exercise their
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:28.200]  religion thirdly we brought a peaceable assembly and there's other elements of
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:31.960]  the First Amendment which we could have argued also and then fourthly we said
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:36.640]  that the Joneses were protected by the religious land use and institutionalized
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:41.720]  persons act of 2000 which is a law that Congress passed several years ago that
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:46.880]  protects religious individuals in regard to land use so they were clearly
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:50.760]  out of line and as soon as they got their letter the next morning they begged
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:55.400]  to have a meeting with us and we met with them the next day and within within
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:18:00.560]  the next week that the matter was resolved they apologized they promised to
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:06.160]  train their people better and have better use of the people better review of
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:09.200]  the people who were going out writing and applying these kind of tickets and
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:14.480]  citations so it looks like at this point that the county is in full retreat and
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:18.160]  is apologizing and it's gonna correct their ordinances and make it right and
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:22.640]  we're gonna stay on top of them to make sure that that actually occurs sure but
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:27.840]  the moral of the story is and I'm sure Mr. Brauels because you're Laura that
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:30.560]  fights this stuff you know this is going on all over the country that it's
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:34.760]  important for people to stand up and say no because it a lot of people are
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:41.440]  laying down to this and then this abuse of power this color of law fraud by
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:45.440]  these little commas ours is expanding as they flaunt this illegitimate
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.640]  authority everywhere that that's absolutely right and that's one issue
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:55.760]  we faced over the last several years is often it's hard to even talk the
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.520]  potential clients into facing down the government and if we don't do that we're
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:04.640]  gonna end up being in a situation that they're facing in Iran right now
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.760]  where the government is just running roughshod over the rights of the people
[1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:12.080]  and so it's very important that individuals are willing to take a
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:18.000]  stand and say no these are my god-given rights these are my constitutional
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.480]  rights and I'm willing to stand on them to protect others well exactly look at
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:27.040]  how they put us in free speech zones and now are even trying to phase those out
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:33.760]  this is how liberty dies and in little steps are go ahead well I wanted to say
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:38.880]  something that it has been something we've battled since this came you've
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:42.320]  sent it went on the news and what it what it is is they they claimed it was a
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:47.160]  parking complaint and there was a complaint but they never addressed that
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:52.240]  issue and since I've talked to a police officer who can kind of congratulate us
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:55.080]  on our victory in our stay there stay that let me hear the story when we get

[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:58.160]  area and we've been in existence for two and a half years although i've been
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:03.040]  doing this kind of work pro bono on behalf of christians everywhere for
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.080]  the last fourteen years so
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:10.400]  uh... we we uh... were were were based on the west coast but we're getting cases
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:13.400]  all over the united states at this point
[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:15.880]  and you see a lot of this don't you
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:19.360]  all absolutely we see this happening every day in
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:23.800]  and uh... thank god that there's an army of christian attorneys and
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:27.400]  conservative attorneys out there to fight these types of cases there's
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:30.520]  there's several thousand uh... attorneys that have been trained all over the
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:34.800]  united states to fight these types of cases and i've never seen you lose
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:38.560]  uh... to see these reports all the time when people fight but as you said
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:41.720]  most people just roll over
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.500]  i mean this is totally on american incredibly unpopular it's wrong
[1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:47.080]  uh... pastor david jones
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.840]  uh... go back to the police officer story
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.600]  well after this uh... had occurred a police officer uh... that i was a queen
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:58.240]  was saw me and he just congratulated us on a victory and for a stand in that
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.920]  and then he said he asked me about
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:05.160]  if i thought this was an intrusion upon our uh... on our right to religious
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:08.040]  freedom and i said well of course it was absolutely
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:10.960]  and then he explained to me that as a police officer when they get these
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:11.900]  calls
[1:26:11.900 --> 1:26:13.720]  they normally go through dispatch it would
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:17.600]  would not have even made it through dispatch in this case it was weeks
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:19.800]  prior
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:23.320]  by the way the complaint wasn't from a neighbor we only have two neighbors
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:27.840]  we have two hundred sixty eight feet of private driveway to three homes
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:33.240]  and uh... we paid paid for the paving and and uh... maintenance of that road
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:36.720]  and then at the end of two hundred sixty eight feet uh... we have over two
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:39.040]  acres of property ourselves
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:43.200]  we park all of our cars on our property every now and then somebody is parked
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:46.360]  on in that private driveway area but
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  uh...
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:51.200]  the point is that when uh... he told me that you know this should have even
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:53.440]  gotten out of dispatch
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:54.520]  but it
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.720]  somebody else got a hold of this thing
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:57.840]  and uh...
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:00.720]  he said we have gone out on parking uh...
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:03.040]  you know citation complaints
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:06.440]  and uh... you just tell the person to re-park and everything's fine no ticket
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:07.360]  is given
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:10.920]  uh... this was weeks later that they showed up and the only purpose they
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:11.760]  showed up
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:13.200]  was to cite us
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:14.640]  for religious assembly
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:19.480]  assembly it was never discussed in six conversations that we had with them
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:23.680]  as we tried to reason with all that this was just a bible study they never
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:28.120]  brought up parking they only told us we were wrong with the code
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:30.680]  and uh... we had to stop in
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:32.000]  in our bible study
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.840]  let me ask dean broils a question because again i just see this in the
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:38.000]  newspaper here and there every week or so and experienced it myself here in
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:38.920]  austin
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:42.080]  with my grandparents uh... with some brush in a creek behind the house was
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:44.120]  the property
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:47.880]  dealing with the zoning boards at we see a a trend here
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:51.520]  where they love persecuting christians and conservatives
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:53.400]  that it's a relish i mean
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:57.080]  what what type of individuals are these from your experience
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.480]  that really are that anti-american
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:01.720]  because even if i disagree with somebody and hated them
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:04.800]  i mean if they were doing you know some kind of weird animus thing in their
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:05.680]  backyard
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:07.240]  that's their right to do it
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:10.720]  what why do they hate christians
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:13.320]  well that you know that's a very good question and that's a question we've
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:16.240]  been asking ourselves in this case is this
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:19.920]  it you know is this a rogue you know uh...
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.040]  zoning person just out to get christians
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.760]  or is it a departmental uh... issue that there's kind of
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.800]  you know across the board animus against christians and
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.840]  it's really hard to tell i mean certainly at the end of the day the
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:35.920]  county did the right thing and then
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.200]  chief administrative officer apologize and back down and has promised to
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:42.480]  you know investigate this properly but
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.400]  you know it sometimes it's hard to know i i mean generally across the united
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:49.200]  states in the media in other places we see
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.160]  a hostile e towards christianity in general
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:56.880]  and we see uh... uh... a hostile e toward the name of jesus in particular
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:01.440]  and so that definitely is kind of culture wide on a lot of fronts
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:05.120]  and uh... we suspect that that may be an issue here
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:08.520]  but it's really hard to pin down as far as what the motivations of the
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:10.200]  individuals were in this case
[1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.920]  well they would never think of uh...
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:17.480]  you know harassing some other religious group unless it's mainline big three
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:20.480]  religions and it seems like those are open season
[1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.360]  uh... just uh... absolutely amazing well
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:27.760]  i'm glad that this uh... cases has has been concluded are you guys thinking
[1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:30.800]  about any litigation or this is dropped
[1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:34.800]  now at this point if the county follows through on the very strong
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.680]  commitments that they've made
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:40.280]  uh... certainly litigation will not be required and that's one of the amazing
[1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:44.000]  things about this case is because of the media outrage
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.840]  and the amount of individuals who are emailing and writing and calling
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:49.440]  all of them
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:51.240]  got a break

[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:38.200]  it's called tyranny and they certainly use zoning as one of the most abusive

[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:45.640]  all right finishing up with a pastor david jones
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.920]  who presided over a flock of 15 people in outside san diego
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:54.600]  his own property his own parking can't do that in america
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:58.680]  but they stood up and said no and uh the establishment backed off i guess the big
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:02.200]  issue here is for both of you in closing and the closing
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:07.480]  comments from you both is when you you said you had a
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:10.520]  bunch of conversations with the zoning department sounds like at first
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:13.800]  they weren't backing down they were going to go along with this the higher
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:17.240]  ups were backing this yes you're not allowed to have
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:21.160]  15 people over for dinner in america because we're the bureaucrats we're
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:24.200]  your gods you're just here to pay taxes and shut up and
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:28.680]  drink your fluoride water and take your vaccines and provide children for us and
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:34.120]  for the cps to adopt out i mean basically
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:37.480]  you know did they back off immediately or how fast did they back off because
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:40.440]  that's your answer whether or not this was a rogue
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:44.840]  minion or whether this was higher ups because i know it's the higher ups
[1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:47.800]  because i see this all over the country over and over again
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:52.040]  sure exactly right and this is uh dave jones i i wanted to say that because
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:56.360]  it it wasn't a rogue we had six conversations with them we appeal to
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:59.400]  them first when they code enforcement officer came
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:03.880]  second when we got the uh permit we started our the citation
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:09.000]  we started to call them three phone calls we talked to the planning loot
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.360]  land use department and then the zoning department
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:16.280]  and every conversation we had with them we were told
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:19.880]  that we were wrong and that we were not in compliance
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:25.800]  that we had to uh stop the bible study uh this was again it was never a parking
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:30.520]  issue it went on for five weeks before
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:33.800]  the attorney broils and that when we met together
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:38.120]  there were nine people in a room and uh we're at the county's office and they
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:41.160]  were once again positioning themselves
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:45.080]  that it was an issue with religious assembly never brought up
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:49.560]  that it was a parking uh they're just you know they're just hiding behind but
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:54.360]  then their bluff didn't work uh did it to mr broils
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.280]  no absolutely and you're asking about lawsuits or or
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:01.960]  or winning it another way and this was one in the court of public opinion
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:05.400]  the outrage and anger that was expressed at the county once this
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:08.600]  went viral on the internet and once the media got involved
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:12.520]  i mean across the board we got positive coverage in the media
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:16.200]  and uh the pressure that was uh exerted on the county
[1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:20.120]  and once they read our demand letter once they met with us and we were serious
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:24.360]  they began to a a back off and then within a week but i want to understand
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:27.880]  from you mr so they backed off and apologize i want to know from you
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:31.720]  though sir because you're around these snakes more than i am
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:35.400]  how do they get so whacked out of their mind on a power trip
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:38.520]  that they think in america you can have people over for dinner
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:43.080]  i mean what has happened to this country why are most the counties i know
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.160]  behaving just like this what is their malfunction where these people come
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:50.840]  from i think it's a combination of things i think
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:55.400]  for for one part these bureaucrats they look at their own laws and their own
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:00.120]  regulations and to them those laws become above the constitution
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:04.760]  united states they start seeing those laws and ordinances as god in a sense
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:09.160]  and they worship those gods and they apply those gods in a way that
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.240]  in their in their mind is not inconsistent with their world view
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.400]  and they start um overruling in a sense the first principle of the first
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:19.560]  amendment to the united states constitution which
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:23.320]  obviously the rest of us see is more important that's one thing that starts
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:26.920]  happening with these bureaucrats the other thing that's happening i think is
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:31.800]  that there's a very anti christian bias being expressed in our society today
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:37.560]  and so that helps make it more palatable in their own minds to apply their
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:42.520]  laws in a very um unethical and in almost illegal manner
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.560]  to violate fundamental for amendment rights well this is one step away from
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:52.440]  rome or communist china because in communist china you can have a church
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:57.640]  it's just official state approved and with the 501c3 and with
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:03.080]  the clergy response teams and the feds because you know saddling up next to
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.480]  uh the churches and and and trying to get them on the faith-based payroll
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:11.720]  total violation of the first amendment now they are targeting more and more
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:16.680]  home churches and and going after those and so it's only a few short steps to
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:21.800]  living in the soviet union that's right and yeah i agree with that what one of
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:26.280]  the things that was ironic about this case is that one of the we were
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.080]  interviewed by cnn fox news everybody gave the story great coverage but
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:34.840]  one of the most interesting interviews we did was with voice of america which
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.480]  ironically broadcast into communist china and uh
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:43.480]  pastor jones and i talked several times about the irony of that that
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:47.480]  communist china where we're now the actually christianity has grown through
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:50.840]  the house church movement here in the united states that's starting to be
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.880]  shut down potentially and so the irony there was pretty stunning
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.240]  well i'm not going to start preaching at people but there's nothing more christian
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.120]  than having in your house that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:05.320]  and the establishment doesn't like it i think a lot of the big churches don't
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:08.280]  like it as well and uh they're kind of getting in
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:11.320]  bed with the government and it's just it's just incredibly dangerous
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:15.000]  anything else pastor dav jones or your lawyer dean broils
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.840]  that you'd like to add i'd just like to say i appreciate
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:22.200]  some of your comments that you've made and it was
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:26.920]  it was a shock to us that somebody would have a mindset
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:30.440]  that they could tell us what to do behind our closed doors
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:34.120]  we appealed to them on that and we were just
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:38.040]  blown away with the thought that they could sit in their chair or go to their
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:40.200]  house and think they could do what they wanted to
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:43.160]  but they could tell me i couldn't have 15 people over
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:47.560]  to uh you know read the bible and pray it still is a shock to us
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.720]  and that's the truth that's the true story here and it wasn't parking
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:54.840]  and the public needs to know that that they are going to
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:59.080]  they are going to continue this line i'm i'm sure of it because what they learned
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:03.800]  is that they can go to uh go to the public and just say it's a parking issue
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:08.040]  and we watch it diffuse the public if they're still talking to me say well
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.280]  pastor dav of course you have to park right that was never the issue
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:16.360]  no i understand they always distract things off what they've really done and
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:19.960]  and still try to make you the victim and never even own up i mean if they're
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:23.400]  going to carry out this tyranny they should debate it from that point it's
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:26.840]  just absolutely so deceptive it it's just they are
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:30.600]  very wicked i'm sorry absolutely i would just add that
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:33.640]  you know a lot of people really still cannot believe that
[1:40:33.640 --> 1:40:36.760]  this story actually happened and we've been telling everybody it's true it's
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:42.440]  true so if you want to verify what happens please visit our website wclplaw.org
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:45.320]  all the important documents all the important documents are on there

[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:52.840]  apology and it it's all true and it as pastor said it was
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:56.600]  had nothing to do with traffic or parking all right gentlemen well
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.480]  we just hope that other people listening around the country
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:03.320]  understand or people listening this later as it's archived on the internet
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.640]  understand that you need to stand up to these people and stop
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:13.320]  being basically domesticated to live in a cross between nazi germany and soviet
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:16.920]  russia with a little bit of fiddles cuba mix
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:21.800]  stand i mean this is this is just mind control it's thought crime
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:25.720]  it's discrimination and we commend you uh
[1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:30.200]  mr broils and you uh pastor jones and if anything develops in this

[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:37.800]  uh i know you're working a lot of other cases that don't seem to hit the zeit
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:41.160]  guys and get this attention in some cases that are even more egregious

[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:48.920]  a heads up on some of the other cases where they've got these families
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:53.000]  cornered with these jackals and hyenas using their
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:58.600]  trumped-up phony bureaucratic lingo to to violate the bill rights constitution
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:02.440]  so we'll uh we'll talk to you again as this unfolds further thank you
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.120]  thank you all right gentlemen take care yeah i might just have them on about
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:08.920]  15 minutes but you just keep wanting to get into the detail
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:12.120]  because it's not just that they're violating your rights telling you what
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:16.440]  you can do in your house it's that then they lie about what
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:21.080]  they did later and never face up to the scum they are
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:25.160]  and ladies and gentlemen i'm going to tell you again
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:29.240]  i can't help people with their cps cases anymore because
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:34.200]  i mentally can't help it i can't handle it i try to help them on error sometimes
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.600]  i try to give people tips on error uh but i can't go to the court cases and
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:41.560]  watch the judges laughing and the pedophiles getting off on grabbing the
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:45.000]  kids i mean it's just pure court of evil you mean
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.200]  you're watching something out of hell go on in front of you
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:52.040]  i can't when i because if i go do one story i get hundreds of calls in austin
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:55.480]  alone i used to do these access tv shows we got to dig those out i got to get
[1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:58.760]  more interns in here or something and there's hundreds and hundreds of vhs
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:02.280]  tapes and three-quarter inch tapes with all these reports i'd do where i'd go
[1:43:02.280 --> 1:43:06.280]  out and be an old lady on a walker begging going
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:09.800]  my daughter comes over three times a week they say just go on a nursing home
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:14.120]  and give the government my house and they put 57 thousand dollars on it
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:19.800]  in the last four weeks and it's 2 000 more a day and i had up the guy moe it
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:24.120]  and they're saying now because there's a dead spot where the english ivy died
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:28.920]  they're still taking it and the officer grabbed me around the neck i don't know
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:33.800]  why this is happening in america and i can't handle it
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:37.640]  i can't sit there with sweet old ladies folks because you know what happens
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:40.680]  i start wanting to kill people i mean i'm going to just be honest with you
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:44.840]  because that's a normal tribal response would be to pick up my club
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:48.280]  and go down the road to the hut of the guy that did this but that isn't how
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:52.120]  society operates people five thousand years ago wouldn't do that to an old
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:56.680]  woman because the warriors would kill them
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:01.160]  instead they've taken our warriors society and they have turned it
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:06.040]  into a bunch of thugs feeding on the people i've had it with you
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:10.440]  and you rationalize and say well it's the law and well it's that you know
[1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:14.440]  i just can't handle it anymore just can't handle it
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:17.560]  and it gets attention because there's still some christians that will stand
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:20.920]  up and fight but other people that's why they love all these third world people
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:24.040]  they're bringing in and they're not bad people they just lived under bondage
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:27.560]  for hundreds of years and you know from mexico and korea and
[1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:32.200]  and everywhere else and and they'll put up with it
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:36.520]  i mean the anglo saxons from 1215 on fought and fought and fought and fought
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:41.640]  and fought to have a little bit of freedom very warlike intelligent a lot
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:45.400]  of uh you know ingenuity and inventiveness every culture great
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:50.840]  people i love all of humanity but instead now that entire
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:54.520]  system of the little bit of freedom that was clawed out by millions of deaths
[1:44:54.520 --> 1:44:58.760]  is now being lost you know any people paid with their lives
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:03.240]  so your house could be your castle and so the king's men the local
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:07.560]  you know lord's men the local
[1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:13.720]  barony the local viceroy the local thug wouldn't come with a bunch of guys with
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:17.080]  weapons and rape your wife and take your grain
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:21.320]  because it got so abusive all of you listening i don't care if you're african
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:25.160]  white whatever it is you had ancestors that fought and clawed into the
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:29.880]  renaissance by killing people
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:34.920]  by fighting ten to one hundred to one odds so you'd have some freedom you
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:39.640]  everything we've got was paid for with blood ladies and gentlemen
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:43.800]  every bit of it was bought with blood
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:48.760]  outnumbered
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:53.800]  unarmed our ancestors i don't care where you're from on the planet if you have
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.880]  any history of liberty in your in your in your culture and all of them do
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:02.120]  it was paid for and then people began worshiping
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:05.800]  liberty and freedom instead of worshiping bureaucracy
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:12.120]  and parasitic control frequency you heard those pastors and that lawyer
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:16.280]  they worship the government they do that it's that's why i say it's god
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:21.000]  the government is god people you know read leviticus
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:26.360]  and they read the books of the law which even if you're not a christian or
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:29.800]  don't believe that point is it's what our magna card is based on
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:34.520]  was ancient germanic law mixed with the mosaic law
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:43.480]  and it was all paid for with blood and and in that law
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:49.000]  you don't have the government with no checks and balances doing whatever it
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:54.840]  wants and liberty and freedom is honored
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:47:00.200]  and we we have the reverse of that today
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:05.560]  and we know what it leads to to being completely robbed
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:11.080]  all right i uh i've got other other guests coming up
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:15.880]  but the last hour we're gonna have open phones
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:20.280]  on separate issues but i've got uh i guess coming up about eugenics
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:25.880]  i wanted to get into all the other news the government health care takeover the
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:29.320]  water federalization takeover the youth core takeovers now
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:33.320]  openly happening uh the environmental carbon
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:37.080]  tax takeovers now happening and i had a bunch of financial
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:41.240]  news to go over as well but make no mistake global criminal
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:49.240]  syndicates are making their move against humanity
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:53.800]  now i'm just gonna have him on a few minutes i drug him on this morning
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:57.080]  because i saw gold was up like 12 bucks and silver was up too and
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:01.560]  i know ted had bought gold and silver again when it dipped for a while so
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.240]  you can get gold and silver at the lower price even though it's up right now and
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:08.760]  that's like buying a stock when it was when it's higher
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:13.000]  front the price when it was lower you just it's the smart move to do and ted's
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.480]  got some great coins available and he hadn't been on in a while because he's
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:18.040]  been out of town in europe trying to secure good deals on
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:21.560]  gold and silver ted anderson good to have us uh good to have you on with us
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.160]  while we still have some free space left yeah no kidding
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:29.240]  just watching what's going on that last guest was just a perfect example of that
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:33.080]  um here here's what's going on elix the market is coming back up again
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:36.280]  obviously plenty of problems out there in the economy
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:40.200]  we basically have handed over all powers over the federal reserve bank
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:44.360]  i would imagine that might have been influenced by hr 1207 coming in to
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:47.480]  otter them they're just trying to grab for what they can
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:50.920]  uh the market is starting to is starting to come back up again from this
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:54.760]  manipulation downward it really gives me opportunities to buy
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:57.480]  that's what i'm looking for is i'm looking for these little down ticks
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.720]  because usually i can save my customers anywhere from five to 20 to 30
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:04.840]  percent some cases even as much as you know
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:09.960]  40 50 percent because the market moves up so fast after they pushed it down
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:13.400]  but right what we do have right now we have the Lakota coins rather than being
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:17.960]  20 bucks a piece that right now at 19 dollars and 70 cents
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:22.200]  and the francs are at 222 rather than being up at 229
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:28.360]  i got british sovereigns right now at 275 275 rather than there be at about 285
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:34.120]  i'm sorry um yeah 285 so the the market is the market is definitely showing
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:37.800]  signs that you know that gold is strong and that things are going to be
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:42.360]  moving this direction uh you know just watching the government do all these
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:46.200]  bailouts and and the printing press just running on
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:49.800]  over at the federal reserve bank you just know that we're going to have
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:52.760]  inflation here and you just know that we're going to have
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:56.360]  every decreasing value of our of our currency
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:00.200]  and uh and every single time that there's a hiccup in the economy or some
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:04.040]  company that needs to be bailed out that's part of the part of the elite
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:07.560]  group is going to get their money and it's going to come out of the taxpayers
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.360]  hide and it just you know the whole thing just
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.480]  stinks to high heaven and i just have to say
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:16.760]  that if the people were smart right now and i'm not just talking about the
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:20.280]  alex jones listeners but i'm talking about everybody that's out there
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:23.640]  that get their buns out of cash on a paper currency
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:28.040]  on a fiat currency that's that's growing weaker every day because the
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:32.280]  federal reserve system is printing it and get yourself into something that's
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.480]  real and hard like gold and get a good deal which you're offering look when
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:38.920]  the dumb bell yuppies figure out that they're tanking the dollar and going
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:41.560]  into hyperinflation whenever that is in the next few years
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:44.600]  you're not going to be able to get gold and silver hardly at any price
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:48.600]  so you need to get into it now the run-up you've seen
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:52.120]  in the price is only the beginning that's what the smart money's on
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:55.080]  and it's certainly better than fiat currency stay there ted tell folks about
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:59.240]  the coins uh you've got on the other side but yeah

[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:37.640]  in the info war
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:42.680]  all right let's go back to ten anderson ted
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:47.320]  finishing up i tell folks the ratio uh what you were telling me this morning
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:51.080]  you bought gold was about 20 less than it is now you bought silver when it was
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:55.400]  almost a dollar less than it is now so you're passing on those prices
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:58.760]  but again every time you have a deal like this people some people wait and
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:02.920]  then it's gone uh i just can't imagine people not
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:07.320]  wanting to have gold and silver especially when all these big top
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:12.440]  financial sources people that ron paul has sourced inside it as being very
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:16.280]  accurate in the past are saying that they're that they're getting ready for
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:19.880]  a bank holiday in september now that doesn't mean they're going to do it
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:22.440]  it means though that the state department's telling the embassies get
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:27.240]  ready for it or for complete war and to dump dollars and hoard
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:33.000]  their local currencies uh so look the world is so uncertain now
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.440]  and the economy so crazy i don't understand how anybody ted
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:39.640]  wouldn't move aggressively into silver and gold well especially when you
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.160]  consider the fact that you're moving out of a fiat currency that's being
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.320]  printed like crazy to do these bailouts that
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:52.600]  are that our government's doing i mean a to increase the money supplied by 30
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:56.120]  percent 33 percent coming up to 50 percent
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.760]  what do you think is going to happen to the value of your money
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.040]  i mean what do you think is going to happen to your property rights i mean
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:05.320]  uh look what michelle bachman was saying about these dealers i mean people are
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:09.960]  losing 15 million dollar businesses overnight because of a government
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:15.720]  of regulation or or you know some cars are somewhere it's crazy what's going
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:19.080]  on out there i don't know why anybody would want to be in this fiat currency
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:23.800]  honestly i mean we're just so close to paying carbon taxes that's the only key
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:27.000]  element that it would take to have world government
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.120]  you know that's the last cog in the wheel that needs to be done they need to
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:34.200]  collect a world tax in order to have a world bank and a world currency and then
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:37.960]  they can dictate to us what our policy is going to be here
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:43.400]  in in any segment of of politics and so you know i i just need to say that if
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:45.880]  you don't put yourself on a golden silver standard
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:48.920]  yourself personally because the government isn't going to do it
[1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:53.480]  i i think you're nuts i i did ted i'm even freaked out now even though i've
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.920]  been knowing this was coming for years in the setup they're now moving faster
[1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:00.040]  than i even thought because i think they are trying to play catch up
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:03.320]  openly a federal bill to say even rainwater on your land means
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:06.760]  total federal controlled jurisdiction over 100 percent of the u.s
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.120]  openly that the congress even people for it admit that
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:15.000]  uh bills to openly set up all the youth corps bills to have the climate tax
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:19.160]  folks get prepared nothing is perfect there's no silver bullet
[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:25.960]  but at least get out of their fiat system 800 686 2237 800 686

[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:41.960]  minutes we've got left in this quick segment
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.960]  ted owner of genesis owner of minus resources

[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:24.760]  yeah right now we have the Lakota coin at 19 dollars and 70 cents now silver is
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:27.240]  about to break through that 14 dollar range
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:30.040]  and that's going to push that right up above 20 again
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:33.080]  and there isn't anybody else out there that's selling those things for less
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:36.280]  than 20 bucks so that is a really good buy
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:39.160]  and then of course the british sovereign if you're looking for gold it's a
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:42.520]  quarter ounce piece they're currently right now at 275 the

[2:03:55.640 --> 2:03:58.280]  everything i try to buy when the market's down
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:01.480]  i mean nobody knows for sure when the bottom's going to hit but when i see
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:05.320]  that thing being pushed down you know i just know there's manipulation that's
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:08.360]  going on there's manipulation going on in every market right now
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.200]  yeah that's why it's been pogo sticking but pogo sticking upwards the graph goes
[2:04:12.200 --> 2:04:16.360]  up and down but it's moving up overall and so what
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:20.280]  else is doing as good as gold and silver in the last five years nothing
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:23.160]  and everything else is losing so folks give the brokers a call they'll be

[2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:52.280]  it's a great investment in my view but there is no silver bullet

[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:15.960]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:19.480]  well i've actually seen their uh some of the television productions they've done
[2:08:19.480 --> 2:08:23.640]  because one of my friends george woolley a pro live activist has
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:28.440]  aired some of the video here in austin on local access
[2:08:28.440 --> 2:08:34.360]  mark crutcher is with life dynamics dot com we'll throw that up on screen for
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:36.760]  people watching us at prison planet dot tv as we
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:40.440]  simulcast with a radio show throughout this hour later in the hour we're gonna
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:44.760]  open the phones up to talk about black genocide and of american genocide
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:48.520]  and again 99 of whites don't know this is going on
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:52.280]  uh but it was george bush senior when he was
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.880]  working for nixon who actually carried out sterilization this is mainstream
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:59.320]  news and abortions on the native american reservations
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:02.600]  so if you want the big socialized health care of obama
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:06.680]  get ready because that's what it means and the same stuff that the bureau of
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:13.320]  indian affairs gives people in the va uh but they've made a new film
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:20.520]  that is really impressive and it gets into this whole history of black genocide
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:23.880]  i'm actually looking for it in here i had it uh
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:28.200]  in here oh here it is it's underneath in game it's uh ma affa
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:32.760]  black genocide in the 21st century in america
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:36.440]  and it's just an excellent film that everybody needs to see
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:41.000]  because uh like i said earlier my film in game gets into the whole eugenics
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:44.120]  operation and how that's the religion of the new world order
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:48.920]  in their own words a religion of death they love death
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:54.440]  they that hate me love death and so that's why abortion is a sacrament
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:59.480]  uh to these people and i'm not kidding i mean i come at this from a
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:02.920]  secular analysis i am a christian but i don't let that
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:07.960]  be a rose color darkly uh though it really gives me discernment
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:12.760]  i look at things just coldly and analyze the history
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:16.280]  and then i emotionally rally people to fight against it but uh it is very very
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:19.560]  real so we appreciate to mark a crutcher for coming on the show
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:22.680]  and for producing this film mark good to have you here thank you sir thanks for
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:26.280]  having me on you bet so so tell us about your journey your your
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.680]  organization what you do generally and how it led you deeper down the rabbit
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:35.400]  hole to really the fount of this uh planned parenthood evil
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:38.600]  well we uh we're a pro-life organization as you know and we
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:42.040]  do a lot of different pro-life things we do a lot of undercover work you may have
[2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:45.720]  uh be familiar with some of our work exposing the trafficking of a baby
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:48.600]  body parts of the abortion clinics chop up the baby they
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:51.800]  they kill and sell them for parts yes i want to talk about all that i want to
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:54.120]  many times but to have you on it for some reason
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.640]  it it never happens so this is hopefully the first of many interviews yeah
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:01.640]  tell us all about it well and that that's it and i mean it that's a whole show
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:04.680]  by itself but basically uh that's enough for another
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:07.000]  profit center for the abortion lobbyist to
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.880]  is to chop up these babies and sell them for spare parts
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:14.280]  and uh it's a it's a fairly profitable endeavor that they've got going we have
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:17.080]  no idea how large it is we know it's still going on
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:20.120]  we were undercover in an abortion clinic in um
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:23.480]  overland park kansas for 31 months and came out with all the documentation on
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.720]  it the they actually put out brochures just like
[2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:29.800]  you get on a new car or something uh talking about how they sell the body
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:32.600]  parts and uh then we also did an undercover
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:36.040]  investigation on the fact that planned parenthood
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:38.920]  is running a nationwide pedophile protection racket they're they're
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:42.440]  protecting the men who who sexually views and rape children
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:45.960]  and we proved it and i'll say it right here on your show
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:49.800]  they're running a nationwide pedophile protection racket if that's not true
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:52.600]  that's libel and slander on its face and they would assume me
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.920]  the first time i said it seven years ago i've said it on over 200 national
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:01.400]  and local television and radio stations they've never even once contacted me
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:04.840]  now for those that don't know i should have read your bio for people
[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:08.920]  but it's so lengthy you're on syndicated radio tv
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:12.760]  i mean you reach millions of people every week you might tell folks how big
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  your ministry is and they just back off and shut up and see i never knew this
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:19.720]  stuff either but over the decades that's what i find found out
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:23.560]  devil worshiping pedophiles basically run the new world order the global
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:27.080]  government and they love death they love killing babies but yep
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:30.360]  please continue so body parts pedophile rings
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:34.600]  uh... black genocide yes you know one of the things that those of us the
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:37.240]  pro-life movement have always known is that
[2:12:37.240 --> 2:12:41.320]  there was a strong racial element to the motivation behind
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:46.280]  uh... the legalization of abortion and so about three years ago
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:50.120]  we launched an investigation into this and uh... uh...
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:53.080]  what we have found i mean i've been in the pro-life battle for thirty years i've
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:54.040]  been working on it
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:56.760]  working in a full time for twenty three years
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:01.240]  and uh... and i like to learn things in the last three years that i never
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:05.000]  dreamed of i work in this twenty four hours a seven days week
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  and the stuff that we've learned in the last three years is mind-boggling
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:12.600]  and it it is absolutely
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:15.640]  undeniable now that racism
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:20.040]  with a with a primary motivation if not the primary motivation but i would go
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:22.760]  so far to say it was the primary motivation
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:25.800]  for the legalization of abortion to begin with
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.080]  and what we did is we went back and and as you've seen in the
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:31.880]  in the dvd we actually start at the
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.920]  at the time prior to the end of slavery
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:39.720]  when not all white people and not even all wealthy white people
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:44.120]  but a certain select group of super wealthy
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:49.160]  white elitist began to wonder what was going to happen or will actually worry
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:52.680]  about what was going to happen when the end of slavery came because they saw it
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:54.200]  was coming
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:56.600]  and we're talking about the late seventeen hundreds early eighteen
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:59.400]  hundreds and up until the mid eighteen hundred these people
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:03.720]  clearly saw that the end of slavery was was going to occur one day they didn't
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:07.960]  know when but they were very alarmed at what was going to happen
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:11.320]  and not from the standpoint of insurrection which is what a lot of
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:14.760]  people talk about the wealthy elite can always
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:19.160]  insulate themselves from insurrection that's not their problem
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.120]  what they were concerned about is the economic impact
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.000]  for the most part these are the people this wealthy elite this small cadre of
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:31.240]  wealthy elitist were the people who had most profit from slavery
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:34.840]  they had made billions on the backs of african that they had
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:39.160]  brought in here from african and it had been christians that ended that just
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:43.320]  like christians are going to end their murder of babies again but go ahead
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:47.640]  absolutely but um they began to wonder what the
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:50.280]  economic impact what was going to be
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:54.040]  of releasing four million people into the economy
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:58.520]  that they had kept artificially ignorant and un and unemployable basically
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:01.800]  uh... if you were black in the eighteen thirties
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:05.400]  and you were set free you only had one job skill now was to work on the
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:10.200]  cotton plantation so what was going to be the impact of this is what concerned
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:14.520]  them and their first idea was to uh was what called
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:18.120]  colonization they were going to send all the slaves back to africa
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  that failed miserably even though it was widely embraced in our government
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:25.240]  that united states congress what most people don't know is the united
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:27.880]  states congress actually funded the american
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:31.640]  colonization society so it was a very seriously took
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:36.680]  taken a concept they just didn't work and
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:39.800]  it's it's interesting when you start studying these things alex
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:43.400]  you know if you put things on a timeline which is how we started this we did it
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:47.800]  like a criminal investigation we put things on a timeline starting in
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:51.400]  like in the early eighteen hundred and continuing up to two thousand nine
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:55.800]  and one of the things that you see is every time this
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:16:01.400]  the small group of elitist tried something and it didn't work
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:05.240]  all of a sudden there was something else to try and it's interesting that when
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:09.480]  colonization failed is exactly the same moment
[2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:12.600]  when there was a new philosophy introduced in the world called eugenics
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:18.760]  no the man who actually coined the term eugenics or the word eugenics
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:22.520]  um is now today called the father of eugenics
[2:16:22.520 --> 2:16:28.040]  um and he his name was francis gallton his family was
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:32.120]  extraordinarily wealthy they had made their money from the slave trade
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:35.960]  um and he came up with this with this philosophy called eugenics
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:39.400]  and basically what it is is not is absolutely no difference in what
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:43.000]  hitler did is the the creation of the master race
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:47.480]  and he thought that the world could um manipulate
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:51.640]  the the human condition to the point that we could be better than we could do a
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:55.000]  better job than what god did they're basically their theory was god did
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:58.120]  god did well as far as he went but we can make it better and they really
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:01.000]  believe this the galtons and the darwins and others were all
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.080]  intermarried and they have like nine kids and eight of them
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:08.440]  would die and the other one would be retarded right and they and they still
[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:12.520]  thought though this was genius and beauty so they they really believed
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:16.760]  that that that they were creating a new super race absolutely and and
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.080]  one of the things and i know who i knew darwin was i knew who gallton was
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:24.360]  before we even started this project what i didn't know
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:28.920]  is that they were first cousins charles darwin and francis gallton were first
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:31.720]  cousins and they worked together on these projects
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:36.200]  and what you start to see as you start unraveling all of this
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:42.200]  is that basically darwin was the philosopher and gallton was the guy who
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:46.440]  put all this stuff into practice he was called the bulldog right
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:51.560]  um gallton i mean sorry uh the the eugenics is first started out with a
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:55.400]  plan that was basically what you might call passive eugenics
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:17:59.320]  they believe that not only were africans uh inferior
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:03.560]  intellectually to whites they believe they were in inferior physically as
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:07.640]  well and that unless they had direction from the
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:11.320]  white community they couldn't survive they couldn't live without us so
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:16.440]  so they set up the social welfare net and racial hygiene health departments
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:20.120]  and that's our cps and plan parent today that's what it evolved into
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:24.360]  that's what it evolved into and what we do is we take everything on a step by
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:28.360]  step basis and we connect the dots from the failure
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:32.040]  of colonization to the success of abortion
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:35.560]  and we show all the stages that these people went through from
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:39.640]  passive eugenics to positive eugenics to negative eugenics to birth control
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.160]  to sterilization and ultimately to abortion
[2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:47.880]  and it's when you start putting this thing on the timeline you keep seeing
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:53.080]  all these things pop up where x fails and exactly on that time here's this new
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:56.280]  strategy and when that failed here's this new strategy
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:18:59.400]  and they kept doing that until they came up with one that worked which was
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:04.440]  abortion now in the and we document of
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:07.400]  things in this video i don't think most people understand
[2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:13.160]  or don't know i certainly didn't know the eugenics eugenics movement had
[2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:17.880]  really settled on the idea for sterilization
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:21.320]  is the way they would control the world's population 34 states had passed
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:25.080]  that yes 30 over 30 states had you
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:29.400]  actual eugenics boards state eugenics board 30 over 30 states had them the
[2:19:29.400 --> 2:19:33.400]  first one was in indiana and this is not something that
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:37.800]  happened just back in the 1910s or the 1920s now this went on to the 80s

[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:16.680]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth

[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:03.640]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal
[2:23:03.640 --> 2:23:06.600]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:10.440]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:13.720]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:17.560]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[2:23:17.560 --> 2:23:20.200]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:23.800]  deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:27.480]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:31.160]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:34.760]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:38.120]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[2:23:38.120 --> 2:23:41.800]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative
[2:23:41.800 --> 2:23:46.120]  portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:49.320]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:52.680]  gold on its own has held value for over 6 000 years
[2:23:52.680 --> 2:24:04.600]  for more information call 1-800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:08.120]  you know you can hear mark crutchard i've seen his tv program many times with
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:11.160]  his daughter and and folks they did a great job
[2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:16.120]  they videotaped the radio show is it getting kind of like we do
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:20.040]  and you can tell he really cares and they were a small organization but in the
[2:24:20.040 --> 2:24:22.600]  last few decades they've reached tens of millions of people
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:26.440]  we see the polls going from the majority of americans being for abortion and the
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:29.960]  majority now being against and even the media admits oh my god people know it's
[2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:32.920]  a baby now they're not you know stop driving around with those cars with
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:36.360]  dead babies as other groups do stop stop it you know
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:40.520]  as if that's bad but the act is okay you know people are winning
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:44.280]  we're winning by telling the truth and to use abortion as birth control ladies
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:47.080]  and gentlemen is very wicked they always have to advertise like oh you're against
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:51.080]  birth control no this is murder
[2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:54.520]  and now it's babies out of the womb and now the
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:57.640]  bio at the sister coming out and saying the eugenicist
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:00.200]  oh we need to go ahead and get rid of babies after they're born
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:04.520]  this is in the mainstream news so lifedynamics.com short segment now
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:07.720]  mark crutchard's on with us the film is
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:11.160]  ma affa black genocide 21st century america
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:15.480]  describe what the name means and then continue where you left off about
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:19.800]  abortion worked for them and this is only one slice of eugenics
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:23.960]  but devastating to show people why time in newsweek call her
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:27.240]  you know woman of the year before they put her in the top 100 women in history
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:31.080]  say she's a great liberal who call black people subhuman weeds
[2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:35.560]  yeah well actually our our video is called ma affa 21 ma affa is the
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:39.720]  uh term that's used in by many in the african-american community to
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:43.800]  describe the time of of slavery it's a swahili word that means
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:47.400]  a tragedy or calamity or or something like that but
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:52.040]  um and they call that time in history ma affa and our argument is
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:56.040]  that the ma affa did not end when the slaves were set free
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.560]  it continues to this day and i think we've made a compelling case for that
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:03.400]  in this video and that's why we call it ma affa 21 it's ma affa in the 21st
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:07.800]  century and yeah the as i was saying a moment
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  ago uh sterilization was their big tool but in
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.760]  the sixties they began to lose sterilization the federal courts were
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:17.800]  starting to rule that these eugenics boards the state eugenics
[2:26:17.800 --> 2:26:21.960]  boards and state sterilization boards were unconstitutional
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:25.560]  and it was at that time for the first time in american history
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:29.000]  that the eugenics movement then switched over and started embracing
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.760]  and being again calling for the legalization of abortion
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:36.600]  it's also at this time that blacks begin to stand up and demand their
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:40.200]  constitutional rights and say we're not going to take this nonsense anymore
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:43.880]  and all of these three things converged at one point you had
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:47.560]  the court ruling against sterilization boards you had
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:51.160]  the black standing up and saying we're not going to be pushed around like this
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.160]  anymore and then by and just i guess some people would say an enormous
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:58.840]  cosmic coincidence the eugenics movement says okay if we can't have
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:02.280]  sterilization anymore we're going to start calling for the legalization of abortion
[2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:05.880]  and then suddenly let me just add they've set up the health boards set up
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:08.840]  the eugenics boards of the health department racial hygiene
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:12.440]  germany the keiser vilhelm institute as you know
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:16.440]  for those that don't adopts the u.s british model and hitler writes him on
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:20.120]  comp thanking the united states and how wonderful it is and
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:24.120]  for teaching him all of this and now he's going to do this to the jews and gypsies
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.560]  and uh germans who had any health problems in their life if
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:30.760]  you had a defective heart they'd come grab your kids and kill them and say oh
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:34.920]  they died of rupture of appendix so the cps abortion
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.400]  uh sterilization that's all going on in germany they get embarrassed after world
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:42.840]  war two the head of the un uh the secretary general of
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:49.640]  unesco julian huxley says we'll call ourselves transhumanist now so suddenly
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:51.960]  in the 60s the blacks are saying you're not going to
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:55.240]  you know castrate me anymore and so they say you know what
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:58.040]  we're going to pay your women to not have you in the house we're going to
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:01.320]  break your families up we're going to turn the cops loose on you
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:05.160]  and we're going to make sure those women then later have abortions
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:08.280]  and what you have to understand too you mentioned keiser willhelm institute
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:12.040]  the interesting thing is that the keiser willhelm institute was actually
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.760]  funded by the rockerfeller foundation and rockerfeller and carneke had had
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:20.760]  probably rockerfeller was the primary one but carneke also put money into it
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:25.160]  and they were the ones who also funded the american eugenics
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:28.600]  society in cold spring harbor new york new york which is still there today
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.800]  to the whole call the human genome project oh that one
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:36.040]  no there is now called the american eugenics record office
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:39.640]  but exactly but i'm saying those two nexus in together absolutely
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:42.680]  and we were able to get some of the information that's in this
[2:28:42.680 --> 2:28:46.600]  in this dvd that that's never been released to the public we were able to
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:50.120]  more or less trick them into giving it to us once they figured out what we were
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:53.000]  doing they shut off the supply yeah continue with the

[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:09.720]  they're real focused and serious but i can hear almost the tremor in his voice
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:12.680]  when he says i discovered things in the last three years i
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:17.000]  i he can hardly talk i i'm the same way that's why i'm interrupting every five

[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:18.760]  let's talk about the pedophile rings with plan parenthood
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:22.600]  uh you you're the guys and some other folks will call plan parenthood and say
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:25.640]  i want to give money just to kill the dirty blacks and they'd oh yes we love
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:28.280]  getting rid of those well you know your money will go directly to get rid of
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:32.120]  them i mean people have trouble dealing with the
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:36.120]  magnitude of the of the wickedness of this group
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:39.480]  it's just like when the neighbor gets caught who'd mow your lawn and water
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:42.120]  your plants with 20 dead bodies in their basement
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:46.200]  you're like i can't believe it well you gotta get past that folks and look at
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:49.560]  the evidence covered in these films i got a little clip of in game
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:52.680]  coming up in just a moment but go ahead sir well you mentioned a moment ago
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:56.120]  floor out of the water one of the things that we discovered
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:00.680]  is that back in the 60s when they began to be concerned that they were going to
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:04.840]  lose sterilization and abortion at that point had not been legalized
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:07.960]  one of the proposals that these people put forward
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:11.720]  was that the u.s government should be putting
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:15.320]  birth control agents into the food and water supply
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:19.480]  and this was widely discussed widely embraced by people in the eugenics
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:23.640]  movement it was discussed at a 1969 meeting of the
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:27.400]  of the united nations it was embraced by them
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:31.160]  and when we started studying this idea that listen to how preposterous this
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:36.840]  was alex their proposal was that
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:39.720]  birth control agents could be put into the food and what municipal food and
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:42.760]  water supplies and then there would be they would
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:47.080]  develop an anecdote to the birth control agents in the water
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:51.640]  which you could apply to the government for the right to purchase
[2:36:51.640 --> 2:36:55.880]  on the new york stock exchange they were literally going to sell these
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:37:01.400]  certificates basically to have a baby on the new york stock exchange
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:04.920]  and when you when we started studying this it was it was almost
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:09.640]  at times alex i hate to say this we were laughing it was so laughable so funny
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:13.720]  that these people were dead serious about this until no i agree with you until
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:16.600]  you realize they're actually doing it through uh
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:21.160]  covert means right now in fact the carbon tax they're admitting
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:24.200]  notice they're now getting rid of the child credit in california
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:27.640]  in in australia they're now going to tax you if you have more than one kid
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:30.840]  and they admit this is how the chinese one-child policy
[2:37:30.840 --> 2:37:34.760]  started in 75 became law 81 but go ahead absolutely
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:38.360]  the at the interesting thing is when we studied this this idea
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:41.640]  what happened to this idea of putting birth control agents in the food and water
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.240]  supply the eugenics movement eventually abandoned it and then
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:48.440]  increased the cost for the legalized abortion legalization of abortion
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:52.520]  mainly because not because they were morally had a moral problem these people
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:56.680]  don't have morals but they did not abandon the the
[2:37:56.680 --> 2:38:01.160]  putting the food uh doctrine of the food water supply with birth control
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:04.760]  because of moral concerns they abandoned it because they concluded
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:07.960]  that it was impractical that you really couldn't do it
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:13.240]  one of the eugenicists we talk about it in my book one of these people
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:17.000]  actually said in this u n conference he was representing the united states on
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.200]  this population council in the u n he says look
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:23.880]  we couldn't stop the import and sell of alcohol
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:26.920]  he said how are we going to do this with water he said all we're going to do is
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:30.840]  we're going to create a black market for untreated water
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:35.240]  he said we're going to have speakeasy for water if we try to do this
[2:38:35.240 --> 2:38:38.840]  now he wasn't opposed to the idea as a as a philosophy
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:42.120]  just that it wasn't practical and then the idea was
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:45.400]  put forward about doing this in foreign countries
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:48.360]  and it was shot down there because they said the
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:53.000]  the country's population we need control are the black countries in africa
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:56.360]  and the vast majority of people living those countries do not get their food
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:00.280]  and their water from municipal supplies they get their water from streams and
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:03.080]  rivers and we can't go out there and and put this stuff in every stream and
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:07.160]  river but mark here's the big horror this is what we know they've done
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:10.440]  they've seen even bbc articles where they check
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:14.920]  medically the young girls 10 15 years old that all have hiv
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.520]  and they haven't even had uh you know their virginity loss they can medically
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:23.480]  as you know check that right and they're going we don't know
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:27.160]  where they got it and they go oh maybe the aid workers are using the same
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:29.400]  needles over and over again and they've caught them
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:33.720]  adding sterilization hormones to tetanus shots that's mainstream news
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:37.480]  and we hear about billa malinda gates giving you know tens of billions of
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:40.840]  dollars of warren buffett the rest of them and bill gates's daddy was the
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:44.360]  head of plant parenthood and here's the times of london billionaire club and
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:48.120]  bid to curb overpopulation and you got all the
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:51.160]  richest people meeting in a quote secret meeting of how to reduce the
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:54.520]  population i just want folks to know what's proven
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:57.640]  and admitted proves these are total criminals
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:01.080]  but i'm telling you it's a lot bigger but but i'm gonna try to shut up
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:04.040]  keep going over the film with the history okay so you have the abortion
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:07.000]  break up with the black family now they're moved on to everybody though
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.880]  they're not just doing this to blacks it's just the blacks
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:13.480]  are the apple of their eye that they're the they're the favorite target well
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:16.120]  listen we we talk about in the documentary we were able to get our
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:19.880]  hand on a document that's called nfsm 200
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:22.680]  it was a document that was put out by the united states government justice
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:27.080]  department the uh cia central intelligence agency and the
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:31.640]  uh usa id which is the agency that operates under the
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.520]  state department through which we fund all of these foreign
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:38.680]  uh eight programs and what that document showed this
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:43.160]  this document in fsm 200 was originally classified and i am absolutely
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:46.360]  convinced that the sex the state of the secretary of
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:49.320]  state's office which with that time this this off this document is often
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:53.240]  called the kissinger report because it was put out by Henry kissinger
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:56.040]  i'm convinced they never thought this would be made public
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:40:59.160]  because if they thought it was ever going to be made public they would not
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:01.480]  have said some of the things that they were saying in here
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:04.760]  but this was a document that was designed to
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:11.800]  uh codify or to describe america's policy on controlling the population of
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:15.560]  what they called underdeveloped or third world countries and not coincidentally
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:19.720]  these countries are all in africa and they're all black countries
[2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:24.280]  but in the document they state that the reason that we have to control the
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:28.440]  populations of these countries we're not doing it to help them
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:31.880]  we're doing it because they have minerals and metals that we need in the
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:35.000]  united states and if we don't stabilize and control their
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:38.840]  populations and reduce their populations they'll use up their own
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:41.000]  minerals and metals and we won't be able to get to them
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:44.200]  and that's a repeat of the british royal commission
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:47.880]  of forty nine that says the same thing it
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:52.280]  nothing has changed about this nothing has changed about eugenics movement
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:56.360]  since gallton first came up with the idea and his and his cousin darwin
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:59.880]  put wings on it i'm telling you this is a
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:03.320]  this is a and people say well you're some sort of conspiracy now do you try to
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:06.680]  tell me that a bunch of people in the late
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:10.280]  1700s early 1800s come up with this fantastic ideas
[2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:14.200]  of controlling the world's population and they're in conspiracy with people
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:17.240]  that were not even born for a hundred years after that
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.080]  it's not a matter of a conspiracy does not have to be a situation
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:25.160]  where a bunch of people get in a room and cook up some idea that they all work
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:28.840]  together on a conspiracy it's what i call the conspiracy of a common
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:33.240]  agenda so it's a program this is the british empire
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:38.200]  the us robber barons the the royalty right and and and i mean the romans had
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:41.800]  handbooks on how to throw disease blankens over walls to make
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.560]  everybody die i mean you know the huns were using that
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:49.800]  2000 years ago this is why elites are in control
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:53.240]  they're master planners they call themselves great architects
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.240]  yeah so i are are we stupid enough to suggest that francis gallton got in a
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:43:00.440]  room with margaret sanger when they never lived contemporaneously obviously
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:03.800]  we're not stupid enough to say no the rockefeller family picked up those
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:07.960]  ideas and on records went and funded her as a front and then she wrote letters
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:11.800]  to the big foundations as you know saying i've got to get black fronts because
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:15.720]  they won't trust us white folks right exactly and that's what they've done
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:19.400]  up until this very day and now we have gone to the point of
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:22.600]  exporting this alec i want to i want to give you an example
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:26.280]  of what i believe is the ultimate form of just sheer
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:30.920]  gall for people to have when when these when this
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:35.400]  this idea that we would export genocide into these african countries really
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:39.160]  took on steam was in the late 60s and early 70s
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:43.880]  at that time we had a man appointed to head up this effort in the united states
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:47.960]  his name was rt ravenholt and he was appointed by nixon
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:52.680]  to run this population control effort outside the country
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:56.520]  they openly stated and and we found that the articles and the
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:59.880]  and the uh... documents where they openly stated
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:04.440]  that the united states goal with population control
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:11.080]  was to sterilize one quarter of the world's female population
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:14.200]  now you tell me where do we get the right
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:18.760]  and who has the call to stand up here and say the united states is going to go
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:22.200]  outside of this outside of its borders and sterilize
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:26.280]  one out of four of the females on this earth
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:30.280]  where do we get the call to do that and that was just on the paper and that was
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:34.120]  just on paper and we've got african countries were 45 percent of the women
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  have hiv and ravenholt and this was really pushed
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:43.000]  not coincidentally in my view when the fort administration meet people don't
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.640]  don't remember this very often that when you get
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:48.120]  when you start talking about the fort administration and nixon and all that
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:52.840]  stuff you forget that uh... ford's vice president
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:56.840]  was nelson rockefeller and rockefeller ford and kissinger
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:01.000]  were pushing all this world population control agenda this world population
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:06.680]  control agenda and it it's the same group of people
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:11.640]  every time you investigate something in this you if you dig deep enough if you
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:14.280]  peel enough and the layers of the onion away
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:17.080]  you always find the same people at the center of it
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:20.760]  well listen i've gone online and looked at the bill among the gates
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:25.160]  foundation their federal filings it's all open eugenics groups
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:28.680]  but but when you see it on the news it's oh they're helping black people
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:31.400]  isn't bill gates suite but then on bill moyer's
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:36.360]  he said get rid of the the population well again
[2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:39.960]  if you look at what we've done in foreign country but let's just let me just
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:45.880]  propose a hypothetical to you let's say that today in
[2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:49.320]  france or england or germany or australia or canada there was some sort of
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:54.920]  natural catastrophe and they and these people need help
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:46:01.480]  would we help them we absolutely would but would our help be contingent upon
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:05.240]  they're accepting the american ideal of birth control and abortion
[2:46:05.240 --> 2:46:09.640]  would we go into france and say yeah we recognize that you got people starving
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.400]  in the streets and you can't help them and we're here with usa
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:16.760]  usa id but we won't we've got this
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:19.880]  food and medicine sitting on this ship out in the harbor
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:24.600]  we will not unload it until you agree to legalize abortion
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:28.600]  except our versions of birth control and family planning and population control
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:32.040]  if you do that we'll unload the ships if you don't we're taking them back
[2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:36.200]  we would never do that in a white country but that has been our standard
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:40.920]  procedure for the last 50 years in africa and in other black countries even
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:45.080]  in this hemisphere but i'll tell you why sir i'm sure you know this
[2:46:45.080 --> 2:46:48.360]  the big secret is and again you've done a great job your research is amazing
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:52.360]  you've taught me a lot this is a sliver just with the blacks
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:55.080]  they're the the grip they're mainly focused on
[2:46:55.080 --> 2:46:57.400]  they don't need to in the white countries because they're all run by the
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:01.080]  eugenicist and they've all are pulling the stuff on black white it
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:04.440]  doesn't matter and you're right when they go
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:08.120]  into africa or latin america or asia they say you've got to accept this
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:11.240]  company running your water supplies well as we're gonna we're gonna put
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:13.880]  additives in it because we care about you you've got to accept
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:17.400]  giving your kids these vaccines because we won't take good care of we're gonna
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:20.920]  kill them down in a hammer but just never mind what happened if we shoot them up
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:24.600]  so that's the next level of the diabolical evil
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:28.280]  is realizing it's it is that they're not giving them aid
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:31.960]  the aid they're giving them is eugenics death as well go ahead
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:35.320]  it it's cultural suicide we're telling these people unless you're willing to
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:37.880]  cook commit cultural suicide we won't help you
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:41.640]  and you know a perfect example of this and it's just one little
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:45.880]  tiny grain of sand on the beach is Haiti
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:49.320]  Haiti as we all know has been struck by a lot of disasters it's a very poor
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:51.720]  country uh... many of the things that have happened
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:55.480]  to it are just a result of where it's located on the globe
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:47:59.080]  they've been hit by hurricanes and tsunamis and all kinds of natural
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:03.080]  disasters we have gone into Haiti repeatedly
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:07.240]  and told them you know we'll help but you have to accept american birth control
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:10.680]  and and um population control measures and if you
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:14.600]  don't do that we won't help you i have talked to people who have our
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:18.440]  missionaries who've gone to Haiti to try to help these poor people
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:21.400]  and they say you can go into clinics there and i had another guy tell me
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:24.360]  this exact same thing about countries in africa
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:28.120]  he said you can go into clinics there and in that in many of these places a
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:31.320]  clinic is made up of a thatched wall
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:34.680]  building with no roof and dirt floors all right
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:39.080]  you can go in there they have no medicines no bandages
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:43.000]  uh... nothing to help deliver a healthy baby none of that stuff
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.440]  but you can look over in the corner and see piles and piles
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:52.280]  of birth control pills and condoms with united with american flags and USAID on
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:56.200]  the ends of them in Haiti today to give you an example of how
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:01.320]  profound this problem is in Haiti today it's estimated that 90% of the female
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:05.160]  population in Haiti has access to free birth control
[2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:10.360]  supplied by the united states government but only 20% of the Haitian people
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:15.720]  have access to clean drinking water most of the 80% of the Haitian people get
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:19.800]  their water out of sewers and out of open pits
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:23.800]  and out of streams and it's all meant to kill them instead of going in
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:27.560]  educating them stabilizing the population the royal commission says
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:31.080]  we're going to let their populations explode as a way to devastate them
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:34.360]  economically so we can then come in and mop up later
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:38.280]  with eugenics i mean it is it is just hellish what they're doing
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:43.400]  it is it is it is obscene i mean it is uh it's an obscenity of the first order
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:47.480]  and i you know that the sad thing about this is
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:52.120]  is that so much of this is done under the guise of compassion
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.920]  that as you mentioned a moment ago basically the american people look the
[2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:57.720]  other way and they don't understand what is
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:01.480]  actually going on in these places there is no reason
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:05.160]  for some of these countries in africa that have large reserves of natural
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:09.400]  resources for these countries to be poor year in and year out for
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:11.960]  generation in and generation out a hundred years
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:15.960]  consistently being poor there is no reason for that
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:19.400]  other than that outside forces are manipulating
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:23.160]  their economies and manipulating their population well it's the economic hit
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:26.200]  man that john perkins talks about it's on we have the on the world bank
[2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:29.800]  documents they go in and destroy their economies by design
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:33.240]  and i mean look at haiti a bunch of sugar cane slaves never allowed to have
[2:50:33.240 --> 2:50:35.880]  education they're hit by hurricanes every year
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:39.880]  there's constant cia coups and you know people say oh they're just black
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:42.200]  they're not even human that's why they live in squalor
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:46.200]  that is such a wicked cop out meanwhile the elites are basically putting out
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:50.280]  rat poison for them to kill their children uh
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:54.360]  and and a lot of racist people think all good this is all being done to whites
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:58.200]  as well ladies and gentlemen we're all under the soft killed eugenics system
[2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:01.400]  as well stay there sir this is very powerful info

[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:32.360]  uncompromised opponent of abortion in 86 he created the life activist seminar and
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:35.560]  trained more than 15 000 pro-life activists all across the united states of
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:38.520]  canada then in 92 he found the life dynamics which has
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:41.960]  since become widely recognized as one of the most innovative and
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:44.440]  professional pro-life organizations in america
[2:54:44.440 --> 2:54:48.040]  under marks direction life dynamics has done trailblazing research in the
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:51.400]  abortion industry and developed an extensive litigation support system
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:54:54.760]  to help women sue the abortionist who kill, injure, or sexually assault them
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:57.480]  since 92 life dynamics has also carried out an

[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:12.120]  keep the state out of their body it has nothing to do with that and when they
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:15.400]  find out it's about eugenics and when they find out
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:19.720]  how evil it is they wake up and mark has agreed to stay with their 15 20 minutes
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:21.880]  the next hour so we can talk about some other subjects
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:26.120]  plan parenthood the nazis the pedophile rings all the key info that i've
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:29.160]  separately verified not just from his research so
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:32.200]  and he's a big national leader so this stuff's well documented and he's been
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.760]  you know bringing that out as he said for years
[2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:39.240]  but you were telling me during the break about congress seeing this
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:43.720]  members of congress and this even waking up people and i asked why didn't you put
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:46.040]  and maybe you don't want to get into this because then they'll try to spin it
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:49.400]  i said why didn't you put obama increasing the abortion funding and
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:53.000]  eugenics funding in here and and and you explained
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.840]  i think eloquently why do you want to get into that or or just move on
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:56:01.160]  well but i'm happy to talk about the the situation that happened in congress
[2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:05.320]  last week we had a congressman who had
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:10.040]  heard about the dvd uh calling we sent him a copy of it
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:13.000]  he was just blown away by it as a lot of people are when they see this
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:16.840]  information and um he wanted to show it
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:19.800]  and make it available to members of congress and their staff to come watch
[2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:24.200]  so last thursday they had a showing for it
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:27.560]  and um it was extraordinarily well attended
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:31.320]  the response that we got was amazing and
[2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:35.320]  they people were saying look we didn't everybody out there's other people need
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:37.640]  to see this and everybody didn't get to come
[2:56:37.640 --> 2:56:41.480]  so they agreed to show it again the next day on friday
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:48.040]  on friday we had representatives of 19 congressmen who are members of the cbc
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:51.800]  you're the congressional black caucus send representatives
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:55.080]  now we knew and people that were there in the little
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:59.560]  uh reception they had beforehand said it was clear
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:02.680]  from the attitude these people had that they were
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:07.000]  uh hostile that they they knew it was it had something to do with stopping
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:10.440]  abortion and it held it was being sponsored by a guy who was a republican
[2:57:10.440 --> 2:57:14.680]  and a pro-lifer so they were coming there basically as infiltrators
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:18.600]  to gather information and even be disruptive possibly
[2:57:18.600 --> 2:57:22.520]  um the anticipation was that they would
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:27.000]  eat the food during the reception they'd they'd stay for 10 or 15 minutes of the
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.280]  of the video get up and leave the reality was
[2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:33.960]  that at the end of the video all 19 of them were still there
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:37.480]  uh they clapped two of the women were crying
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:41.640]  um one woman came up to to pastor johnny hunter who's
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:44.920]  head of learn which is the largest african-american pro-life organization
[2:57:44.920 --> 2:57:48.200]  in america one of these women came up to him and said pastor hunter i've got to
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:52.200]  tell you i walked into this room with one view
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:56.440]  and she said i'm leaving with a totally different perspective
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:00.840]  and she said this thing has changed my life and i'm gonna go back talk to my
[2:58:00.840 --> 2:58:04.920]  congressman well praise god because that's the thing this is so over the

[2:59:14.360 --> 2:59:17.800]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead

[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:37.800]  this from newsreel films produced by the robber barons of rockville or
[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:41.000]  funding went into this that were shown to people
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:45.720]  at free showings and shown to school boards to get the eugenics laws passed
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:49.720]  to sterilized babies and it's on record they wouldn't just come
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:52.040]  sterilize women that a lot of times they take a baby and put it in the bucket of
[3:00:52.040 --> 3:00:54.840]  water same thing the commonest chinese do
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:58.200]  so it's also the murder of babies that are already born
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:02.280]  so this is very very serious we hit that break and you were talking about
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:05.800]  all these congressional aides waking up these pro-abortion people
[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:09.400]  coming in and really figuring out that they've been lied to their whole lives
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:12.280]  that this was the genocide of their people and that they thought of it as
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:16.520]  some sacred uh... bill of rights sacrament you're not going to take my
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:20.120]  abortion rights away not knowing it was really hit larian
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:23.480]  it's not knowing that what basically what it was designed to do
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:27.560]  was to wipe out their their their uh... culture
[3:01:27.560 --> 3:01:31.880]  that that's that's the bottom line and you know one of the things people think
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:35.880]  we're we're being at the moon here a lot of times when we talk about
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:39.800]  these what you as you're calling them robber barons uh... but it's all on
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:43.640]  record i mean if this is this is that they wrote they wrote books themselves
[3:01:43.640 --> 3:01:47.400]  let me let me give you one that that if if anybody doubt that they can go study
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:50.520]  themselves it's absolutely true
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:53.400]  uh... and they'll find the documentation on it
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:56.600]  at the end of world war two it was revealed
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:01:59.880]  that the company who manufactured the gas for the
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:03.640]  nazi death camps was a company by g pharman
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:07.400]  and it was later found out when when the allies started researching what had
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:10.440]  been going on with i g pharman it was later found out that not only did they
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:13.160]  manufacture the gas for the nazis using their
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:18.360]  gas chambers i g pharman engineers actually designed the gas chambers
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:23.960]  as a way to induce uh... the nazis to buy the gas from them
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:27.320]  i g pharman engineers and i g pharman board of directors
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:30.840]  uh... members were charged and tried at nuremberg
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:37.160]  after the war now i g pharman was a large uh... company in europe at the
[3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:41.320]  time and they obviously didn't want to go out of business so what they did
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:44.600]  to distance themselves from the holocaust which they were being closely
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:47.640]  linked to especially when all their board of directors also on trial at
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:51.320]  nuremberg they changed the name of the company it became
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:56.440]  known as hurt a g and they survived the company survived not only did survive
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:01.800]  it thrived and today hurt is a gigantic multinational pharmaceutical and
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:06.440]  chemical company now they have they have
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:09.800]  uh... subsidiaries all over the world including the i state their their
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:12.680]  headquarters is in new jersey
[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:17.720]  in france their subsidiary is a company called russall you cloth
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:21.640]  russall you cloth is the company that developed r u forty six the abortion
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:27.080]  pill so in other words the same company i g pharman
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:31.480]  which manufactured the gas for the nazi death camps
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:35.400]  also developed r u forty six to use an american death camps
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:38.120]  killing is our business and business is good
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:41.880]  and here isn't it here's something that's very interesting about this
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:45.400]  it was also revealed in congressional hearings after the war
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:51.000]  that the rockefeller foundation was a business partner with i g pharman
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:54.360]  they even went together and formed another company called standard i g
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:57.720]  pharman for standard oil and which is the american company
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:01.640]  under rockefeller and i g pharman they were actually business partners in that
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:05.480]  partnership even continued in after the war began
[3:04:05.480 --> 3:04:10.520]  so you had i g pharman and rockefeller in bed together to come up with
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.280]  the cyclone b gas that was used in the nazi death camps
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:18.760]  later on i g pharman is developing r u forty six under the name of

[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:35.240]  they couldn't find a manufacturer to manufacturer of
[3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:38.680]  r r u forty six for the visit kills a lot of people that take it stay there
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:41.960]  final segment of our gas we got him back on a routine basis

[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:12.200]  hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:15.400]  inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:26.520]  have to hire blacks to be our front so they don't know we want to kill them
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:32.600]  it is on record all of this goes on so don't be in denial
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:35.720]  about what's set up abortion what runs it
[3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:39.000]  what's happening in this country and the world and the carbon tax and that
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:42.280]  we're carbon based life form that we need to be taxed for having more than
[3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:46.120]  one child and need to be regulated and be licensed to have kids this is the
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:49.160]  eugenics takeover and after our guest leaves us i'm going to get more into
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:52.360]  that but i wanted to play a clip from in-game blueprint for global
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:58.760]  enslavement this is from the movie put out in the 30s
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:04.040]  promoting this stuff and then they had a bunch of newsreels that promoted it
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:08.760]  uh and you know as bad as this movie is it's seen as oh she's really innocent
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:12.040]  she doesn't need to be sterilized because she was adopted
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:15.400]  but it's still oh the retards need to be
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:19.240]  you know sterilized or people that have mental problems need to be or physical
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:23.960]  problems but she's innocent so they put it into
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:28.120]  situational ethics where it's she's innocent but the other
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:32.840]  still deserve it here it is the scientific rationale for tyranny
[3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:38.040]  has always been attractive to elites because it creates a convenient excuse
[3:09:38.040 --> 3:09:42.360]  for treating their fellow man as lower than animals
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:46.920]  robert thomas mouth is famous for saying that a mass food collapse would be
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:49.560]  helpful because it would wipe out the poor
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:55.160]  his fictional scenario would later be called a malthusian catastrophe
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:10:00.760]  malthus is important because his ideas led to the rise of a new scientific
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:04.360]  field that would dominate the course of human history
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:10.920]  for the next 200 plus years charles darwin an admirer of the malthusian
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:14.520]  catastrophe model developed the theory of evolution
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:18.280]  its chief tenet being the survival of the fittest
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:22.760]  with the help of th hoxley known as darwin's bulldog for his strong support
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:26.200]  of darwin's theories darwin's theories were pushed into wide
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:29.160]  acceptance among key scientific circles throughout
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:34.680]  england and then the world darwin's cousin francis galtin credited as the
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:39.160]  father of eugenics saw an opportunity to advance mankind by
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:42.680]  taking the reins of darwin's evolution theory and applied social
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:48.680]  principles to develop social darwinism the families darwin galtin
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:53.400]  hoxley and wedgewood were so obsessed with their new social design theory
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:58.840]  that they pledged their families would only breed with each other
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:02.440]  they falsely predicted that within only a few generations
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:06.120]  they would produce superman
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:12.040]  the emerging pseudoscience was only codifying the practice of inbreeding
[3:11:12.040 --> 3:11:16.200]  already popular within elites for millennia
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:19.320]  the four families experiment was a disaster
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:24.280]  within only two generations of inbreeding close to 90 of their offspring
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:29.880]  either died at birth or were seriously mentally or physically handicapped
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:33.400]  the moneyed class of the planet and particularly the royal families of the
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:36.440]  world were already obsessed with breeding and filled with a
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:40.680]  predatory disdain for the underclass seized on the new science and began
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:49.400]  aggressively enforcing its aims worldwide
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:53.320]  biometrics appears to be a new science but it was actually developed by
[3:11:53.320 --> 3:11:57.960]  galtin back in the 1870s as a way to track racial traits and genetic
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:12:03.720]  histories and as a way to decide who would be licensed to breed
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:08.120]  in 1904 the cold springs harbor research facility was started in the united
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:11.000]  states by eugenicist charles davinport with the
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:17.400]  funding of prominent robber barons carnegie rockefeller and heron
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:21.960]  in 1907 the first sterilization laws were passed in the united states
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:26.680]  citizens with mild deformities or low test scores on their report cards
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:32.200]  were arrested and forcibly sterilized you're 17 aren't you have it
[3:12:32.200 --> 3:12:36.040]  yes but what have you done with my folks well we're trying to help them out of
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:39.640]  something new too they were taken to the hospital this afternoon
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:44.040]  hospital wasn't even taken this morning we thought it was necessary to
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:47.400]  present your family's case to the state medical commission
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:52.280]  not to an examination they decided it was one important action to me
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:56.840]  to have your entire family sterilized well what's that
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.760]  i don't know what you're talking about now in this state we have a law
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:04.200]  which provides for such people to have an operation so there won't be any more
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:09.080]  children i see well we placed your brothers in institutions where they'll
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:12.520]  be properly cared for but you go back to your job soon
[3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:16.920]  i'll arrange to have a hell of a foil but i'm kidding my job i'm not going
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:20.520]  anywhere now you're going to the hospital too well
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:24.920]  and you mean they're going to stop me from having children ever
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:28.920]  exactly i'm all right i tell you i won't go to any hospital
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:32.440]  we don't want any trouble with you young woman if you refuse to go the officer
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:37.560]  here we'll take you by force in 1910 the u.s eugenics record
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:41.160]  office was set up that's in the british and they
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:45.240]  take her to trial and decide to go ahead and sterilize her and it's good
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:50.280]  uh going back to uh mark crutchard this is our history those that don't know
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:53.720]  history are doomed to repeat it christ said the people perish for lack of
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:58.760]  knowledge the truth will set you free i mean it really is true
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:03.000]  and uh so so finish up with the eugenics in the film
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:08.280]  my alpha 21 but then get into and of course love you back i know your time
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:11.640]  is very important sir to get into the other crimes of
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:15.160]  planned parenthood because it's not just their sicko eugenicist the eugenicist
[3:14:15.160 --> 3:14:18.440]  hire sickos who like to engage in crimes against
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:22.040]  children as kind of their payoff to carry out these
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:26.120]  evils so it's kind of a a court of criminals all working together
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:29.480]  each with their different uh different vices they enjoy
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:32.840]  the upper echelon control freaks just enjoy the
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:36.920]  the the the the domination of humanity but their minions
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:42.360]  enjoy a more uh more uh
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:45.640]  more i guess of the field type of behavior go ahead
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:49.560]  yeah what you have to understand is that these people
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:53.320]  honestly believe that they are genetically superior
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:56.520]  to everyone else on the planet it's not that they
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:01.960]  they they do this out of uh hoping that they're genetically superior they
[3:15:01.960 --> 3:15:07.400]  honestly believe it and so in in their kind of twisted world view
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:11.400]  um they i don't i don't think many times they even
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:16.280]  realize how patently evil they are you know if a guy is going out here and
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:20.840]  he's committing uh rapes on the street or murders or robbing
[3:15:20.840 --> 3:15:24.760]  places if you stop him if you go to the prison if you go down to Huntsville
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:28.280]  and you ask these people is what you did wrong is what you did evil
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:31.320]  most of them will tell you yeah they knew it they knew it when they were doing
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:35.640]  it though it was wrong but the the most dangerous part of these eugenics
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:39.640]  this eugenics crowd and this this white elite that we have seen around the
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:43.480]  world over the last 150 years is they honestly believe this stuff they're true
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:48.280]  believers satan has his foot on their throat and they
[3:15:48.280 --> 3:15:50.840]  don't even understand it they don't really realize that that's what they're
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:53.720]  doing but they are the most dangerous people in the
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:57.080]  face of the earth there is nothing there is no force
[3:15:57.080 --> 3:16:00.520]  in the history of mankind that is more dangerous
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:05.320]  than science and technology that is not restrained by
[3:16:05.320 --> 3:16:10.440]  morality and these people see morality is kind of a quaint
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:14.120]  uh philosophy that yeah i'd probably best if the whole world lived by this
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:17.080]  stuff but it's not really realistic and that's not the goal we have to shoot
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:21.240]  for um and we're morally and intellectually superior
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:26.280]  in every way to these people so it's our right to have dominion over
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:29.640]  that's right they say it's illegal in in their system for you to resist them
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:32.600]  you're like well i have a right to live i i have a right to not have sodium
[3:16:32.600 --> 3:16:35.320]  fluoride put my water and tell me i got to shoot my kids up with mercury
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:39.000]  that gives them cancer and they just go you aren't intellectual enough to
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:41.400]  understand that i've had one of them on the air say
[3:16:41.400 --> 3:16:44.440]  we're going to take over the planet alex and we're going to forcibly re-educate
[3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:47.560]  you and to them i go but that's tyranny
[3:16:47.560 --> 3:16:51.080]  no i'm intellectually more advanced than you
[3:16:51.080 --> 3:16:57.080]  and you just psychologically mentally can't even measure up to me so you
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:01.320]  don't get to make that decision well it's it's a it's a part of the arrogance
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:05.240]  and the gall that i that i talked about earlier when they say
[3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.400]  that we have the right as a as u.s. government has the right or actually
[3:17:09.400 --> 3:17:13.400]  their argument was the responsibility to go out and sterilize one fourth of the
[3:17:13.400 --> 3:17:17.000]  world's female population they
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:20.760]  they believe that they are the kind of the chosen people
[3:17:20.760 --> 3:17:23.960]  and if the rest of us were simply as smart as they are
[3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:27.720]  we would agree with them in other words you cannot be intelligent
[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:31.400]  and reach a different conclusion than what they reach and this is
[3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:34.920]  classic neoliberalism in the 20th century in america
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:38.760]  yeah and they say they're very sad about it oh i don't like that we have to
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:41.000]  shoot the young woman up with hiv but
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:44.200]  my god they're gonna destroy the earth if we don't well then how about they go
[3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:48.280]  kill themselves oh but no no no they're the brain trust they've
[3:17:48.280 --> 3:17:52.520]  got to survive this is just classic extermination
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:56.680]  this is just an instinct of a control freak to dominate everybody around them
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:00.040]  and i've talked to these people at the bottom line they get off on it they
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:02.600]  get off on it they're not trying to educate people
[3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:05.640]  they're not trying to no they want to dominate and control
[3:18:05.640 --> 3:18:09.560]  and when i found sir is you're going off their own documents we cover an end game
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:12.680]  is they don't just have positive and negative eugenics as they claim
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:15.800]  that is making the great race greater and live longer and better looking and
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:19.480]  smarter and let's stop the dummies from
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:22.440]  breeding it's worse when you really get into
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:25.720]  higher level eugenics they're targeting the smart and the intelligent
[3:18:25.720 --> 3:18:29.800]  that they think rival them in the power structure so
[3:18:29.800 --> 3:18:33.800]  really them while they're diverting kind of low level races that serve them
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:37.000]  that oh this is just for blacks and mexicans and asians and people
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:39.960]  while they're diverting them when you do when you get a higher level text on
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:42.440]  eugenics and the real operational system that i've
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:45.800]  studied just from the intelligence on the ground of what they're doing
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.240]  their real target is actually who they believe the elite
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:52.200]  most smart people are and that's northern europeans
[3:18:52.200 --> 3:18:56.200]  and jews because they think those are the groups that are real smart
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:18:58.920]  but they want their elite families to stay in control
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:02.840]  so they want to exterminate out those groups because they see them as rivals
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:06.600]  kind of like a male grizzly bear will come up and smell cubs and kill the
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:11.160]  males tigers lions do that some species of birds go and kill
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:14.280]  male baby birds because they think they're going to be competing with them
[3:19:14.280 --> 3:19:17.240]  lately that's actually what they're doing so for all the
[3:19:17.240 --> 3:19:20.600]  racists out there they're putting stuff in your water too
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:24.680]  well it's not what what you're describing there is not unlike if you
[3:19:24.680 --> 3:19:29.480]  think about it alex what always happened in countries that were taken over
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:33.080]  through communist uprisings one of the things that the communist
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:36.520]  always did when they took over a country was execute all the people that
[3:19:36.520 --> 3:19:40.280]  helped them take over because they would see them as potential
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:42.680]  threats and potential rivals in the future
[3:19:42.680 --> 3:19:46.920]  oh that's a great point final segment sorry uh we're having these breaks just
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:49.320]  amazing having mark crutcher on

[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:58.040]  to expose this you need to again abortions being exposed they're still
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:00.600]  killing millions of babies every year but the numbers are
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:04.520]  are going down the polls show people are waking up to this
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:07.960]  and so the establishment's using the phony green revolution now
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:11.400]  as the pretext to put in this world tax of control is that we covered in the
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:14.200]  end game okay mark finishing up we'll have you
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:17.640]  back up for a part two on this you've been gracious with your time
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:20.840]  get more into Planned Parenthood and just some of the other disgusting things
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:25.640]  they're involved with on record that you have documented life dynamics.com
[3:25:25.640 --> 3:25:28.360]  we all like to say i would like to come back some time and talk about
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:31.720]  these other things with their show all in and of themselves and that is the
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:36.680]  the pedophile protection racket and this this issue of marketing that the
[3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:39.880]  body parts of the babies that they kill there's more money in the marketing of
[3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:42.600]  the body parts than there is in the actual abortion
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:46.360]  i would not be surprised in someday in the future
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:51.320]  that you don't see free abortion clinics in order to
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:54.840]  just acquire the bodies they could right now do that that would not be a
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:57.240]  problem and when we were doing our undercover
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:00.520]  investigation that was something that we heard
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:03.640]  discussed that they might actually put
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:07.960]  free abortion clinics out here just just to get the dead bodies because
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:10.440]  you know they could do an abortion for three or four hundred dollars
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:13.560]  charge the woman three or four hundred dollars but they get a body that they
[3:26:13.560 --> 3:26:16.600]  could sell for two thousand well they could get more bodies if they didn't
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:19.320]  charge anything well that's how the scam works they take toxic
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:21.800]  waste from aluminum production and fertilizer
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:24.360]  and then the city of austin pays millions a year
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:27.880]  to put the poison in our water when that company would have to pay to get rid
[3:26:27.880 --> 3:26:30.360]  of it this is kind of the same kind of scam but
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:34.200]  they should be paying for the babies as much as they get for them
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:37.080]  and china we've confirmed and gotten the brochures
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:40.680]  they admittedly render the babies down and put it into cosmetics
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:45.080]  right well that i don't think really alex we have any
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:49.160]  inkling of an idea even those who of us who work in this every day
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:52.920]  any evening of an idea of how deep this thing goes
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:56.040]  but at one point i want to make before we before we leave because i don't want
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:26:58.760]  people to get the wrong idea about something here
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:04.680]  this is not about political parties um it's very often that you hear people
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:07.320]  say yeah we gotta stop those evil democrats and we gotta help the
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:09.800]  republicans let me tell you something
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:13.800]  whether you're talking about the the godless social engineers
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:17.080]  that dominate the democratic party are the godless
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:21.880]  elitists who dominate the republican party they've both been mobbed up in the
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:25.720]  eugenics business for way over a hundred years
[3:27:25.720 --> 3:27:29.320]  and this is something that we need to make sure people understand that we're
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:32.760]  not out here proselytizing for the republican party
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:37.640]  are criticizing the democratic party because as we show in this documentary
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:41.240]  they've both been up to their eyeballs exactly
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:44.840]  because if you just make it left right then that the system can play it off
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:48.600]  against us when really it's system-wide like you said mobbed up
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:52.600]  this is a mob a cult this is really their religion
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.520]  is i mean i've discovered that ibm
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:01.720]  and microsoft are basically eugenics fronts right i mean it just it goes so
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:04.120]  deep well you know a minute ago i i was mentioning
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:07.960]  that rockerfeller was involved in in the production of ij with ij
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:11.640]  farvin uh... and then we were talking about r u 46
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:14.040]  and we got interrupted there by the commercial but
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:18.040]  um when i when they couldn't find a manufacturer for i for r u 46 in the
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:21.000]  united states that they spent eight years looking for someone to actually
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:25.880]  sell it here eventually a chinese company a
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:28.920]  pharmaceutical company owned by the chinese government
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:32.360]  agreed to manufacture rm 46 for the american market
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:36.200]  and they admitted in the press release that they made
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:38.600]  when they announced that they were going to do this
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:42.520]  they admitted that they only did it because their research was being
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:44.600]  underwritten by the rockerfeller foundation
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:48.760]  i saw that in the news unbelievable so the rockerfellers by way of the chai
[3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:52.280]  com government are killing american babies black white
[3:28:52.280 --> 3:28:56.200]  it doesn't matter i mean just outrageous but the majority
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:29:00.280]  uh... but what are the numbers per capita a i mean it's a huge higher level
[3:29:00.280 --> 3:29:04.120]  of black babies are aborted right out of the right in american today
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:09.240]  a black baby is is over five times as likely to be aborted as a white baby
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:14.360]  american women are twelve percent black yet black women make up thirty seven
[3:29:14.360 --> 3:29:17.400]  percent of the abortions more black babies

[3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:57.080]  and the church committee brought a lot of this out as well not just about the cia
[3:33:57.080 --> 3:34:01.320]  and then of course it came out in the 90s about Henry Kissinger in state
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:04.600]  apartment memorandum 200
[3:34:06.760 --> 3:34:12.360]  but the issue here is we're all living under eugenics

[3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:24.520]  the family farms and ranches and that's what this is doing this is all
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:28.520]  about population control every time we get the minutes
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:32.760]  or every time we have a spa or every time one of the

[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:44.120]  majority of these people that's what they talk about
[3:34:44.120 --> 3:34:47.720]  that's why they want the power it's the ultimate control freak and you know we
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:51.000]  talk to these hotel workers and people at builderburg you're after here and we
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:53.160]  say

[3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:16.840]  here's my number here's our info and when they
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:21.000]  actually hear the evil they always come back and say
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:24.360]  absolutely we got to stop these people see folks

[3:35:56.760 --> 3:36:00.280]  you know just just just come i'm joking about seals can't swim they
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:03.560]  they say polar bears can't swim it's it's as ridiculous as saying
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:07.960]  fish can't swim and that you know they're melting and dying and and that
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:11.400]  there's no ice caps when the ice caps are getting bigger i mean
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:16.600]  it's just lies on top of lies on top of lies
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:20.840]  and billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:24.920]  you know world government to carry it out and how they're it's called the good

[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:39.720]  Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey i mean all of these people it is
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:48.360]  it is so disgusting to see all of this going on
[3:36:48.360 --> 3:36:52.520]  and all of this happening and and just wanting people to read it for themselves
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:58.120]  just wanting people to find out what's going on for themselves because
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:05.160]  because this is all real ladies and gentlemen all right um
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:09.720]  you know i want to take a few calls specifically in a limited time we have
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:13.960]  specifically on that last interview you heard about eugenics
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:17.160]  i mean how can any of you listen to us and send me emails saying i'm making this
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:21.000]  up number one i'm not lying they would sue me if
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:25.080]  this stuff wasn't true but number two if there's a 10
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:29.000]  percent chance of what i'm saying being true you better look into it
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:31.320]  buddy
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:37.240]  it's on record i i give this example because it's been on cnn msnbc and
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:40.920]  came out in court the documents got released at bare pharmaceutical
[3:37:40.920 --> 3:37:45.160]  knowingly over 10 years shipped out over a million ampoules of factor eight
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:48.120]  knowing every person that got it was going to be killed by it
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:56.520]  by hiv and hepatitis it it wasn't like they just cold
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:02.440]  bloodedly said i'll murder these people it was for eugenics it wasn't for profit
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:06.280]  they take incredible risk putting drugs out that kill you
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:10.520]  because they want to kill you that's this is their religion
[3:38:10.520 --> 3:38:16.920]  and and and i know that's wild i know it's crazy i'm not i don't believe it
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:19.640]  i don't believe in their system i'm not the crazy one
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:23.160]  i'm the one that looks at them saying it and doing it and says we got to do
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:26.040]  something about this
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:35.960]  and i'm so sick of people in this closed left right paradigm
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:40.200]  if they're a right winger they say i'm a leftist and if they're a leftist they
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:43.640]  say i'm a right winger and they just say that and then never address the facts
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:48.280]  we've laid out never address the information we put out
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:54.200]  they punch up my call screen here so john can send me
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:57.080]  any callers
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:01.240]  from minnesota we're down here in austin texas they're up there in minnesota we
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:04.920]  can also take calls on our system but one eight hundred two five nine nine two
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:07.880]  thirty one uh some of these i said i'd mention
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:13.960]  obama claims ci involvement iran patently falls i mean what an asinine lie
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:19.960]  what a asinine lie when the ci admits they're doing it
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:23.240]  and i was just watching singing in during the break and it's all about the
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:26.680]  police are beating the people and not allowing protest what do you think
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:31.080]  happens around here in most areas of the u.s if you don't get a permit
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:34.840]  the cops dress up like protesters attack their own officers
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:37.880]  and then start breaking collar bones and in some cases shooting people to death
[3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:41.080]  rubber bullets now i'm not defending that i'm not
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:46.440]  defending the moolas the issue is this thing is cia funded on record
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:51.240]  and the media shouldn't be lying to everybody san it in truth
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:55.480]  and they want to demonize iran so the whole country can be smart bomb and
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:39:58.280]  you'll see a whole bunch of dead women bleeding to death but you won't see it
[3:39:58.280 --> 3:40:02.040]  on our news then you've seen somebody when a
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:05.160]  when a big two thousand pound bomb blows up 50 yards away and
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:09.240]  they get cut in half or get their head blown off there's lots of blood then
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:13.000]  you see all the photos of dead little kids everywhere the neocons send me
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:16.360]  threatening emails when we post them going good kill more than kids
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:21.240]  see you're being manipulated with psychology
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:26.280]  and they want to put a guy in power who announced he won the election
[3:40:26.280 --> 3:40:29.560]  before the polls were closed so he could then cause it and when he's the guy
[3:40:29.560 --> 3:40:33.400]  that bombed the marine core barracks you're now loving the guy but see
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:35.800]  that's how it you now love kodafi because you're not real
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:40.200]  conservatives those of you out there you're sick of freaks who are just
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:44.360]  mentally ill and worship the system your totes your bootlickers
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:49.400]  your cowards but none of this is important missing governor was in
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:53.000]  argentina he told everybody he was going on vacation
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:59.320]  he told him where he was his political enemies made this up
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:02.600]  and because he's not going along with the new world order on several issues i'm
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:05.400]  not saying the guy's a good guy just that
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:09.080]  it's just like ron paul gets told he's in a big hotel banquet room
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:15.800]  next to a suite and that that the austrian newspaper wants to interview him
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:18.600]  and he walks in they say please go in here sir while he moves from equipment
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:22.680]  he goes into a room next to it sasha barren cohen runs in and drops his
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:25.960]  pants and ron paul runs out of the room and the
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:29.720]  media is saying ron paul's got to explain himself see this is them
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:34.200]  trying to kill his political future and the dumb public loves petty things
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:37.400]  like this oh oh the governor went somewhere he's
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:41.480]  bad oh ron paul got set up by the guy that did
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:44.760]  borat you know meanwhile they're putting cancer
[3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:47.800]  viruses in your shots i mean can you start caring about the cancer
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:51.880]  viruses in your shots you care about your kids enough to do that can you at
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:56.040]  least stop giving them fluoride water

[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:00.920]  they better come from a spring of its bottle of water
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:08.760]  or it means it was put through um just charcoal filters and the fluoride was
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:11.160]  left in
[3:42:13.400 --> 3:42:18.360]  and i and i can't believe i'm the radical i'm the bad guy because

[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:35.480]  and you know i guess going back to iran the big message here is
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:40.280]  the police state's good but not
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:45.160]  in iran then it's then it's bad documents back saudi links to extremist

[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:54.360]  operation who works for the cia and massad you've already had the head of
[3:43:54.360 --> 3:43:57.560]  the embassy there on tape saying yeah they told us let the hijackers in the
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:44:00.280]  u.s even though they were flagged as terrorists because they were that was a
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:04.200]  cia cover pakistan official behind killing of the

[3:44:13.160 --> 3:44:17.240]  and then look at this report climate bill separate vote after deal is reached
[3:44:17.240 --> 3:44:20.280]  they're saying they're not letting the public see the bill but that it does
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:24.520]  have a tax on all carbon and the feds are
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:27.960]  basically completely taking over but the public can't see the bill
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:31.240]  before it is passed you can go read the wall street journal article and they
[3:44:31.240 --> 3:44:34.120]  just act like that's totally normal because the wall street journal
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:37.320]  owned by the big banks and rupert murdoch is going to be taking your money
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:41.160]  and put it directly in their fat mouths it's like golden sacks is getting record
[3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:47.160]  bonus money off the bailout money record bonuses for those crooks
[3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:50.280]  obama we will get health care reform this year
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:54.200]  and it'll be like the kind of care the native americans get being sterilized
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:57.000]  and euthanized the kind the va veterans get
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:02.040]  obama condemns violence against iranian protesters it's all just too rich
[3:45:02.040 --> 3:45:07.240]  um got a few other stories i'm gonna have but let's go to calls right now
[3:45:07.240 --> 3:45:11.240]  john in washington you're on the air go ahead
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:15.800]  how are you doing alex i'm i'm doing good i'm exposing these murderers that's
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:19.400]  that's what i do well that's what i'm trying to do here too i live right
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:24.600]  between two relatively large um indian reservations
[3:45:24.600 --> 3:45:27.800]  and um i've had several discussions with these folks about
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:31.880]  oh just different things and a great deal about
[3:45:31.880 --> 3:45:35.880]  um uh this eugenics issue and and they just
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:41.640]  basically opened handedly deny it so what i've done is i've
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:45.640]  rented the uh screening room at the community center
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:50.040]  and i'm going to invite all of the officials from the
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:54.040]  uh tell me how this works and we're just gonna watch that uh
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:57.960]  watch the show and see what they think about that good let me explain how this
[3:45:57.960 --> 3:46:01.640]  works they're not evil people probably but they're in denial
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:05.080]  they rationalize what they're doing because they think reality is what they
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:08.680]  decided is in their head like oh this isn't a cliff i'll just jump off
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:13.480]  but but it is a cliff so they're delusional and they always hire people
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:17.160]  they all the government always gives the money to the little group that steals
[3:46:17.160 --> 3:46:21.480]  most of it controls it and and you know it's the corrupt indian
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:24.280]  agents and then they just hire the corrupt tribes to do it
[3:46:24.280 --> 3:46:28.760]  it's on congressional record that up until the 1980s they sterilized
[3:46:28.760 --> 3:46:33.080]  40 plus percent of native american women it was the london guardian yesterday
[3:46:33.080 --> 3:46:36.680]  the un sterilizing women and lying to them about what the procedure is
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:39.880]  they just say oh i am the doctor you need to be put under now honey
[3:46:39.880 --> 3:46:43.080]  and we're going to give you medicine for that broken leg and they sterilize you
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:46.040]  or you come in for dentistry and they knock you out on the gas and sterilize
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:51.160]  you so that's london guardian yesterday so
[3:46:51.160 --> 3:46:55.800]  all of this is happening and going on so i would go to the tribes themselves
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:46:59.480]  and explain uh you know the pimp leaders
[3:46:59.480 --> 3:47:03.160]  are in denial because they they don't want to notice what's going on but but go
[3:47:03.160 --> 3:47:06.600]  ahead get personal invitations to this and the
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:10.440]  screening room is at the community center on the reservation
[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:14.680]  so we're we're going to draw a crowd they're one way or the other and and
[3:47:14.680 --> 3:47:19.080]  just let them understand because what bothers me so much about this
[3:47:19.080 --> 3:47:23.080]  is that they get applied with cash for every conceivable reason if you go to
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:27.640]  your a a meeting you get a check if you you know it's just whatever and they
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:29.960]  think that the federal government is their
[3:47:29.960 --> 3:47:34.040]  good buddy and their friend and i've tried to tell them that ever since
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:38.440]  to my knowledge ever since the the scandal concerning geronimo
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:42.520]  the indian tribes i would name one treaty that the federal government has
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:46.040]  ever lived up to no exactly i've got articles today where they're
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:49.160]  making six-year-olds go into counseling if they
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:52.520]  misbehave in school it's going into a mind control
[3:47:52.520 --> 3:47:56.360]  induction cult center where the where where this you see they they tell the
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:47:59.480]  parents don't discipline your kids then the kids are bad in the state tasers
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:02.840]  into death this is all about mind control all about the state
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:06.200]  stirring up as much trouble as they can it's in their own handbooks
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:10.280]  i appreciate your call order out of chaos nate in georgia
[3:48:10.280 --> 3:48:13.320]  nate you're on the air hey how you doing alex
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:18.200]  good um well the reason why i'm calling this person for most i wanted to thank
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:21.400]  you uh i have watched a lot of the zett guys movies back
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:24.840]  before i had to subvert you and um you really turned me on to open me up a
[3:48:24.840 --> 3:48:27.960]  little bit more however uh this this call is
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:30.440]  actually concerning today's show and another show
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.040]  that you had a few weeks a couple days ago about the reptilian brain
[3:48:34.040 --> 3:48:38.280]  and uh i had did some research on the reptilian brain and how it function
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:41.720]  and i was appalled at the stuff that i found out
[3:48:41.720 --> 3:48:46.200]  um well concerning the eugenics program that you're talking about
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:49.720]  um i did some little research and i put two into together
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:54.520]  well i was on youtube the other day and just going through some clips about
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:58.120]  the reptilian brain and i read i came across this one clip
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:03.000]  it said uh what lies in plain sight and it was a michael jackson video
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:06.520]  well this gentleman did an analytical breakdown of the video
[3:49:06.520 --> 3:49:10.600]  and it was a psychological manipulation teaching people
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:17.240]  to engage in homosexuality and uh uh uh male um male homosexuality and male
[3:49:17.240 --> 3:49:20.680]  here's the deal i'm not even judging or attacking those people
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:25.960]  but the issue is yes yes if you go to plan parenthood's main website it's all
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:28.920]  about how to be gay or lesbian because they don't want you having kids
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:32.680]  they decided a hundred plus years ago teach the slaves
[3:49:32.680 --> 3:49:36.920]  to not have families break the family up try to make it fashionable
[3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:41.800]  to have uh a male on male female on female so that they stop
[3:49:41.800 --> 3:49:45.480]  having kids so they don't have a family unit so society
[3:49:45.480 --> 3:49:48.600]  is decimated see they want everybody to be part of the state
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:51.960]  so the family has to go to be absorbed so it's them
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:56.520]  persecuting the family cps takes the babies to give to the gay and lesbian
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:49:59.720]  families we don't like being persecuted and hunted by
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:02.760]  you like as planet of the apes and your cps are
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:06.440]  throwing nets over us and our kids because you know because you want them
[3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:09.160]  for yourself you know as a slave back at the
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:12.680]  and i mean basically that's what this is they're attacking us
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:16.680]  not the average gay person out in the street but the big controllers
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:21.000]  up above that's what they're into and and and yes i was familiar with that and
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.080]  for those that don't know it's not david ike and the whole
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:26.360]  reptilian thing it's that in physiology it's taught in
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:29.720]  medical school you have the brain stem the reptilian brain different parts of
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:33.160]  the brain it's called the reptilian brain because it's shaped like a salt
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:38.360]  water crocodile brain and it has all those primitive functions of
[3:50:38.360 --> 3:50:43.560]  fight flight aggression all of that in it and that's the kind of
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:48.200]  base programming that that subliminals and things manipulate
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:52.120]  that's what i want to get you in a mesmerized fashion watching tv

[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:48.440]  this ladies and gentlemen is the reality
[3:54:48.440 --> 3:54:51.400]  this is what they're into this is what they're pushing this is what everything
[3:54:51.400 --> 3:54:54.360]  revolves around you can't let the establishment always set the
[3:54:54.360 --> 3:54:57.800]  agenda of whatever new diversion or distraction it is you've got to set the
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:02.040]  agenda on eugenics and then we know who they are and what they're doing
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:06.200]  bunch of criminals let's go ahead Nate finish up the point you were making
[3:55:06.200 --> 3:55:10.440]  well the one last thing i wanted to tell you about was uh...
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:14.040]  there's an uh... useful speaking about pedophilia earlier in the show
[3:55:14.040 --> 3:55:17.720]  um and how they're they're taking people's babies well
[3:55:17.720 --> 3:55:22.680]  again while doing our research i came across another video clip on youtube
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:25.320]  um this video clip was called uh...
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:28.760]  i think it's in the outfield it was a documentary on movies
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:33.880]  that were publicized for children and for this movie had an incredible amount
[3:55:33.880 --> 3:55:37.560]  of subliminal pedophilia an incredible amount
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:42.280]  and this movie was made about ten years ago so since then a little bit of a
[3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:45.560]  more research and i found that since this movie was released
