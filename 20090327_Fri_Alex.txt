[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:41.520]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us today
[00:41.520 --> 00:49.200]  it is Friday the 27th day of March 2009 we have our weekly financial update with
[00:49.200 --> 00:53.280]  Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster joining us in one hour then
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.200]  we have Dr. Whitaker just an amazing researcher on the causes and solutions to
[00:58.200 --> 01:03.000]  disease malnutrition and the medical sins that are killing the world his book
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.200]  is medicine and it just gets into this the amazing situation we're facing with
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.640]  the New World Order Rockefeller medicine so that is coming up in T-minus
[01:13.640 --> 01:19.240]  two hours from now and we'll have open phones when he joins us there on the
[01:19.240 --> 01:26.440]  show interesting here I also see that I have a interview coming up after the
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.720]  show with the Huffington Post wonder what they want to talk about and bunch of
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.560]  radio interviews tonight I tell you I don't feel too wicked but I guess the
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.680]  saying no rest for the wicked we're all fallen and there is no rest for those I
[01:38.680 --> 01:44.400]  guess trying to fight the good fight against the wicked so I guess that goes
[01:44.400 --> 01:52.080]  both ways okay I am trying to ferret this out because there's so many bills
[01:52.080 --> 01:57.040]  there's five different bills in the house that have language about compulsory
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.800]  national service and different variants of it the House and Senate passed
[02:02.800 --> 02:09.000]  versions into conference that had language concerning compulsory service
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.840]  and setting up a body to set up a systems for compulsory service then I got a
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.920]  version of the bill that had it removed and now I'm getting all these calls and
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.240]  emails and reports people saying no that it's been added back in and this is
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.880]  what happens with these bills there's you know they're being attached to hundreds
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.200]  and hundreds of other bills and larger packages as it's debated along with the
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.000]  budget and so we'll get to the bottom of this hopefully by the end of the show
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.400]  today I got Watson Paul Watson and others on that situation financial experts
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.080]  say recession ends by year's end this out of the Associated Press this is the
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.480]  same group of private fellow reserve bankers and the same corrupt Treasury
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.000]  Department that has been telling us for years and years that oh we're not in a
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.040]  recession and then they finally came out and said okay we've been in a recession
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.400]  for the last few years well now according to every benchmark three
[03:06.400 --> 03:14.840]  consecutive quarters of contraction we're into six quarters of contraction or a
[03:14.840 --> 03:20.200]  year and a half three quarters of a continual contraction with the economy
[03:20.200 --> 03:29.200]  shrinking and job losses is a depression it is depression type numbers now it
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.400]  somehow could be reversed but it won't be reversed setting up a new bank of the
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.720]  world and a new global currency now finally it's on the nightly news Fox
[03:37.720 --> 03:44.520]  CNN CBS nightly news AP Reuters just everywhere hundreds of articles last
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.600]  week the UN calling for a world currency issued by the IMF and World Bank
[03:49.600 --> 03:56.800]  together now I want to explain something here we already have a world currency the
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.080]  private fellow reserve is just the regional shareholder of the larger
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.720]  global banking system it's private a select group of less than 15 families
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.720]  that own the central banks of Europe England in the United States Canada
[04:12.720 --> 04:22.000]  Australia New Zealand Germany France Switzerland the list goes on and on and
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.680]  any nation you see having rebels financed to overthrow it by the West any
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.600]  nation you see with CIA coups or MI6 funded coups or Mossad funded goes
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.240]  that's a nation that hasn't allowed the private banks to come in and take over
[04:35.240 --> 04:39.360]  their issuance of currency so we already have the world currency they're
[04:39.360 --> 04:46.120]  already issuing IMF and World Bank monetization just fiat money they create
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.560]  out of nowhere and they go out and buy the other sub currencies with that so
[04:50.560 --> 04:55.540]  they just want to make you accept their new global currency and track everything

[06:07.760 --> 06:12.080]  a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.320]  to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[06:17.320 --> 06:21.320]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[06:21.320 --> 06:25.280]  yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a
[06:25.280 --> 06:29.960]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of
[06:29.960 --> 06:37.360]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.080]  about left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[07:04.160 --> 07:07.320]  Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want
[07:07.320 --> 07:11.440]  to have food if you're a politician who voted for the bailout don't call e-foods
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.400]  direct if you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of
[07:15.400 --> 07:20.560]  650 climatologists who know the earth is cooling don't call e-foods direct if
[07:20.560 --> 07:24.360]  you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people don't get food if
[07:24.360 --> 07:27.680]  you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending
[07:27.680 --> 07:31.440]  yourself and preventing the crime don't call e-foods direct if you believe the
[07:31.440 --> 07:35.600]  official report on 9-11 you won't need food if you think the warnings on the
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.880]  Alex Jones show are foolish don't call e-foods direct for the rest of you go

[08:05.440 --> 08:11.240]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.200]  network okay we've got three hours and 52 minutes spanning out before us Bob
[08:16.200 --> 08:20.960]  channel this weekly visit coming up and then Dr. Whitaker will be joining us
[08:20.960 --> 08:25.960]  author of medicine to really bring out some hardcore information about how the
[08:25.960 --> 08:30.760]  main medical system is basically a biological chemical warfare system to
[08:30.760 --> 08:33.960]  carry out eugenics against the people the doctors are compartmentalized the
[08:33.960 --> 08:37.040]  nurses are compartmentalized but we have all the Rockefeller Foundation
[08:37.040 --> 08:40.960]  documents UN documents it's all the giant eugenics operation Bella Melinda
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.760]  Gates all of it their foundation very wicked and I happen to have a story here
[08:47.760 --> 08:54.440]  a mainstream news article and I want to get to later when he's on with us where
[08:54.440 --> 09:00.360]  they're panicking in places like the Ukraine close to half the population is
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.080]  refusing to take vaccines and the citizens there are not under the total
[09:05.080 --> 09:08.600]  mind control like the American people are in the British are they're saying
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.320]  look people keep dying when they take these shots people keep getting cancer
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.760]  people keep there's been a bunch of vaccine trials there that killed the
[09:16.760 --> 09:21.320]  people that take them they read the news about people dying in mass of the HPV
[09:21.320 --> 09:30.040]  shot here as well in the United States and all over Africa all over the world
[09:30.040 --> 09:35.160]  people are refusing in India they won't take it and so now the United Nations
[09:35.160 --> 09:41.240]  and others are moving to try to engineer pharmacological crops which they've
[09:41.240 --> 09:47.680]  had for decades but to force you to take vaccines that will be put in that will
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.640]  not even put it they will biologically grow in the plants and I've got other
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.680]  stories here proposed law would require flu shots for preschoolers I mean this
[09:58.680 --> 10:03.080]  is the type of just out of control news and information that we have coming up
[10:03.080 --> 10:10.760]  later in the show today when you watch the different pre-g20 meetings that
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.640]  are happening in the Councils of Europe in the United States in Congress I was
[10:16.640 --> 10:29.320]  watching c-span hearings yesterday they are openly announcing a new global
[10:29.320 --> 10:39.000]  currency and this is the heart of world government this is the this is the key
[10:39.000 --> 10:50.240]  to world government if you are a private group of banks and you can openly
[10:50.240 --> 10:59.200]  publicly issue your own currency worldwide you can buy up any country you
[10:59.200 --> 11:03.360]  want any industry you want you can buy off militaries you can buy off the media
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.040]  and that's what they've already done stealthily through the Federal Reserve
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.160]  and the Bank of England that are privately owned but they just scan where
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.040]  the government gets the permission to issue the currency and liquidity and
[11:16.040 --> 11:19.160]  then they pay interest to the bankers well that isn't enough for the bankers
[11:19.160 --> 11:25.080]  they are going to in whole issue the currency themselves and then you will
[11:25.080 --> 11:31.600]  pay taxes to them for the right to use their currency and so you will pay in
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.880]  whole for quote one dollar that'll be in a global unit you will pay for that
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.320]  dollar and you will pay interest on that dollar but more importantly the bankers
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.400]  can then restrict the value of the currency or they can increase the value
[11:44.400 --> 11:46.880]  of the currency they can play different regional currencies because they're
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.080]  gonna have regional currencies they don't want to come out with one global
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.120]  currency there'll be a global super currency as they've now stated in hundreds
[11:52.120 --> 11:55.400]  of reports we were reading this in white papers you know decades ago now it's
[11:55.400 --> 12:00.040]  mainstream news as they roll it out we're now here but they still want to have
[12:00.040 --> 12:04.200]  regional currencies they control that are based on the super currency they're
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.960]  just local units of that so they can rise one currency and lower another to
[12:08.960 --> 12:12.000]  create havoc in the markets and consolidate power as well you know they
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.640]  always say they're doing all this for stabilizing effect it's the exact
[12:14.640 --> 12:19.560]  opposite they seize power by creating booms getting everybody in debt to them
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.400]  with fiat made up liquidity and money and they implode things when they know
[12:25.400 --> 12:30.120]  that mathematically basically no country or nation or major corporation can pay
[12:30.120 --> 12:36.120]  it back this is the name of the game it's monopoly it's fire sale and so that's
[12:36.120 --> 12:39.440]  why they destroyed confidence and they have gotten unlimited power in Europe
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.800]  in the United States illegitimately to have tens of trillions of dollars
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.720]  pumped into their coffers and then interest on that debt interest on the
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.080]  money they're given we give them the money and then we pay interest on the
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.720]  money we gave them to them but now they're just going to issue it wholesale
[12:55.720 --> 12:58.880]  themselves and they've been doing this for several years of the Federal Reserve
[12:58.880 --> 13:02.640]  it's come out now they admit it we told you last year they were doing it it's
[13:02.640 --> 13:05.720]  come out in mainstream news London Telegraph Times of London Associated
[13:05.720 --> 13:10.560]  Press Reuters that that the IMF and World Bank are already and the Federal
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.480]  Reserve are already issuing a super currency that's monetized only to other
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.520]  financial institutions that are part of their cartel and so all the rest of the
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.440]  world is cash poor and they've cut off the cash conduit pipeline to the people
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.000]  in governments they themselves are using all of the fiat currency they've
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.840]  created to buy everything up I mean this is the most galactic sized fraud the
[13:36.840 --> 13:43.560]  most colossal the most just unspeakably gargantuan out in the open
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.360]  ridiculously evil thing you can imagine so they love people talking about a
[13:48.360 --> 13:55.800]  hundred and sixty five million dollars AIG they just they just absolutely reveled in that no
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.040]  discussion the 9.7 trillion stolen the last five and a half months in the US
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.440]  alone tens of trillions more worldwide by the same people no discussion of them
[14:03.440 --> 14:06.200]  openly setting up a world bank and a world currency I mean they're putting
[14:06.200 --> 14:09.520]  in the news and telling you that's the solution and they're doing it but no
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.080]  real discussion about how these are criminals and this is world government
[14:13.080 --> 14:20.880]  even as their articles say it is world government run by the banks and they're
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.200]  going to bring in neo feudalism and complete surfdom so I'm going to go
[14:26.200 --> 14:34.080]  over that report well this group of reports here on the show today but I
[14:34.080 --> 14:37.040]  want to get started with this and it's 11 minutes long then we'll go into the
[14:37.040 --> 14:42.080]  next segment listeners in England actually use the soundtrack from in game
[14:42.080 --> 14:50.320]  glad folks are enjoying that they put a little music under it but it's its clips
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.880]  and then I saw this two days ago meant to play at the last two days and I have
[14:54.880 --> 14:57.360]  I've had time since then because we're going to use some clips of this in this
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.240]  next Obama film I went and watched hours last night and I woke up at 5 a.m. to
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.680]  go back to sleep and watched hours more of the European Parliamentary debate on
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.000]  what's happening and they openly say world government world taxes world
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.120]  regulation Gordon Brown says you won't be able to go anywhere in the world
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.800]  without the new Bank of the World controlling you he calls it a global
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.120]  Europe the entire planet will be tied into the European Union and for those
[15:27.120 --> 15:33.600]  that love to obsess on Rome running things I have been looking more into it
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.000]  and the European Union was founded in Rome Treaty of Rome 57 the Pope does
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.040]  say it's a world government of the European Union Tony Blair has converted
[15:42.040 --> 15:48.160]  to Catholicism and this does have a major thread of the Catholic Church at the
[15:48.160 --> 15:51.880]  heart of it and I'm not here bashing Catholics I don't bash Jews I don't bash
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.440]  Catholics I don't bash Protestants I don't like getting it all this infighting
[15:55.440 --> 15:58.840]  that you know I don't care if you're a Catholic or a Protestant or a Jew or
[15:58.840 --> 16:03.120]  whatever you are we should be against a Bank of the World ruling us and then
[16:03.120 --> 16:06.160]  in Israel's heavily involved the US is heavily involved the Rothschilds are
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.880]  heavily involved I mean at the top seats of power it's it's it's a you know
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.800]  every major power sector is involved in this but definitely I've been
[16:15.800 --> 16:22.880]  researching this deeply and it really does have a central core of the city of
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.720]  Rome see notice how it's a private city of banking just a few square miles
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.360]  within the city of London itself that is the financial head of the world and
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.040]  you know mainstream news admits that and it's privately held and has its own
[16:38.040 --> 16:44.440]  rules its own laws and has set the global maritime system of law that we're
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.920]  under that is tyrannical that's Napoleonic that is Roman it's really
[16:49.920 --> 16:53.280]  Roman civil law but modern times they call it Napoleonic law guilty of the
[16:53.280 --> 16:58.720]  bourbon innocent the rest of it the administrative law courts and enjoy the
[16:58.720 --> 17:02.480]  law of merchants going back to really before Rome to Greece and Babylon and
[17:02.480 --> 17:08.760]  Egypt and Alexandria and Cairo but I digress then you have the city of Rome
[17:08.760 --> 17:13.400]  that is setting up as global ecclesiastical merger of all the religions
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.840]  calling for a new world order if you're a Christian it's quite blasphemous to have
[17:17.840 --> 17:20.960]  the last two popes having hundreds of religious leaders including animus and
[17:20.960 --> 17:27.760]  others all meeting and saying it's all one God so you've got to you know go
[17:27.760 --> 17:30.320]  ahead and tell it like it is and that's why a lot of Catholics are very upset I
[17:30.320 --> 17:35.840]  know and because this is just amazing to see all of this unfolding and then you
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.680]  have the city of DC which is the political military head of the world
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.600]  and it's a district of Columbia and incorporated private corporation and
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.880]  that is a fact so you have the city of Rome the city of London and the city of
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.080]  DC the district of Columbia there wasn't incorporated too long after the
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.400]  founding of this nation and has been slowly but now we're coming to the end
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.200]  abolishing all the constitutional institutions and bringing in this
[18:01.200 --> 18:09.160]  tyranny so that's just some of the news that we will be covering today we come
[18:09.160 --> 18:15.520]  back on the start the first part of this 11-minute clip that and again I've been
[18:15.520 --> 18:22.800]  watching hours of the parliamentary debates ahead of the open public rollout
[18:22.800 --> 18:26.640]  of a new global government the global currency it's already been set up but
[18:26.640 --> 18:28.920]  it's kind of like when they build a ship in a shipyard they've got these big
[18:28.920 --> 18:36.360]  giant curtains you've all seen the old black and white newsreels and they drop
[18:36.360 --> 18:42.040]  the giant curtains and there's a huge ship and then they release the pins that
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.400]  hold it and it slides into the water and you know it's a big spectacular splash
[18:46.400 --> 18:53.040]  they have now dropped the curtain they April 2nd with the G20 are going to
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.200]  then have it slide off the blocks into the into the channel and then in the
[18:58.200 --> 19:01.960]  coming months after that they are going to bash the bottle of champagne on its
[19:01.960 --> 19:07.800]  stern or on its bow and it's going to cruise out of the harbor into the open
[19:07.800 --> 19:12.000]  sea and that's world government and then they'll just continue with their new
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.040]  financial total world domination imploding economies consolidating power
[19:16.040 --> 19:19.720]  bankrupting everything so they can come in and buy it up and then turning
[19:19.720 --> 19:23.120]  government loose and spy forces and police state and force compulsory
[19:23.120 --> 19:26.320]  service being announced everywhere worldwide and it is just going to get
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.360]  worse and worse and worse I mean we are in for deep trouble because when they
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.160]  get this global financial power and a world ID that will still be a national
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.800]  ID but globally standardized will track trace track everywhere you're going
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.080]  control you can't run anywhere then they're going to carry out the one-child
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.480]  policy the controlled plague releases and from here on out it becomes hit
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.400]  larion the diane is going to start i mean it's already starting if you were in
[19:50.400 --> 19:53.520]  cambodia or iraq or hundreds of other countries with the globalists are
[19:53.520 --> 19:58.120]  slaughtering people with their proxies but we're gonna start dying here and in
[19:58.120 --> 20:01.320]  europe so get ready to die
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.480]  let's go to the heart of the matter life-change tea has had some commercials
[20:08.480 --> 20:12.880]  that are not appealing to those who live in denial maybe we are to believe there
[20:12.880 --> 20:17.640]  are no parasites in the world and that having a clog colon is good for you that

[21:07.600 --> 21:13.400]  civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as
[21:13.400 --> 21:18.520]  well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[21:18.520 --> 21:22.240]  working for the best interest of the american people while obama's already
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.920]  fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a
[21:26.920 --> 21:31.640]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of
[21:31.640 --> 21:37.640]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.080]  left or right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[22:12.000 --> 22:16.160]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw free
[22:16.160 --> 22:19.720]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal reserve note forcing
[22:19.720 --> 22:23.640]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these

[23:58.320 --> 24:23.960]  impossible you see to go back to the shipyard analogy they build this giant
[24:23.960 --> 24:30.120]  warmock of devil tree this new world order system they build it by the thin
[24:30.120 --> 24:35.480]  veil but we knew people that were in there working on it and the builders of
[24:35.480 --> 24:38.200]  the ship bragged about what they were constructing they just didn't put it out
[24:38.200 --> 24:41.680]  on the news and then now they're ready to launch the thing they can't hide it
[24:41.680 --> 24:45.000]  anymore so they're announcing it and trying to put a good spin on it well we
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  know what comes next what they plan to do with this new world order system that
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.920]  they're almost done with and that is wage unholy war against the people of the
[24:56.920 --> 25:00.640]  planet against the people of the world now I want to go ahead and get started
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.920]  with this European Parliament debate and this is members of the European
[25:06.920 --> 25:10.720]  Parliament from England France all over the world and Prime Minister of England
[25:10.720 --> 25:16.600]  Gordon Brown is there so listen carefully here it is
[25:16.600 --> 25:22.240]  to the European Parliament on the preparations for next week's G20 summit
[25:22.240 --> 25:27.800]  as chairman of the G20 Gordon Brown has been offering active international
[25:27.800 --> 25:33.000]  leadership at what is proving to be one of the most difficult times in recent
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.920]  history the speech the speed with which she has helped develop the G20 as a new
[25:40.920 --> 25:47.480]  tool of international economic governance is both encouraging and impressive today
[25:47.480 --> 25:52.520]  there is no old Europe no new Europe no east or west Europe there is only one
[25:52.520 --> 25:58.280]  Europe and it is our home Europe so I stand here proud to be British and
[25:58.280 --> 26:03.240]  proud to be European representing a country that does not see itself as an
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.000]  island adrift from Europe but as a country at the center of Europe not in
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.400]  Europe slipstream but in Europe's mainstream and that is why I'm also
[26:16.400 --> 26:22.440]  proud that by a large majority our British Parliament ratified the Lisbon
[26:22.440 --> 26:34.560]  Treaty and I believe that we in Europe are uniquely placed to lead the world in
[26:34.560 --> 26:38.840]  meeting the holy new and momentous challenges of globalization ahead
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.360]  Prime Minister you receive some criticism this afternoon for your
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.120]  comment British jobs of British workers but you can brush that aside because
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.720]  from the moment you said it I don't think anybody seriously thought that you
[26:49.720 --> 26:53.240]  would ever as a British Prime Minister put the interests of British workers
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.880]  above that of your European dream and my goodness me you showed that this
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.000]  afternoon it's just a pity that apart from UK it virtually nobody seems to
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.440]  bother to turn up to listen to you no you're very popular here you're very
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.680]  popular indeed because within a few days of the Irish saying no to the Lisbon
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.680]  Treaty you had ran that treaty through the British Parliament and you've done
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.680]  it breaking a specific you see I said you were popular you did it breaking a
[27:21.680 --> 27:26.480]  specific manifesto pledge that you would give the British people a referendum
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.360]  on the constitutional treaty shame on you Prime Minister for doing that you
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.800]  have devalued democracy in our country you have devalued the trust that voters
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.120]  have got in you as a British Prime Minister but of course we know the
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.800]  reason why the reason why is that we would have voted no you said in your
[27:45.800 --> 27:51.040]  speech that none but those on the extremes oppose European Union well
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.200]  that may be right amongst professional career politicians but a clear majority
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.000]  of the British people want us to have friendship and free trade with the
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.800]  European Union but do not want to be members of this political Union I want
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.040]  to discuss how we can build from a world which looks today unsustainable
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.520]  unsafe and unequal a truly global society which is sustainable for all
[28:15.520 --> 28:21.200]  secure for all and fair to all and let me repeat I believe that the European
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.560]  Union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future will you now work
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.720]  to bring the United Kingdom into the euro in the post recession period I'm
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.040]  also confident that perhaps after today you will announce the end of a couple of
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.080]  opt-outs or even as my friend Graham Watson said announce the entry of the
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.720]  UK in the euro some of you will know that for many years I've advanced the
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.720]  case for a global Europe and for the economic reforms to make it happen
[28:49.720 --> 28:54.840]  initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe I will
[28:54.840 --> 29:00.400]  recall that most presents are busy and I went to Camp David to propose to
[29:00.400 --> 29:05.560]  present Bush a global response but I have made this case so strongly in recent
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.200]  years precisely because I passionately want Europe to be leading on the world
[29:10.200 --> 29:18.200]  stage Prime Minister what a courageous speech I see you've already mastered the
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.120]  essential craft of the European politician namely the ability to say one
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.840]  thing in this chamber and a very different thing to your home electorate
[29:25.840 --> 29:31.360]  you'll come back and play the rest of it back up about 30 seconds where he says
[29:31.360 --> 29:40.760]  a global Europe a world government world government dominated by the European
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.120]  Union that is what all the new order documents state and the US will be
[29:44.120 --> 29:50.120]  nothing but a third world slave group that supplies military forces that's it
[29:50.120 --> 29:57.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:57.120 --> 30:04.480]  network you already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most
[30:04.480 --> 30:08.560]  important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts
[30:08.560 --> 30:12.320]  agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher

[34:18.120 --> 34:23.040]  calling for world government oven by the banks doesn't exist either back for
[34:23.040 --> 34:26.080]  weeks has been saying I'll tell you the truth about the FEMA camps we're
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.800]  investigating where the place to find out of its true and then Ron Paul comes
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.000]  on and he says are you worried about these camps he said well you know there's
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.840]  a bill to do it but you know I don't think right now it's a problem but we
[34:39.840 --> 34:44.640]  can't trust the government and so then both sides misrepresented that people
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.000]  that are mad at Ron Paul for not being more hardcore said I got emails about it
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.400]  and saw stories written hey Ron Paul said there's no camps no Ron Paul said
[34:52.400 --> 34:57.240]  well there's a bill to do it but you know he doesn't see any right now and he
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.880]  does take too conservative of a position because I know Ron Paul is extremely
[35:00.880 --> 35:07.320]  well read it's kind of like the John Burt society wrote articles saying black
[35:07.320 --> 35:12.040]  helicopters in urban warfare didn't exist a couple years before they
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.840]  reversed themselves on the cover with about militarization of police and I
[35:15.840 --> 35:18.800]  actually saw one of their writers in urban warfare takeover drill in Oakland
[35:18.800 --> 35:22.680]  and he was there and he said oh Alex Jones and I said yeah oh you're here
[35:22.680 --> 35:27.440]  now witnessing the black helicopters and I even sent them an associated press
[35:27.440 --> 35:31.600]  article where they tried to bribe the police chief and others not just my
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.200]  video interviewing the broken then met it into the San Antonio Express news and
[35:36.200 --> 35:46.000]  AP but I mailed them that because I saw one of their writers there who'd written
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.920]  a piece saying it didn't exist but I find he lived in California so I saw the
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.280]  writer there at the Oakland takeover and I said okay I give me your card I'm gonna
[35:53.280 --> 35:59.040]  mail you the AP and you know what they published the AP article in their
[35:59.040 --> 36:06.040]  magazine and said okay it's true so it's like I had McManus in here yesterday
[36:06.040 --> 36:08.720]  the president of the John Burt society which I think does good work they're
[36:08.720 --> 36:12.960]  good people and I didn't throw any you know hardball questions at him because
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.440]  I just wanted to you know pick his brain and you know get to know him and they
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.200]  did do a lot of the groundwork on exposing this whole thing and a lot of
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.600]  us wouldn't even be here today knowing about this it wasn't for them a lot of
[36:25.600 --> 36:31.240]  their material was similar when waking me up but a good old Bobby Vaughn my dad's
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.400]  friend died of a brain tumor two years ago but grew up with him hanging out he
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.400]  was a big JBS he was always bringing their books over and none dare call a
[36:39.400 --> 36:42.800]  conspiracy and give them to my dad and then soon as I could read I was pulling
[36:42.800 --> 36:46.960]  it off the bookshelf of just thousands of books in our house my parents house
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.240]  every room just full of bookshelves and storage things full of books you know
[36:51.240 --> 36:56.920]  that was that one book I pulled off the shelf and so we got to thank them but
[36:56.920 --> 37:00.400]  at the same time he's in here and I said yeah their goal is seven million
[37:00.400 --> 37:04.600]  people in this youth service corps and in the in these other compulsory
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.880]  volunteer things he said no Alex it's 250,000 and then 500,000 is what they
[37:09.880 --> 37:14.880]  want and I said well that's in one of the bills to start but here's the New
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.400]  York Times with the senator saying this is their goal and he went oh okay and
[37:18.400 --> 37:24.680]  he left with the New York Times so a lot of it is we've just got to continue to
[37:24.680 --> 37:27.720]  educate Ron Paul we've got to continue to educate the JBS we got to continue to
[37:27.720 --> 37:31.960]  educate the liberals the conservatives every group because all the time listeners
[37:31.960 --> 37:35.360]  call me and go did you know about this why aren't you reporting on this and I
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.320]  go thank you no I I missed it or I didn't see it or I saw it and didn't have
[37:40.320 --> 37:43.400]  time to read it and forgot about it because we're just overwhelmed here
[37:43.400 --> 37:48.560]  that's your power out there with films and books and news articles and email
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.040]  lists is to just continue to educate everybody you know now that they're
[37:53.040 --> 37:56.160]  writing hundreds of articles every week admitting world governments real in the
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.000]  bank of the world in a currency and all the global currency a lot of people are
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.360]  saying okay well now it's all admitted and kind of standing down some people
[38:03.360 --> 38:06.240]  are the awakenings bigger than ever but some people saying we've done our job
[38:06.240 --> 38:13.600]  no I'm back I have to call Paul Watson and Kurt all the time and go look there's
[38:13.600 --> 38:16.320]  an article here about how they want to make us take implantable microchips and
[38:16.320 --> 38:19.120]  they're like yeah everybody knows that we've written hundreds of articles on
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.920]  it and posted probably thousands over the years Alex old news and it's not old
[38:24.920 --> 38:28.280]  news to people that didn't know about it who were laughing at us now we can say
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.640]  look it's openly admitted and I call Paul up one of our best writers and I say
[38:32.640 --> 38:35.840]  Paul you do such great research when you put a big master article together but
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.880]  asking for two weeks like he did on the fit on the compulsory service the other
[38:39.880 --> 38:44.720]  day excellent story we're much better writer than I could do and I said that
[38:44.720 --> 38:47.200]  we need one about how they're openly setting up World Government of Bank of
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.560]  the World and tie it all together with everything and he said but Alex it's all
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.360]  over the news now well and we've been covering this for years and I said I
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.800]  know but we have to now bring in the latest information and point out we were
[38:59.800 --> 39:06.120]  right again I mean it doesn't matter if it's in no exaggeration hundreds and
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.200]  hundreds of news articles thousands of government documents army dot mill
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.300]  civilian and make labor camp program all of this openly admitted that they're
[39:16.300 --> 39:21.560]  building camps everywhere they're now forcing people in Hawaii and in
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.840]  California and other states to leave their little tent cities and to go into
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.440]  sports domes and fairgrounds behind barbed wire and the police search their
[39:30.440 --> 39:35.920]  cars outside they searched up their IDs and CPS is in there that's all admitted
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.880]  I mean being forced because you're homeless into a camp that's how this
[39:39.880 --> 39:45.880]  starts in Cambodia and Russia and China and Germany they first bring an
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.480]  economic degradation and then they put you into the camps and they set the
[39:50.480 --> 39:53.680]  precedent and oh there's crime in the camps we got a building a holding
[39:53.680 --> 39:57.480]  facility and you're off to the races and that's what's being openly announced
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.280]  I mean they have a bill which just mirrors what they've already built kind
[40:00.280 --> 40:03.200]  of like they were spying on us for decades without warrants with the
[40:03.200 --> 40:09.320]  national security agency an echelon keyword software and now they just admit
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.960]  it and then when it came out that every case of it was a felony they then
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.600]  retroactively pass a law saying they can do it well just like these FEMA camps
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.320]  are illegal they're now trying to pass a law but the key is the bill tells you
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.040]  how the camps are already set up and how the police are at them in the local
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.640]  clergy and the infraguard and the clergy response team and medical centers and
[40:28.640 --> 40:38.560]  cots and in 2000 or 1999 it's in my film police state to the takeover I got
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.760]  calls from workmen taking old 747 hangers at the Robert Mueller Municipal
[40:43.760 --> 40:47.760]  Airport they just closed and moved to Bergstrom and it's a huge complex in
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.920]  the middle of Austin and Central East Austin and part of it they turn into a
[40:53.920 --> 40:56.680]  movie studio parts of it in the storage it was all these hangers and
[40:56.680 --> 41:02.200]  facilities and big airport building terminals and everything and I go out
[41:02.200 --> 41:04.880]  there interviewed security guards and goes yeah they're putting in bolts and
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.920]  chains and porta-potties and cots and and bar bar fences inside and I go put
[41:09.920 --> 41:13.280]  that on local TV and people say oh you're a liar doesn't exist then local
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.120]  Fox News six months later goes in they show the bolts and chains they show the
[41:18.120 --> 41:22.800]  cots they show the porta-potties the fences inside with bar bar on top I
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.920]  put that in the film and people say it isn't real and doesn't exist they go
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.600]  oh that's a movie studio out there yeah well yeah part of it is kind of like
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.000]  FEMA's taking over part of Highland Mall people go I drove by Highland Mall
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.720]  there's still a sears there yes we said part of Highland Mall and we've posted
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.600]  two videos of it and they admit it and it was in the local paper I said part of
[41:45.600 --> 41:53.680]  Highland Mall is a FEMA induction center I mean another example of this is we
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.240]  post mainstream news where they're putting out their propaganda so people
[41:56.240 --> 42:02.440]  can comment on and analyze it and I talk about this not because we get
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.920]  criticized but because it's it's good to analyze people's mindsets of denial we
[42:06.920 --> 42:10.760]  posted this article out of the Associated Press vaccine refusal spars
[42:10.760 --> 42:16.600]  outbreak fears it talks about people all over the world from Europe to Latin
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.080]  America to Asia to you name it not taking vaccines in mass you know in
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.800]  Ukraine alone 9 million refused vaccines just just for one injection what
[42:27.800 --> 42:35.720]  MMR triple jab three things in the one shot and we posted that you know to show
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.280]  well just the first paragraph in a link to it so people can read the whole
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.960]  article and people are commenting oh now your four vaccines Alex what is this
[42:43.960 --> 42:49.040]  see they have they don't they lack critical thinking we're posting an
[42:49.040 --> 42:53.640]  article about how people are refusing to take vaccines obviously it's
[42:53.640 --> 42:56.040]  government propaganda saying you sure need to take it there's gonna be an
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.840]  outbreak wherever you've supposedly taken the shot you can't get it and we
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.960]  posted there so I can then come on air and you can read it with me as I read
[43:05.960 --> 43:13.240]  it on air and so I can debunk it but no in the mad rush to find some way to try
[43:13.240 --> 43:16.640]  to discredit me they say oh no he's now saying vaccines are good that's not what
[43:16.640 --> 43:25.240]  I'm saying I mean it's just bizarre that this is how people's mindset works it's
[43:25.240 --> 43:30.320]  just that they they're unable to think in any complex way and it's it's bizarre
[43:30.320 --> 43:33.840]  you know I'll post an article about how governments all over the world are gonna
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.680]  turn the lights off starting one night a year and then one night a month then one
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.680]  night a week training you that industry is bad that powers bad training you to
[43:43.680 --> 43:47.880]  have less to live as a feudal serf under their control it doesn't mean I'm for
[43:47.880 --> 43:52.840]  turning all the lights out I'm showing you you know I post articles where they
[43:52.840 --> 43:55.560]  say we need a global government a global bank to issue the currency in
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.800]  control of the governments of the world and in the entire magazine article I
[43:58.800 --> 44:01.960]  linked to call the new world order that said that people did the same thing look
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.160]  at him putting out new world order propaganda calling for new order no
[44:05.160 --> 44:10.560]  we're posting the mainstream media admitting all of this so people can see
[44:10.560 --> 44:19.920]  what's going on it's bizarre the mental gymnastics people go through I got
[44:19.920 --> 44:26.480]  sent an email by some fake Christian website saying pretty big saying Alex
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.280]  Jones is calling for armed revolt that is not in the Bible we are to submit to
[44:31.280 --> 44:39.280]  the beast system basically and Romans 13 and his Obama deception is bad you
[44:39.280 --> 44:46.680]  shouldn't watch it and Alex once spoke at a Unitarian Church which has ties to
[44:46.680 --> 44:55.160]  socialists so he is a communist like if I speak if I speak at Sheridan Hotel in
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.480]  LA I don't work for Sheridan or if I use a Neumann microphone I don't work for
[44:59.480 --> 45:06.360]  the Neumann microphone company or if I have a Sony or Panasonic camera or a
[45:06.360 --> 45:13.880]  Ato mix atomic clock or a I mean it's it's it's it's just this obsession with
[45:13.880 --> 45:19.320]  Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones he did this he did
[45:19.320 --> 45:27.120]  that he it's just crazy and so one of our biggest problems is you have the
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.840]  mainstream media spinning lying obfuscating pushing propaganda we're
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.640]  trying to analyze that then you have the general public wrecked by the system
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.160]  wrecked by the establishment a large portion of it who are even awake to the
[45:38.160 --> 45:40.680]  new world order but they won't spend any other time actually fighting the
[45:40.680 --> 45:45.520]  globalist they spend all their time critiquing each other and knitting and
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.360]  bitching and witch hunts when all I'm trying to do is say here's world
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.760]  government with world ID card total control they're putting cancer viruses
[45:53.760 --> 45:56.880]  your vaccine sodium fluoride in your water here's all the studies that it
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.920]  hurts you and harms you what what are you going to do about it and that's what
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.040]  the globalist are afraid of is us just simply putting the information out and I
[46:07.040 --> 46:10.640]  told you our biggest problem is the phony churches telling their people to
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.480]  lay down to corrupt government it is totally unbiblical it is on it it's
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.680]  just it's wicked historically it's a fraud and it's just disgusting let's
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.760]  finish up with the European Union meetings openly calling for a global
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.200]  Europe ruling the planet here it is some of you will know that for many years
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.920]  I've advanced the case for a global Europe and for the economic reforms to
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.160]  make it happen initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from
[46:37.160 --> 46:43.720]  Europe I will recall that most presents are busy and I went to Camp David to
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.800]  propose to present Bush a global response but I have made this case
[46:47.800 --> 46:52.080]  strong strongly in recent years precisely because I passionately want
[46:52.080 --> 46:59.680]  Europe to be leading on the world stage Prime Minister what a courageous speech I
[46:59.680 --> 47:04.280]  see you've already mastered the essential craft of the European politician
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.280]  namely the ability to say one thing in this chamber and a very different thing
[47:08.280 --> 47:12.360]  to your home electorate you've spoken here about free trade and I meant to
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.440]  that who would have guessed listening to you just now that you were the author of
[47:16.440 --> 47:19.720]  the phrase British jobs for British workers and that you have subsidized
[47:19.720 --> 47:24.720]  where you have not nationalized outright swathes of our economy including the
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.680]  car industry and many of the banks starting at our debate today as we
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.920]  prepare for the London summit next week I propose that we as Europe take a
[47:34.920 --> 47:39.880]  central role in replacing what was once called the old Washington consensus
[47:39.880 --> 47:45.600]  with a new and principled economic consensus for our times you cannot you
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.600]  cannot continue against public opinion to build this European Union if you do
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.160]  it against the will of the people you are storing up enormous social and
[47:56.160 --> 48:01.040]  political problems for the future please please let the peoples of Europe decide
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.400]  their destiny don't have it done in parliaments like this and parliaments
[48:05.400 --> 48:11.520]  like Westminster it won't work I propose that Europe takes the lead in a bold plan
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.440]  to ensure that every continent now makes the changes in the banking system that
[48:16.440 --> 48:20.960]  will open the past to shared prosperity that every country participates and
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.640]  cooperates in setting global standards for financial regulation and every
[48:25.640 --> 48:32.200]  continent injects the resources we need to secure economic growth and jobs we
[48:32.200 --> 48:38.120]  need a European financial services authority we need also to reject all
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.720]  forms of economic nationalism and protectionism and I believe that for
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.440]  the first time we can also agree the big changes necessary for coordinated
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.080]  action that will signal the beginning of the end of offshore tax havens and
[48:53.080 --> 48:59.000]  offshore centers with its unique experience of setting supranational
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.120]  transnational rules we show that European Union is better prepared than
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.240]  anyone not to impose but to propose the rules for this globalization our
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.480]  regulations should apply to every bank everywhere at every time with no opt-out
[49:13.480 --> 49:18.040]  for a shadow banking system no hiding place in any part of the world for tax
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.960]  avoiders who are refusing to pay the fair share but as far as the economy is
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.520]  concerned you've told us that somehow you're the economic guru you're the
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.800]  man that can save the world well I remember very well your first big
[49:31.800 --> 49:37.280]  actors chancellor when you sold 400 metric tons of gold on the world's
[49:37.280 --> 49:45.760]  exchanges at $275 an ounce at today's valuation that would be 10 billion
[49:45.760 --> 49:49.120]  dollars higher but it isn't just the fact you've got it wrong because we can
[49:49.120 --> 49:52.960]  all get it wrong it was the fact that you announced in advance that how much
[49:52.960 --> 49:57.360]  you were gonna sell and on what day you were gonna sell it it was an error so
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.160]  basic that the average a-level economic student even in these educationally
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.920]  devalued times wouldn't have done to add to that you've destroyed our private
[50:06.920 --> 50:11.520]  pension system you took away from the Bank of England its ability to regulate
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.760]  the banks and gave it to the tick box bureaucrats at the FSA in Canary Wharf
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.280]  and we haven't heard an apology your government has apologized for the
[50:21.280 --> 50:26.080]  Ambritsar massacre you've apologized for slavery you've apologized for virtually
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.760]  everything will you please apologize for what you did as British chancellor and

[54:01.280 --> 54:06.440]  want an international monetary fund that does not just react to crisis that
[54:06.440 --> 54:10.720]  prevents crisis and I want a world bank that has the resources to prevent
[54:10.720 --> 54:16.280]  poverty and to facilitate amidst the collapse of trade credits the expansion
[54:16.280 --> 54:21.080]  of trade run the world perhaps you would have more moral authority in this
[54:21.080 --> 54:26.140]  house if your actions matched your words perhaps you would have more
[54:26.140 --> 54:30.120]  legitimacy in the councils of the world if the United Kingdom were not going
[54:30.120 --> 54:36.320]  into this recession in the worst condition of any G20 country the truth
[54:36.320 --> 54:42.360]  Prime Minister is that you have run out of our money the country as a whole is
[54:42.360 --> 54:49.640]  now in negative equity every British child is born owing around 20,000 pounds
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.560]  servicing the interest on that debt is going to cost more than educating the
[54:54.560 --> 55:00.440]  child and today I want to emphasize also that Europe and America can work more
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.080]  closely together I talked to President Obama yesterday about what I want to
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.320]  talk to you about today about a new era of heightened cooperation between Europe
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.080]  and America now never in recent years have we had an American leadership so
[55:17.080 --> 55:22.720]  keen to cooperate at all levels with Europe the opinion is moving we'll say
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.520]  it loud and clear in London so that we can be working together with our
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.080]  partners namely our American friends we want the others to move along with us
[55:32.080 --> 55:37.400]  we need global rules to the global economy so starting with the EU US
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.680]  summit a few days from now when President Obama comes to Prague we can
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.320]  transform that summit from just an annual meeting into an unstoppable
[55:47.320 --> 55:52.240]  progressive partnership to secure the global change that the world now needs
[55:52.240 --> 55:57.640]  Prime Minister you cannot carry on forever squeezing the productive bit of
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.400]  the economy in order to fund an unprecedented engorgement of the
[56:02.400 --> 56:08.000]  unproductive it you cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.240]  out of debt and when you repeat in that wooden and perfunctory way that our
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.120]  situation is better than others that were well placed to weather the storm I
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.680]  have to tell you you sound like a Brezhnev era apparatchik giving the
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.440]  party line you know and we know and you know that we know that it's nonsense
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.640]  everyone knows that Britain is worse off than any other country as we go into
[56:29.640 --> 56:34.200]  these hard times
[56:38.640 --> 56:46.560]  and if you talk about what you just heard Rush Limbaugh the rest of them
[56:46.560 --> 56:55.320]  come out and say you're a kook all we do is watch the European Parliament
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.440]  all we do is watch C-SPAN read the bills all we do is read the Army War
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.680]  College admitting to preparing to wage war against the American people and the
[57:04.680 --> 57:09.360]  enemy tells us we lie no you lie
[57:12.880 --> 57:21.560]  so they're digging the grave for our Republic
[57:21.560 --> 57:28.120]  England has refused to join the European Union and so Gordon Brown is
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.320]  forcing them despite the fact in every poll more than 90% of Brits don't want
[57:33.320 --> 57:40.080]  it and you heard the British member of the European Parliament standing up to
[57:40.080 --> 57:45.080]  Brown and explaining to him that there will be rebellion in England but that's
[57:45.080 --> 57:47.640]  why they have common purpose and all these other government-controlled groups
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.400]  can in control of every city in town is because they're there to suppress the
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.280]  people standing up and saying no and that's why when we go out and protest the
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.040]  private Fed the European US branch of what's happening the army spying on us
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.200]  and they admit it because they work for the criminals our government has been
[58:03.200 --> 58:07.600]  seized now I have the YouTube clip it's going up on info wars dot com and

[1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:29.720]  jones we have turned the power of the people of the united states in the
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.880]  world loose those of us in the anti-new world order anti-globalization move
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:40.200]  we're just fighting authoritarians tyranny but we need to combine our
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:49.080]  forces on a more regular basis to cause larger and larger viral spreads of our
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:54.400]  information through the internet out into the third dimension plane that we
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.320]  all live in physically on the streets at city council with copies of DVDs with
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:04.360]  materials and information exponentially growing our numbers and that's what's
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.320]  happening right now and that's why the globalists are pulling out all the
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:12.400]  stops now bob Chapman I'm about to go to bob Chapman coming up about about 10
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:18.600]  minutes I'm gonna play while Bob's on with us a YouTube clip and you know I
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.720]  called this months ago Glenn Beck on his radio show then on his TV show in the
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:27.640]  last month and I never really come out against Glenn Beck I said the guys in
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:32.880]  neocon you know he says put Ron Paul supporters and FEMA camps I'd criticize
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:37.040]  him for that but I said he's just a discredited minion he's not that big of a
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:40.320]  danger to the people then in the last six months he started saying there's a
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:46.480]  global government being set up but then he would always sandwich that in with
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:52.320]  al-Qaeda and they're gonna get us it was psychological manipulation and then
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.080]  for the last month or so he's been saying I'm gonna expose the FEMA camp
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:59.040]  whether they're real or not in-depth investigation and he promised every night
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:01.960]  to do it and have folks tune in and he wouldn't do it and then he kind of laugh
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:09.680]  at it and discredit it well now he's had the head of popular mechanics on remember
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:13.360]  Hurst Publishing are the folks that run by William Randolph Hurst who's in the
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:17.320]  Spanish-American War said you supply the pictures all supply the war making up
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:22.960]  that Spain was attacking you know people in Cuba and they're the folks with the
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:27.360]  fake red scare they're the folks that are always calling for a police state he's
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:30.760]  was a big robber baron and in the encyclopedia Britannica under yellow
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:34.560]  journalism it says Hurst Publishing so I mean you cannot have a more discredited
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:38.160]  more nasty group of individuals and other ones that went after 9-11 truth
[1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:44.040]  would just totally made up crap they are now going to quote debunk now I said a
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:47.120]  few weeks ago I did like an hour on the FEMA camps all the documents for the
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.560]  eclipse but I said I was gonna do a several hours on it a master debunking
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:55.720]  and then I've been busy launching the Obama deception things but I am going to
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:59.480]  do the research I've done the research I'm gonna dig all the documents back out
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:04.120]  there's just so many congressional testimony in the Miami Herald and
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:08.960]  Houston Chronicle and I mean hundreds of army dot mill regulation 210-35
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:14.240]  civilian the main labor camp program have it here in front of me Glenn Beck
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.480]  knows full well about all the FEMA camps you know three weeks ago I did that
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:24.040]  hour-long special it's gone viral on the web I want you to make I'll do it early
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.240]  next week that'll give us a few days ahead of their debunking on April 6 to
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:33.920]  make it go mega viral and if we do this millions of views could be attained so
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:37.280]  that ahead of time they're debunked just like somebody leaked us the popular
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:40.320]  mechanics magazine before it was actually out we debunked it before that
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:43.920]  launched and that was critical to defeating them and we did defeat them
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:47.880]  Bob Chapman we talked about this three weeks ago when you were on and boy now
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:52.440]  Beck has really shown himself he says they don't exist there's no FEMA camps
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:59.880]  well some of us have blind is on conveniently so and that's the what to
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:08.160]  be expected from the people who are on the air misleading people you know they
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:14.600]  give you 95% truth and then 5% of the New World Order's agenda and it's been
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:20.120]  many many of them through the years and he's one of them but I'd say with him
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:29.400]  it's more like 70% truth and 30% New World Order lies I mean it's it's amazing
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:34.160]  I mean Lou Dobbs really is a paradox because overall he's positive and really
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:38.680]  helps things but I guess that's why I agree with that yes that's why the ADL
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:41.600]  and Southern Harvey Law Center is attacking him stay there we're gonna
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:43.960]  come right back to you after this quick break break down what's happening on the
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:47.640]  financial end then I want to play this back clip for everybody folks tell your
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:50.640]  friends and family to tune in I'm gonna play this clip I'm gonna do a little
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:56.440]  bit of debunking on him there's some basic facts and then we'll continue but
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:01.600]  I want to get Bob Chapman's take on this as well stay with us attention
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:05.520]  gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:09.280]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:12.640]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:16.440]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil in
[1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.800]  my conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.080]  reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and
[1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:27.760]  dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:30.960]  time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:34.160]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants proto
[1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:36.800]  grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with
[1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:40.320]  extraordinary taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to
[1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:43.880]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow

[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.560]  and spread the word I'm Bob Chapman I want to get into the economy and coming
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:52.240]  up at the bottom of the hour I am going to launch an operation and I thought
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:58.280]  about doing last night when I learned to the Glenn Beck newest portrayal I want
[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:02.760]  listeners well tell folks about that the bottom of the hour and we'll get into
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:06.280]  some other important issues but oh there are no FEMA camps just all over the
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:11.800]  news but getting into the economy I know for us it's old news and so we have that
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:15.720]  weak spot of that blind spot in my opinion at least I do but because now
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:20.120]  it's in literally hundreds of papers a day saying the solution is a world
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:25.200]  government world bank that sets the taxes and it was in the BBC two days ago
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:30.000]  again a carbon tax starting at 750 billion dollars a year in Europe in the
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.720]  U.S. alone and they're now announcing in Canada they've passed in several other
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:39.320]  states the flatulence tax on farm yard animals they passed it in New Zealand
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:42.680]  and there was a report I saw in the big New Zealand paper that a couple hundred
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:49.440]  sheep would cost 168,000 New Zealand dollars and they're saying this is all
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:52.960]  our profit we have to shut down they're announcing they're going to turn the
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:57.040]  lights off worldwide for a new holiday to teach you that power is bad and lights
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.080]  are bad for the earth and this is feudalism so to have it all openly
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.920]  being announced what we read in government documents what you read 40
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:09.040]  something years ago I read decades ago it's now there and I think I'm trying to
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:12.880]  get everybody to kind of reset and remember that now people are ready to
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:15.760]  listen to us and now it's out in the open and I don't see many people even
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:20.040]  pointing this out and that's upsetting to me everybody needs to be going out
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:24.640]  and going look it's here they're meeting to try to finalize this next
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:30.400]  Thursday what on April 2nd and in subsequent meetings so your take on
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:33.760]  world government coming out in the open how they're going to try to face it in
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:37.600]  first with a global currency at the monetary level that is the banks
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:41.040]  issuing their own currency for governments to be allowed to then issue
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:44.560]  their own currency but it's just a domination of that super currency
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:47.160]  according to London telegraph AP Reuters and literally hundreds of other
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:51.520]  reports so so again the public won't see the global currency yet in their hand
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:58.080]  it's just their dollar is converting to a global system true and that's what
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.600]  they want to do they want to use the special drawing rights which are
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:10.720]  drawn up in 1969 by the the IMF they were used before between governments and
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:21.120]  they they weren't successful and I think this trying to make these SDRs into a
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:26.680]  world currency for them is a terrible mistake because it's gonna end up in
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:35.160]  failure like previous attempts work they're probably better off trying if
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:38.160]  that's what they want to do I don't know whether I should give many ideas or not
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:44.120]  but I think they've been better off trying a basket of currencies even though
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:50.880]  the basket of currencies would be fiat nature in other words but they've been
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:55.640]  trying that for three years I mean they tried to do but I think Alex this is
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:12:01.800]  the way they're going to go on this the SDRs are tradable between countries but
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:08.560]  not individuals and it still doesn't stop the near-term problem of sucking in
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:14.480]  dollars or you know having dollars in your hand that you already have that
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:20.360]  dropping in value and so they've got to come up with something closer to the
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:24.680]  heart of the matter and that's what this that's going to be a big fight next
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:31.240]  week and that's borne out by the manipulation of the stock market over
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:37.440]  the past 10 trading days and it'll continue into next week they wanted to
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:42.560]  get the market up as much as they could because of all the bad news that's coming
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:47.440]  all right let me just back you up on that I never played this clip John three
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.600]  days ago I sent you a Times of London video clip they're now getting all the
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.560]  times in doing TV news in the House of Commons with the governor of the Bank
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:01.680]  of England basically saying what Bob just said that hey we've got to issue a
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:10.600]  totally new level of a monetary unit and not issue the currencies he talks about
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:14.000]  how they're doing both right now and then how the currencies the dollars and
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.920]  others that are all being inflatable just feedback in to that in a loop so dig
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:23.520]  that out John but I just wanted to add that for people that actually watch
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:26.760]  parliament watch the European Parliament watch c-span this is all
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:31.200]  openly being debated right now but again they they phrase it as this is the
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.040]  solution of the global crisis which they engineered and then whether you believe
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:38.440]  it was contrived or engineered or by accident they admit it was engineered
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:41.920]  Bob believes that it's got under control and that may be true the point here is
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:46.800]  is that they plan to be the last man standing and thus King of the Hill with
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:54.080]  the world government when they're done with this but go ahead Bob well I don't
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:14:00.600]  think that they're in a position to immediately replace the dollar it'll
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:05.920]  have to be done over some period of time it might take six months to a year yeah
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:09.600]  they said they're gonna do it over three in most of the reports I've seen and
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.400]  then what they have to do is choose the currencies they want to work with well
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:20.040]  the USDX index including the dollar is seven major currencies they're probably
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:24.760]  best going that way which would include the dollar as well but it doesn't solve
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:30.280]  the long-term problem and maybe that's not of any interest to them because they
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:37.800]  think that they what they will be able to do is to graduate this new basket
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:43.640]  we'll call it of currencies for the period that they need before they allow
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:48.080]  the whole thing economically and financially to collapse and then they'll
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:54.720]  come up with the idea of having a digital currency for the entire world and it
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:15:00.240]  will be supposedly based upon a gold backing and people still are not going
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.080]  to accept that because they have to give up their sovereignty and so it's just
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:08.840]  another game that they're playing but it's going to be very acrimonious because
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:16.160]  the US elitists do not want to give up the power of the dollar I mean they've
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.520]  got a license to steal and they don't want to give that up and they're still
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:26.840]  fighting with the European Aluminous as to when there's going to be a phase in
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:32.400]  to a world currency like I just described and and they want to keep the
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:39.360]  dollar until then so that they can continue to reap riches and so it's not
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:45.520]  only that that's going to be debated behind and in front of the scenes at the
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:53.480]  G20 meeting next week but also they're going to try to control all things
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:59.120]  financial through one governing body worldwide that was my next point that
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.560]  was my next question for you while we're all debating and they're getting us a
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:08.240]  debate will we keep the dollar and and I get emails people saying why should I
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:11.240]  care if they get rid of the dollar I'm not rich I don't you know have money in
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:14.720]  the bank I'm not a currency speculator folks they've deindustrialized us all we
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:19.000]  have left is our dollar to buy all these goods you know for most of our
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.960]  economy and so this will devastate us any way you slice it moving away from the
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:28.400]  dollar so you do need to care this affects you like nothing else financially
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:31.600]  ever will so I want you to comment on that Bob and then of course the big
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:36.920]  issue is regardless of what currency system they go with they are openly I
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:39.800]  just played clips the European barlement where they admit this setting up
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:44.040]  quote a global European government Europe dominating the planet they said
[1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:48.920]  the US will no longer dominate things that's openly being announced and that
[1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:54.200]  that they will have taxing and policing authority on every nation on earth so and
[1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:59.160]  then the OECD and the UN states they want an 85% tax rate across the board so
[1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:05.480]  this is complete bondage go ahead well it's a combination of factors as you've
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:13.040]  just pointed out and the taxation element the element of world currency
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:20.680]  world financial control under one body and it looks like they want a phase in
[1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:26.160]  process but the phase in process cannot last too long because of the state of the
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:30.720]  world economy which is in a form of collapse the world is in depression they
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.960]  just don't know it yet and so you know the question is how far can they go with
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:42.880]  it and keep it from collapsing and total totally and on the other on the other
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:49.840]  hand when do they want to do that you know their timing is it three years from
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:56.000]  now is it six years from now is it six months from now I mean you just don't
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:03.040]  know and so these are the things they're trying to round up and and so there's a
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:07.920]  lot of facts to this there's a lot of factions to it and you're going to see
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:12.120]  that laid out and that's why they ran the stock market up and that's why they
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:17.480]  hit gold twice in the big way in the last two weeks because they want gold to
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:21.880]  rise from a lower level and they want the stock market to fall from a higher
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:27.960]  level that's what they're up to because with this global manipulation they make
[1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:31.400]  money on the way up and the way down and once they get global total regulatory
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.040]  power they almost have it now they can manipulate everything to destroy
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:40.200]  nations consolidate them it's just unlimited wrecking machine once they
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:44.640]  get that global government as bad as their mischief has been so far what will
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:51.160]  it be 10 times worse on average when they get the superpower global control it
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:57.120]  will be an unlivable world and in conjunction with what we already know
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:03.720]  about living in the world it's going to be nasty everybody's going to be
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:09.760]  unhappy and if we don't face them down and stop them from doing what they're
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:14.880]  doing then that's the way we're going to have to live and I drove the sea
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.760]  revolution before that well I just played a clip of members of the European
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:22.760]  Parliament from England telling Gordon Brown they said 90 plus percent of our
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:26.360]  country doesn't want the euro you're forcing us into it you're going to have
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:31.360]  a revolt and they were serious and in the cuts to brown he's just smiling like a
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:37.360]  hyena that's what they want so but meanwhile the American people are
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:40.720]  dancing around well there's no global government there's no banks there's no
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.320]  elites there's no global currency Alex and Bob Chapman or Cooke's everything's

[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:54.960]  friend
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:59.160]  and I'll ride again all right Bob Chairman I'll go to these questions I've
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:06.000]  got for you quickly they plan to bring the world in the global crisis into a
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.280]  deeper crisis they have done that now but for the average American who doesn't
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:16.200]  care about global currencies can you explain to them why this is so important
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:22.680]  it's important because we owe so much money to the remainder of the world
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:28.140]  they're holding close to three trillion dollars worth of Treasury and and Fannie
[1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:36.560]  May and Freddie Mac bonds and if the world starts to dump dollars and not by
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:42.680]  those bonds and other investments in the United States we will go bankrupt right
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:49.040]  this minute we need one point eight one point nine billion dollars a day to meet
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:57.800]  our requirements for foreign trade it's called the balance of payments surplus a
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:04.040]  deficit and we're in a deficit so it's very important what the world thinks of
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:10.160]  the dollar because if the dollar goes down in value all the goods that you buy
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:16.160]  and most of them come from other countries now are going to be much more
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:22.320]  expensive in the past what countries have done is denigrated the value of
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:27.600]  their currencies to make their goods cheap that was good for America because
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:33.260]  it kept inflation down and they also took that money and bought those bonds I
[1:26:33.260 --> 1:26:38.520]  spoke of if they stop buying the bonds and their products are more expensive
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.000]  they're not going to sell as much and you're going to have to pay more for
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:47.040]  what you do buy so you're going to have a depression with higher prices because
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:51.200]  you already have a depression you just don't know it yet because your government
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:55.480]  will never probably tell you officially that it is a depression and by the way
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:58.240]  they've been inflating the other currency before you finish it before I
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:03.320]  forget I'll throw this in get your take on it they're also throwing in the fact
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:08.240]  that in England the Bank of England has and then the Treasury in England the
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:12.400]  Exchequer for the first time ever has been putting out their own bonds and
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.000]  people aren't buying them so they're having to come in and buy themselves we
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:19.760]  know the Fed and the Treasury have been doing that but quietly so we're already
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:25.280]  seeing the fact that people can't even buy it to begin with well they started
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:30.560]  in the United States the Fed started this week buying Treasury paper and they
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:36.240]  did so by creating money out of thin air it's called monetization and yes the
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:39.960]  British have done that and the Swiss have been doing what would corporate bonds
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:45.040]  which is very surprising and so you're going to continue to see this kind of
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:51.120]  thing going on in many countries but the point is it's highly inflationary here
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:55.960]  you have high unemployment getting worse and inflation keeps on going up in the
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:28:00.600]  middle of the depression it's the worst of all worlds you know I want to say one
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:05.560]  more thing about the previous conversation I talked to a very very
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:11.920]  reliable source in Europe this week and they told me that the people in Europe
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.800]  are royally royally PO to what's going on there is going to be a knockdown
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:24.320]  drag-out fight next week I mean really nasty and this will be the European
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:30.560]  Nations and Britain and the United States going at it and you know we're
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:36.600]  talking about monetization the first batch that the Treasury has asked for
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:42.520]  is 300 billion dollars and that means because they can't sell the amount of
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:46.640]  bonds that they have to foreigners in January the latest period we have
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:53.760]  figures for the foreigners cut back by 148 billion dollars the amount of bonds
[1:28:53.760 --> 1:29:01.040]  that they were willing to buy that's a very very very high figure now 300
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.680]  billion dollars is not going to make it within the next three months they're
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:11.040]  going to come and tell you they need an additional trillion that's 1.3 trillion
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:16.840]  in total never mind what they've done secretly behind the scenes in Washington
[1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:21.800]  or what they've been doing offshore for another hundred billion dollars during
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:26.440]  that time frame and before that see the government never tells the truth all they
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:32.960]  do is lie so we're talking about colossal amounts of money being monetized I
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:38.600]  figure that over this next two years this year and next year they'll monetize
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:43.000]  over five trillion dollars and that is going to create a hyperinflation the
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:46.600]  likes of which the world has never seen break it down for us Bob when we come
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:52.800]  back man I'm getting into the FEMA cams stay with us we're on the March the

[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:12.520]  the hand of the wicked ones yeah the god of this world's in control but not for
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:24.080]  long haha I love it the awakening has entered its final phase and the tyrants
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:41.120]  are in great fear all right let's go back to Bob Chapman and I want Bob's
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:43.520]  take on the whole FEMA camp clip it's only a few minutes long we're gonna
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:47.640]  play here and we got Jason Bermas in studio who first alerted me this
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.640]  yesterday afternoon when we was back announced this radio show he was gonna
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.120]  be debunking at that night and then he had public mechanics on us at the big
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:59.280]  debunking is coming up on April 6 this is very important to call to action in
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:02.880]  one moment but going back to Bob Chapman the international forecaster.com
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:08.760]  Bob hyperinflation I mean what type of inflation are we talking about with
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:15.160]  trillions and monetized debt well we're running around a 9 to 10 percent right
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:20.480]  now without the monetization I firmly believe that secretly they did a
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:25.000]  about 300 billion and over the last four months plus the 300 billion they just
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  did that puts them up to about 162 billion so they'll be out of the 300
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.800]  billion category pretty shortly and that means that they'll have to ask for
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:42.280]  more money and that means inflation will move up to where it was 13.6%
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:48.400]  about nine or ten months ago before they had this deleveraging part process as
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:55.240]  it's been called and that's when banks cut back lending and because they did
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.840]  that many entities had to sell things particularly hedge funds and that's why
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:06.680]  the market came down and other sorts of investments came down as well including
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:13.640]  commercial real estate which is a real trouble now and so inflation I think
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:19.480]  there's a good chance it'll be back up by the end of the year to 13.6% and then
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:24.560]  as they continue to monetize and continue to increase money and credit in
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:31.160]  general then we'll get up into the 20s and 30s how far it can go beyond that I
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:35.680]  don't know it all depends on what they do it's too hard to call but I think you
[1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:40.440]  can look forward and you know we're gonna relish this a 20 to 30 percent
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:46.560]  inflation and you know that's why it's so hard for other nations to invest in
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:54.680]  say 10 year which is long-term US notes at 2.7% when they know inflation real
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:59.520]  inflation is 10% they're already taking a beating and then they're facing the
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:05.880]  possibility of a dollar not being the only reserve currency or the reserve
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:12.000]  currency having a drop in value perhaps versus their currency and maybe they're
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:17.720]  gonna take another 30% loss on top of it well look at Eastern European currencies
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:23.120]  plunging they're already in total depression well that's true and it's
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:28.480]  all the fault of the Western bankers who gave them cheap loans propped them up
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:34.080]  and everything started to slow down and they get caught in the middle of the
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:38.520]  meat grinder and they're not gonna recover for a long time but neither is
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:43.400]  the remainder of the world and things are gonna be very very tough out there
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:48.000]  all right Bob Chapman I'm gonna play this we're gonna put you on hold and I
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.240]  want you to listen to this give us your take when we come back we're gonna play
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:54.080]  this Glenn Beck clip that I'm gonna comment on I want your take on it and
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:58.400]  Jason Burmese's take on it Glenn Beck he's gonna get to the bottom of it he's
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:02.840]  gonna tell you the truth about the FEMA camps he's looking at it it might be
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.840]  true meanwhile it's in the Houston Chronicle it's in the Miami Herald it's
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:12.120]  admitted the public purchase orders in the last seven years building them open
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:16.080]  announcements bills introduced to merge the local police and community groups
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:22.720]  into the camps Schwarzenegger in California and folks in Hawaii are
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:28.640]  forcing the homeless out of their tent cities into barbed wire camps at their
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.280]  convention centers and of course at the fairgrounds it's all happening the
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.920]  military announces they're gonna use 20,000 trips the American people all of
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:41.080]  its public news I have the civilian and make labor camp program army regulation
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:47.040]  210-35 will go over that but meanwhile they bring in the captains of yellow
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:51.960]  journalism you know we always make the joke of next to in the encyclopedia to
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:56.160]  ugly's a picture to you or no literally in the encyclopedia next to yellow
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:00.600]  journalism is Hurst publishing that publishes popular mechanics in the
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.800]  9-11 debunkers and and but this is publicly admitted there's FEMA camps
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:10.600]  and so now they're gonna deny basically well it's like them in denying
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:14.960]  there's a new world order as it's all over the newspapers so here it is the
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.960]  debunkers Houston here James that I called you what three three four weeks
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.720]  ago and ask and ask you to help on a project and that is I really truly
[1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:28.800]  believe America we have a real problem in this country we don't know what the
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:32.280]  truth is anymore we don't have anybody we can trust and there's a lot of stuff
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:36.560]  and I've told you before I've told you for a long time on the internet please
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:41.400]  don't pass these things around on the internet unless you know they're true
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:47.040]  and I think it is important for us to debunk those things or verify those
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:51.800]  things that are out there because we're separating on the truth now so I asked
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:54.920]  James from popular mechanics to do an investigation on several projects the
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:59.600]  first one is the FEMA camp yes and so we put a reporter on this and what's so
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:03.080]  interesting here we're we're we're waiting to really do a definitive deep
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:05.840]  dig on this we don't like to just come out say oh we've debunked it you know
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:10.800]  after we've looked at it for days but it looks at from our early reporting like
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:14.720]  a classic conspiracy theory little grains of truth but all adding up to
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:17.840]  something that really isn't true okay I want to because I want to go I want to
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:23.000]  when we have this ready next week for Monday yeah a week from Monday this is
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:30.200]  one of those things that they are so specific on the internet and this is
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:34.840]  why I was going to do an expose on this and I thought that we had some of the
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:39.120]  things from the internet and we weren't ready to go on with them all we had was
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:42.840]  the grains of truth and the and the things that we knew were false and this
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.360]  but we didn't have that definitive they show this picture here it is they show
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:51.200]  this picture there it is and that's why we called you well yes and you know
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:54.600]  you remember all the 9-11 conspiracy theory reporting we did and we found
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:58.240]  again and again someone would take some little fact and but they would take it
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:02.200]  out of context and they would put on the web and it looks credible because they
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:05.680]  mimic you know the way that regular but you are going to be able to show the
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:08.520]  pictures and you're gonna say this is true this is false this is true this is
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:13.160]  false great that is a week from Monday now we've been watching the 9-12 project
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:16.240]  very very closely a lot of people are worried about the implications of a
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:19.920]  couple of bills and it kind of goes into this which is true which is not the
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:25.680]  give and then of course the give act in both versions had compulsory service we
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:29.320]  read it was in the New York Times then thank God putting pressure on it went
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:32.840]  into conference and I've had the guys reading it they did take it out though
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:36.520]  they're setting up the funding and the grid and the studies to do it so see
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:40.560]  this is how they're gonna attack it there are thousands of websites thousands
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:44.640]  of photos hundreds and hundreds of videos where they'll go show a urban
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:48.720]  warfare training center saying in Mississippi and it's got foxholes it's
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:53.520]  got camp bar bar it's got bar bar facing in and it's dual use you can do
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.840]  training as they say it's training for Kosovo but it can also be used for a
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.000]  camp just like the man is our prison camp they held Japanese in they reopened
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.440]  that back in 1998 it's still reopened they refurbished it's sitting there
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:10.880]  empty a prison camp so what they're gonna do is they're gonna go show watch
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:14.760]  camps that are dual use and say oh look we talked to the military it's just a
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:20.040]  training facility discredited but then they won't go to civilian inmate labor
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:27.840]  camp program army regulation 210-35 unclassified now from 86 to 97 they
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:30.880]  held Americans in camps it's all in here you just Google it you'll be at army
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:35.840]  dot mill I'll give you the phone number to the army headquarters you like to
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:39.120]  call them it's right here in the report that they're proud of this but it was
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:42.920]  secret for 11 years then they announced it and now there's not 12 camps there's
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:45.480]  24 with people in them and then well they're like well they're federal
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:48.640]  prisoners you know the non-military prisoners but they're under military
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:53.520]  control and it's a labor camp what is wrong with that see these are what
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:57.320]  these are the guys were convicted of bank robbery and child molestation
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:00.800]  whatever so see they integrate the troops in the military where this is
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:03.440]  normal just like they say all the Marines are out of the checkpoint to look
[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:07.480]  for drugs oh they're the army's helping it wrecks oh there's liaison officers
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:11.160]  and all the police departments from the army but then you read the army reports
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:13.920]  and we've read the codes and it's been in the army times they're gonna use them
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:17.600]  against the American people 20,000 but you heard him say they're gonna debunk a
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:19.920]  bunch of stuff they're gonna have him on every week they're gonna say yeah
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:22.520]  they're gonna use troops but it's just to help it car wrecks when the army
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:26.600]  document says it's for total takeover and the army war college they're gonna
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:31.560]  show camps that aren't really camps so it's strong in classic strawmen and yes
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:35.360]  there's baloney they'll go show an empty warehouse and say it's a FEMA camp when
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  it's not in Chicago but you know I saw people put in pure 57 in New York in the
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:43.840]  bus terminal same thing bar bar fences porta-potties inside sleeping on the
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:47.080]  floor they have one at Austin I have local news admitting it you know it's
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:50.880]  the police saying they have this federally paid for so this is how they're
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:54.800]  gonna do it you notice he says we're gonna debunk a bunch of stuff and so
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:57.320]  that they have to see oh there's a kernel of truth yeah there's a bill
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:01.480]  introduced for emergency camps for when society breaks down what do the Nazis
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:05.560]  say hey you know people are beating up you Jews and people we've got camps for
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:10.080]  your safety and we've also gonna delouse you and you know we're gonna take you
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:14.600]  here that's what the Soviets did I mean see they're not gonna come out say we've
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:18.400]  built death camps we're gonna get you it's oh no the governor of California you
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:21.720]  know there's all these tent cities he's taking federal funds and putting them in
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:25.640]  a safe facility where the CPS is there and there's bar bar facing in and regular
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.960]  families that are living in their cars and tents where they raise money to get
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:30.680]  an apartment which is happening you gotta now be with the crackheads and the
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:34.280]  mentally ill people though the regular homeless folks and the drunks and then
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:38.360]  they'll be crying and they admit all that so see this is all this is how they
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:42.480]  introduce it to you they don't introduce it oh it's bad and scary Bob
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:52.160]  Chapman your comments on this well first of all I think the three main points
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:45:00.160]  that that he was trying to make was that they don't want people to trust what's
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:05.080]  on the internet they kept on saying well it this has to be verified in that has
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:10.920]  to be thrown out because it's not true that they're supposedly going through a
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:17.320]  an investigation one in fact as you say all of the facts on this particular
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:24.280]  issue are all there don't bring in facts about anything else that you doubt and
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:30.280]  and of course the first thing they threw at the audience was it fits in the
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:36.440]  realm of conspiracy theory and of course that that's strong warning about the
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:44.880]  internet not being a place where you can get verified information if you may
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:55.680]  and they said that out of hand so far that then oh is no FEMA camps and it's
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:01.840]  just conspiracy theorist and of course you pointed out that they are what they
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:09.000]  are and how Fox and popular mechanics will try to get around this what I was
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:15.600]  surprised at is that the man that he interviewed really didn't have any
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:20.880]  information whatsoever I thought it had to be a little embarrassing notice they
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:26.160]  said we we we looked at this and there's all these kernels see they don't want
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.920]  you to integrate listen FEMA is on record in hundreds of newspapers Newsmax
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:35.520]  that advertises on Fox right after the clip I there was a Newsmax after their
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.760]  magazine Newsmax Christopher Ruddy in 2002 saw the federal purchase order put
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:45.320]  out for bids for three one million man camps during natural disasters or
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:48.600]  terrorist attack or breakdown of society and they got all these emails saying it
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:52.680]  wasn't real and Christopher Ruddy we got to dig this up this is 2002 wrote the
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:57.920]  exact headline was yes folks they the the FEMA camp story is real something
[1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:02.080]  like that yes the camp stories real and he gave the phone number to the federal
[1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:05.760]  purchase office I mean he was gonna be that's how the Houston Chronicle learned
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:11.720]  about the next wave in 2006 of camps they've got a stinking FEMA camp in
[1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:16.280]  Taylor with people in it right now and as Rex 84 said in congressional hearings
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.320]  first they put illegals in to vet it and test it and train the people but it has
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:24.640]  dual use for citizens to be held extra judicially just like the Military
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:29.280]  Commission's Act clearly states Bob Chapman I don't what we have to do is
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:36.680]  don't let them get it off the ground the minute they try to debunk the camp
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:42.520]  situation you got to go right after them and attack them and from every angle
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:46.640]  that's what we're doing because they they don't have anything to debunk it I
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:51.520]  mean they're lying about it and it's just like this man he they he had on
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:56.000]  there he had no information whatsoever well here's another issue have them on
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.680]  mags used to write for danced around the subject mags doesn't even have any
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:04.960]  journalism degree mags from what I've read were up for TV guide
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:08.920]  oh entertainment weekly excuse me I go in turn Burma suggestion Burma's knows
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:12.600]  these guys has debated them now they refuse to debate us here's one example
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:17.040]  out of their debunking a 9-11 mess book okay here's one of the lies of hundreds
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:22.560]  they say norad only intercepted one airplane in the year before 9-11 and
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.000]  that was pain steward because they know folks all heard about that they
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.080]  intercepted in 17 minutes with 6 f 6 16's then we just googled the name of the
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:34.880]  guy they quoted the norad spokesman this this this colonel and there he was in
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:40.600]  Reuters in AP when pain steward happened in other events saying we've had 167
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:46.080]  intercepts in the last nine months before 9-11 okay you know in the first
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:51.560]  nine months that year 167 of memory serves 167 168 167 and so one time
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:56.240]  mags was on another show on Genesis and I called into the show and I said you
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:00.320]  won't debate me but I said here's the Reuters article and here's this name he
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:07.200]  said I'm not gonna discuss that see they will not they are lying trash and I
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:11.720]  call them out here on air they are lying trash they said a third of building
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:17.040]  seven was scooped out and the and the fuel all did it NIST Jason admits that
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:19.600]  that isn't what did it now and they say they don't know what happened yeah they
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.720]  took the quote from Cheyenne Sunder who had to get up and say that that was just
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:26.880]  not true at all you know he said there wasn't any significant damage to the
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:29.840]  building and it turns out it wasn't the fuel oil tanks it looks like it was
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.520]  thermal expansion there's never been a retraction or an addendum to that hit
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:38.040]  piece that they wrote I mean I think the best thing about this Alex is we are
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:41.920]  continuing to expose Glenn Beck as a wolf in sheep's clothing I mean we've had a
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:45.720]  lot of pressure over the last few months in this office alone emails telling us
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:48.680]  no Glenn Beck is coming around he's telling us the truth about the
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:52.320]  financial he does this every year he comes out says there's a new order law
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:55.480]  the sea treaty and then let's arrest all the Ron Paul supporters and use troops
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:59.040]  against them they're dangerous enemies then he comes out oh you can trust me
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:02.040]  I'm gonna fight the new world order and then says yeah this is all a bunch of
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:06.520]  bull now that you trust me you don't trust the internet trust me I'm gonna
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:10.400]  debunk this with the fathers of yellow journalism yeah and the fact that he's

[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:41.560]  views it's more than 10 million views but if we can have it on one video it can
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:45.440]  have a million views and and it'll be a challenge to go in back here's the

[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.200]  attempts to debunk us I mean how obvious is it back who's saying put Ron ball
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:37.760]  supporters in jail a year ago we're dangerous use the military on us my act
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:41.240]  report stuff I'm your friend I've decided I like you I'm gonna be the great
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:44.880]  arbiter I will decide we'll sort of grassroots movement under me which is
[2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:47.800]  what Obama and the British government they're all creating these doppelgangers
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:52.100]  to kind of go out imitate what we do but then stab everybody in the back Bob
[2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:56.880]  Chapman how obvious is this to you it's very obvious and it has been from the
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:02.080]  beginning we used to call these people change agents and what they do is they
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:06.640]  work for the people who control things from behind government and they're told
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:11.960]  what to do and how to do it and they have experts working all around the
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:17.080]  world 24 hours a day coming up with things like this among other things that
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:24.040]  they do and so that's what he is he's a disinformation specialist and they have
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:27.800]  the grain of truth and then they had the rest of it being propaganda and you're
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:32.760]  absolutely right well what he said is wrong and the interview he had was
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:37.360]  ludicrous I mean the other man had nothing to say
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:44.320]  Barmas tell us about Meg's this is a true piece of work they had to turn his
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:49.280]  mic on go ahead yeah Meg's is the former editor-in-chief over at entertainment
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:54.640]  weekly magazine I used to read a lot as a kid and he was hired by Hearst
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:59.240]  publications I believe in the run-up to that big article that they wrote about
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:03.800]  the 9-11 truth movement this was back and I believe 2004 they did a big
[2:02:03.800 --> 2:02:08.160]  cleaning of all their employees and brought in a whole bunch of new people
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:15.880]  now Meg's and I debated about 9-11 I ate him and David Dunbar up they had the
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:19.680]  opportunity to debate me again on the view they refused to do so and then they
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:24.480]  stopped taking requests all together to debate 9-11 and for them to bring in
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:29.680]  popular mechanics to try to quote-unquote debunk the FEMA camps is just
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:34.480]  about as thinly veiled as they get this is a this is a magazine that's supposed
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:39.280]  to go over the latest tractor the latest car I mean it has nothing to do with
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:43.480]  FEMA camps Alex or 9-11 but it's worse than that the next thing that goes to
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.240]  we've gotten more of the club is he goes now we're going to debunk compulsory
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:51.280]  service it's he was in all the bills Obama's announcing they're trying to
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:54.520]  push it we're trying to shoot it down people denied it was in the bills just
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:58.200]  like they denied the Mayak report now they won't issue the full bill we don't
[2:02:58.200 --> 2:03:02.760]  know we can't find it see they make it extremely difficult for me to do a key
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:06.280]  word search by providing me with a PDF file I can just type in a word and I
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:10.360]  can scan the entire document what they have up there is text of legislation and
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:14.440]  each subsection has a link so I literally have to go through 200 plus
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:18.080]  subsections each one and type in that keyword so they're making it very

[2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:42.000]  asking me how these bills are put into place and I basically told them look
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:45.640]  these are always written beforehand they're always written by think tanks and
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:49.400]  all these special interest groups and the people that actually rule us and then
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:54.240]  they sneak in other parts of legislation or use semantic wording to make them
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:59.360]  strong at Bob Chapman's take on that Bob well they've been doing that for a
[2:03:59.360 --> 2:04:04.760]  long time and it's just the public is not aware of it and you know these bills
[2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:09.960]  are whether it's a labor union and certain legislation or a lobbying group
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:15.560]  for the pharmaceutical industry very little work is done on bills of any
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:21.500]  kind by Congress themselves it's these other parties who bring in the the
[2:04:21.500 --> 2:04:26.000]  legislative wording and the writing but how else and I is it how else and I
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:29.640]  and is it for them to try to say we're making it up that they want to compulsory
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:33.480]  service and are trying to pass that when it's all over the news I mean I mean
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:36.520]  they think they can get away with anything I mean right now no one's still
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:40.480]  talking about the effectiveness of a centralized electronic citizen verification

[2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:11.760]  have left with bob Chapman you give them a subsection of the bill this is the
[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:14.680]  type of stuff they have tucked into this national service bill we're trying to
[2:10:14.680 --> 2:10:17.720]  get pulled out of it but but this is some of the other stuff imagine how big
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:21.200]  the national ID card is they denied so long they were setting up with federal
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:25.280]  highway funds tied to the states thumb prints biometrically face scans being
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:28.960]  integrated into federal and private databases being used as this global
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:32.320]  system and the states are resisting that well imagine what's in all the
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:35.440]  thousands of pieces legislation we're just reading the one dealing with national
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:40.160]  compulsory service and find other little gems like this that nobody's talking
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:44.160]  about we got to get a story from paul watson uh... or from curtain in on this
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:47.600]  asap tell them about it
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:51.600]  section seventeen ten study to evaluate the effectiveness of a centralized
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:53.360]  electronic citizen
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:57.160]  uh... ship verification system the corporation for national and community
[2:10:57.160 --> 2:11:00.240]  service shall conduct a study to determine the effectiveness of a
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:04.480]  centralized electronic citizenship ship verification system which would allow
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:07.600]  the corporation to share employment eligibility information with the
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:10.080]  department of education
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:12.840]  now they're going to implement this through both the corporation and the
[2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:17.320]  department of education in subsection a one but in subsection a four they let
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:20.960]  you know that the information that needs to be shared in order to fulfill
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.440]  employment eligibility requirements
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:27.360]  so basically they're telling you in if you don't go along with the system you
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:30.640]  will not be able to be employed in this country and they're going to implement
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:34.040]  it and it's fully funded from two thousand uh... ten to two thousand
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:36.560]  fourteen and that's what homeland security's been saying you'll have to
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:39.120]  have an idea card to buy and sell to have a job
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:41.920]  but the illegal aliens are exempt from this like in the seven hundred eighty
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:45.400]  seven million dollars stimulus package it says illegals are exempt
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:49.280]  from having to go through uh... i'd be requirements but citizens have to
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:50.240]  to get the money
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:52.040]  or to be involved in any of the bailouts
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:55.160]  uh... so just absolutely amazing bob Chapman now
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:57.360]  give us your analysis on this
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:11:59.920]  well first of all it's more insanity
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:04.320]  uh... particularly the illegal alien aspect of it it flies in the face of
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:06.920]  any kind of logic whatsoever
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:11.760]  but uh... these sorts of things as we know have been coming for a long time
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:16.720]  and now they're approaching reality that is uh... the
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:18.600]  identification card
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:20.680]  uh... via homeland security
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:24.000]  uh... via uh... driver's licenses
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.760]  now this new element which is
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.360]  uh... the
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:31.720]  uh... data bank of uh... children
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:34.160]  uh... so that uh... when they reach
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:37.640]  uh... an age of that they are going to be employed
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:40.720]  uh... that will be just carried on and as you said
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.400]  you won't be able to get a job
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:44.640]  unless you're in this data bank
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:48.840]  and so what they're doing is pigeon pigeon holding everybody
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:49.760]  so that
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:52.440]  uh... they know what everybody can do
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:54.080]  uh... how they've been trained
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:56.160]  and so if government says
[2:12:56.160 --> 2:12:58.160]  uh... mr smith
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:00.600]  uh... you live in new york city
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:04.760]  uh... but uh... we don't see any jobs for you there so
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:08.160]  uh... we do have some jobs for you in provo
[2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:13.040]  utah so we're going to ship you out there otherwise you don't work
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:16.840]  well absolutely and and under this it's still in there to make it i mean it's
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:18.600]  got the eighteen to twenty five
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:21.720]  three months compulsory service that it appears has been script for now thank
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:24.080]  god people getting upset it was in the bills
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:25.840]  and in mainstream news
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:28.360]  when they still say fifty hours for middle school
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:29.640]  a hundred hours
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:31.360]  uh... for elementary
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:35.880]  uh... you compulsory service for college so this is federal control and so it
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:38.120]  says the kids going to school
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:40.320]  have to have this and that's what they've been saying
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:42.520]  you know job training at schools
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:45.760]  where the government uh... will decide they said this what you're going to be
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:47.280]  when you grow up
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:48.920]  different education paths
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:51.720]  the government will decide and then out of high school you'll have the
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:52.520]  credential
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:54.080]  for what you're allowed to do
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:55.960]  uh... that's also with this hr
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.080]  thirteen eighty eight section seventeen ten currently in their correct
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:00.880]  burmese

[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:02.640]  currently in there yes
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:05.000]  and and and that's what we're doing where i mean this bill is changing every
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.600]  day we spent hours trying to read it burmese's
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:11.040]  uh... the watson brothers are never was in this is one bill

[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:17.800]  that's why they've tried to pass the read the bills act were by law
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.960]  the congressman have to read the bills and be involved in writing them
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:24.000]  uh... but there's other subsections to in there aren't there yet there are a
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  ton of subsections and you know the subsection right under eighteen oh one

[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:01.400]  four or five articles

[2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:22.200]  dr. Scott Whitaker is a board-certified naturopathic daughter with 20 years of
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:27.120]  experience Southern California native they grew up in the infamous South
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.160]  Central area Los Angeles strong parental guidance as his anchor he escaped the
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:34.480]  call the streets and received his undergraduate degree from University
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:37.200]  California Berkeley and civil engineering during his time at Berkeley he
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:40.200]  became interested in holistic medicine and drew a connection between holistic
[2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:44.800]  living and long-term health particular interest in him was the effectiveness or
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:48.240]  lack thereof of prescription drugs on common health problems plugging the
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:51.120]  african-american community especially alarming was the number of friends and
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:54.080]  family members he watched suffer and eventually die from effects of these
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:59.440]  synthetic slaughterhouses and after graduation he found himself working in
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.640]  the engineering field at st. Louis Missouri he enrolled in Keller graduate
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:05.200]  school of management where he earned his MBA and is the interest in holistic
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:08.600]  medicine was far from satisfied and firm and to get all the information he could
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:12.760]  he obtained a doctorate of naturopathy from the international school of
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:17.600]  naturopathy in Los Altos California and armed with the resources he needed
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:20.520]  dr. Whitaker vowed to spread the truth about prescription medications and bring
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:24.360]  the message of holistic lifestyles and a means of obtaining long-term good health
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:28.200]  to people everywhere and the book you know I've now had a chance to read is

[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:40.760]  national awards and it integrates all the research have separately done for
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.640]  mainstream government reports and I mean this is on record take prozac they
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:48.840]  admit it causes you to go psychopathic and get more depressed it's on the insert
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:52.520]  so they put you on more drugs I'm just backing up before we you know backing
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:55.640]  him up before we go to him and then they found all these studies that st.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:26:00.120]  John's wort in double-blind studies actually helps people but then prozac
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:03.200]  actually in the whole group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors actually hurt
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:08.760]  some I told you the Alabama and Germany shooters three weeks ago we're gonna be

[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.560]  next hour and 35 minutes and I appreciate him coming on the show today
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:39.040]  dr. Whitaker thanks for being on Alex Jones I appreciate it it's good to have
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:41.920]  you here this is a short segment just introduce yourself your awakening and
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:46.240]  then let's get into all the research you've done and what you found dr.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:51.760]  Whitaker 20 years of experience in holistic medicine nutritional
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:57.760]  detoxification been traveling the world in about about nine countries studying
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:01.440]  those healing sciences over in Africa and Asia bringing them back to America and
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:05.640]  using them and applying them and getting phenomenal results with everyone
[2:27:05.640 --> 2:27:13.640]  to come in contact with regarding their particular condition so the holistic
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:19.640]  approach to healing is the only way I go the current medical establishment the
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:25.240]  current medical paradigm is nothing but a death trap
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.560]  well I agree with you and it's set up by the eugenicist and the doctors and
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:34.640]  nurses are compartmentalized tell us about your weight your awakening and
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:37.840]  then we're gonna come back and get into the research you go over in your book
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:43.640]  medicine exposing what they're doing I guess my awakening actually started I
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:50.080]  was a young guy and my dad was always sending me off to school with my herbs
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:54.960]  and minerals and vitamins and I never missed a day of school in terms of
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:00.560]  attendance I never was sick and I was always fascinated with chemistry and as
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:04.520]  I went higher in education and took chemistry classes and organic cam and
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:10.040]  all that stuff and and really saw the connection of how plants relate to the
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:14.600]  body and how the body relates to plants and I met a seminal Indian on campus one
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:19.760]  day there at Berkeley he told me to never take any drug and always use the
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:24.640]  plant for healing and I used Golden Field Neck and Nation that day on I went
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:30.040]  from one book to over 800 books in terms of nutritional healing and then I had a
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:35.360]  personal experience with someone very close to me who went to see a doctor
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:41.280]  on a Tuesday and they admitted her and she was dead by Thursday and from then
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:46.960]  on I said that I would expose these criminals for who they are and to wake
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:51.120]  people up well that's right in fact we see in the national news every year the
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:56.080]  number it's always above 300,000 this is admitted that die of bad drug
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:29:04.000]  interactions alone I've had one surgery when I broke my leg and at night the IV
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:07.920]  came out and I woke up with blood all over me I've had so many friends that go
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:10.680]  in to have a surgery they get an infection and die I've had good friends
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:16.200]  that have died of that I mean they go in for a migraine headache and they're dead
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:21.360]  two days later you know from the needle they put on them and but still the
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:25.160]  general public isn't aware of this it's just incredible so stay there sir let's
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:30.080]  break it down because you go through it in the book with the author of medicine
[2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:35.000]  and he's an engineer he's a doctor he's a lot of other things and he brings all
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.120]  those different forms of research together just for with amazing
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:44.520]  information the website is medicine as an sin dot own spot dot com we'll put that
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:48.160]  up on screen for everybody watching at prison planet TV as well Dr. Scott

[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:14.120]  creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:18.760]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.360]  interest of the American people well Obama's already fudging yeah but since

[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:41.080]  talked to medical doctors who got all the Rockefeller documents I've seen them
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:44.160]  I've we've covered them here a hundred times where they knowingly discovered
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:49.680]  that most cancer was viral 85 years ago or so it's put in the vaccines that
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:56.160]  childhood cancer was unknown now it's epidemic worldwide I'm gonna go over this
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:00.400]  report later with dr. Whitaker who's on with us out of the associated press
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:03.960]  demonizing people that aren't taking vaccines but saying worldwide in some
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:07.160]  countries like Africa the whole public won't take them they have to pay local
[2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:10.800]  government to come at gunpoint give it to him half the public in Ukraine's now
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:14.360]  refusing exponentially it's happening everywhere so people are waking up but
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:18.800]  going back to just to what under Whitaker covers in his book and by the way
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:24.640]  you go to a medicine net also is another website of his and find out more it's
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:27.920]  just so horrible what they're doing and most the doctors and nurses they don't
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.040]  even know they're compartmentalized so sir please continue I mean break it all
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:36.200]  down the numbers what we're facing what's really going on in the hospitals the
[2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:41.960]  carnage yes well the hospitals are I want everybody to realize this the
[2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:47.160]  hospitals are a business don't ever forget that if you don't believe me
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:51.960]  go in there without your insurance card but the hospitals are set up they're
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:59.160]  all set up for drugs surgery the only reason or purpose that someone will
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:03.600]  everyone go to a hospital is for emergency reasons the emergencies being
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:10.120]  gunshot wounds car accidents amputations stab wounds things of that
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:16.040]  short crisis medicine other than that you can forget it there is no cure ever
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:20.080]  coming from the current medical establishment for anything I don't care
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:24.920]  how many foundations that they put on the TV I don't care how many pink ribbons
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:29.240]  you see every October there is no cure ever coming from the medical
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:33.600]  establishment because they don't want a cure the goal is to keep you at least
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:38.920]  about halfway fit and halfway alive so they can drain your account and then
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:45.320]  send you off to your grave you're right just and they're suppressing a lot of
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:49.120]  cures that's been documented please continue I mean I mean the numbers of
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:52.560]  people dying from malpractice admittedly dying from bad drug-inerted
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:56.080]  interactions but just the drugs themselves you know Fin Fin the heart
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:59.880]  attacks it's all admitted it's like HPV vaccines killing all these people they
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:04.480]  admitted as they say that's okay people are gonna die no doubt that in that
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:08.960]  corporation Merck probably one of the most sinister corporations on the planet
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:14.720]  who came out with who gave us biocs a couple years back killed over 50,000
[2:36:14.720 --> 2:36:19.360]  people and then they decided all you know we made a little mistake and then
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.880]  pulled it off the shelf but they had made 3.3 billion dollars so and then they
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:29.160]  want to come out and give this garter seal to our little girls ages of nine
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:36.120]  and 26 which I believe is nothing but a sterilization program and the body
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:42.320]  naturally gets rid of the so-called HPV and the only kills it only kills
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:46.560]  3,000 people a year and that's folks that already have autoimmune problems it's a
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:50.240]  virus that's on doorknobs everywhere else and they admit on the insert I mean
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:52.520]  I have to go to a doctor to know this if they had been on the insert we're not
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:58.960]  even sure this knocks out the HPV and only covers six four to six of the 350
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:05.840]  plus varieties of it yes yes even the so-called FDA of all people admitted that
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:09.960]  your body naturally gets rid of the so-called HPV I call it hocus pocus
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:16.320]  because it's so many strings attached to it and as I stated that actually the
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:21.360]  number one cause of cervical cancer for those women out there is latex condoms
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:26.800]  so that's a whole part a whole new show right there mr. Jones but no no cover it
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:31.440]  all cover whatever you want go ahead well latex the latex in the for the
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:39.440]  condoms contains talc and talc has the same or are similar chemical structure
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:45.440]  as bestos so when you're putting something like that inside of body and up
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:49.760]  to delicate organ you're going to create some serious issues there and that's
[2:37:49.760 --> 2:37:55.280]  what that does that talc gets inside of the woman and sets up the systems for
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:38:01.320]  the cancer to take place in cervix so men never use that on a woman women never
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:07.000]  let that in your system if that is your means and methods of of using then use
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:15.520]  the non latex condom please continue yes the hospitals one of my one of my
[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:22.160]  favorite chapters in my book medicine is the hospitals the menu who wrote the
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:27.040]  who wrote the menu if you ever go into a hospital and see the food that's being
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.720]  fed to the people it is outright frightening and this is these are these
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:36.080]  menus are written by so-called dietitians whose training was the same
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:40.240]  training that a md gets in med school and so they know nothing about nutrition
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:47.120]  at all med schools offer elective courses in nutrition elective courses
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:52.240]  three-hour elective courses so doctors know nothing about nutrition so you
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:57.200]  look at Linus Pauling how many times you win the Nobel Prize they know that real
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:01.680]  vitamin C not the chemical derivative as you know doctor just is has a magical
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:06.240]  effects on cancer and it's what your skin's made out of that's people will
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:09.240]  get scurvy if they didn't eat it their teeth will fall out they die and most
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:12.560]  Americans aren't getting a vitamin C I mean that I'm not I know you've written
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.200]  about that I mean can you talk about vitamin C alone oh yeah well vitamin C
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:19.040]  of course the real one like you said most of the vitamin C on the in the
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:23.200]  markets like the Walgreens and Walmart that's all synthetic that's made from
[2:39:23.200 --> 2:39:27.520]  synthetic corn you want to get the real vitamin C vitamin C that's like stuff
[2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:33.640]  like Camus Camus rose hips things are that sort and the vitamin C is so
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:39.720]  powerful soon as the body absorbs it like you said the skin titan skin gets
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:45.560]  real elastic also and then the immune system is boosted of course it's
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:50.840]  anti-inflammatory so vitamin C alone and prevents heart attack so that Linus
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:55.560]  Pauling did tremendous research on it he was scrutinized before he died and
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:40:02.600]  vitamin C needs to be used every by every day by everyone maybe we should
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:05.360]  talk about the positive stuff you and others have discovered that on record
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:08.920]  works but I mean let's continue with the carnage let's expose them and I'll try
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:11.600]  to shut up just so many points you bring up I want to back you up and then let's
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:16.560]  get into the good news but go ahead oh well because I was saying about the
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:21.680]  hospitals in the in the basically the foods that they that they serve people
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:26.960]  you can't get nobody will on white flour white sugar tap water microwave foods
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:34.160]  the hydrogenated oils sucralose splendor canola oil all this stuff is in
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:38.240]  hospital food and you wonder why do people end up checking in don't check
[2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:41.120]  out it's almost like a roach motel you know those are little things you put
[2:40:41.120 --> 2:40:44.960]  down next to your wall and wrote just check in don't check out like that in
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:50.280]  hospitals and the name hospital comes from the St. John's of the hospital
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:54.600]  you got to agree to research of that and you know and when they killed you back
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:58.360]  in the day they lay out a single rose on your pillow that's what a concept of
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:02.600]  bringing roses you never want to bring cut roses to someone that you're
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:06.120]  visiting who was sick because you're given off the the essence of death so you
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:11.840]  always want to bring a live plant but the hospital the MD the MD who was
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:16.600]  considered by most people as a god I call them medical deities misdirected or
[2:41:16.600 --> 2:41:21.520]  it's a pretty it's a priesthood he's better believe the priesthood they want
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:26.040]  you to be born in their temple and dying the temple and the temple is the
[2:41:26.040 --> 2:41:33.440]  hospital so the doctors average age MDs average age is about 59 years okay so
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:36.600]  just not being a doctor you can't you can average about 14 more years of life
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:41.240]  here and I mean by the way I got to back up again in court pleadings you pray it's
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:45.280]  a Roman civil court he wears the black robes of Saturn the judges will tell
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:49.520]  you this is even taught in law books and that's all a temple as well this is a
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:54.440]  cult but the medicine please continue oh yes no doubt because all the all the
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:59.440]  court systems under the British admiral regulations anyway bar and most of the
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:07.520]  gold most of the flags have gold fringes so but the hospitals the centers of
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:10.840]  death and you see they're being built everywhere that's why they call it
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:15.360]  hospice where you go to die it's it they're using the right name go ahead
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:20.280]  exactly so as I stated the the only reason you will want to visit one is
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:27.360]  for emergency reasons and then it comes down to when you get there they set you
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:31.360]  up in all these tests every time they take a test on you I don't care with
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:39.280]  MMR or cat scan or any type of test the doctor gets a kickback 300 400 bucks
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:45.040]  and that's why they always describing them and they send they send them off to
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:48.400]  their buddies that's why you got to see specialists now because everyone needs to
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:53.000]  get a little piece though you they can keep that money chain going and so the
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  when you go in if you're going I know some of you are still using your HMOs
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:00.920]  and your PPO and all these different health management systems because that's
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:05.040]  what they are they're there to manage your disease you got to be aware that
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:10.000]  when you go in it's like a recruitment scheme to scare you they create fear
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:16.320]  F E A R false evidence appearing real and then they got you I call it the web
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:21.240]  once they got you on one hand and they they get you on the other hand they
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:25.440]  create the fear you go in get the test test is this and they start you on the
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:28.800]  drug by the way I have a good friend who has a lovely I've known for about two
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:34.000]  years 24 year old girlfriend totally healthy exercises whatever and she went
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:39.040]  to the hospital for a checkup they told her she might have some cancer they
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:43.000]  cut out part of her guts she's been on chemo now for a year and a half and her
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:49.480]  kidneys are failing they're killing her wow wow and I am that's horrible and it
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:54.760]  just to mention you said about the kidneys you know 90% of the kidney
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:44:01.840]  dialysis are being used by African Americans in America and I've labeled
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:06.880]  the machine the Negro machine because it is that they're popping up on
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:12.040]  corners almost like liquor stores and they're everywhere every time I turn
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:15.680]  down the street is a new dialysis and they're coming up and and those things
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.040]  are a cash cow big money and that's because they teach people only drink
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:26.240]  Coca-Cola and iced tea eat all this process deadly stuff full of GMO that's
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:28.880]  not just black folks particularly hitting them as it's tailored for that
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:33.640]  everybody Hispanics whites all the numbers are exploding these plagues and
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:37.920]  they know that I mean look at Pedialyte it's for your baby full aspartame look
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:42.880]  when you go in the baby store it says water for kids with nutrients they need
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:46.880]  fluoride added and it's at four parts per million when one part per million
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:51.680]  will they admit give you massive bone cancer and children they admit this but
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:56.480]  oh see they know what they're doing oh we just for your baby aspartame just for
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:02.000]  your baby you they need fluoride go ahead yes no doubt and and they set our
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:08.520]  babies up with these 36 so-called mandatory vaccination they want to lay
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:13.560]  on them soon as they come out of the womb the MMR vaccine that's where you
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:18.920]  getting all your autism from and your DPT vaccine is where you get your seed
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:23.560]  this stuff is so deadly and they want to act like it's something that's
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.880]  mysterious oh where's this coming from a lot of times as you know doctor the
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:32.240]  children have a convulsion in the hospital and the parents or they have
[2:45:32.240 --> 2:45:35.480]  it in the car at home that night then they arrest the parents saying you shook
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:38.760]  your baby to death because there's blood on the brain when all the studies show
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:42.920]  it causes an autoimmune response so they don't just kill your kid or brain
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:46.320]  damage him then they arrest you even better now the police get money oh
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:51.600]  yeah yeah shaking baby syndrome ahead of brother Alan York down in Florida had
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:57.120]  that issue and a lot of other families have had that issue and yeah no doubt the
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:01.160]  the mercury that they call it stemmer saw now you know they said oh we took all
[2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:04.480]  the mercury out but then we saw what they put in there and you read them
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:10.360]  greens on them a song is 50% mercury so these these guys are satanic murderers
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:15.840]  yeah they're so evil and the CDC is part of it the Center for Disease
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:20.600]  Creation the AMA the American Murder Association all of them are all behind
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:27.680]  this and big pharma and in those pediatricians who know only know they're
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:33.000]  jabbing and sticking our little babies with these poison talkers you know our
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.880]  parents we sit up and say don't do drugs do not do drugs and then we go and rush
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:43.840]  them down to the arms of somebody and stick drugs into their arms criminal
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:48.920]  injectors not to mention the cancer viruses and DNA and microplasm they
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:54.560]  met but oh well please continue doctor yes as you as you did you did mention
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:47:00.400]  earlier the childhood cancers and childhood diabetes didn't even exist
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:07.280]  20 years ago didn't even exist until they started this massive routine
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:13.000]  vaccination and this is where this stuff is coming from it that the swine flew
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:18.880]  a vaccine which was laced with the sd-40 Simeon virus back in the 50s
[2:47:18.880 --> 2:47:24.360]  and 60s so it's those are those are who came up during that time frame most
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:29.080]  likely you have these latent cancers now appearing in your lifestyle and the
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:32.960]  people are wondering where it comes from and by the way they admit that over 200
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:35.760]  million Americans with polio alone and then the swine flew and others were
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:40.840]  given this these were cancers that didn't exist and these rare cancers are now
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:44.360]  everywhere and they go and every person that gets it they go you have the sv-40
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:49.520]  they admit it's killing you just enjoy yourself though oh yeah these these and
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:53.800]  that that's the thing that they're so irritating it they're so blatant openly
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:58.600]  with it and they kind of brag about it you know like the number one killer in
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:06.000]  America is doctors and they admitted on their AMA pages you know we killed over
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:12.720]  half a million people last year and so what and then they they even make jokes
[2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:19.080]  about it I mean they're so blatant with their arrogance and evil but yet the
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:23.920]  American people for some reason are caught up into that white coat I mean
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:29.000]  that red that that white coat that the MD wears is the same coat that a butcher
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:37.040]  wears and they both do the same thing well said now take my dad is a dentist
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:40.280]  and rural surgeon I remember him when I went to get my driver's license he said
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:46.120]  son don't sign the organ donor part of that and I said why he said well a lot
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:48.880]  of hospitals here in Dallas will kill you if you ever have a car wreck or
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:51.240]  something and if you're not that hurt because they get a couple hundred
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:54.880]  grand now it's close to a million you know that was 20 years ago or more I'm
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:49:00.280]  getting old and I kind of laughed at him and then I saw it on 60 minutes were
[2:49:00.280 --> 2:49:05.800]  hospitals were killing people and for their organs and and I remember my dad
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:09.080]  you know reading medical reports in the 80s saying age was engineered and
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:12.440]  things so when you do talk to medical professionals at least when they're
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:16.800]  older they all know about this it's the younger ones that don't I mean you are
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:20.360]  you saying all the doctors know what they're doing or or I mean I think they're
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:23.200]  all like on a godlike power trip and they're kind of scared of the AMA and
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:27.320]  they just do what they're told I believe the ones maybe in the in the early
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:31.800]  years your 40 and 51 those those ties who got that training from that era I
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:38.240]  think they have more of a sense of of an ethical moral type of way they approach
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:43.760]  their profession and and the control isn't where it was as it is now the
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:48.920]  young the young guys are going in there young girls and make the dog going into
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:52.640]  profession because of the dollar I agree with you 10 years ago they took away the
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:57.120]  hypocritical do no harm right right a great movie I'll call that do no harm
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:03.560]  right with Meryl Streep and so they go into this profession and I think it's
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:09.520]  all money-driven and of course they're wind and dying from first year of med
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:15.760]  school all the way through and lavish boat rides and and all that stuff so when
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:20.280]  they come out the drug of choice is the one that took me out to dinner and then
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:24.040]  they're promoting and then the pharmaceutical reps come in and they
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:27.000]  don't even read the inserts they just say oh yeah we got this today and what
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:31.160]  you try this out and then the commercials oh my god every commercial you see

[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.960]  okay I know I'm jumping in a lot here it's just it just it amazes me this much
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:29.320]  carnage is going on and as you said it's getting worse now I discovered my film
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:33.360]  in-game that it all is eugenics that was the dominant thing you know 60 70 years
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:36.520]  ago they went underground this Hitler embarrassed them that's why they're
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:39.760]  about the Nazis over here that actually learned it from us and this is what
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:44.320]  they're carrying out through compartmentalization but please continue
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:49.560]  sir oh yeah that was the project the paper clip operation paper clip where
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:57.520]  Ruff those evil scientists over here and continue their eugenics but the you
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:55:03.360]  know the current status in regards to our health is definitely effective when
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:10.440]  you go and get vaccinated so all the people out there who are using so-called
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:15.360]  flu vaccine you know that which is amazing to me you know from October to
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:20.520]  March supposedly this flu is floating around the air and landing on people and
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:24.520]  all this kind of stuff so I always ask myself what is it doing between April and
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:29.400]  September it goes on vacation is in the Bahamas I mean where is it then why don't
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:35.480]  they talk about it then so it is all a scam and in my research those people who
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:41.040]  use the flu vaccine and five years consecutive if you had a flu shot you
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:44.200]  about 99% chance you're going to develop out timers because it's so much
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:50.880]  aluminum incidence flu vaccine but of course we have the chelator the heavy
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:55.600]  metal chelators the from from from using the herbal clean them to clean the body
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:01.160]  of the aluminum and offset that but stay away from the food you want to avoid the
[2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:07.200]  so-called flu start eating white flour white sugar coca-cola mac-dudews
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:12.840]  Burger King and crispy grease and you'd be okay
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:17.960]  continue because the biggest thing is the food in the water isn't it all the
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:22.440]  food that the greatest threat right now to mankind is the temperate the tampering
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:27.280]  of our food which is going on daily I mean I can't see all mainstream media
[2:56:27.280 --> 2:56:31.520]  every single day they're coming out with some type of new genetic food that they
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:35.600]  want to put on the market 80% of the foods now in all supermarkets are all
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:41.120]  genetic terms of your produce and even your meats now are cloned
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:45.840]  clone meat is now in the market and and they won't they won't even label it for
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:49.280]  anyone just laid up there like it's like it's looking like a real steak and it's
[2:56:49.280 --> 2:56:55.320]  not so you got to be very careful on the meat that you select they've been
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:58.560]  spraying them with viruses live viruses somehow they want to protect us from
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:04.600]  listeria so these these are individuals who are behind this which is
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:09.200]  course the FDA your Department of Health and these corporations biotech
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:12.120]  corporations in the May 1 being Monsanto probably the most staked
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:17.760]  incorporation on the planet let me stop you there because we're again six years
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:22.760]  ago they legalized because there's so much E. coli in the slaughterhouses
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:26.360]  instead of just cleaning the meter keeping it clean they radiate it which
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:29.400]  kills it and then the studies how it goes to your body and clogs everything up
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:33.960]  and has no value then they spray it in the Latin word as you know doctor is
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:38.160]  virus-seeding bacteria that's the Latin you know if you translate the Latin as
[2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:42.600]  the name and they based it and so it's a vaccine they grow in these big vats
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:48.360]  other bacteria and viruses are in it it's grown on the base vaccines they then
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:54.160]  put into larger brews it's like brewing brewing yeast basically they grow it
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:57.440]  mainly on dead humans dead babies the big plants are in Europe they use dead
[2:57:57.440 --> 2:58:01.640]  babies and dead monkeys and things like that this is mainstream news and then
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:05.520]  they spray that on all the meat now and people don't believe me just Google
[2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:08.600]  spraying live viruses on me I just wanted to back you up on that go ahead oh
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:14.320]  yeah no doubt no doubt and also the ingredients of vaccines themselves from
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:18.920]  all the high-propylene glycol aborted fetal tissue
[2:58:18.920 --> 2:58:24.920]  mercury aluminum what I got to do with health nothing so realized people that
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:31.680]  the only one that vaccine benefit is the manufacturer who made them there is no
[2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:36.960]  benefit at all in vaccination dr. Scott Whitaker stay there back in 70 seconds

[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:45.960]  him trying to promote Africans and trust me take the shots we even got that in
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:53.760]  the mainstream news today and I want to go over that some on air continuing
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:01:00.000]  search you just dropped bombshell after bombshell dr. yes also want to give a
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:04.200]  shout out to brother Marcus there and do be in books for even allowing this to
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:08.040]  happen take place well no I'm just glad he told me about the book and we got one
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:10.440]  because I mean there's so many great people that I don't even know about
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:14.880]  that you don't know about getting us all together speaking of Barack Obama I
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:19.240]  mean you studied this whole situation with this wicked establishment let a
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:22.840]  real good president whether he was black white purple polka dotted I mean would
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:30.520]  they let a good guy in no not not at all of course when you read the liquid
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:37.440]  history and history of presidents you will see that they're they're all blood
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:45.200]  line are related and that they anyone who steps outside of their of the line
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:49.200]  that they supposed to toe is eliminated we can go back to Andrew Jackson
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:55.640]  Lincoln Garfield and of course Kennedy all these guys went up against the
[3:01:55.640 --> 3:02:02.120]  international bankers and of course they were eliminated so Obama is just a
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:11.760]  facetie he is just someone who is there to give hope calm the masses down and
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:16.360]  then present himself at least to certain people as a so-called Messiah which is
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:24.400]  very laughable at best so no they won't let any so-called good guy get into that
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:30.960]  position at all that position is there for tyranny oppression and to keep
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:40.040]  people confused and definitely let big farmer and big oil do what they do look
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:44.440]  at what he's doing with Africa I mean he's he's now sitting Africa core they
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:50.640]  want to put troops in Africa he's doubling the funding for the vaccines and
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:55.000]  abortions in Africa I mean the globalist love him because Africa according
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:59.280]  to the news is not trusting the establishment anymore rightly so they
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:03.360]  say all the Africans are ignorant and backward they think the vaccines have
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:07.000]  cancer and HIV in them when there's no bell prizewinners that have studied it
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:12.240]  and say it's in there oh yeah well when we study the oppression of
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:18.960]  colonization and America going over there doing their thing British going
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:24.840]  over there doing their thing every other country going over and using Africa as
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:31.280]  a as a doormat and taking all the resources killing the people with
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:37.000]  biological weapons giving them genetic food that's not going to help anybody
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:43.800]  and he's going over there as a philanthropist peacemaker and all he's
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:48.080]  going over there to do is to set up those governments so that they can keep
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:53.120]  sapping those natural resources keeping the people in strife and conflict
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:58.640]  between tribal tribal wars and then so they can pillage the whole continent of
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:05.360]  Africa as they've been doing before I'm sure you've seen the Senate letter that
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:11.080]  got leaked and Obama admits it's real where in Kenya he was trying through
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:14.840]  Odinga his cousin to get the Muslims and Christians killing each other to bring
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:21.680]  the nation down I mean that is evil oh yeah oh yeah they've always used you know
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:25.440]  they'll try to say you know people's old religion is cause of war no it's not the
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:31.160]  case there's the case where you have these agents provocateurs going in
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:36.080]  creating conflict between two different groups and so they could fight till each
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:40.240]  other off it works perfectly okay the doctors start over with that because you

[3:08:21.240 --> 3:08:24.560]  you to start over as you're interrupted by the break explaining what agent
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:30.240]  provocateurs what frontman do in society and continue with other comments on what
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:37.160]  the problem is doing because one of the biggest group of listeners we have per capita
[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:40.640]  and for twelve percent of the population were way over represented listeners of black
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:44.640]  americans because they know not to trust the system they've seen the scams a lot of
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:48.040]  americans are fat dumb and happy to think this is your everything's fine but now
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:51.360]  under obama you know they're really by into the government health care there
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:53.920]  and everybody is but they're really by and uh...
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:57.600]  hey i can trust the rock obama and i'm going no he's controlled by eugenicist
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:01.600]  he's increasing the attacks on i on africa bill melinda gates bill gates behind
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:02.760]  his dad heads
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:03.960]  planned parenthood
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:06.840]  which openly called black people weeds had to be exterminated and taught
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:08.840]  hitler everything you knew margaret singer
[3:09:08.840 --> 3:09:12.420]  and then i always black uh... high schools one i went to
[3:09:12.420 --> 3:09:15.320]  so i live by white rock lake when i was in first grade
[3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:16.420]  a kindergarten
[3:09:16.420 --> 3:09:19.120]  and you know the school probably sixty percent black
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:23.240]  and it was margaret singer uh...
[3:09:23.240 --> 3:09:24.360]  kindergarten
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:26.960]  and they had a statue of her out there in dallas
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:30.240]  so this is a type of stuff we're dealing with can you speak directly
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:32.920]  particularly to black folks but everybody else in
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:35.040]  you know how we get a listen but but
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:38.280]  that secondarily finish up with what you're saying about uh...
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:41.600]  obama and africa and an age of revocateurs
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:42.800]  yes uh...
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:45.480]  well he and of course they're using
[3:09:45.480 --> 3:09:46.400]  uh...
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:48.440]  they're using a black
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:52.000]  okay in terms of externally shown a black face
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.680]  so that uh...
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:57.200]  the rest of the world i guess was tired of seeing
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:09:58.280]  a white face
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:01.760]  colonized them so they figured i guess a black face would be better
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:03.920]  and so they're they're using this
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:05.320]  this this image
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:06.720]  of this man
[3:10:06.720 --> 3:10:10.640]  and uh... and using it as a in sign of a piece
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:15.320]  you know i'll be coming to help you that type of film philanthropic
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:16.080]  uh...
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:17.680]  an element and uh...
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:21.800]  it's all a sham a game is like his universal health care uh...
[3:10:21.800 --> 3:10:24.720]  that these are promote the hillary couldn't try to promote
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:26.080]  that's all a scam
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:27.400]  uh...
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:30.160]  with what that's going to do is
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:34.200]  uh... say that the only medicine or any drug that you can use is ours
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:35.600]  the medical establishment
[3:10:35.600 --> 3:10:39.080]  they want to eliminate uh... naturopathic doctors like myself
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:42.600]  i'm sure they'll try to limit car practice care acupuncture
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:44.480]  and and just affect the whole
[3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:46.240]  natural healing community
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:47.680]  and uh...
[3:10:47.680 --> 3:10:51.720]  that that universal health care is very very serious because uh...
[3:10:51.720 --> 3:10:54.200]  but you won't be able to do anything else but go to them
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:56.760]  i mean they'll put uh... herbs and vitamin
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:58.120]  as descriptions
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:00.880]  and uh... we've got codex alimentaries
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:03.480]  possibly going into effect at the end of this year
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:07.240]  uh... uh... all nine which is uh... that they're calling all vitamins
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:08.360]  toxins
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:11.560]  so uh... this is very sinister and satanic
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:15.960]  and then they're they'll promote biotech more genetic foods will be
[3:11:15.960 --> 3:11:18.840]  come on the market every single day
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:21.200]  and and and by the time you look up
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:24.560]  uh... your home market but breaking through frankenstein
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:27.320]  well there's another example with this eugenics agenda
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:30.000]  that like oh it's a great thing we're fighting to get this could this this
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:31.920]  establishment health care
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:33.400]  and that's killing you
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:37.360]  once you go in there and they call it a practice as they practice their art
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:39.280]  on you like your guinea pigs
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:42.000]  i mean that's what this is all about so specifically
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:46.200]  uh... this is about enforcing vaccines they've they've already uh...
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:49.720]  the fda's you know came out and just listed a type of b vitamin
[3:11:49.720 --> 3:11:53.120]  as prescription so they're gonna say all you gotta get a prescription for that
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:53.960]  exactly
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:57.520]  exactly if you feel free to it and they tried it there in new jersey and
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:58.960]  maryland uh...
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:02.480]  uh... gunpoint medicine there with the uh... students
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:07.080]  uh... who they want to be vaccinated to come to court with with a k forty seven
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:08.160]  so uh...
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:10.280]  uh... that this stuff is is is
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:11.640]  on the move
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:13.260]  coming to your town
[3:12:13.260 --> 3:12:14.960]  is very serious
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:20.160]  this legislation that the new one that came out that each uh... hr eight seven
[3:12:20.160 --> 3:12:22.400]  they're going to eliminate all organic farming
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:25.300]  uh... you can't have farmers markets anymore
[3:12:25.300 --> 3:12:28.120]  you can't even grow vegetables in your backyard
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:30.560]  uh... very dangerous the uh...
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:32.360]  that lady that's putting that up
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:33.760]  uh...
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:36.560]  what's the republican uh... roza delaro
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:37.760]  her her husband
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:40.320]  it's deli greenberg who works in my pencil
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:42.880]  so these people are satanic
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:44.980]  evil and murderers
[3:12:44.980 --> 3:12:47.440]  that's right you are not that though is the most
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:50.800]  uh... satanic corporation on planet marcia would interrupt you because we
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:53.080]  hit that break earlier come up on santo
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:56.880]  take your time get into monsanto right now for folks go ahead the monsanto i
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:01.000]  broke that name down it means model state one state very satanic it was a
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:02.760]  good with agent orange
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:05.320]  uh... rbg age growth hormone
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:07.360]  uh... uh...
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:08.280]  the uh...
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:10.280]  there was all and all these different
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:14.000]  uh... chemicals and how we see in the market is going to our body
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.560]  monsanto was by most of it you're going to move the
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:18.800]  uh... damey and all men three
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:22.960]  and when it when they talk about foreign corporation separate uh... take
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:26.280]  born and put monsanto in the same place you see what's going on they want to
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:27.760]  control the whole
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:29.800]  food supply of the world
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:30.480]  uh...
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:33.040]  anybody who could fit in a laboratory
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:37.640]  and make a fool don't even make uh... uh... seed only produces one time and
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:38.840]  you have to go back
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:41.000]  that company to get to see again
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:42.160]  if they can't
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:46.400]  so uh... you got these terminator c if they produce in given to these farmers
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:47.200]  on the genetic
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:48.400]  soil
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:50.360]  it produces one year old
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:53.600]  and then that's what we have to go back to monsanto begging
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:59.080]  for c to go plan again for the following year so it's uh... controlled food supply
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:00.320]  and people
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:04.440]  have to get back to the basics and learn how to grow their own food
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:08.880]  and and supporting their local organic farmers very very important
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:13.200]  well doctor i saw a report uh... out of oklahoma with one of their major cities
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:16.280]  with the city councilman saying people are planting gardens
[3:14:16.280 --> 3:14:19.520]  i don't know if we can trust him to do that we need to inspect their gardens
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:20.920]  and have licenses
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:24.120]  have a garden in your backyard or community garden because you might grow
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:26.920]  marijuana see that's guilty until proven innocent
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:28.900]  we're all prisoners speak to that
[3:14:28.900 --> 3:14:31.760]  only and then and then and how that ties into the federal bill that openly
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:35.040]  bans organic farming selling eggs on the street corner
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:38.080]  their swat team in the armist selling milk or eggs
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:40.280]  uh... and people with food pantries
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:44.240]  uh... you have i mean they really do want to shut this down obama
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:48.240]  it is again about who's in office is just expands but it's expanding
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:51.840]  under him and then monsanto brought us through sir older subsidiary
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:55.600]  aspartame now over ten thousand foods
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:14:58.760]  and i think i was brought in by donald rumsfield
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:14:59.920]  and uh...
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:02.200]  you know how how criminal he was
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:05.520]  but yeah this hr eight seven five that's what that's for that to eliminate
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:08.480]  the organic farmers your farmers markets
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:10.320]  selling food on the corner
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:11.600]  it's a little bit on that
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:14.760]  because they know that people want real food today
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:16.880]  and they've targeted the genetic stuff
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:18.640]  the growing fruits and vegetables
[3:15:18.640 --> 3:15:23.440]  that they picked uh... green they put them into a lot of uh... a few mccasin
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:26.200]  uh... center fumigate them then put them on the market that's why the citrus
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:29.960]  today taste so horrible if you bought from the regular stores
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:32.720]  and they have no nutritional value whatsoever that's why you gotta eat
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:38.000]  about a hundred of them just to get vitamin a or vitamin c out of them
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:38.840]  so
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:41.440]  these biotech companies
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:42.560]  these big farmer
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:44.400]  uh... vaccination
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:47.160]  uh... the clone meat people
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:51.640]  are all tied in together they all sit together thinking of how they can
[3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:52.800]  capitalize
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:54.000]  on us
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:55.840]  and at the same time
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:15:59.200]  and when we get sick we gotta go to them anyway
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:01.320]  and then they give us more drugs
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:05.000]  so it's just chemicals after chemicals go on to go on back to ig farm and they're
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:05.960]  in germany
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:08.440]  the german plant was now bare
[3:16:08.440 --> 3:16:12.720]  who uh... during world war two wasn't even bomb the whole place was was uh...
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:14.440]  told not to touch
[3:16:14.440 --> 3:16:15.920]  and and today
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:18.000]  uh... uh... ig farm in
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:19.760]  which is today bear
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:22.280]  uh... nothing but a chemical company
[3:16:22.280 --> 3:16:26.400]  and chemicals nothing but drugs and drugs is what controls all the uh...
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.120]  medical schools in america
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:32.480]  well remember uh... bear pharmaceutical and scores of subsidiaries
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:35.840]  for more than a decade when they knew every shot of factor eight
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:37.880]  with a hemophilia x and others
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:39.880]  was filled with hiv
[3:16:39.880 --> 3:16:43.560]  and filled with all types of hepatitis and other things
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:47.000]  and they knew it in their memos came out of an msnbc reported it
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:48.880]  and they knowingly shipped it out
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:50.280]  infecting millions
[3:16:50.280 --> 3:16:52.040]  that isn't just greed
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:54.120]  this is what they believe in
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:55.360]  oh yeah no doubt
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:57.560]  no doubt they uh...
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:16:58.880]  uh...
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:01.680]  i mean we're dealing with some people here i actually believe one day that you
[3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:05.480]  want to try to shoot a rocket at the sun i mean these people are absolutely
[3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:06.800]  barbaric
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:07.960]  they panic
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:10.160]  uh... they care nothing about human life
[3:17:10.160 --> 3:17:13.680]  uh... almost like they're uh... you know uh... reptiles or something because
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:15.440]  they they have no emotion
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:16.840]  and uh...
[3:17:16.840 --> 3:17:19.600]  uh... and uh... and uh... and so sad because
[3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:23.480]  the american population and uh... you know some of who are
[3:17:23.480 --> 3:17:27.120]  so caught up on cnn the criminal news network
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:28.080]  and
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:29.960]  uh... they
[3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:31.360]  anything that comes out
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:33.540]  but they say they just follow it on this
[3:17:33.540 --> 3:17:36.720]  i really don't understand it so see what you asked me about
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:38.240]  uh...
[3:17:38.240 --> 3:17:42.680]  you know after american people here how they've been tricked into this messiah
[3:17:42.680 --> 3:17:43.640]  image
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:46.520]  and we know the history of america and what it did
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:50.920]  uh... to our ancestors bring it is here work at the death in pain nobody
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:55.600]  then the sixties came and killed all of our leaders uh... king michael max
[3:17:55.600 --> 3:17:57.000]  uh... fred hampton
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  and uh... uh... always setting up
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:01.480]  roadblocks tricks
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:02.920]  cointel pro
[3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:04.720]  and things of that sort so
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:06.320]  uh...
[3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:08.260]  actually think that today
[3:18:08.260 --> 3:18:11.360]  that the anything has changed because of a new
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:16.880]  basis entered into office is absolutely ridiculous
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:19.680]  well then look at how he's gone back he said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:20.800]  that's all he did
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:24.000]  uh... he said that he wasn't going to uh... keep attaining without rights and
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:25.400]  all the headlines
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:28.960]  obama backs bush on the rise for detainees he's protecting bush
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:31.400]  and blocking congressional investigations of all the crimes bush
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:32.160]  committed
[3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:34.240]  he's launched all these new wars
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:37.800]  uh... he's got all these top globalist like henry kissinger brzezinski in
[3:18:37.800 --> 3:18:38.560]  there
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:42.280]  he's increasing the eugenics funding in asia africa latin america
[3:18:42.280 --> 3:18:45.720]  and then i see white folks black folks whether it's like they're an occult
[3:18:45.720 --> 3:18:46.520]  they're like
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:48.680]  i just love him he's jesus
[3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:53.280]  unlike no you gotta understand this is a blackface on the new world order
[3:18:53.280 --> 3:18:55.240]  they are trying to fool you
[3:18:55.240 --> 3:18:59.320]  and now they say yeah well obama had a lot of it all of us but i still like him
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:01.560]  man they're in trouble
[3:19:01.560 --> 3:19:03.440]  and in big trouble uh...
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:05.760]  you know it was back to that
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:08.800]  uh... i watch a lot of uh... documentaries and movies and
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:11.360]  of course i got my all obama deception here
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:15.240]  telling everybody about it is outstanding

[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:18.480]  cancelled a UN backed measles and rubella vaccination campaign funded by US
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:22.480]  philanthropist Ted Turner who's a eugenicist and at a press club dinner
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:26.760]  said we need to get rid of all these GD useless feeders a Hitler quote big
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:30.960]  public eugenicist is get rid of 80% of us in time magazine but he's got a shot

[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:46.040]  authorities have cancelled the UN backed measles mumps and rubella
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:51.120]  vaccination campaign because 9 million people refuse that so they've that's
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:54.560]  just one shot program and they said no we're not taking it I never thought I'd
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:57.440]  see the day we're perfectly good vaccines are being destroyed said Michael
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:27:03.160]  Baca co-op of spokesman for UNICEF around the world health officials say
[3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:05.760]  they're struggling with the repercussions of vaccine fears they call
[3:27:05.760 --> 3:27:10.240]  unwarranted and dangerous and then it says that well since it says a bunch of
[3:27:10.240 --> 3:27:14.120]  people have been dying from vaccines in Ukraine and so that's why they won't
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:19.260]  take it and they said northern you know in northern Nigeria there's a boy
[3:27:19.260 --> 3:27:22.800]  caught a polio shots believing HIV's in it well they were caught doing that they
[3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:30.240]  caught them the UN workers in and this was mainstream news in Libya and they
[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:34.440]  had whole wards of kids getting HIV who never had sex and they caught them with
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:39.360]  it in there and I mean this is going on and the whole article is trying to spin
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:44.240]  this and say it's not good that people aren't taking it but this is great news
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:47.200]  that all over the world people are saying I'm not gonna touch your stuff
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:53.440]  dr. Wettaker I love that when I hear stuff like that that means that people
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:59.680]  are listening waking up and refusing to let poisons be injected into their
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:03.120]  bodies into their family's body and of course they're always gonna
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:09.120]  always spend the media to make it seem like they're doing something wrong or
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:12.880]  something but like a like the couple of these parents here in the state who
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:16.720]  refused to be had the children vaccinated like I said they were forced at gun
[3:28:16.720 --> 3:28:25.400]  point 8k 47 to go to the downtown court in the jerseys and in Maryland and well
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:30.000]  almost made take these vaccines by the way I have the state attorney on this
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:33.120]  is predominantly black kids are making do this and he was black and he laughed
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:36.320]  and said I don't vaccinate my children but I said there's no law to take
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:41.440]  vaccines is or he said no but they still told them it was the law and had
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:44.680]  police with them 16s and police dogs we had reporters there it was on the
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:48.520]  national news thousands lined up being forcibly injected when there's no law
[3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:53.080]  if that isn't a bankrupt fraudulent government what is oh yeah oh yeah and
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:59.800]  you got these bootlicking uncle Tom so-called Negro leaders who who will
[3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:04.120]  protect the establishment that they're called the Boulay and these are
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:09.320]  probably some of the worst people ever in terms of black leadership and they do
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:16.400]  nothing but help the establishment keep everybody else down why they benefit
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:20.680]  from all the other perks that they receive and there are some of the
[3:29:20.680 --> 3:29:26.440]  worst people on earth but why would the guy even admit he doesn't vaccinate his
[3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:31.520]  kids and then snicker about it all because he knows how foolish it is
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:37.280]  to even do it and so he knows he knows you know he knows the law like yeah
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:42.360]  I'm gonna go on and make you guys do about that they won't do like 75% of the

[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:47.640]  best place for folks to get your book medicine I've seen several websites with
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:36:01.200]  your book the main website is www.medicins.net Medicins.net
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:05.080]  medicins.net we've got that up on the screen at prisonplanet.tv you know I
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:09.760]  think we're turning the corner people are really starting to wake up now
[3:36:09.760 --> 3:36:14.400]  everywhere there is a massive quickening happening that's good news but
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:18.280]  the establishment is moving in jumping on as both feet trying to put us back in
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:19.120]  the box
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:25.880]  oh it's no doubt there's no doubt they realized that through internet to your
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:33.400]  show and other activists out there who are trying to awaken the population and
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:42.200]  they have to shut that all off with agent provocateurs silly movies and silly
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:46.600]  TV shows keep your mind on that stuff which is really not it's not really
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:53.160]  like entertainment but detainment it keeps you detained so this stuff is
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:59.760]  very serious they use mind control almost every day I'm sure that people saw
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:05.160]  the movie eagle eye they could see that they can tap into your personal life at
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:11.480]  any time with just that cell phone absolutely let's go to phone call Scott
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:15.920]  in Maryland where they had got machine gun point force 1500 children to be
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:22.600]  vaccinated with no law you're on the air of Scott hi you know I think the world
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:27.720]  is not so black and white as your guest is portraying it I'm an oncologist and
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:33.720]  there's a 90% cure rate for just singular cancer if a young guy has
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:37.680]  particular cancer and he because he listens to your guest does not go to a
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:41.520]  doctor it's a good chance he's gonna die where he has a 90% cure rate does your
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:46.400]  guest have that kind of treatment success with you know vitamins I don't
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:51.360]  think so I'm hot you know I just throw this out doctor let me just throw this
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:55.000]  out to you I know there are good doctors and good people we talked about that
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:00.040]  earlier like my dad the issue here is we know with certain cancers like
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:07.760]  testicular or prostate that you have an 80 90% cure rate with us I also know my
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:12.360]  grandmother went and had a CAT scan as a regular checkup they said she had lung
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:16.320]  cancer they cut her lung out the screw her heart up and everything and they
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:20.520]  said oh it was just a ball of dirt in there but you know it was I just wear a
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:24.520]  blood vessel at birth so she didn't have that and then there's a 20-something
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:27.960]  year-old you know girlfriend one of my good friends who's dying right now into
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:31.120]  the chemotherapy I mean all these kids are getting cancer I mean they give
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:35.080]  homeless people the bird flu shot and they die that's the one in telegraph I
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:39.000]  mean certainly the there's a lot of evil going on here but you know what I'm not
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  gonna erupt you go you've been holding make your point Scott well I just for
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:47.440]  certain cancers like testicular and lymphoma they have an 80 and 90% cure
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:52.480]  rate so just not all cancers are untreatable solid tumor malignancies
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:57.200]  advanced metastatic they have basically there's no there's no known standard
[3:38:57.200 --> 3:39:02.480]  cure for that so you know I'll give you that the other thing is that I mean I'm
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:06.960]  interested in integrative medicine and Dr. Dean Ornish has a program for
[3:39:06.960 --> 3:39:11.120]  reversing heart disease with diet and exercise Medicare it's gonna start paying
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:16.880]  for it in January 2010 and so I think there is some you know integrative
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:22.240]  medicine is coming to the fore in many circles and medicare people are
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:25.560]  demanding it just like ten years ago everybody sort of converting over to
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:28.720]  organic foods of the feds change the standards where something doesn't have
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:32.440]  to be organic to say organic we're trying to shut down I mean I mean I agree
[3:39:32.440 --> 3:39:38.080]  that that that that a lot of doctors and in regular medical science want to have
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:42.640]  a more holistic thing and look at other things but I mean the horror stories of
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:46.680]  malpractice and drug I mean they know pros that causes psychotic breaks why
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:50.840]  are they pushing it on kids I mean I know the eugenicists run the top of the
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:56.560]  thing and but I mean I mean you made some points at Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:01.520]  you want to comment to the oncologist well he all he mentioned was to physical
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:05.360]  cancer was the other one in formal I've done both of those under percent cure
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:12.320]  rate so I don't understand his point I would like to see your statistics I
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:17.320]  highly doubt that that's the case I mean have you done a trial science of
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:23.840]  study behind that you doubt it you're the arrogant person sir I mean I am a
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:29.240]  researcher I'm a researcher I would have to doubt it if you said you did that I
[3:40:29.240 --> 3:40:33.440]  believe you why I'm not doubting you well I mean I'd like you to publish your
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:39.000]  results you know I would like you to drop a study so I can go a lot of
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:42.640]  medical studies though about the power of different vitamins and minerals and
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:48.080]  plant extracts I mean that's out there yes but there's a lot of synthetic
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:51.640]  vitamin studies that have been negative lately and they've gotten most of the
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:59.800]  attention now I I'm I'm interested in you know diet and and healthy holistic
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:05.240]  approach and I point people to the Ornish program if they want to you know
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:09.920]  a scientifically proven program that has some science behind it I have had
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:15.080]  patients come to me with you know going to a naturopathic doctor coming out
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:20.480]  with 30 vitamin pills to take a day I don't think that's in and then their
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:25.560]  diet is not emphasized so you know I there's certainly a lot of quacks on
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:29.480]  all sides out there but I mean my whole issue is when I go to have a baby at the
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:33.080]  local hospital they're sitting there with a nurse hooked into the health
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:36.760]  department asking my wife if we've got enough money or about mean to her not
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:40.000]  telling my wife this is a police interview and they're gonna seize my new
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:44.320]  baby and my wife makes one wrong move so I'm just saying the system is
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:49.200]  predatory I'm not saying that the doctors individually are all bad but any
[3:41:49.200 --> 3:41:54.840]  other comments to that Scott or yeah well I mean I've had that training
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:59.520]  basically you're looking for child abuse and it's not I mean all in the
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:03.320]  guise of good intentions so I mean yeah but it's not they're not telling you
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:07.160]  you're in a police interview that that's going directly you know like it's a
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:10.240]  grid I mean have you read the studies with a Rockefeller's figured out most
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:13.720]  cancers viral and and they're a bunch of eugenicists I mean these people are
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:19.800]  psychos I know what they're doing after we've proven that well I have not read
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:24.840]  this particular why do you think all these children as an oncologist are
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:31.240]  you denying that there's now explosive juvenile diseases like of cancers that
[3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:37.320]  never before was seen you know I have to go back to the Sears data on that I I'm
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:43.480]  not a pediatric oncologist but you know I believe that the incident of a cancer
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:48.120]  has greatly increased since 1940s now it's starting to decline in the last
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:52.520]  decade but only very small amount but yeah since the 1940s if there has been a
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:55.920]  large yeah it's pumped up and then playing off because of survivability of
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:42:59.160]  statistics I've seen I know doctor I just read the medical journals I read it
[3:42:59.160 --> 3:43:05.760]  all but listen Scott send send an email to Rob D at info wars.com this this D
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:09.760]  to Ornish we'll look into that we have all views on here and I appreciate you
[3:43:09.760 --> 3:43:15.160]  holding thank you so much okay that was Scott from Maryland we go back to
[3:43:15.160 --> 3:43:21.440]  Dr. Scott Whitaker I mean that guy was not half as arrogant as most medical
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:26.520]  people are was he well you know just the fact that he would immediately just blow
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:31.040]  mine off it's like oh yeah but I doubt that you know he carries on with his
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:36.400]  his his jargon but you know with them everything has to be a scientific model
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:42.720]  it's like they go to school and if it doesn't fit into this certain box and
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:48.480]  they don't believe it okay well here's a scientific model I know with the Searle
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:54.280]  owned by Monsanto headed up by Rumsfeld this is I've read the actual scans of
[3:43:54.280 --> 3:43:58.840]  the reports they fed it in the milk to the Reese's monkeys and almost all of
[3:43:58.840 --> 3:44:03.760]  them died it was killing them and then they still use that data and turned it
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:12.800]  around and got approval with payoffs in Congress for that I'm sure and you'll
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:19.040]  have the individuals like we just had who will promote that and say they they've
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:25.280]  made the scientific discoveries well I don't know if he's backing that up but
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:29.720]  it's pretty crazy Nathan in Las Vegas Nathan you're on the air welcome
[3:44:29.720 --> 3:44:33.320]  how you doing this is actually Nathan from Los Angeles but it doesn't really
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:39.440]  matter okay that's only Las Vegas we go ahead well anyways that yeah I'm calling
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:44.480]  because I had a question that I actually ran by a few people over the last year or
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:48.120]  so but it's never can get an answer and I've done the research and I'm just
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:54.480]  baffled on this what is this dental shots or techno shots carry anything that I
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:59.480]  should be worried about tetanus shots it's been in mainstream newspapers I've
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:04.920]  been 10 years ago 12 years ago five years ago I forget the exact but I mean
[3:45:04.920 --> 3:45:08.240]  mainstream European papers you can pull this up I've had medical doctors on
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:12.920]  scores of them basically saying what this nasiopathic doctors saying right
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:19.360]  now but in India and Africa major firms universities tested from multiple
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:24.720]  manufacturers okay it wasn't an accident a very expensive female hormone just had
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:28.720]  Montefon talking about it earlier this week he's a medical doctor and they
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:33.000]  tested it and so you get an autoimmune response to the tetanus and to that
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:36.320]  hormone that's released at the start of the second trimester causing a violent
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:39.880]  miscarriage and autoimmune inflammation in the organ that releases the hormone
[3:45:39.880 --> 3:45:46.840]  would you like to speak to that the tetanus shot oh no doubt it also is a
[3:45:46.840 --> 3:45:53.400]  another form of causing infertility it doesn't allow the egg to attach and
[3:45:53.400 --> 3:46:03.280]  causes many problems women the tetanus shot is a very toxic stains mercury so
[3:46:03.280 --> 3:46:08.640]  the you know avoided at all costs people did back in the day and then
[3:46:08.640 --> 3:46:13.840]  grab my grandma what they did they ever punctured their foot with anything like
[3:46:13.840 --> 3:46:19.140]  that they would just take a penny put it at the puncture wound draw the
[3:46:19.140 --> 3:46:23.800]  poison out that's what they did well when I step on stuff because I've had a
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:27.880]  tetanus shot I was little but I've had puncture runs I just get a knife out put
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:31.320]  it over the flame and then just stick that sucker in there get that get it
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:34.960]  bleeding something I guess people aren't don't want to do that but I just get it
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:41.000]  going to get it bleeding dental I was trying to figure out cuz I you know
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:45.240]  everybody have to go to dentist at some point I'm just that one I'm just well
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:48.360]  you notice you notice they're moving away from the mercury fillings now
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:53.680]  towards you know the other composites that are basically a plastic I guess
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:59.920]  specifically dental shot you know like the pain killers you know what I don't
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:02.680]  believe there's any mercury in the novel came that's not a vaccine that's just a
[3:47:02.680 --> 3:47:06.880]  drug that's just a drug to the dead in the nerve but the dental profession also
[3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:13.000]  is no less an evil than the American Medical Association because a promoting
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:18.440]  fluoride and mercury put in people's mouths is satanic at best oh yeah I
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:22.320]  remember when I was a kid I'd get the fluoride wash and I get a huge headache
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:27.360]  afterwards thanks for the call Nathan doesn't exist in New Mexico interesting
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:33.800]  name go ahead doesn't exist Monsanto doesn't exist day after day I hear
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:38.640]  people denying the truth on the Alex Jones show Pontius pilot asked the
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:45.600]  question what is truth people need to Google the principle of contradiction by
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:53.160]  St. Thomas Aquinas something can't exist and not exist at the same time also
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:48:02.000]  Google the letter story of a soul that went to hell hello yes sir we're
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:07.880]  listening to you go ahead now you're just talking about how the establishment
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:11.560]  denies everything they're still saying there's no compulsory service bill
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:15.520]  when Beck says there's no FEMA camps popular mechanics says so I appreciate
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:20.280]  your call when it's just everywhere in the mainstream media I've got
[3:48:20.280 --> 3:48:25.480]  reports here of all these youth brigades I've got this the army civilian
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:28.920]  police and security guard program that I've got to go through I've got the
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:33.720]  civilian inmate labor camp program these are 24 camps with Americans in them
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:38.960]  right now these are forced labor camps operating now and no one will it's an
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:43.800]  army dot mill can you speak to just the level of denial we see out there doctor
[3:48:43.800 --> 3:48:51.680]  oh yeah big denial I remember when the Katrina event happened when when that
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:57.200]  fiasco took place and FEMA came on board and so many families were broken up
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:04.440]  from that some they still it can't find today and they set up concentration
[3:49:04.440 --> 3:49:09.720]  camps you know they sent everybody to the to the dome to be killed there but
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:16.280]  luckily the the winds with the other way that that roof then gave in but these
[3:49:16.280 --> 3:49:22.520]  forces are always like I said they use in my control they use the media to to
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:27.320]  manipulate thoughts and then they have they make you think that was there is
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:32.840]  not there and it really is these are concentration camps all over all the
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:36.760]  military bases that they closed down on now being used as for concentration
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:39.720]  can they introduce bills saying they've already set them up but to get more
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:43.120]  funding for them it says it's on the whole basis what we always told people
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:48.120]  but all we're making it up Len Beck we can trust him Brandon in Kansas Brandon
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:53.000]  you're on the air go ahead I have a couple questions one for each of you in
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:58.840]  a couple comments of time permit my question first to dr. Whitaker is what
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:04.360]  do you know about Lyme disease and its agenda and source and Alex what do you
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:07.600]  know of how it could fit into the globalist agenda well I know the answer
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:11.840]  to me that it has to fit in there somewhere and possibly be the goal of
[3:50:11.840 --> 3:50:17.120]  the key experiments well I mean we have Plum Island we know it was leaked from
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:20.320]  there even mainstream news says that they've been to zoological experimental
[3:50:20.320 --> 3:50:25.320]  level four bio weapons lab they weaponized the Lyme disease go ahead
[3:50:25.320 --> 3:50:29.840]  doctor oh yeah I mean it's raining at the gentleman just asked that I have a
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:36.960]  just just picked up a Lyme disease client last week and it's definitely a
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:45.320]  biological weapon they promoted as some tick landing on you and treating this
[3:50:45.320 --> 3:50:49.160]  problem but that's not a problem that's traded by no tick as a biological
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:56.920]  weapon that destroys the nervous system bacteria and we've been using the

[3:54:17.600 --> 3:54:22.120]  Tony Brown says the Tuskegee experiment did not just letting them die of it
[3:54:22.120 --> 3:54:26.000]  but spreading it and giving it to them that one for 45 years so people exposed
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:31.880]  it no this is sinister at the top and I want to have to do a few minutes here

[3:54:45.880 --> 3:54:51.960]  like I said the biology weapon it was made there on Plum Island there and goes
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:55.960]  back into the 40s so yes it could relate that to the Tuskegee experiment
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:55:02.720]  that was during that time frame and as a bacterium laboratory made destroys the
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:08.000]  nervous system and like I said we've been using a chlorine dioxide to get the
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:12.040]  body back in shape with that and a couple of nerving herbs to balance out
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:16.440]  the system after the person goes through that but it's very debilitating when the
[3:55:16.440 --> 3:55:25.320]  person encounters it and it's airborne and you know it's just another state
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:29.600]  panic weapon being used on the human population by these globalists well

[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:05.360]  gone for three weeks now it's been out for two weeks you should you're here

[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:12.120]  copy here yeah it's amazing I came back I've been out of touch I haven't been
[3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:16.160]  looking at computers or listening to phone calls for about three weeks I
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:20.520]  come in the other night my phone is full of messages from people around the
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:25.320]  country saying the Obama deception is fabulous you you know I want to talk
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:30.480]  to you about it and so I'm really happy for not only for you because this is a
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:34.520]  very very positive thing but I'm very happy for the people this country you'd
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:41.440]  be able to see through this thing what we are facing is the most dangerous
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:46.400]  period in the history of not only our country but the Western culture and you
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.960]  know this Obama he he's a real work of art and the real danger of Obama is that
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:56:58.200]  he is so likable is that he is so articulate that he is so charismatic
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:05.560]  he is a man of color he's very very likable guy and that is the real danger
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:11.680]  and as I say over and over and over again you've got it judge a tree by its
[3:57:11.680 --> 3:57:16.960]  fruit not by its flower and his fruit is bad and his fruit is bad and I have all
