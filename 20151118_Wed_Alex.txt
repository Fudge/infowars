[03:20.600 --> 03:26.280]  but turned to terror federal and local law enforcement agencies have made
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.960]  dozens of arrests of men and women suspected of ices involvement mustn't
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.320]  have been too hard because the last four years they've allowed al qaeda al
[03:35.320 --> 03:43.960]  nazar and now ices to recruit all over the western world all over the western
[03:43.960 --> 03:51.360]  world they have been allowing these people to train recruit and then bring
[03:51.360 --> 03:57.600]  their jihadis into the middle east here's another headline out of the daily
[03:57.600 --> 04:04.240]  express eight ices suspects posing as refugees arrested at islam ball airport
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.640]  but french president halan's response is to welcome refugees 30,000
[04:10.640 --> 04:19.440]  additional in this week despite the paris attacks and obama has come out and
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.440]  said that they're not going to tell governors like governor greg avid of
[04:24.440 --> 04:30.120]  texas and 20 plus others including some democrats they're not going to tell
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.200]  governors or legislatures or state police or anybody else for that matter
[04:34.200 --> 04:41.560]  where the jihadi refugees are being seated can you imagine i mean obama
[04:41.560 --> 04:45.560]  could be planning some type of sleeper cell takeover i mean i'm not saying the
[04:45.560 --> 04:48.920]  radical muslims would actually take down the country but this could be the new
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.320]  9-11 and obama thinks we're so dumb that when they strike us he won't get in
[04:53.320 --> 04:59.880]  political trouble for what they've done this is wild man made climate change is
[04:59.880 --> 05:03.560]  largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the public into accepting a
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.880]  vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global warming global
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.920]  warming is a manufactured problem played up by the government to instigate a
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.600]  public reaction in this case fear the government then exploits to offer a
[05:13.600 --> 05:17.840]  predetermined solution the strategy now known as the hegelian dialectic has been
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.960]  used successfully by politicians for millennia to expand government which
[05:20.960 --> 05:24.200]  can only grow at the expense of individual liberties the bush administration
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.240]  uses strategy successfully in 2003 when it gained enough public support for the
[05:28.240 --> 05:31.960]  invasion of iraq a claiming country had weapons of mass destruction and the war
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.560]  ultimately expanded the military industrial complex in america's merging
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.400]  police state today global warming is used as a buggy man because allows the un to
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.600]  use government funded scientists to scare the public into believing that may
[05:42.600 --> 05:45.640]  make climate change is too big of a threat for their country to handle alone
[05:45.640 --> 05:48.800]  and thus it's can only be defeated through the expansion of the un at the
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.960]  expense of their nation's sovereignty the number one goal of an out of control
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.360]  government is not to protect you but rather to gain more power at your expense

[08:36.640 --> 08:43.880]  security of Europe now moves forward and there have been just incredible
[08:43.880 --> 08:53.240]  developments on the ground in Paris and it was info wars dot com reporters Joe
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.600]  Biggs and Michael Zimmerman that were first on the scene this morning and I
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.680]  want to just recognize the fact that they're engaging in real journalistic
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.880]  activities and that most mainstream media is scared to even get close Biggs
[09:07.880 --> 09:13.000]  has a military law enforcement bearing and I could say that Zimmerman looks
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.320]  pretty conservative as well so they're able to get behind police lines here in
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.120]  the United States in Europe time and time again and got some extremely
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.960]  powerful footage and videos and got that out very very quickly we're gonna be
[09:25.960 --> 09:30.400]  going to them here in just a few minutes exclusive this video and audio is up on
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.600]  info wars dot com along with still images exclusive info wars on the scene at
[09:37.600 --> 09:44.640]  terrorist raid films body bags and this is where seven were arrested a woman
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.680]  with a suicide vest blew her self up and a German shepherd or al-sation that
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.480]  was trying to pin her down and so we're gonna be talking to Joe Biggs and others
[09:56.480 --> 10:05.280]  in a moment then we have the French president openly saying this week they're
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.720]  gonna take another 30,000 refugees from Syria even though it's now admitted and
[10:09.720 --> 10:16.400]  I have stacks of news mainstream but we were telling you months ago that a large
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.680]  portion our military age fighters that failed in the fight against Assad in
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.400]  Syria and are now moving on to the new European front the same fighters were in
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.880]  Libya they said we're going to Syria next three four years ago then they said
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.320]  next we're going to Europe they are actually doing it the European Union is
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.960]  not stupid Merkel is not stupid Obama is not stupid Hollande is not stupid
[10:38.960 --> 10:45.240]  none of these people are stupid you've got to ask yourself what are they going
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.880]  to do when they start shooting down jet airliners machine gunning schools
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.520]  attacking theaters bombing military bases blowing up shopping centers you
[10:55.520 --> 11:01.920]  know blowing up grocery stores what's gonna happen how does the controlled left
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.600]  the George Soros run open societies left think they're gonna get away with
[11:06.600 --> 11:15.800]  this they're trying to elicit rioting and nationalist responses to then
[11:15.800 --> 11:19.280]  restrict free speech which Germany's already doing I don't see how they're
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.600]  gonna get away with it it really shows you how incredibly bold they are and I
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.960]  keep wondering what's their next step because this is planned to advertise the
[11:27.960 --> 11:32.320]  borders are open destabilize the Middle East make a deal with Turkey is a conduit
[11:32.320 --> 11:38.880]  to bring these people in so that the refugee crisis intensifies then the
[11:38.880 --> 11:46.280]  stories on info wars.com Turkish fans boo Paris victims chant Allah Akbar shock
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.520]  video illustrates the fact that Islam is the problem that's Paul Watson's view
[11:52.520 --> 11:59.160]  and he used to be more what you'd call anti Islamophobe and that was when we
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.560]  were bombing Iraq and in killing all these innocent Muslims but these are
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.840]  the non radical Muslims we kill our governments back the radical Muslims
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.320]  who are allied with socialism the Turkish fans booed victims the Paris
[12:11.320 --> 12:15.040]  attack and said Allah Akbar God is great during a minute of silence
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.840]  illustrating once again how radical Islam is the problem Islam is the problem
[12:18.840 --> 12:24.480]  and more and more Islam itself has become radicalized and it's just
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.520]  completely and totally shameful because Europe has been very inclusive of
[12:29.520 --> 12:37.320]  Muslims very inclusive it's an inclusive culture and now Obama won't tell 20 plus
[12:37.320 --> 12:42.320]  governors where the refugees are being brought in this is truly unprecedented
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.280]  big raids in the US is nearly 70 or scooped up with ties to ISIS planning
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.200]  attacks reportedly in the US I want to go to this Allah Akbar clip then we're
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.880]  going to Paris to talk to Joe Biggs Paul Watson's rotated this morning back
[12:55.880 --> 12:59.800]  into London and is reporting from there where they're also saying they're
[12:59.800 --> 13:04.280]  bracing for attacks we've got multiple reporters on the continent and also in
[13:04.280 --> 13:09.560]  the UK on the big island of Albion but first let's go to the shock clip at the
[13:09.560 --> 13:16.080]  soccer game during the moment of silence where the Turkish fans celebrate the
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.720]  situation in a game against Greece here it is
[13:20.720 --> 13:47.760]  this is what primitive cultures do
[13:47.760 --> 13:52.000]  now they've taken our primitive nationalist culture which is pretty much
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.400]  all we have and told us our cultures laying down and then they merge us with
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.440]  cultures that are all about dominating with the head Imam of Jerusalem the
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.080]  head Imam of Australia the grand musty of Australia saying your women are ours
[14:05.080 --> 14:10.160]  you are weak we are conquering you which is true we are the biggest but most
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.840]  pathetic chumps on the planet you can't go to Turkey or or Saudi Arabia and
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.640]  preach your religion or go after people's women or you know get free stuff
[14:22.640 --> 14:29.160]  only in Chumpville only in the West that was so wealthy because of the free
[14:29.160 --> 14:33.200]  market do we have the great grandkids the spoiled rotten brats of every race
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.440]  color and creed bitching and complaining about all the freedom we've got and the
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.000]  very criminals opening our borders are the ones taking our liberties hard fought
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.960]  paid for in blood back to the Magna Carta in 1215 fought over for a hundred
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.960]  years this year all being fed down a garbage disposal all being fed down a
[14:52.960 --> 14:58.080]  toilet because that's our real wealth is the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[14:58.080 --> 15:05.520]  without that without that rulebook we're just more dirt that's what makes us
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.640]  American it's what makes us Western is that we supposedly had more checks and
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.280]  balances but all our controlled media did was tell us how bad we were all day
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.440]  instead of telling us how bad other countries were and the people would
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.800]  misconstrue what I was saying saying how dare you bash America when you
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.800]  criticize the police state America isn't the police state America isn't the
[15:24.800 --> 15:28.280]  globalist America isn't the private foreign owned Federal Reserve I'm
[15:28.280 --> 15:34.000]  attacking the false institutions dissolving our Republic we take you now
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.480]  live to northern Paris in medieval Paris oldest part of the city founded by
[15:39.480 --> 15:46.520]  the Romans more than 2100 years ago then in Gaul where Joe Biggs former Army
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.760]  Staff Sergeant combat vet is reporting on the front lines I call this combat
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.520]  journalism Joe you're right there you got the tips you were there right after
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.600]  the raid today before anybody else congratulations to you and mr. Zimmerman
[15:58.600 --> 16:03.680]  tell us what you witnessed well actually when we got there they had pushed off a
[16:03.680 --> 16:06.760]  lot of people and there was a there was a lot of press probably over a hundred
[16:06.760 --> 16:10.520]  people but they were in this whole little area just like we've seen you know
[16:10.520 --> 16:13.320]  in Ferguson things like that's what I mean you're the only ones that got it
[16:13.320 --> 16:16.840]  yeah yeah exactly so what happened is we got there and I'm looking around I'm
[16:16.840 --> 16:20.320]  like there's got to be another way that we can get around and find out what's
[16:20.320 --> 16:23.440]  going on like that doesn't make sense they're not gonna have every corner
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.000]  blocked off so we hiked you know blocks and blocks went down every corridor
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.760]  through every little alleyway and every time we were met by police it would push
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.080]  us out of the way and then eventually I got to one and I just sat there for a
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.120]  little while we shot a video and Zimmerman started uploading it and then
[16:39.120 --> 16:42.160]  when I looked over my shoulder to go see if there was anybody still there the
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.560]  police had moved away for a little bit so I ran down this alleyway and at that
[16:46.560 --> 16:49.600]  point that's when I saw the body laying on the ground they had this forensics
[16:49.600 --> 16:52.920]  team all around it and they were taking pictures and there was no camera crews
[16:52.920 --> 16:56.320]  except for me there was no one out there except for the police and the
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.600]  investigators and so I snapped some photos of the body underneath the the bag
[17:01.600 --> 17:07.440]  and eventually was able to actually talk to a French police officer and I asked
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.160]  him I said is this one of the ISIS jihadis who was involved in the
[17:11.160 --> 17:15.720]  Paris attack on Friday and he said yes so we were able to get there you know
[17:15.720 --> 17:19.320]  with perseverance and pushing through and trying over and over again and we got
[17:19.320 --> 17:25.280]  it and it's great to see one of those crazy looms in a body bag and not out
[17:25.280 --> 17:27.880]  there able to hurt anybody else but at the end of the day that's still not
[17:27.880 --> 17:30.720]  gonna stop this stuff from happening because you have a lot of people out
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.080]  there who are supporting him especially the governments who are allowing these
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.440]  guys to go out continue these missions and you have an entire town you know
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.600]  Paris is completely just shook up I went out last night briefly for about an
[17:42.600 --> 17:46.280]  hour and walked around and there was no one out and I went into different bars
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.080]  and stores and I said is this normal and they said no people are scared they
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.360]  don't want to go out so I mean it's definitely has a toll on the economy and
[17:53.360 --> 17:57.600]  people just are staying inside and then you have what happened today with the
[17:57.600 --> 18:02.320]  explosions the raids you have a suicide bomber a female at that running out
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.960]  setting herself off setting herself off killing herself and that police dog and
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.560]  then we were able to witness the the other terrorist that was killed like you
[18:10.560 --> 18:14.680]  said earlier seven other people were brought in but I have some news as well
[18:14.680 --> 18:20.160]  it just takes a second from an update the suspected Islamic militants
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.000]  uncovered in a pair of suburb by police were planning an attack on the French
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.800]  capitals la defense business district a source close to the investigation and to
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.480]  police sources said today so these guys weren't just in hiding these guys were
[18:33.480 --> 18:37.920]  actually active they were trying to gather more people this was a terrorist
[18:37.920 --> 18:41.680]  self and they were going to do more attacks throughout Paris so that was
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.000]  stopped today well the reason it's important you got in there is we don't
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  just believe governments when they say they've got somebody they've killed
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.600]  there's a suicide bomber we need to see it and document it and that's why it's
[18:53.600 --> 18:56.280]  important that you got in there Joe and got that I know you're going to be
[18:56.280 --> 19:02.240]  uploading more but let me ask you this question how on earth do you think the
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.440]  French president the German Chancellor of the US president and others think
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.280]  they're going to get away with bringing in record numbers of Islamists when even
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.880]  the FBI admits a bunch of them are ISIS and are busting them even while Obama
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.360]  brings them in today this is crazy exactly I mean at the end of the day we
[19:20.360 --> 19:23.280]  have to find out where these guys are being funded from who who who do they
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.160]  benefit from and who are they really speaking for you know I highly doubt that
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.560]  you know a lot of these people in the government here want to allow this stuff
[19:30.560 --> 19:33.480]  to kind of happen but there's somebody back there who's got money in their
[19:33.480 --> 19:36.280]  pocket and they're pushing for it and they're allowing those borders to stay
[19:36.280 --> 19:39.240]  open they're allowing these people to come in that's called Saudi Arabia that
[19:39.240 --> 19:42.640]  basically runs the White House to a great extent and it's running this proxy
[19:42.640 --> 19:47.120]  war Obama better have some aces in his hole boy because I'm telling you I've
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.640]  never seen more brazen arrogant in our face behavior Joe Big stay there
[19:52.640 --> 19:58.040]  we're coming right back to you at the scene of the takedown of these
[19:58.040 --> 20:05.040]  suspected terrorist earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages
[20:05.040 --> 20:09.080]  or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be
[20:09.080 --> 20:13.120]  better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then
[20:13.120 --> 20:17.480]  we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking
[20:17.480 --> 20:21.640]  about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how
[20:21.640 --> 20:25.760]  will I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but
[20:25.760 --> 20:29.560]  the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.640]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[20:33.640 --> 20:37.800]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.920]  the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[22:28.280 --> 22:33.400]  crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this
[22:33.400 --> 22:38.280]  has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all I've posted a

[23:42.200 --> 23:48.360]  guns 80.com every day what that means is that you have to go to guns 80.com

[23:53.720 --> 24:04.920]  80.com but don't tell them you heard it from me there appear to be Arabic
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.680]  military age men that Joe says are basically stalking them right now
[24:09.680 --> 24:15.320]  taking photos they've been followed by cars they are below the Sacred Heart
[24:15.320 --> 24:22.720]  Cathedral in Paris that overlooks the city from the north towards the south if
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.360]  you're a TV viewer we're going to cut to some shots of the cathedral and I'm
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.360]  gonna have Zimmerman pan out over the city at night so you can see what our
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.120]  crew is seeing but I want to take you now back to Joe then I want to finish
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.840]  up in this segment and have Joe move to another location so that they're a safer
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.120]  because reporters and others have been threatened people have been attacked
[24:46.120 --> 24:52.120]  there have been now what eight attacks total six that night two others and a
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.720]  lot of other reports that are just being pawned off as crime that I'm also
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.360]  seeing on the news but Joe you say that you're picking up on some folks
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.720]  basically stalking you yeah there's been three guys that have been kind of like
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.160]  walking around they finally eventually left because of this van behind me as
[25:09.160 --> 25:12.560]  you can see it's full of police with submachine guns so that definitely makes
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.520]  me feel a little bit better because I am in a gunfree zone and I don't have that
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.880]  ability that second amendment like I do back in Texas back in America to protect
[25:19.880 --> 25:23.040]  myself from one of these guys so it's definitely nice to have that right there
[25:23.040 --> 25:27.200]  but yeah these guys kept walking around there's three three guys and they just
[25:27.200 --> 25:30.240]  kind of like taking a few pictures and looking at us and they don't look happy
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.960]  at all and they looking at me like they'd you know like to kick my head and
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.000]  you were talking about fair they don't have the bearing of police you've been
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.880]  leaving you alone and been friendly you're saying they had the bearing of
[25:40.880 --> 25:46.640]  they looked Arabic yes and so experience that in Iraq and Afghanistan what
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.160]  did you pick up I'm just the way they're they're staying together they're
[25:51.160 --> 25:53.960]  staying in a group and they keep walking around and they're trying to almost
[25:53.960 --> 25:56.920]  these like they're trying to be intimidating by maybe you're scaring
[25:56.920 --> 26:01.600]  us to go away or either to see if we'll move then they can follow us somewhere
[26:01.600 --> 26:05.240]  else so either way I've got a good eye I've been around this up before in
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.520]  combat and we'll be all right other points you want to add or need to add
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.000]  developments that have been unfolding since we talked to you 23 hours ago like
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.120]  we said we got up this morning we heard the initial reports about the raid
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.960]  that began around 4 20 a.m. Paris time I actually slept with my windows open so
[26:25.960 --> 26:31.640]  I actually heard a loud boom from where I was at and I didn't really quite think
[26:31.640 --> 26:34.760]  much of it until when I finally woke up and looked at my phone and saw what was
[26:34.760 --> 26:37.760]  going on I said hey we got to get out there we need to go find out what's
[26:37.760 --> 26:43.000]  going on so we headed out to us called St. Dennis it's a basically like a
[26:43.000 --> 26:50.360]  suburb northeast of Paris it's about a 30-minute drive out there and like you
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.360]  said tons and tons of people and the thing to think about is is you know the
[26:54.360 --> 26:57.760]  way ISIS is the way a lot of these people are they go to these events after
[26:57.760 --> 27:01.520]  they happen they sit there in the crowd and film you know it makes you think how
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.920]  many actual active jihadists were in that crowd laughing about what's going on
[27:06.920 --> 27:10.920]  about the attacks on Friday taking pictures shooting video trying to get
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.000]  out information about people they might find as a threat to send back to their
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.280]  base in Syria or Iraq to wherever they have their different leaders and
[27:17.280 --> 27:20.520]  planning on things like that so it's definitely something to think about this
[27:20.520 --> 27:24.400]  is an ongoing situation and like you said earlier they're expecting more tax
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.800]  to happen over the holidays and it's a possibility and like you said they're
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.320]  allowing even though these attacks happen they were going to allow more of
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.240]  these refugees to come through and like I've said before not all of them are
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.560]  going to be bad but all it takes is two or three of them to get together get a
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.040]  plan and do something bad and we saw what happened on Friday we saw what
[27:43.040 --> 27:46.400]  happened with Charlie Hebdo horrible stuff and people need to remember that
[27:46.400 --> 27:50.520]  that can happen in America we've already had the the recruiting centers yet
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.840]  Fort Hood the rest of it and our media just spends it and says it's not jihad
[27:54.840 --> 27:58.280]  how are they going to do that when hundreds get killed at a shopping mall
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.440]  or at a college or at a Jewish center how are they going to cover that up job
[28:02.440 --> 28:05.920]  eggs I mean I don't get how salon can even come out and say that they do this
[28:05.920 --> 28:09.360]  because they're stressed out I've been stressed out I've been in combat and not
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.320]  one time did I ever think about strapping a suicide vest to myself and
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.800]  blowing myself up I mean the pan to the right there we've got military troops
[28:19.800 --> 28:27.280]  patrolling with assault rifles there that looks like military and we've got
[28:27.280 --> 28:33.440]  jogger going by those are those are French military aren't they Joe yes sir
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.520]  they are they've been around a lot of different places during the daytime you
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.800]  haven't seen that much activity as far as a lot of patrolling you'll see some
[28:41.800 --> 28:44.840]  soldiers from now every now and then but at night time that's really when you
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.120]  start to see them come out and they're patrolling you know with the guns in a
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.640]  hand ready to go so that's what they're expecting is something to happen in the
[28:52.640 --> 28:58.760]  cover of darkness like it's happened before again I'll go back to this
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.120]  question how is the establishment going to get away with it when there are more
[29:03.120 --> 29:07.920]  attacks clearly this is out of Syria this is the failed ISIS armies are
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.480]  coming into the West this is their retreat forward into their next theater
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.560]  they admit that they said that back in February they're following a plan there's
[29:16.560 --> 29:20.240]  going to be a whole bunch more attacks now undoubtedly we've been predicting it
[29:20.240 --> 29:23.840]  it's here I want to come back to you and do five more minutes show and ask you
[29:23.840 --> 29:28.520]  that question and ask the listeners that question what is the end game here this
[29:28.520 --> 29:36.040]  is crazy town eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.240]  five nine nine two three one especially if you're in Europe or in Paris or in
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.280]  Belgium we love to hear from you or if your military or police would like to
[29:43.280 --> 29:46.560]  take on this I mean we know they're gonna take our liberties because of this
[29:46.560 --> 29:51.520]  but they're gonna get in trouble we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[34:08.040 --> 34:12.960]  speech yeah we're coming with forced inoculations yeah the IRS is gonna

[34:24.400 --> 34:31.640]  be millions of Middle Eastern refugees as a clash of civilizations to then
[34:31.640 --> 34:36.760]  allow them to be radicalized allow them to attack us and then bomb whatever
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.160]  country they want the Middle East that isn't even connected to the groups that
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.680]  are attacking us we'll never go after Saudi Arabia no in fact they're in the
[34:44.680 --> 34:51.240]  news today secretary Kerry the usual suspects saying we've got to hit Assad
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.880]  we've got to remove Assad he's the reason ISIS is in Libya no he's not the
[34:56.880 --> 35:00.680]  reason ISIS is in Libya and in Syria because they want to go into Libya too
[35:00.680 --> 35:07.180]  they're already bombing there all over is because he hasn't been taken out no
[35:07.180 --> 35:16.400]  they're there because the West put them in there and it's even in mainstream news
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.720]  look at that headline well Habib used them to ISIS how Saudi Arabia exported
[35:20.720 --> 35:28.920]  the main source of global terrorism that's by Karen Armstrong the new
[35:28.920 --> 35:35.760]  statesman and that's all over the news that's admitted and our government is
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.560]  backing it the French government is backing it the Turkish government is
[35:39.560 --> 35:43.400]  backing it the German government is backing it the UK government is backing
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.880]  it and then they sit here with a straight face and say our hearts and prayers
[35:47.880 --> 35:50.720]  are with the French our hearts and prayers are with the Russians when
[35:50.720 --> 35:58.320]  their jetliner gets blown up and 224 people get killed so answer my question
[35:58.320 --> 36:06.800]  to answer my question the answer to my question is it is to destabilize the
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.160]  West it is create a class of civilizations it is the pretext for the
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.480]  surveillance grid and the police state that isn't used to protect us but use
[36:14.480 --> 36:18.080]  to suppress our political speech look at how the Patriot Act and homeland
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.680]  security and the IRS are all pointed at returning veterans gun owners
[36:22.680 --> 36:27.280]  conservatives libertarians and Christians I rest my case and it's the
[36:27.280 --> 36:32.640]  same story in Europe and they think we're so politically ignorant they think
[36:32.640 --> 36:37.680]  we're so politically dumb to be specific they think their constituents are so
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.280]  politically ignorant and so politically dumb and so politically correct that
[36:42.280 --> 36:46.800]  they will sit there and watch sports stadiums blown up and theaters shot up
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.280]  and blown up and jetliners blown up and hundreds of thousands of Christians
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.080]  killed the Middle East and will sit there with a straight face and support
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.160]  the president of France the chancellor of Germany the president of the United
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.960]  States when they engage in this operation and the Muslim nations should
[37:04.960 --> 37:08.520]  be upset about this because then the West will use this to come in and
[37:08.520 --> 37:15.440]  dominate and bomb your countries but again at a primitive level it feels way
[37:15.440 --> 37:22.880]  too good to go to a Greek-slash-turkey soccer game during the moment of
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.960]  silence the one minute of silence for the dead French and others that were in
[37:26.960 --> 37:33.320]  France the moment of silence for the dead and dying from last Friday's attack
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.600]  and they chant Allah Akbar and celebrate it in fact that's my next
[37:37.600 --> 37:44.600]  question for Joe Beggs Joe Beggs Turkey supposedly our ally and then they have
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.720]  the crowd chanting Allah Akbar during the moment of silence which means God is
[37:50.720 --> 37:56.000]  great in a sign of disrespect against those that died what type of freakish
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.920]  attitude is that I mean it's disgusting I mean it's not just in Turkey though I
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.480]  mean look at what happens with black lives matter that the fact that they
[38:05.480 --> 38:09.480]  could do a hashtag F Paris and then you've got a guy coming out with a rap
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.120]  video there's just some sick disgusting people out there and to answer your first
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.560]  question how do or do I think that the elites are going to be able to get away
[38:17.560 --> 38:21.160]  with us continuously honestly yeah I think it's going to continue to happen
[38:21.160 --> 38:25.760]  for one reason the lack of real journalism out there there's only a few
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.960]  sources out there there's us there's vice I mean but you've got mainstream media
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.160]  outlets who reach millions of people are completely controlled by the government
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.760]  of course you know we're out here telling what's going on we're telling the
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.800]  truth but you've got these mainstream media outlets who are basically cutting
[38:42.800 --> 38:47.520]  off our head because they're just pumping lies pumping lies out not
[38:47.520 --> 38:52.680]  even controlling not even trying to do anything truthful or journalistic in
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.360]  any way they'd rather spark up controversies have people you know bitch
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.520]  and complain about a Starbucks coffee cup or something like that I mean it's
[39:01.520 --> 39:05.440]  ridiculous and that is why because the government's tell them what to say and
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.680]  they do it they have no reason to even tell the truth they're bawled out most
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.000]  of those anchors probably take money in the pocket it's sickening and that's
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.400]  why because most people out there aren't awake and all they all they think and
[39:19.400 --> 39:23.360]  they believe is real journalism is when they turn on the BBC or when they turn
[39:23.360 --> 39:26.800]  on Fox News or CNN and they don't know that there's a whole another world out
[39:26.800 --> 39:32.440]  there that they aren't even privy to actual knowledge truth freedom liberty
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.960]  what we promote but these people turn on and they see what's going on and go well
[39:36.960 --> 39:40.880]  we should you know take in the Syrian refugees you know your race is basically
[39:40.880 --> 39:44.120]  if you you know don't want to have your head chopped off or be killed or blown
[39:44.120 --> 39:47.920]  up by an Islamic terrorist because even say something like that would mean
[39:47.920 --> 39:51.840]  you're racist and you're inhumane and that's just getting pumped down everyone's
[39:51.840 --> 39:54.840]  throat and the government's behind it every kind of government that's all they
[39:54.840 --> 40:00.160]  do it was just like with the with Gary Webb when he wrote the Dark Alliance
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.080]  the Washington Times got hit up by the CIA and they're telling them to pump out
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.520]  other stuff and attack them and completely killed the thing that's what
[40:07.520 --> 40:14.880]  happens it's disgusting and it's now come out that the editor of the LA Times
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.480]  that wrote hit pieces against him as well was CIA and of course it later came
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.280]  out in Congress everything Webb had exposed was true he had a new book
[40:24.280 --> 40:27.760]  coming out I was talking to him two weeks before he died that proved
[40:27.760 --> 40:33.120]  everything he'd said so they dropped by his house and shot him twice in the head
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.560]  yep those pesky two double tap or double tap suicides those keep happening to
[40:39.560 --> 40:44.280]  people somehow I mean and people just don't see past that I mean it really
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.760]  does in the pit of my stomach make me want to throw up in a vomit when there's
[40:48.760 --> 40:51.920]  so many people out here in this world that don't just open their eyes and
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.960]  don't go and you know is what I'm seeing is that what's really happening is
[40:56.960 --> 40:59.480]  there's something really is there's something behind the curtain should I
[40:59.480 --> 41:03.080]  look more and a lot of people just they turn on and they accept whatever it is
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.720]  whatever's pumped down their throat and they want they want more and they're
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.480]  happy to be ignorant it's like your friend Michael Hastings he told family you
[41:11.480 --> 41:15.500]  talked to his wife he told others they're after me Homeland Security they
[41:15.500 --> 41:19.640]  might try to kill me I'm running an hour later his car blows up in front of
[41:19.640 --> 41:25.520]  everyone and we're just told don't even investigate foul play yeah I mean that's
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.400]  the mainstream media that's them having their you know their their their cords
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.560]  programmed they're telling them the government's going hey man you need to
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.040]  push this narrative forget what actually happened forget the truth forget the
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.520]  fact that a vehicle traveling down a straight path somehow exploded and then
[41:42.520 --> 41:47.000]  hit a tree and then when it hit the tree that ejected the engine down the road
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.360]  and the same original path of travel I mean that's crazy that people just turn
[41:51.360 --> 41:56.320]  on the TV and go okay yeah that makes sense when it's never happened and that's
[41:56.320 --> 41:59.560]  what's happening in the world so yes the answer to your question is yes I think
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.200]  this stuff will continue to happen it will happen all the time until we get
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.080]  more people to wake up and start digging and start asking questions and we need
[42:07.080 --> 42:10.720]  people out there we need journalists who are out there in these mainstream media
[42:10.720 --> 42:15.760]  positions to start doing their job and stop taking the money and stop sitting
[42:15.760 --> 42:20.840]  there and just falsifying everything else for someone else's agenda do the
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.160]  right thing tell the truth it's disgusting we need more people to come out
[42:25.160 --> 42:28.880]  here and push through barricades and go in and find out what's going on it
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.840]  shouldn't just take me and other people to go out and do that we need everyone
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.440]  that hungry to find out what's going on because there's another story to it's
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.760]  never what they're pushing out I have to go out there dig and find it Joe I want
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.000]  to get another update from you in about an hour and a half from now or at about
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.600]  1.35 or so central okay I'm you're doing some great reporting you and Mr.
[42:52.600 --> 42:56.520]  Zimmerman get out there continue and we'll do another update with you coming
[42:56.520 --> 43:00.840]  up about an hour and a half thank you Joe Biggs Roger that there he goes from
[43:00.840 --> 43:08.000]  North Paris they're at the Sacred Heart Cathedral with French commandos patrolling
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.480]  behind him and a van full of police with sub machine guns notice it's guns that
[43:14.480 --> 43:18.560]  are going to protect and men with guns that are going to protect the French
[43:18.560 --> 43:28.040]  citizens from the occupying force of giant radical Muslim ghettos where they
[43:28.040 --> 43:34.080]  don't want Europeans to even enter or come in their restaurants now you can
[43:34.080 --> 43:39.400]  parallel that to the Middle Easterners I know that own jewelry shops carpet shops
[43:39.400 --> 43:47.880]  restaurants coffee shops businesses hotels gyms they love Westerners they
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.240]  want to be Western they want to live in nice houses they want their daughters to
[43:51.240 --> 43:56.360]  be free they're still Muslims they still follow the god of Abraham they're good
[43:56.360 --> 44:01.360]  people they're all over the place and they can't stand what they see happening
[44:01.360 --> 44:06.560]  and then they end up getting persecuted and discriminated against because our
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.040]  governments protect the radicals our governments are bringing them in because
[44:11.040 --> 44:14.960]  it's the radical Islamists that go together like a horse and carriage with
[44:14.960 --> 44:19.640]  the Socialist with the Trotskyites with the Leninist with the Maoist with the
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.200]  Black Lives Matter Ford Foundation garbage
[44:26.040 --> 44:33.840]  and they are pushing it big time there are a lot of great Muslims and Arabs in
[44:33.840 --> 44:39.480]  this country who are doctors and lawyers and scientists who do want to be in a
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.040]  free country in a free world those people are not a threat to this country but
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.400]  what is a threat to this country is radical Islamists funded by Saudi
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.720]  Arabia and by our criminal government being protected to create the class of
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.840]  civilizations so the controlled left says let them in claim they're not
[44:54.840 --> 44:59.080]  terrorist claim nothing's happening that's how you are culturally open no
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.720]  you're culturally open by shutting down radicals and going after them and not
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.680]  letting them come in this country that makes it safe for everyone that wants to
[45:09.680 --> 45:12.760]  live in a free country to live together and have their freedom because you've
[45:12.760 --> 45:16.720]  got freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom to do what you
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.800]  want as long as you don't hurt somebody else instead we're told those of us
[45:21.800 --> 45:26.200]  they're constitutionalist that we've got to give up our way of lives to the left
[45:26.200 --> 45:31.600]  and teach our kids what they say and worship the gods they say worship the
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.160]  state I'm not gonna be part of that we're gonna go to break here in a few

[46:46.480 --> 46:50.320]  everybody especially working with Alex and the team over here at info wars life
[46:50.320 --> 46:56.320]  to create a product that would focus on helping people clean environmental
[46:56.320 --> 47:00.880]  chemicals and toxins from their body and how to detox those from the system we
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.320]  have a lot of good products over here from the x2 all of the liver cleanse
[47:05.320 --> 47:10.000]  products the oxy powder the winter sun I mean you name it down the line
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.120]  everything is great today though I'm really excited because this is something
[47:14.120 --> 47:19.120]  that you guys have the exclusive for which is a product called deep cleanse and
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.080]  why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.240]  crystals we have two unique products that nobody in the world has one of the
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.960]  most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.720]  actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.640]  ago as a matter of fact this ingredient was only given to the elite of the elite
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.560]  thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet we
[47:47.560 --> 47:50.960]  wanted to put this stuff for a couple years but we couldn't get an organic
[47:50.960 --> 47:55.120]  form right I mean I explain I mean with this stuff so good we couldn't put it
[47:55.120 --> 47:59.720]  out for years right so I had to actually it's kind of like the iodine crystals
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.920]  finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.560]  available but in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains thousands of
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.200]  years ago they found they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.080]  monkeys would go up into the mountains are being raised against monkeys and
[48:16.080 --> 48:22.160]  they would pick this black substance from the mountains and so in Russia they
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.720]  actually it grows in Russia and the mountains that in the Himalayan's and
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.280]  only in the summer and Shilajit is actually the decomposition of seven up
[48:31.280 --> 48:36.480]  to seven thousand different medicinal herbs so it decomposes all these
[48:36.480 --> 48:41.160]  different herbs decomposing the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up
[48:41.160 --> 48:47.200]  there and what happens in the summertime it's almost like an oil from yes it's
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.080]  high in full of acid is high in humic acid is always claiming oil is really
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.920]  from decomposed animals and plants there is some oil that is based from fossils
[48:56.920 --> 49:03.320]  but most of it's really abiotic but so so this is a true fossil source I mean
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.200]  explain it to me it is it's really the decomposition like I said of over seven
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.320]  thousand different medicinal herbs and plants and it and with the rocks and the
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.600]  pressure deep in the mountains it freezes and and during the summertime and
[49:16.600 --> 49:21.040]  the pressures build it up is out oozes out so it literally oozes out of the
[49:21.040 --> 49:27.720]  mountain rock sap it's like rock sap it's black and it's highly nutritious even
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.680]  in the 1980s when the Olympic athletes in Russia were accused of being on
[49:32.680 --> 49:37.280]  steroids they found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.760]  works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles it's a big dose in there
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.080]  the second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.120]  what this formula is designed to do the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.440]  strong negative charge all the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have
[49:55.440 --> 50:01.360]  positive charges so these go in they grab it and then they safely eliminate it
[50:01.360 --> 50:08.600]  through the body so you can become healthy I mean the this is an amazing
[50:08.600 --> 50:13.200]  formula I wish I actually had it but because this was an exclusive info
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.600]  wars life product you're the only one in the world that has this formula now and
[50:17.600 --> 50:21.960]  you know there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.960]  because you can only harvest this once a year how do people take it how is it
[50:25.960 --> 50:31.880]  recommended that this be done just a daily daily dose yeah daily dose the
[50:31.880 --> 50:35.960]  instructions are on the label you know of course I kind of modified for each
[50:35.960 --> 50:39.240]  individual it depends on what your lifestyle is I mean the honestly the
[50:39.240 --> 50:42.840]  best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your
[50:42.840 --> 50:47.240]  environment and try to identify them and start slowly reducing them but
[50:47.240 --> 50:50.920]  personally I'm going to probably take it every day every other day and I'll
[50:50.920 --> 50:56.120]  probably go with about a dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls and I and I
[50:56.120 --> 50:59.400]  live I don't expose myself to any chemicals but it's out there in the
[50:59.400 --> 51:02.000]  air it's in everything well I mean I say what I do the air I've never been a

[53:50.480 --> 53:54.600]  joining us for part of the next hour he will be at the UN conference that's the
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.520]  most important UN conference ever in their own words openly announcing
[53:58.520 --> 54:03.000]  planetary government this is so huge fusing it with the TPP and other
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.840]  treaties he will be joining us tying in to the situation in Paris and what's
[54:09.840 --> 54:15.960]  been unfolding there as well so that is coming up also have clips a
[54:15.960 --> 54:20.920]  representative in Congress talking about Paris attacks being a chilling reminder
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.840]  the US needs trick or gun laws simply amazing to demonize the Second
[54:26.840 --> 54:32.800]  Amendment when people end up attacking the answer is more guns I mean France has
[54:32.800 --> 54:38.960]  taken the guns so it's just the inversion of reality that we talk so much
[54:38.960 --> 54:44.480]  about also we have several other very very important clips we're going to be
[54:44.480 --> 54:48.440]  getting to but right now let's go to your phone calls you've heard my question
[54:48.440 --> 54:51.720]  I want to get your take on it how do the politicians think they're going to go
[54:51.720 --> 54:55.720]  away with bringing these people in who's an attack is an asymmetrical warfare
[54:55.720 --> 55:02.120]  and is the end game just a class of civilizations and more chaos Matt in
[55:02.120 --> 55:07.120]  Canada thanks for calling thanks for holding her on the air hey Alex I was
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.880]  going good that's good man sorry I the way I'm able to watch your show I'm
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.640]  usually a day or two behind so I'm sorry I'm not going to ask a question
[55:15.640 --> 55:20.560]  regarding your question my point of view is on the Paris attacks is this and
[55:20.560 --> 55:25.960]  France has been in the headlines a lot lately what was backing Palestine and
[55:25.960 --> 55:32.640]  not science yet TTIP and and indicting the Rothschild I was just wondering if
[55:32.640 --> 55:36.720]  this could be a retaliation towards that kind of a hey smart enough France get
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.000]  your act together false play kind of deal or what do you think well if there
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.320]  was evidence that Israel was attacking France we would cover it I mean Israel
[55:48.320 --> 55:54.120]  did attack the USS Liberty to blame Egypt and we've exposed that Israel ran
[55:54.120 --> 55:58.120]  the Levant affair Israel bombs of its own buildings and blaming on enemies
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.840]  before Israel has done that that's been in the news that's something that some
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.360]  Israeli governments have done our government's done false flags the
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.600]  French have done it in Operation Gladio along with our government so that's
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.120]  certainly a possibility I just haven't seen the evidence of that ISIS is a
[56:16.120 --> 56:22.680]  real organization that's been turned loose France didn't really recognize
[56:22.680 --> 56:27.880]  Israel they recognize the UN resolution but some people could argue France is
[56:27.880 --> 56:33.120]  being hit because they did that Israel didn't make the Muslims run my camera
[56:33.120 --> 56:39.160]  crew off in Belgium or in Paris I mean there are radical Islamists that you
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.560]  know the Imam of Jerusalem saying Western women belong to Muslims I mean
[56:43.560 --> 56:49.640]  is is is that Israel's fault too I do believe that it was ISIS a hundred
[56:49.640 --> 56:53.600]  percent I'm just saying do you think that maybe because Germany is allowing all
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.640]  these refugees in it besides the civil disobedience that's going on there they
[56:57.640 --> 57:02.960]  haven't seen the extent that pair that Paris just did so I'm well I mean I
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.120]  tend to hear what you're saying Germany red carpets the radical Muslims like
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.680]  nobody else and going back to World War two a lot of the radical Muslims like
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.760]  Germany they liked Hitler they're the French occupied large parts of the
[57:15.760 --> 57:24.320]  Middle East Syria North Africa Libya and so the French are not liked in many of
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.960]  those sectors and circles so it's kind of an old tit for tat if you ask my view
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.240]  this may be a false flag we just haven't seen mounting evidence of it and I
[57:33.240 --> 57:38.760]  think your question is a good one it's just some of the people that are saying
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.640]  hey Alex why aren't you saying Israel did this I don't see the evidence that
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.320]  Israel was behind this event again I don't see the fact that Israel is behind
[57:49.320 --> 57:56.200]  radical Islam they Israel has been caught with some Arabic agents stirring up
[57:56.200 --> 58:01.560]  Muslims in Lebanon and in Israel that came out in the Jerusalem post herettes
[58:01.560 --> 58:10.200]  and it also came out in UPI about 12 years ago headline Israel created fake
[58:10.200 --> 58:17.240]  al-Qaeda groups and had them bomb Israel as a pretext to take freedoms from the
[58:17.240 --> 58:22.600]  press so I don't think it's bad to say Israel could be involved I just don't
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.360]  see evidence of that the fact that Israel has been involved in false flags
[58:26.360 --> 58:31.440]  means that you can say Israel may be involved in this but is Israel involved
[58:31.440 --> 58:35.960]  in most terror attacks not from my experience we'll be right back stay

[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.000]  back to your phone calls right now let's talk to Brandon calling in from FEMA
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.840]  region 3 Brandon you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I'm an X Marine and one
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.240]  thing that I find so laughable about this fraudulent war and tear I didn't I
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.840]  enlist Marine Corps in 2003 after I graduated but that's what you do in
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.560]  the family and I noticed once I came back from Iraq I started noticing it was
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.600]  eight four million the police training that killed terrorists that killed the
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.000]  American people I can't tell you how many countless urban warfare drills we
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.640]  conducted where we were rounding up 9-11 truthers pro-lifers I'm a boy on
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.200]  dear hats it's a total fraud and until I don't see how these people are going to
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.400]  get away with this I really don't sure is here answering the question they're
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.160]  going to flip the police state that supposedly for the radical Muslim threat
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.360]  on to veterans gun owners at 9-11 truthers patriots they're going to flip
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.280]  it on to those of us that know what's going on yeah I mean I've literally seen
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.800]  drills where you have Army Rangers and don't force there and you were they would
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.200]  pick up M-2 40s and mow down 9-11 truthers peaceful protesters patriots
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.520]  exposing the lies well Brandon your phones breaking up and I know they do
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.400]  these type of drills because I've been since some video of it I've talked to
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.320]  countless military people that have been part of it but you really should fly
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:27.800]  down to Austin and we should interview you or others that were part of these
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:34.240]  drills so so tell folks and try to speak right on your telephone so we get
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.520]  this clearly where you would be what you would be doing and and what what
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.320]  response did you guys have when you learn that you were training to take on
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.760]  people that were aware that criminals aided and abetted the terrorists on
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:57.200]  9-11 I'm gonna I'm gonna say this I was time even in Iraq we would get
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.240]  intelligence to go moving end up blowing this poor guys door down it was
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.480]  five nights in a row and it's like look we've been there about four times there's
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.200]  no terrorist and they didn't shut up and do what you're told or you know you're
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.240]  gonna get court-martialed and it's like even the officers will be freaked out
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.640]  when you have people that were probably bare minimum CIA telling them that your
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.320]  troops are gonna go here and hit this house even though he's been there three
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.560]  times and if you don't say anything Colonel you're gonna get court-martialed
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.040]  or killed I mean look what happened to Pat Tillman he wouldn't go along with
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:35.120]  fraud they had to kill him no one stays that's that's what I know but I mean they
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.160]  have these urban warfare drills where they target the political groups they're
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.440]  scared of and they're scared of 9-11 truthers because we expose the criminal
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.800]  elements of our government we're bare minimum protecting the Saudi Arabian
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.840]  attack now that's all come out we're vindicated now you see why the
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.280]  criminals in government are so scared of us because look we're pointing out
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.600]  they're bringing in the Islamic threat again they're doing it all over again
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.200]  Brandon and it's so serious so so let me ask you this what would you guys in
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.080]  these joint exercises with army and the Marines together what would you say or
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:15.480]  think when they were practicing mowing down 9-11 truthers it's like okay this
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.160]  this is wrong this is morally wrong it doesn't matter if you believe that you're
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.760]  bitterly opposed to someone saying a government states care attack government
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.080]  through our history have done every government has been involved in false
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:33.040]  flags in one way or another or shy off and it's I mean the outfit a lot of the
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.920]  special forces guys be totally freaked out about this because I mean these guys
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.080]  these guys are being trained to do things that they know is high trees and
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.480]  they know it's probably punctual by the death penalty well you know they're
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.000]  being watched to see their response they should just act like they love it go
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.080]  along with it and just be embedded inside the occupied government and that's
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.000]  really probably the right thing to do it's all a test for you
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.200]  Obama's plan to fly in hundreds of thousands more migrants from the
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.840]  Middle East hit a snag as governors of more than half of the states said they
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.840]  would not accept them immediately the Washington press corps said governors
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.280]  must follow Obama's executive orders or they're violating the law really 217
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.080]  years ago Thomas Jefferson and others pushed back against the federal government
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.360]  that had exceeded its authority the Kentucky resolution said that the
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.920]  several states composing the United States are not united on the principle of
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.640]  unlimited submission to Washington they repeated the principles of the ninth
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.160]  and tenth amendment that the federal government had been delegated certain
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.080]  definite powers and the rest of the powers were retained by the states and
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.200]  the people and Jefferson warned in the resolution that allowing someone to
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.240]  assume power that wasn't delegated would result in unlimited power Kentucky he
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.920]  said would not submit to unlimited power vested in a man or a body of men it's
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:59.080]  time to take away illegitimate power for worse com I'm David Knight when cells

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.040]  or affected by secret international bodies Lord Christopher Monkton one of
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.880]  the heads of the fastest growing party in Europe and the UK you kept is going to
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:39.400]  be joining us for the balance of the hour and 80 plus percent of UK laws the
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:45.320]  government admits are now made by the unelected EU bureaucracy the EU
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.520]  parliament is only ceremonial and can make recommendations this global
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.960]  governance system is now uncloaking itself because it's now operating in
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:04.160]  plain view it's now going operational the Pope three months ago called for a
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.680]  planetary government a world government with climate change initiatives and
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:15.000]  climate taxes to monitor track and tax and now as Lord Monkton warned us months
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.880]  ago it's been confirmed they want a world court with a world enforcement body
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:27.080]  and even Reuters reported last week open discussions of arresting Americans that
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.320]  don't agree with anthropogenic climate change it's gone from freezing to
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:39.840]  warming to if you don't believe humans make the summer and the winter come you
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.920]  are a terrorist you cannot make this up and we have the 2015 United Nations
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.960]  climate change conference coming up to be held in Paris from November 30th to
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.320]  December 11th the French president two weeks ago announced they would lock
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.000]  down the borders starting in late November to protect the conference but
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.120]  now you've seen the terror attacks their answer is bring in unlimited millions of
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:14.280]  quote migrants from war-torn Syria most of them failed jihadis in the war to
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.920]  topple Assad I want to ask Lord Monkton when he thinks the end game is there as
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.800]  well but this is an epic time to be alive we have a yesterday in a turkey
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.600]  versus Greek football game during the one minute of silence for the dead in
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:37.800]  France last Friday the 13th one minute of changing Allah Akbar and laughing we
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.080]  have our reporters in Paris on the ground getting the exclusive video of the
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.480]  body bag of the suicide bomber woman that blew herself up killing a police dog
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:53.160]  that's on info wars.com as well as the Allah Akbar chanting this is truly
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:59.360]  unprecedented make no mistake Peter Sutherland who helped create the EU who
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.080]  helped sell out iris sovereignty getting them to sign on as well is now the head
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.600]  of the UN body on borders of migration and he has said that we want to get rid
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.680]  of sovereignty and get rid of Europe so they admit this it's so naked why are
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.880]  they so arrogant or is it a con game are they truly in deep trouble is their
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.680]  agenda in trouble I think it's a little bit of both Lord Monkton of course was
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.840]  chief advisor to Margaret Thatcher he's an inventor he's also run major
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.480]  newspapers in the United Kingdom and he heads up the Science and Public Policy
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.800]  Center he also promotes the website what's up with that where many of his
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:45.760]  articles and peer-reviewed journals are published he's had the most read
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.440]  scientific paper western paper in Chinese history published earlier this
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.880]  year on the fraud of man-made climate change published and we now have just
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.720]  giving you a briefing here before he gives us the full briefing Putin has
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.440]  come out saying it's all a fraud and a military program to shut down nation
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.040]  states and impoverished populations China is moving more in that direction so
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.800]  we're having some devastating victories but the plan to implode sovereign
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.120]  nations is only moving faster because they're in trouble and and want to use
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.560]  order out of chaos to bring us to our knees that's my expert analysis in four
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.320]  minutes we'll now get Lord Monkton's break down Christopher Monkton thank you
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.360]  for coming on with us well Alex it's always a pleasure where should we start
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.880]  I threw out about ten different topics there but I know they're all intertwined
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.400]  what is the state I think I think one of the most topical ones obviously is this
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.960]  Paris business the the bombing that happened there and a hundred and fifty
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.520]  odd people killed hundreds more wounded and then as you say at this Greece
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:58.040]  versus Turkey football match the Islamic fans there chanting Allah Akbar
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.840]  almost in a triumphalist way in what was supposed to be a minute silence in
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:08.800]  respect for the souls of the dead who've been killed and this does show what a
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.760]  breakdown of normal civilized communication there is now between the
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.560]  Islamic world and the rest of the world because remember the rest of the world
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.120]  doesn't do this sort of thing something like 95% of all acts of
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.440]  terrorism worldwide over the last quarter of a century have been and are and
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.320]  continue to be in the name of Allah thereby Islamic extremists and the
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.320]  extraordinary thing is how seldom you hear leaders of Islam coming out and
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.160]  saying this is unacceptable even after the latest real outrage in Paris against
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.560]  ordinary innocent civilians the more or less the entire Islamic world had
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.080]  absolutely nothing public to say there was one little group of scholars that
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.840]  said something and one Imam that said something but basically very very little
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:12.640]  was said by the supposedly moderate Islam supporters Muslims to express their
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.320]  disdain for the terrorists who blew these people up now one of the things
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.880]  that we did I think very successfully in dealing with the terrorism in Northern
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.360]  Ireland which was the last big bout of terror that we had in the UK and that
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:32.000]  lasted from about 1969 until roughly the mid 80s when Margaret Thatcher began to
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.600]  get on top of it one of the things that she did was to engage the population and
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.520]  leadership in the south of Ireland on the side of civilization against the
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.080]  terrorists and once it was clear to the IRA terrorists that they no longer had
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.640]  any shred of support either from the Irish government or from the Irish
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.400]  people that is when they imploded and we've got to work the same trick now
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.920]  with Islam we've got to say to the mullahs worldwide every time there is a
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.360]  terrorist act we expect you to get on to your local TV station get into your
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:18.920]  local newspaper get into your pulpit and preach against the terror and if we see
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:24.280]  you doing this and if they see you doing this they who are claiming to act in the
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.560]  name of our life you tell them they're not and that they have no support or
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.520]  comfort from you that will make a big difference I'm afraid we also have to
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:40.400]  point the finger here at Saudi Arabia because through oil funding of the
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:46.360]  Wahhabist very extreme Wahhabist sect they have set up Wahhabist madrasas
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.240]  which are schools for children right across the Islamic crest crescent all
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.720]  the way up through all the stands at the south end of Russia and up to Pakistan
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:00.680]  and right across the the far east as well in places like Singapore and Malaysia
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.680]  which have heavy Islamic populations all the way down through northern to
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.200]  Central Africa again heavy Islamic populations and here these Wahhabist
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.520]  madrasas which are virtually invisible nobody seems to realize they're there
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.880]  but they're there now by their tens of thousands and in those madrasas all they
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:23.640]  learn all day for five or six years is how to recite bits out of the Quran and
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.640]  how to hate the West and this is a serious problem the the kids who go to
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.680]  these madrasas are not getting any of the education in civilization which from
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.160]  the 9th to 12th centuries made Islam the center of the world's learning if you
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.760]  went to Damascus or Baghdad from the 9th to the 12th centuries there were no dark
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:48.560]  ages there as they were in Christian Europe there civilization and scholarship
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.280]  flourished by the way let me stop you there because I get criticized when I
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.200]  point out history you're a scholar of history I enjoy learning history as well
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:02.400]  you're right Islam during some periods was actually very scientific not warlike
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.160]  and very advanced and then it goes into other periods where it's completely
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:12.800]  barbarous and so there have been periods where the Middle East was a light in the
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.080]  world how could we get back to that that of course is the absolutely correct
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.480]  question and I think we have missed one or two tricks let me give you an example
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.640]  you remember the Charlie Hebdo episode again in Paris just in January of this
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:35.400]  year when 19 journalists doing bad cartoons were shot up by a pair of
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.000]  Islamic brothers again hollering Allah who act bars they went in with their
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.680]  machine guns and mode everybody down indiscriminately and of course there
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.520]  was rightly outrage at that but we did two things wrong in response to that
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.000]  first of all we should have got together all the newspaper editors should have
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.720]  got together and agreed that they would all print one each of these cartoons so
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.200]  as to say to the terrorists now that you've done this you have spread the
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.160]  cartoons rather than shutting them down in fact the opposite happened nobody
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.640]  would print the cartoons and even Charlie Hebdo itself said well we can't go on
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.480]  drawing wouldn't let us share him we tried to put it out and who wouldn't let
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.720]  you Facebook wouldn't let us share him we tried to and not because we want to
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.160]  ask people's religion that is the problem you see we are being craven in the
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.880]  face of terror and that is always a mistake it simply encourages the terror
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.400]  if you do that and in Britain we had the same problem because the police were
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.480]  going around interviewing news agents where people have been trying to buy
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.200]  copies of Charlie Hebdo asking for the names and the dresses of the people who
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.080]  wanted to buy copies of Charlie Hebdo that was completely the wrong response
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.120]  but the other thing we got wrong and this if there are any any of our Muslim
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.760]  brothers and sisters listening to this let me say something that I think you
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.720]  would like me to say and it's right that I should say it I said this actually
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.960]  when I was preaching to the undergraduates in Churchill College Chapel at
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.640]  Cambridge just two weeks ago and I said to them look the other trick we missed
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.720]  when the Charlie Hebdo thing happened is we didn't point out as we should have
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.800]  done that some of those cartoons one or two of them they weren't just bad they
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.720]  were gratuitously offensive they were deliberately maliciously evil they were
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.080]  really really nasty cartoons and they should not have been printed because
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.720]  it was so pornographic because they were they were it was it was combining
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.560]  pornography with insult to the deeply held beliefs of Muslims and that is not
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.200]  appropriate in any civilized I think that shouldn't be in a free newspaper put
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.000]  on newsstands I know that stay right there Lord Moncton I want to ask you
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.120]  what is the West thinking bringing in millions of radical Muslims when they
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.440]  know they're going to end up engaging in terror attacks how does the political

[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:30.280]  will take some of your phone calls towards the end of Lord Monkton's
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.560]  interview with us this huge UN summit openly to cement world government is
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.600]  coming up we have exposed these conferences before we have forced the
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.680]  mainstream media to cover it and things like the Copenhagen Treaty and the
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:51.000]  Danish text and things like that have been shot down in the past they tried to
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.240]  keep Lord Monkton out of the conferences he's had to famously parachute in this
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.000]  time I'm told he's going to be part of the conference so we'll speak about that
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.640]  in the next segment but all of this is interconnected Lord Monkton finishing up
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:09.920]  on the situation in Paris millions of Islamists is coming in from areas just
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.840]  chopful of suicide bombers and radicals we've already seen military bases
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.640]  attacked here recruiting centers our media says it's not Islamic when it is
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:27.320]  what is the rationale what is the in-game of Merkel and Hollande and Obama what
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.920]  are they thinking I don't think they are thinking that's the truth of it I mean
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.680]  just finishing off on that previous point what we should do is have a blasphemy
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.200]  law as we always did in the past and that was actually a sensible law it
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.840]  wasn't to deprive people of the freedom to speak against other people's
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.680]  religion but it did stop them from being gratuitously offensive to the point
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.920]  where somebody might want to turn violent that was the reason for it and
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:57.000]  we need to rethink that but now on what to do about all these migrants this is a
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.520]  huge problem in Europe at the moment of course it's going to be a huge problem
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.800]  in America if Obama does try to order the state about by executive order he
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.160]  will be as you rightly pointed out in your splendid introduction exceeding his
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.800]  powers under the Kentucky provision if he tries to do that and so I hope that
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.760]  the governors of those states who are being robust will continue to be robust
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.520]  stand firm and admittedly they would now eventually end up in the Supreme Court
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.520]  which of course is has become a bit of a joke it's now got people on it who
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.240]  really in no sense are qualified to be judges that are appointed by Obama and
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.880]  so as the outcome there is likely to be dire in the end I think that what the
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.000]  left have got to worry about and worry about big time in the United States is
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.240]  the Republicans getting the trifecta and holding on to both houses of Congress
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.160]  in the 2016 election and winning the White House because at last the
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.240]  Republicans have really quite a number of very credible candidates for the
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.240]  White House which they didn't have in the last two election and so it could be
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:08.360]  that the Republicans take all three in which case I hope the GOP will get up
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.840]  and running on this because all they've got to do now is just slow Obama down
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.880]  and stop this they want a picture now of the tide of refugees pouring into
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.160]  Europe and why has that happened because Europe abandoned the idea of policing
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.480]  its borders with its fellow European states only Britain partly thanks to the
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.760]  existence of the English Channel and partly thanks to conservative members
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.280]  of Parliament and of course now you get members of Parliament who have resisted
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.400]  the idea of allowing our borders to be dismantled we have retained some sort
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.800]  of border control but even then they're getting in by the hundreds of thousands
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.560]  every year even into the UK and there's no doubt that our systems can't cope
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.960]  we are all dangerously near to national level bankruptcy because the
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.600]  governments have been borrowing too much isn't that the Cloward and Piven in game
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.080]  is just bringing in as many people as you can bankrupt the system in a total
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:14.040]  socialism I think there is a very large element of let's give up and let us
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.840]  force totalitarianism on the people by making any other option just seem so
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.200]  dreadful so that they beg to have so-called security which in effect means
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.120]  losing their freedom and that I'm sure is the totalitarian game because one of
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.720]  the things that is interesting is that the left which is the modern-day
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.520]  expression of totalitarianism the national socialists in Germany followed
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.880]  by the communist socialists now the environmentalist socialists these are
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.960]  the three main groups of socialism they have all killed tens of millions the
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.880]  environmentalist socialists after all had the ban on DDT put in place when it
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.240]  was just on the point of extinguishing malaria from the world and the numbers
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.320]  of people who were dying of malaria had been reduced to 50,000 a year worldwide
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.080]  it's now closer to a million a year it's been like that for the 40 years of us
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.760]  they they banned DDT so that the environmental left have got blood on
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.000]  their hands just as much as the Nazis and the communists who were their
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.160]  predecessors had on their hands and there is no doubt that the alliance and
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.440]  it's becoming a more and more explicit alliance between the hard back and
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:28.840]  Islam is very very dangerous you're right a sickening alliance between the
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.920]  hard left that wants to wreck the last and radicalism that wants to wreck
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:38.640]  it in their shared hatred they are brothers Lord Mark you we've got to go

[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.680]  global treaty yeah here is a clip of Putin not just the article where a few
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.600]  days ago he said a lot of the G20 countries being attacked by terrorists
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.720]  have actually been involved supporting ISIS let's go to that clip the
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.480]  reporter asked Putin as far as I understand one of the central themes
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:02.560]  during the summit has become the fight against terrorism and it is evident that
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.600]  we cannot have an effective war on terrorism without the fight against the
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.480]  ones who finance the terrorist has there been any discussion during the summit of
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.480]  any specific ways to do so what were the points of the discussion and were there
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:26.760]  any decisions reached yes of course this was one of the key subjects the
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.720]  war on terrorism
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.680]  what the solution for the people here in Paris and especially after the tragic
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.320]  events of hostage taking and deaths of people in Paris and of course we all
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.120]  understand and spoke about this that it is necessary to cut the finance routes
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:52.600]  to terrorist organizations I provided examples based on our data on the
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:57.960]  financing of different Islamic State units by private individuals this money
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:03.360]  as we have established comes from 40 countries and there are some of the G20
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:10.280]  members among them all right now that's more truth from Putin again I'm not some
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.720]  Russia worshiper here but he's attacking ISIS he's saying global warming is a
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:18.480]  concerted fraud to bankrupt nation-states and impoverish people and
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.560]  selectively enforce feudalism to read his full quotes it sounds like he's been
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.080]  listening to Lord Monkton how big a deal is it to have Vladimir Putin come out
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.040]  when he's gonna be one of the main people at this UN conference that starts
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.320]  in 12 days in Paris how big a deal is that Lord Monkton I don't think one can
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:43.880]  really underestimate the significance of this it's very very important and I'll
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:51.040]  tell you a bit of history back in 2004 Putin asked one of his scientific
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.720]  advisors that is chief scientific advisor at the time Dr. Andrei Ildarionov
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:01.080]  whom I know whether global warming was a problem or not and could he please
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:07.560]  find out by holding an international conference of experts at the Kremlin so
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:14.160]  what did he look around the world and he found the country throughout the
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.080]  world that was the most true believing country in this whole rubbish as far as
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.440]  the governing class was concerned and that country of course was the United
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.840]  Kingdom and so he invited Sir David King then the government's chief scientist
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:33.280]  and now it's chief negotiator at the Paris summit on the climate question and
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.160]  in fact I was in Cambridge yesterday to hear Sir David King give a talk at the
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.040]  mathematics department and a lot of rubbish he talked as well but what was
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:48.760]  significant about this 2004 conference was that Ildarionov also invited
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.960]  skeptics now at that time he didn't know of me and I wasn't really a skeptic at
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.520]  that time I hadn't looked at the science and when I did I became a skeptic but he
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:03.680]  invited noted skeptics from all around the world and when Sir David King arrived
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:10.120]  at Sheromitebo Airport and he found various skeptics getting off planes from
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.560]  all over the place and heading off to the government cars he turned around and
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.320]  tried to get back into the British plane and go back to the UK because he is
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.000]  entirely incapable of debating this issue I know because I've debated it with
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.960]  him before and his blood was all over the floor at the end of it and so he was
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.840]  pretty much arrested by the FSB and made to go to the Kremlin where he was made
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:39.000]  to give his presentation and towards the end of it Dr Roy Spencer who keeps the
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.040]  satellite temperature records that show no global warming now for 18 years 6
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.200]  months 18 years 9 months got up and said over heaven's sakes of David you're
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.080]  talking complete rubbish about this particular point the facts are as
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:56.040]  follows and King who is completely incapable of taking any criticism or
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.640]  arguing any point on climate science because he doesn't know any he knows
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.680]  the party line but that's all he knows flunked out and the FSB made to stop him
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:09.560]  and Ilarianov went up to the lectern and just waved them aside and said no let
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:14.000]  him go because Sir David King has disgraced the name of Britain disgraced
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.200]  the name of science disgraced the name of King and disgraced the name of
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.960]  knighthood he said one thing he has done though is he has told us just what
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:27.440]  rubbish the official case in support of the global warming alarm is and the view
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.640]  that I think the Russian Academy of Sciences will take is a skeptical one
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.080]  because the skeptics here have been willing to put their point forward in
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.440]  debate willing to be challenged by the other side and admit those challenges
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.560]  well now I know this happened because I have spoken to Ilarianov himself about
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:49.680]  it as well as to several others who were there and six months later Putin told
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.480]  Ilarianov that the Russian Academy must change its mind on this question because
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:00.480]  he had done a deal with Tony Blair again in Britain by which Tony Blair would get
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:06.240]  Russia most favored nation status at the World Trade Organization allowing tariff
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.720]  walls to come tumbling down and Russia to trade more freely with the rest of the
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:15.360]  world provided that Russia changed its tune and gave in to Tony Blair on the
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.640]  global warming question and the significance of Putin now realizing he
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.400]  can no longer maintain that agreement he reached with Tony Blair is that Putin
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:30.400]  who is very hard-headed and very clear about what Russia's interest is and
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:37.360]  isn't has now realized that he has less of an interest in selling overpriced gas
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.120]  via the pipelines into Europe at four times the world price which he does at
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.440]  the moment he has less of an interest in maintaining that than in stopping the
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:51.680]  worldwide economic damage that is being done by this ludicrous global warming
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.120]  nonsense so I think it's extremely healthy and very encouraging that at last
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.400]  the leader of a major nation has come out openly and said look folks this is
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:10.120]  rubbish I hate to say it but on so many fronts Russia is heroically fighting
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.640]  ISIS for real Russia is exposing global carbon taxes as an enslavement
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:21.560]  mechanism a military economic takeover Russia is trying to deploy all sorts of
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.080]  new technologies the third world I mean I know Russia's been through the whole
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.840]  Marxist nightmare for 80 years and now is trying to struggle out of it but
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.560]  you're a well-traveled man and all over the world in your analysis what is the
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.840]  power makeup of the world we know it's been the Anglo-americans establishment
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.080]  the UK the US with Europe kind of in the middle Russia and China but now if you
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:48.800]  pull back what would you say if it's a unipolar a bipolar a tripolar what is
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.640]  the makeup of the world or is it or is a collectivist on one end and free
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.560]  marketers on the other go ahead the the central divide in politics which was
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.320]  first meditated by the Chinese philosophers in the early Chinese
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.360]  empire the time of Confucius was indeed between the libertarians and the
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.600]  totalitarians the division that you yourself have just spoken of and that
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.400]  remains the division today but when you get something like Putin coming along
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.720]  what he does is to do what the old foreign office hand who taught me geo
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:25.680]  politics a wonderful man called Tom Greenwell who was the chief leader writer
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.360]  of the auction person I was his deputy we would go drinking together and he would
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.160]  teach me all this he said the first duty of anyone in the foreign office is to
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.200]  uphold the national interest of Britain and ask the question what's in it for us
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.240]  now Putin in every one of the things you've just described that he does is
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:48.480]  upholding Russia's national interest which in many respects coincides with the
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.840]  global interest though it doesn't coincide with the global totalitarian
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.960]  interest and this is very interesting so they're not going along with the
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:01.800]  parasitic centralized crony capitalist centralized fraud system so it's good for
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.480]  Russia's good for the rest of the world as well that's right because Russia
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:12.040]  curiously through an authoritarian and very vigorous president is actually
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.360]  becoming libertarian in the policies that it follows because it has suddenly
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.640]  discovered that libertarianism is more in its interest than totalitarianism and
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.480]  of course this is also true in the United States it's also true in Britain
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:30.080]  that it would be in our interest to be libertarian but the press politic of
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.240]  the governing class in certainly in Britain the Conservative Party is now
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.200]  a totalitarian party it's no longer a libertarian party
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:41.560]  UKIP has replaced it as the libertarian party and then you have in the United
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.720]  States half of the Republican Party is like the Conservative Party in Britain
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.840]  it is totalitarian and it goes along with the left like we call this the
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.440]  baner faction if you like but now you've got Ryan as a slightly more vigorous
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.920]  speaker I'm hoping that the Republicans will clear out the nest of rhinos in the
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.120]  Republican National Committee this is where a lot of the trouble comes from and
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.640]  put a few tea parties in there to ginger it up a bit and then I think we can
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.120]  start see libertarianism taking over once again and a new renaissance so let's
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:17.720]  shift gears then you don't brag but it's true our are more involved even more
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.760]  than Senator Inhofe and and others they demonize and openly call for arresting
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:28.360]  now even in US newspapers in sabotaging with the truth infiltrating getting the
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:32.680]  inside scoops on these treaties that they want to ratify in secret before
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:38.360]  rolling out against us you have literally been the Obi-Wan Kenobi sneaking on
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.520]  board the Death Star at least six times I know of and blowing it up before it's
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:47.880]  operational now you've said this latest global conference starting in 12 days in
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.000]  Paris is the worst ever this is really they're coming out of the closet they're
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.640]  open announcement of world government open announcement of climate courts to
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:02.880]  prosecute yourself and me and others so how do we get you on board this I mean
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.680]  I guess they would have wanted you on board the Death Star this time but but
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.920]  what are we facing no they won't want to let me in but they're not going to be
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:14.760]  able to keep me out as they will discover but the point is this that yes
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.720]  this is they are going to try to use the national and international courts as
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:26.080]  their means of enforcing totalitarianism worldwide in the name of the climate but
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:32.360]  what is fascinating is that even the UK so-called Supreme Court which used to be
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.280]  the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords now it's got its own separate
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.840]  building just across from parliament and it calls itself the Supreme Court they
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:47.240]  had a climate propaganda hate the skeptics meeting in September and I have
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.920]  just today had an answer from the Supreme Court to my freedom of information
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.400]  questions about it and the answer is rather not to my surprise that they're
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.080]  not going to tell me very much unless I force them to which I am going to do
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.400]  because they breach the law by not replying to me in time so here we've
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.440]  got the highest court in the land in Britain broke the law because it didn't
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.880]  reply to my freedom of information request within the statutory limit but
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.640]  this propaganda event was very much intended to be tied in with Paris to
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.400]  tied in with the idea of an international climate court and there was a
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:26.240]  speaker there called Philippe Sands QC a leading barrister leading lawyer in
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.880]  London and he came out either lefty of course he came out and said that
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:37.280]  intelligent rational informed skeptics who write in the scientific journals
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:43.600]  should be put on trial and their claims should be scotched by the courts and
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.800]  this meeting was held in courtroom number one and it was broadcast that was
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.200]  the astonishing that's how I knew about it it was broadcast and of course this
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.120]  means the Supreme Court now can't hear any climate change related cases at all
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:01.800]  because it has declared a prejudice in that direction there was a Supreme
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.880]  Court justice who chaired the session and congratulated Philippe Sands on his
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.520]  speech after he had said these outrageous things and of course as you
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.320]  were also rightly said that we are sabotaging them with the truth but they
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.360]  are determined to lock us up and execute as if they possibly that's right in fact
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.880]  when we come back I'll show the Reuters article and there was one also out of
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.000]  Rasmussen reports.net where they said America you in America it's not
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.760]  popular to lock up the skeptics but they had a large percentage of Democrats
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:37.160]  want us arrested I mean what's sickening to totalitarians by the way I'm gonna
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.600]  show them something for TV viewers they don't like vampires don't like it the
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.840]  UN voted as you know five years ago to say the Sun has nothing to do with
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.560]  climate well we're gonna put the Sun up behind me when we come back because it
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.120]  is the main driver of climate and it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:58.160]  matter what they push it is the main driver so there it is look at it that's
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.040]  a fact there are hundreds of silver products on the market today but there's
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.860]  nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented one

[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.640]  Rob and Jeremy and Jason and Bryant and Mike appreciate you holding then at the
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:20.920]  bottom of the hour Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman in FullWars.com reporters will
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.000]  join us with more updates they were already at the scene of the terrorist
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.560]  blowing themselves up in Paris today and got the exclusive video and photos of
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.640]  them being put in body bags and they are reportedly being followed right now by
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.120]  jihadis and Biggs is saying he's more concerned in Paris than he's been in
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:43.120]  places like Afghanistan Biggs was blown up twice in armored vehicles it was
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.160]  shrapnel another time and shot another time and of course that was covered by
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.800]  Rolling Stone magazine and Esquire both did profiles with him in them that's the
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:57.280]  kind of combat units he was in so a lot of craziness going on there with whole
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.440]  no-go areas in Paris and in Brussels Belgium where they come up to Wessers
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:08.000]  and say get out you try to walk in a convenience store they go get out I mean
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.040]  this is the tolerance of the left and Lord Moncton I want to go to these calls
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.400]  but to discuss the mental illness of the control left they're not even leftist
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.360]  Thomas Jefferson was a leftist in my view they literally hate the West like
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.840]  their parents so much that they're like bringing hoodlums in to strangle their
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.760]  mother and father in their beds because they feel like that's a coming of age I
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:34.000]  mean I really think it is a mental illness that they're destroying the
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.160]  nest that made them so powerful they want to shut off our industry they want
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.080]  to break up our families they want to bring in groups that absolutely hate our
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.040]  culture I mean these really are mentally ill people who I guess would come to the
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.600]  Christmas party and you know overturn the table for fun I mean they just seem
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.760]  like Grenches very interesting at the meeting a couple of days ago at the
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.720]  Cambridge mathematics department which I attended with fascination to hear the
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:07.520]  professor of physics two other eminent professors there and then David King it
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.160]  was very interesting watching and listening to the audience but they were
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.240]  of course very nearly all left-wing because virtually everybody in academia
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.120]  from the students to the professors is left-wing they vote left they live off
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:26.000]  the state they live off the taxpayer and at one point I mentioned in a very
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.920]  mild way that the difference between the ozone hole problem and the global
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.120]  warming problem is the ozone hole problem had more or less got the science
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.880]  right it had exaggerated it a bit and basically got it right whereas in the
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.040]  global warming they've simply got a lot of the science wrong and therefore the
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:47.040]  science isn't settled and there were kind of murmurs of fury from all around
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.640]  the room they were too polite to shriek out in in the loud way that some
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.640]  audiences were this was Cambridge after all my own alma mater but it was very
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:57:00.000]  interesting the automatic instinctive going along with the party line without
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.720]  having the faintest idea whether the party line had any scientific
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.960]  justification or not and this is a feature of the left they get every
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.760]  decision wrong what you've just said is quite right they got the DDT thing
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:17.120]  completely or every environmental scare they dream up they're basically wrong
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.640]  about it here they are trying to cold close down coal-fired power stations our
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:25.720]  own mad climate change secretary here as announced there will be no more coal
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.240]  power stations operating in Britain within 10 years of now an entire industry
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.960]  that my whole country was built on coal look at all your famous statesman
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:40.600]  pointing that out that the modern UK was built on coal built on coal and
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:44.640]  surrounded by fish we've now shut down the coal and we've allowed the EU to
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.200]  destroy all the fish I mean it it's just unbelievable the self-destructive
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.320]  instincts of the left because of course in destroying our civilization they
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:59.240]  destroy themselves as well so it's it is silly it's very sad Lord Martin stay
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.440]  there we gotta start the next hour we've got to start the next hour but I
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.720]  just want to go out with a clip from Dartmouth College two days ago with
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.480]  people in the study hall being screamed at and flipped off because they're white
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.880]  the same mental illness we're gonna go out to break with this come back with
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:34.920]  your phone call stay with us total disconnect with reality third hour

[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.280]  it's a war zone you know let's Saudi Arabia take them they haven't taken one
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.400]  person Lord Moncton what do you make a Saudi Arabia lobbying us to take all
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.520]  these refugees offering to build 200 madrasas in Europe this year alone I
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:46.840]  mean we're just Saudi Arabia is an aggressive imperialist force well the
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.640]  danger that if they're not taking very many themselves they're pushing them
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.360]  all in our direction because they know that these people are trouble and of
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.080]  course the idea of them setting up madrasas these are going to be Wahhabist
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.640]  madrasas these are going to be preaching terror and revolution that's the
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:08.240]  trouble and we must not import any more Saudi Arabian extremist Islamic
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.960]  ideology into the West it's got to stop and we've also got to start liberating
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:18.440]  the countries of the Muslim world from this hideous Wahhabist sect which is
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.720]  very extreme and it really really lies at the root of where this terrorism comes
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:27.760]  from well sir I mean the left loves to call imperialist this imperialist that
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:33.440]  but isn't Saudi Arabia haunts showing the 79% Sunnis many of which are good
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:38.680]  people trying to command them an imperialist fashion to basically be the
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:43.480]  vanguard of a type of religious imperialism well of course the the word
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.640]  for it is jihad it's a violent religious imperialism and Saudi Arabia is
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.680]  playing quite a dangerous double game game in the one hand a cozying up to the
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:56.040]  West or is it the West cozying up to Saudi Arabia because it's so rich I can
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.760]  never work at work out which it is and on the other spreading this terror via
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:09.640]  the Wahhabist madrasas which don't give anything like a recognizable wide and
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.360]  liberal education liberal in the sense of the old-fashioned not not the left-wing
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.640]  sense of the term liberal in the sense of you learn a little bit about
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.680]  everything you have a wide and properly broad education they don't get that in
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.880]  these Wahhabist madrasas and and so to import those into into Western nations
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.000]  would be a huge mistake and we must try to make sure that that does not happen
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.960]  sure we must try to make sure that in those that may have already been
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:39.240]  established the educational rules of each of our countries are followed so that
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.320]  they do offer something recognizably as a broad national career there I mean
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.320]  these should not be accredited in any way you're absolutely right well if you
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.000]  look at the wild-eyedness of any I don't care if they're white Arabic black that
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.320]  goes with these schools they come out looking like Charlie Manson they've
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.600]  been put through cult programming they're totally wild-eyed it's dangerous
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  Rob we're going to break in one minute more calls in the next long segment but
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.920]  comment to what Lord Monkson just said yeah I just agree absolutely what he
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.720]  said and you know one of his people aren't going to be privy to this as Joe
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.920]  Biggs stated earlier they're not going to be made privy to until they come over
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.240]  here and start spraying a bunch of people and it's going to take a major major
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:25.800]  act there's some kind of big all-out war these four people are going to open our
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.680]  eyes to it people need to wake up you know people got their head in the
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:34.600]  sands to drink in the Kool-Aid and we just need more people like that you
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.360]  Alex and Joe Biggs and Paul Lawson's we need them out there well thank you sir
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.840]  we're just doing our job but we're gonna come back with Lord Monk and I know
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:46.920]  this they arrested 69 jihadis today in the US alone that they believe we're
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.120]  about to launch ISIS sponsored attacks that's only happening because Obama's
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.560]  flooding us with it with these immigrants he wants to roll up terror
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.080]  networks so he doesn't get embarrassed they already knew they were there
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.120]  Obama's plan to fly in hundreds of thousands more migrants from the
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.760]  Middle East hit a snag as governors of more than half of the states said they
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.760]  would not accept them immediately the Washington press corps said governors
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:16.200]  must follow Obama's executive orders or they're violating the law really 217
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.960]  years ago Thomas Jefferson and others push back against a federal government
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:23.280]  that had exceeded its authority the Kentucky resolution said that the
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.840]  several states composing the United States are not united on the principle of
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:31.560]  unlimited submission to Washington they repeated the principles of the 9th
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:35.080]  and 10th amendment that the federal government had been delegated certain
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:39.000]  definite powers and the rest of the powers were retained by the states and
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.080]  the people and Jefferson warned in the resolution that allowing someone to
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.120]  assume power that wasn't delegated would result in unlimited power Kentucky he
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:53.800]  said would not submit to unlimited power vested in a man or a body of men it's

[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:20.600]  side you're listening to Alex Jones we've got articles coming up for Lord
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.720]  Moncton leaves us Americans are rushing to buy guns in record numbers we have
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:30.560]  Democrats actually coming out and saying that we should take the guns away
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:35.400]  because of Paris we've got a clip of that coming up from C-span and before
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.000]  Lord Moncton leaves us Christopher Moncton of the science and public policy
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.080]  Institute joins us before we leave today I'm gonna get into these articles
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.800]  Rasmussen little support for punishing global warming foes now you'd think
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:58.520]  that's positive oh there's little support and then it says 68% of likely voters
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.880]  oppose the government investigating and prosecuting scientists and others
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.640]  including major corporations who question global warming I mean imagine
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:15.400]  that they're just introducing the idea of arresting us and calling for it and
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.720]  that ties in with this article all over the country they have new
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:24.720]  interpretations of wetlands streams and rivers claiming up to five miles on
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:30.040]  either side of a creek or river and the feds are taking it the BLM is in Texas
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:34.760]  on the Red River with Oklahoma taking tens of thousands of acres homes you
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:43.240]  name it in some cases owned for over 100 years from ranchers and farmers the
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:47.400]  feds already have half the country I mean this is just crazy this is criminal
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.480]  let's go to phone calls for Lord Moncton I'll get his take on both those before he
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:56.280]  leaves us Jeremy and Kansas thanks for holding her on the year yes Alex thank
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.160]  you I called in with a larger critique of what I perceive as the direction that
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.760]  your operation is headed heading in specifically around Paris and what I
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:11.240]  see is the danger of falling into becoming a weaponized cultural fascist
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:16.640]  counterpart to the weaponized cultural Marxism on fake left but I do want to
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.000]  deal with the Lord Moncton main issue here in terms of I think that we need
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.040]  to transcend the entire debate about the role of carbon in the atmosphere by
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:33.320]  looking at two very plain facts one has to do with the weaponization of geo
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.600]  engineering that could really be served by covering more deeply the work of
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:43.040]  Michael J. Murphy and then Wigington and then the other one is that we would have
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.760]  actually we in the West would have been headed away from extractive fuels almost
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:56.720]  a century ago by you know people such as the farmers who were learning how to
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:02.640]  grow carbon neutral alcohol and build cars out of plant-based plastics and so
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.200]  people should know here's the deal here's the deal I think carbon's good
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.080]  we're a carbon-based life form that the planet's carbon starved from the
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.800]  metrics I've seen going back millions of years and so regardless they want carbon
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.440]  taxes and regulations and I'll come back to you after Moncton's gone to hear
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.240]  your fascist critique of the show I want to hear this but but here's what I do I
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:26.360]  oppose whatever the globalist erupt to she can call it fascist call it whatever
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.480]  you want I don't want totally open borders and I don't want to shut down
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.080]  all the coal power plants I mean I don't want to commit suicide Lord Moncton do
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:39.600]  you want to respond to what I do let's be very very clear about this one should
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:45.160]  take decisions on scientific questions in a scientific and not in a political
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:51.080]  way and the fact is that the science around alarm about global warming has
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:58.040]  completely collapsed there's been 18 years and nine months with a zero trend
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:01.720]  in global warming you have to go back further than that to get any trend at
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:05.400]  all and then not very much there's really been no significant warming for a
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:10.880]  quarter of a century let and in that quarter of a century getting on for half
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:16.480]  of man's entire emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases since 1750 have
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.720]  been emitted and the and the temperature has hardly responded but what about the
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:26.080]  UN vote to counter you and others and a bunch of astrophysicists that went
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.080]  public saying the Sun is the cycle we went into warming now we've been
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:35.720]  cooling for 18 years because of it I mean it's the Sun and then they have a
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:40.080]  vote and say the Sun isn't the main driver of climate in fact they say it
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.880]  doesn't affect it they're totally discredited right there well of course
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  they are and I see that you've got a picture of the Sun behind you and for
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:50.080]  those who think you always are somewhere on the edge of outer space Alex it
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:58.440]  looks as though you are floating very close to the Sun but to get back to
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:02.040]  Jeremy's point the fact is one must take scientific and scientifically let me
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.160]  tell you some of the problems very briefly with the official science thing
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:12.440]  number one is that actually if you use mainstream methods we would only expect
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:19.720]  to see half a Celsius degree of warming by 2100 is that a problem no of course
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:24.200]  it isn't so they've tried to conceal the fact that that is what their own data
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:29.360]  methods models and results show they've lied about and that's what cut numbers
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.640]  hiding with the client that this is a different fraud it is the central fraud
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:39.440]  where they they know that their own methods however wrong they are say I
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:42.960]  say to them that's only going to be about half a Celsius degree of warming to
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.480]  2100 and they say oh it's going to be 2.2 or it might even before nonsense
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:50.720]  they know it's only going to be half degree on their own methods but their
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:57.760]  own methods still exaggerate because it's just been discovered that the effect
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:05.840]  of CO2 on the climate has been overstated in all the models by 40% it's
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.160]  also been discovered that the so-called temperature feedbacks that multiply the
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:16.120]  effect of CO2 on temperature by about three in the original models they've
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:19.680]  already cut that down to multiplying it by only two in the current generation
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:23.880]  of model and that usually cuts back on the amount of warming we'd expect but
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:28.320]  now professor Ray Bates who made an excellent speech on this in Moscow
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:33.280]  quite recently again one of the influences on beauty has said that climate
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:36.640]  sensitivity which is the amount of warming you get if you double the CO2 in
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.640]  the atmosphere is not going to be three or four Celsius degrees it's going to be
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:45.680]  naught point three to naught point four now this is a person who when I debated
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:49.600]  against him on the subject of the climate three years ago he was a true
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:53.760]  believer putting out the official line so they're losing ground let's go to some
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:57.320]  more calls Jeremy I'll put you on hold I'll come back to you after Monk is gone
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:02.200]  since you want to get into the fact that I'm countering the terror overseas and
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:06.400]  saying it's real I'm saying it's real because it's not manufactured 9-11's
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.760]  been proven correct that Saudi Arabia was involved our government ordered to
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:12.640]  stand down I've had the members of Congress on that have seen the secret
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:16.560]  documents they let the attacks take place to take our liberties and to attack
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.880]  Iraq that did nothing okay I've been proven right now the difference is this
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:27.440]  is a real Islamic invasion and I'm opposing it I'm also opposing taking our
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.760]  liberties to counter it okay they want to bring them in have the class of
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.880]  civilizations I don't want to have that I don't want to bomb Muslim countries
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.480]  either okay you know they can be there they can have hoods on their heads they
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:43.520]  can mutilate their daughters they can kill each other and throw sticks at each
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.400]  other all day if they want to I don't want to do that I want to build space
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:50.800]  bases I want life extension technologies I want my daughters to be free I want the
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:55.120]  fascist left off my back Jason in Florida you're on the air go ahead with
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:16:00.440]  Lord Monkton yeah thank thank you Alex and thank you for your team the reason
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:06.200]  why I'm calling is basically I want the people to understand like I don't know if
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:11.480]  you saw the clip today with Josh Ernest was on Fox News and they asked him
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:15.080]  questions about you know the betting for the refugees that are coming in and you
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:19.600]  know he basically stated that the you know the betting is extremely rigorous
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:25.120]  and he used you know the names like the CIA and the FBI
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:30.960]  yeah well the eyes come out and said they're not vetting them so there you go well yeah you know
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:35.680]  numbers are too great to allow them to vet them properly and the mistake they
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.880]  made as Tony Abbott the recently the prime minister of Australia said in a
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:45.160]  recent visit to Europe is they should not let any of them in until they have
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:50.320]  done proper and very detailed checks and then they should only let them in if it
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.400]  is very clear that they are likely to be genuine right you get vetted in your
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.920]  country of origin not at the country you're coming to
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:01.720]  precisely and and that if they try to cross our borders they will be dealt
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:08.000]  with very very firmly and put back where they came from and because we didn't do
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.120]  that and we acted wet at the outset it's signal the flight that is that every
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:16.240]  young man of ambition who wanted to make a bit of money for himself and his
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:21.160]  family got on the boat and came to Europe because they see Europe as the
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:24.280]  streets paved with gold not all of them are terrorists I should think actually
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:28.960]  only minority of them are but they are all or very nearly all economic migrants
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:33.160]  otherwise you'd get families you'd get babushkas you'd get grandmas you'd get
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:38.040]  little kids you get a mixture of people coming instead they're all young men in
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:42.040]  their 20 said Jason you're absolutely right I mean we got Paul Ryan all of
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:46.120]  lying to us saying they're being vetted the FBI started doing some vetting and
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:51.400]  arrested 69 people for terrorism that's it they're not they're not vetting them
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.000]  we know that a lot of the passports of bogus they're going through the most
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.200]  rudimentary checks and they don't have any means of keeping tabs on them once
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:01.680]  they've let them in and that's the thing once you're in you can do what you
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:05.200]  like nobody keeps an eye on you that's right to make sure but you are settling
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.760]  down properly and not planning jihad and this kind of failure of the security
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:13.640]  forces to appreciate the scale on which this could happen once in particular
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.960]  Europe had taken down its borders and then you have Obama being soft as he
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:20.920]  always has been on immigration left are always soft on immigration because the
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:25.680]  first two generations of immigrants vote left that's why the left always do this
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.680]  and that's why when the Republicans come back in they are going to have to have
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:33.920]  a very busy agenda one of the items on that that agenda is that all the borders
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:37.400]  should be tightened up the border with Mexico the borders yeah we've already
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.040]  taken on too many we've got to absorb these deprogram them from their Ford
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:45.200]  Foundation garbage Jason do you have anything else you wanted to add yeah
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:48.800]  well my point basically was like you know you know that he talks about the
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:54.040]  biometric system and I've vetted refugees from Syria I've vetted refugees
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:58.160]  from Iraq and Afghanistan and the system that they use is called the bats and
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.360]  hides system and the bats and hides system basically doesn't even work I
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.960]  mean they can't even vet Americans you know when when when when you're going
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.460]  for you know I'm a veteran from United States Marine Corps and after the Marine
[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:12.800]  Corps I became a contractor and I was a defense contractor for Department of
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.680]  Defense Department of State and we did we did all the vetting for you know
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:21.200]  displaced Iraqis and and Afghanis everything and when we as Americans are
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:26.480]  signing SF-86 and doing a you know a 20-page background report that goes
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.880]  back 10 and 20 years exactly it's impossible to do it's impossible to do
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:34.560]  this for these Syrians especially when there's nobody to even look at from where
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.920]  they're coming from because they're all displaced it's totally it's impossible
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:42.760]  well I'm going to add that and great points sir and you should shoot a video
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:45.280]  about it you should write an article about it we should do a story about it
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:49.240]  because absolutely I mean to get a driver's license they put you through a
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:54.160]  big database and you've lived here your whole life. Jason can I say how very nice
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:59.240]  it is to have someone on who has a background in this and knows about it
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:03.320]  and knows how much trouble should be taken if you're going to do vetting
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.240]  properly and of course one has to see it a little bit from the side of our own
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:11.360]  public authorities in that the sheer numbers that are now trying to get in
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:16.480]  have swamped any attempt to do the kind of vetting and the danger if you don't
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:21.840]  do it though is that the the militants that jihadis can exploit the system and
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:26.800]  they can feed in as many terrorists as they want. Well Lord Moncton in in February
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:31.600]  sure in February the head of ISIS said we're gonna flood Europe with half a
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:34.520]  million refugees filled with our operatives we're gonna start shooting
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:38.160]  and bombing you they said it we covered it and the media said we were
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:41.840]  conspiracy theorists even though it was in the Daily Mail the BBC even the BBC
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.840]  reported on on on ISIS's open statements and so look Peter Sutherland as you
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:52.560]  know the head UN envoy over migrants and borders had Europe's borders go down
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:58.000]  they advertised all the freebies they got everybody to come the EU wants this
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.520]  the United States wants this as you said because the left thinks it's so sexy to
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.720]  be a radical jihadi they hate their dad they hate their mom they hate George
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:12.880]  Washington they hate the Union Jack you can't even fly that in the morning one
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:16.120]  of they try to come arrest you as you know they hate freedom they hate the
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:20.160]  West you know they love all the money they love all the products they love all
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:24.720]  the choices they love all the freedom but they think it's really sexy to have a
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.960]  burka put on their head and so my question is how do we counter this type
[02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:34.600]  of sniveling weirdness well I think the first step and it's really a very
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:41.000]  straightforward one is you've got to say we can no longer cope with the numbers
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.760]  that are trying to come in and therefore we are going to for a time
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.280]  until we sort things out close our borders so those who want to come in
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:52.480]  we're just going to say to them no you won't be let in you will be put
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:56.840]  straight back on a boat and made to go back home and I think you have to start
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:01.640]  there draw a line in the sand and say sorry for the moment we're swamped we
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:06.400]  can't do this anymore and then you take stock and you think and we have
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:09.640]  international meetings about it and you work we work out a proper plan
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:15.880]  fact is these are mostly Arab Muslims it is the primary responsibility of the
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:20.800]  Arab countries to look after their own and if they were not able just to pass
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.040]  the problem on to the West they would be much less willing to sponsor this
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.200]  terror in the way in which Saudi Arabia does indirectly and some other
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:35.320]  countries do directly I think we need to take a much tougher line on the Arab
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:39.920]  world to say look this is a problem of your making and it is for you to sort
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:44.680]  it out and don't expect us to take these people in because we can't and because
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:50.400]  we know that your terrorist whom your funding has created are wanting to use
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:53.920]  this as a mechanism to get their people into our countries and for the sake of
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:59.160]  our citizens good health and survival we will not tolerate that I want to get
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:02.880]  one more come back from Jason about our comments to what he just said but but
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:07.160]  look when the TSA wants to grow my genitals or wants to ask me why I have
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.640]  great jelly that I bought at some farmers market for my mother and say that
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.240]  they could have me arrested when the police set up a checkpoint want to
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.840]  search my car randomly it becomes a joke when the border to the south is wide
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:24.480]  open when the border patrol completes the smuggling process when Europe brings
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.520]  in known jihadis and protects them and then when they put all these other
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:32.320]  people to get jobs in America through all these background checks it really
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.960]  shows that the security system is there to harass the producers and the
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:43.400]  citizens and to make sure we're minding our P's and Q's when the UN the
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:47.520]  governing class all the rest of them are above the law someone asked Lord
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.480]  Monks in this then go back to Jason how does somebody like Peter Southern on
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:55.480]  that heads up all this garbage think he's gonna get away with it with a
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:24:00.600]  straight face writing articles for the Financial Times of London where he says
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:05.600]  no we need to get rid of Europe's homogeneity it's bad that Europe even
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:11.200]  exist I mean it's just he's like speaking space alien he's so hateful he's so
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:18.480]  vicious he's so ugly in his policies I mean this guy it's a joke it's almost
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:22.840]  like what they're doing is so outrageous they have to make it outrageous to
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.640]  buffalo us because the lie is so big it's so ridiculous is what I'm getting at
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:33.280]  well it's it's got completely out of hand the the European class
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.160]  politic in particular is no longer subject as you were saying at the
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:41.720]  beginning of this program to any real democratic control decisions are being
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.920]  made on five six of our laws by people whom we do not elect and because they're
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.720]  not therefore having to take the feedback from the people that stops them
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.360]  going stupid they're doing what every dictator does they become detached from
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.760]  ordinary people if you remove them one stage further and take them from the EU's
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  bureaucracy and put them in the UN as so many of them now are that means they
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:08.600]  become still further disconnected from any form of reality and they live in a
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:13.320]  little world of their own and a niece of mine recently joined the UN and I
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.440]  happen to mention to her something the other day she rang up to ask for advice
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:20.680]  on a speech she was drafting for her superior and I happen to say something
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.720]  about the global warming thing and she immediately trotted out the UN line she
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:31.120]  been completely kind of recruited if you like on all the main points that the UN
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:35.080]  thinks they become like robots they become completely disconnected from the
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:39.800]  real world and I think one of the things we've got to do is to make absolutely
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:46.720]  sure that every supranational or global body which wishes to exercise any power
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:52.960]  of decision-making or lawmaking over us must be elected by us or it can wield no
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.880]  power over us at all we must introduce democracy to the international sphere as
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:02.440]  it has been introduced in the national by the way I agree with you and the
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.720]  control left the control left wants to Star Trek future and always says how
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.360]  dare you be against the type of global discussion I'm not against global bodies
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:13.280]  global discussions as long as sovereignty is maintained as long as
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:16.600]  there's an open vote as long as because that's obviously the next step of human
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:22.680]  development but this this UN thing is a dictatorial totalitarian mess where in
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:29.160]  article 30 it says the UN can abridge any freedom at once at will this is the
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.400]  problem and the only way to put this right is to make sure that they are
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:38.760]  elected and if they're not elected they can't wield any power or influence and
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:44.400]  I would go further I would say that every treaty every international treaty
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:50.160]  that has been made with which has put in place an international body that
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:56.840]  treaty should automatically be cancelled after one year from now if there has
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.760]  been no worldwide election among all the member states participating in that body
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.880]  to elect the people who actually run it that would apply as much to the EU as it
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.800]  would to the UN itself and the world that's right because it creates its own
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:16.960]  little kings its own little viceroys over those those agencies Jason getting
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:22.240]  back to the fact of the vetting there is no vetting their vetting fake passports
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:25.720]  they're just creating new fake identities I guess when they bring them in and
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:31.200]  certify these fake passports they admit that you know something like 80% of them
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:38.560]  are fake isn't that actually creating a new fake identity I mean they just have
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:42.640]  the news article where they show that you can actually buy a Syrian passport for
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.520]  $2,000 in fake a whole identity that the main point that I want to get across
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:52.320]  to all of your listeners is basically that you know the vetting even if they
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:58.160]  are doing that unless they're taking each individual into a room and water
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:01.240]  boarding every single one to get information out of them which we know
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:05.880]  they're not doing they're just not going to prove anything and the other
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:11.320]  thing is I've seen in all the work that I've done as a defense contractor I you
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:16.120]  know Americans Americans deceiving our government by you know photoshopping DD
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:22.960]  214 I've seen them photoshopping like paramedic and EMT certificates just to
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:26.960]  make a buck and they still get through the government and get to go overseas
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:31.240]  and work so if we can't catch those people what makes you think you're going
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:36.360]  to catch somebody from another country coming into ours you know with ill
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:41.880]  intentions to do something bad it's insane it's insane thank you so much
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:46.640]  Lord Monkton we're out of time briefly to read a rass music headline about
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:50.160]  arresting people that disagree with the government I mean it's just getting
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:53.680]  scary they're they're grabbing land everywhere they're accelerating
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.600]  actually a rather surprising one it is bringing it on because the one place
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:05.400]  where if you have fair judges both sides of this climate question will get
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.680]  heard are in a good old-fashioned adversarial one side against the other
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:13.560]  case in a court where each side can cross-examine the other and one of the
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:17.400]  reasons why so few climate change cases have ever got to the court is the left
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:20.840]  know this perfectly well they don't actually want to put any of us into a
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:25.400]  court because they know that if they put us into a court we'll win if you had
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:30.840]  outdoors film thrown out of the schools in the UK by the court now of course the
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.480]  danger now is that with the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom having come
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:40.120]  out and declared a policy that people like me who research and get papers
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:44.440]  published in the in the peer-reviewed journals should be arrested and
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:48.000]  imprisoned totally discredited we're out of time thank you Lord Monkton thank
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:54.080]  you we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.640]  network
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:02.360]  man-made climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:06.120]  public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:08.840]  warming global warming is a manufactured problem played up by the
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:12.320]  government to instigate a public reaction in this case fear the government
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:16.200]  then exploits to offer a predetermined solution the strategy now known as the
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:19.400]  Hegelian dialectic has been used to successfully by politicians for
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:22.640]  millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:26.640]  liberties the Bush administration uses strategy successfully 2003 when it
[02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:30.240]  gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq my claiming country had
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:33.600]  weapons of mass destruction and the war ultimately expanded the military
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:37.240]  industrial complex in America's emerging police state today global warming is
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:40.880]  used as a boogeyman because allows the UN to use government-funded scientists to
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.160]  scare the public into believing that man-made climate change is too big of a
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.200]  threat for their country to handle alone and thus it's can only be defeated

[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:27.680]  the radical jihadi areas that have been taken over where women are told don't
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.680]  wear skirts women are told wear hoods no alcohol can be sold this is de facto
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:37.760]  sharia law taking place and we're asking why are the globalist pushing this
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:42.320]  since we talked to you an hour and a half ago Joe any new developments
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.800]  Roger that Joe Beggs here with info wars.com we're in downtown Paris actually
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:50.320]  earlier I forgot to mention a story I wanted to tell you really quick before
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:55.520]  I give you a breaking update we actually held a cab and when we got into the cab
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:00.640]  Alex the guy says you know where would you like to go and I said to a saint
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:04.640]  dentist he goes whoa he's like do you know what is going on there and I was
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:08.560]  like well yeah and he goes no no no no no no and he was scared like he gave me
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.200]  this look in his eyes when I said I wanted to go to where the ISIS raid was
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:15.880]  being conducted he was about ready to just tell us to get the hell out of the
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:21.440]  cab and go on and he took us out that way he actually dropped us over a mile
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:26.200]  away and we had to actually hike in there through the you know the suburbs of
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:29.600]  that area to get over there so I thought that was very interesting the fact that
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:34.200]  the guy was so scared he wouldn't even get close enough to that area and at this
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:38.040]  point in time basically off of Washington post I believe it is we pull up
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:42.400]  the article really quick for you have a right here yeah Washington post
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:46.640]  suspected architect of Paris attacks is dead according to two senior
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.680]  intelligence officials so I'm not sure if that brings it to three now three dead
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:55.520]  today the female suicide bomber and then the person that we take a picture of
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:00.360]  outside who was confirmed to be an ISIS terrorist or was there in another body
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:03.840]  as well so that's one thing I'm still trying to find out if that was a body
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:07.760]  that I took a picture of the mastermind or was he inside after they threw the
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:10.560]  explosives and then they found him in there later and they're just now
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.680]  confirming it so that is a big development what time is it on the
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:29.160]  streets there in Paris it is 20 24 20 20 40 so 840 at night here in Paris and as
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:32.640]  you can see if you look around there's a lot more people out here tonight than
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:37.000]  there have been in previous days I think the the word and the news traveling
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.680]  fast about the raid in St. Dennis is spread fast and people are out they're
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:45.440]  back to normal I went out last night like I said and it was a ghost town no one
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:49.280]  was out I spoke to a few of the different bartenders and shopkeepers and
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:53.120]  everyone said that that was not normal for people to be out and as you can see
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.560]  it looks like people are starting to go back they feel a little bit safer knowing
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:01.080]  that these people have been either killed or captured in some way but that doesn't
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:04.840]  mean that it's over yet you know the French Prime Minister the president
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:08.600]  everyone has said that remain vigilant that there are possibilities of more
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.480]  attacks coming you know the fact that these guys are shacked up and they were
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.400]  ready to conduct another terrorist attack in the business district here in
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:20.280]  Paris shows you that there is possibility of another cell out here
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:26.280]  ISIS has named Paris it's like one of its top targets that they want to hit so
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.880]  and Paris is brought in record numbers lovingly of refugees and of course we
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:36.840]  know some of the shooters were refugees that's been confirmed but Jeremy in
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.880]  Kansas I want you to hear this caller was saying that we're in danger of being
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:45.960]  a fascist paradigm compared to the leftist paradigm so I want you to hear
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:51.160]  what Jeremy Joe Biggs has to say from Kansas Jeremy go ahead and make your
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:58.600]  point yes just tying up the solutions to the global warming no no no hold on
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:03.040]  hold on I don't screen your calls but you said you wanted to get into us being
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:08.160]  in danger of promoting fascism basically so I want you to specifically not get
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:11.200]  into your solutions for global warming I don't think there's solutions to global
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:17.080]  warming it's not happening that's another show I really want you to respond
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:24.120]  to the claim that you think we're becoming fascist go ahead okay I do want
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:30.480]  to show respect for the fact that in my days with we are change LA I always
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:34.960]  felt personally respected by you and I have learned a lot and been inspired by
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:39.720]  you especially from your terror storm days but what I've seen in the last few
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:44.160]  years and it's really becoming clear with the the reporting on the Paris
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:51.360]  attack is a really a going backward into the lower levels of what's actually
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:55.680]  going on here and of course there are cultural Marxist that are being funded
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:59.720]  by the Ford Foundation but they're also cultural fascists that you appear to
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:03.400]  have aligned yourself that are funded by people like the Cokes or Heritage and
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:07.000]  that's everything stop right there stop right there I'm gonna let you make your
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.480]  points I've never gotten one red cent from the Koch brothers I've had big
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:15.280]  reporters on like Greg Palace who's a liberal saying the Cokes have given more
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.720]  money the Democrats they have Republicans that's all more pigments the
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.640]  imagination I don't get any money from big oil any money from coal any money
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:28.680]  from anybody take Matt drudge Matt drudge is funded by advertising money
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:32.280]  by the left the right you name it through ad agencies that buy ads on the
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:37.280]  internet it's like Google ads I mean it's just crazy just throw out there that
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:43.080]  oh you've aligned yourself with people the Koch brothers oh my gosh yes the
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:48.360]  Koch brothers give me a break so see here's what I'm saying something like
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.520]  9-11 that clearly has inside job written all over it we expose but then when they
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:58.360]  create a real jihad army and turn it loose and open our borders to flood us
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:02.800]  and have big foundations demonizing anyone that points out they're dissolving
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.520]  sovereignty I'm against it okay there are real jihadies coming into Syria and
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.280]  now into Europe and the United States they really are killing people they
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.080]  really did tell our reporters get out of here you're not allowed to be on the
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:22.360]  streets of Russell's Belgium okay this I don't like any type of totalitarianism
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:28.000]  whether it was Nazis or Black Lives Matter or radical Arabs so specifically
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.960]  how am I going backwards how am I engaged in fascism I want to know go
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:40.800]  ahead yes that's why I'm calling you and not calling Glenn Beck because I do I
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.800]  have faith in the goodness and brother I'm for real I just want to hear
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:50.160]  specifically how you think I'm wrong okay let's deal with September 11th what
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:54.520]  I've seen through the days of terror wars is the people who continue to do
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.960]  research in September 11th have found that the core of the September 11th
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.800]  operation led to the core of the deep states of the US and Israel if Saudi
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:09.800]  Arabia had any involvement in it it was about supplying nationals to be blamed
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:15.640]  as passing the Israelis framed them and the US protected them but that the core
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.680]  of the operation are buildings being blown up from the inside including the
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:23.920]  Pentagon where people are being targeted who are enabled danger and accountants
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:30.840]  looking for missing trillion you know and so this this attack in Paris has all
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:36.720]  the earmarks of Operation Gladio continuing forward into the 21st century
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:41.440]  and if you look at the history of terrorism modern terrorism the Israelis
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:44.360]  are at the heart of it with the King David Hotel bombing where they were
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:48.680]  willing to kill Jews in the name of the Zionist project but also through NATO
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:54.680]  and US CIA intelligence so let me expand on all this I exposed 9-11 before it
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.040]  happened I exposed the day it happened and I know that there are different camps
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:01.920]  that want to blame this group of that group there are criminal networks above
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:07.840]  Western governments that clearly bare minimum stood down on 9-11 clearly blew
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:13.160]  up building 7 clearly involved we are the main drivers of exposing all of that
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:18.800]  we're now 14 years later though when the public turns away from a subject I
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:23.780]  still cover it still have guests on routinely but I don't get bullied I'm
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:27.160]  not talking about callers like you but other people to call them say you better
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:30.880]  have me on about this you better cover that you better cover space beams all
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.880]  the rest of it I am not a 9-11 only person most people know about Operation
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:42.880]  Ajax or Gladio or Northwood's because of me okay I was the one that exposed it
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:47.720]  all when it took the most heat to do it I'm the person that lost most my
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:51.640]  affiliates and then of course gained them back 14 years ago when I wouldn't
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:57.400]  shut up about 9-11 so I've been there done that specifically though you don't
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:01.360]  need to launch an Operation Gladio where you stage terror attacks and then
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:06.480]  frame communist so NATO has an excuse to expand control in Europe when you've
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:11.960]  brought in real jihadis to do it and so that's my point this is a false flag but
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:15.200]  the most rudimentary type because the West created the climate and the
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:18.920]  conditions to bring in people they knew would do this Joe Biggs your take on
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:24.280]  what he's saying well with the entire attack like I said I've fought these
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.560]  people overseas they're real imagine growing up in an area where you're being
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.800]  bombed that creates terrorism those people hate us they hate so many people
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:41.080]  out there the fact that France is now bombing only adds to the hate there are
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:44.560]  real terrors out there and when people all they want to do is bring up the fact
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:50.600]  that well don't you mean CIA instead of this ISIS don't you mean don't you mean
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:55.560]  the US government yeah they help kick start the whole thing off it's just like
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.360]  anything you can have a child you can create something but then when it's
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.160]  against older guess what it's gonna have a mind of its own and do exactly
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:07.600]  whatever it wants so yes we funded them to an extent and yes they're allowing
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:11.680]  things to happen but guess what there's a group of guys in Syria and Iraq who
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.080]  probably don't know anything about that they're just angry and pissed off about
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:18.840]  what's going on and they're being sucked into this entire lifestyle and they
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:22.000]  feel like they're fighting for something so every time I hear that it just gets
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:28.920]  under my skin I can't stand it exactly ISIS magazine a few months ago came out
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:32.800]  attacked in full wars and then they put you in their videos begs they hate you
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:36.640]  I've been put some of their literature and they said you know we do not work
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:42.400]  for CIA do not listen to them because the fact that we're exposing that the
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:46.720]  West is setting up Muslims to fall is hurting their recruiting they admit the
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:49.760]  number one thing hurting their recruiting is the fact that we're
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:54.400]  pointing out that they're being set up okay I did I did a report eight months
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.480]  ago with a grandmother in Syria she's riding around and these ISIS guys are
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:01.680]  kind of patrolling around in their Sharia law area telling everybody what
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:04.600]  they can or can't do and they were yelling at the older lady because she
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:07.440]  didn't have her face fully covered and she goes I know that you're getting your
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.200]  money from the USA stop letting them control you and the ISIS guy goes yes
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:14.960]  we get stuff from America I mean so we know that we're beyond that we don't
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:18.760]  have to say that every time we're here boots on the ground giving people live
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:23.720]  updates about what's going on exactly I can't spend all day focusing on the fact
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.040]  that the CIA helped that out okay we know everybody knows you watch we've
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:31.120]  said it we were we talk about it constantly and I noticed the more we do
[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:35.960]  shows about 9-11 the more the 9-11 police write articles and call us and
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:39.440]  say we're not doing enough like they've terrorized us into covering it or
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:43.920]  something look we covered it constantly I'm not mad at Jeremy bringing the stuff
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:47.320]  I'm talking about other people we're actually trying to stop a class of
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:51.580]  civilizations Dick Cheney wrote the PNAC document with Jeb Bush a year before
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:56.560]  9-11 rebuilding America's defenses just type it in you can read it on you know
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.160]  scribs or Wikipedia they took their website down a few years ago used to be
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:04.960]  the you know the neocon network had it out there they explained we're gonna
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:08.880]  finance radical Muslims have us have them attack us then we can invade them
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:14.120]  class of civilizations we're trying to stop the class of civilizations where
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:19.600]  they're putting ISIS pit bulls in our nursery room to maul our babies so they
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.200]  can then point us at a sod who's innocent to go take his government out
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:26.720]  that's what's happening Jeremy you have one minute to respond but I'm going to
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.920]  bring come back with more calls okay thank you of course there are you know
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:37.520]  tough theory Salafist Wahhabi cultists who are involved in this at least for
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:41.480]  being blamed for it and probably were involved in the operation however we
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:46.280]  know that that was actually a bulwark of the British Empire's creation of a
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:51.480]  counter gang against the Arab Muslim world in terms of countering the fascist
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.040]  cultural potentials with this story you could have your reporters really dig in
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:00.760]  on the drill that was running on the morning of that the these allegations
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:05.200]  of this indestructible passport is exactly the same as September 11th
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:09.480]  instead of going this route of immigration which plays into the hands of
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:13.640]  the police state and you see Donald Trump being critiqued by reason back here
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:17.400]  in the United States of America for basically that's good that's good I
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.880]  appreciate your call let me carry that we expose all we're done we expose
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:28.040]  almost every day that Saudi Arabia was created by British intelligence we did
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:34.720]  it yesterday with with Dr. Pachennick we popularized all that separately this
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:38.680]  was a general anti-terrorism drill ahead of the UN summit coming up not the
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:43.240]  exact place exact time that's different and this passport with a suicide bomb
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.720]  being found is not the same as two passports in a fireball being found it
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:51.920]  is not exactly the same it's not even in the same universe and I'm not arguing
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:55.680]  with you I just don't agree with the statements you're making we'll be right
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:58.440]  back stay with us
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.680]  something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old

[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:13.520]  it's very elementary the West is bringing in radical jihadis who will
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:17.120]  engage in terror they will then use those terror attacks to take our liberties
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:23.360]  yeah the FBI might find some patsies too who knows they've done it before we
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:28.200]  expose it they don't need to now let me tell you this whole ISIS thing is
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:31.760]  hot with the left hot with the gangbangers I've been telling you this
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:37.480]  before the media did and I really do my research and so they don't need to cook
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:41.560]  up some bull to get funding now I'm trying to stop it all being brought in
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:45.840]  so it doesn't happen so we don't lose our freedoms I'm not scared of a few
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.680]  hundred people getting blown up I don't want it to happen but I am concerned
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:54.000]  about what they're gonna do to our society on the backs of these jihad
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:58.760]  attacks that are already happening in fact they just ran a story in here that
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:04.280]  reminded me of this from September 29th Obama gave 1,500 terrorists asylum and
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:08.040]  US documents reveal changing the definition of terrorism to allow them
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:11.160]  to bring them in they're bringing in the foreign fighters that already worked
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:16.200]  for them retraining them and redeploying them so there's your false flag right
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:23.400]  there Joe Biggs is chomping at the bit to respond to Jeremy oh yeah so whenever
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.600]  something like this happens everyone all the sudden becomes a forensics expert
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.840]  an EOD technician which is an explosive ordinance disposal technician guy who
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:34.080]  knows everything about explosives I'm one person who can actually speak on the
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:38.200]  subject because I myself have been blown up I've seen the suicide bombers blow
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:41.960]  themselves up the guy in that instance what he's talking about had on a belt
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:46.680]  bomb which means it would send shrapnel out and hit people in the guts for him
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.960]  when it goes off it's always gonna do is sever that person in half the back
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:54.480]  pocket would be left unscathed more than likely the pockets or wherever he had
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:59.040]  talked about passport should have been destroyed no it shouldn't no it's not
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:01.280]  that doesn't happen every time something like this happens people like
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:04.880]  there's no blood and there's no this not everybody if you depending on where you
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.960]  shoot somebody not everything's Hollywood it's not a terminator movie not
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:12.880]  everybody just gets blown up like this they people automatically hear suicide
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:17.360]  best or our our our belt bomb and they think that everything's gonna be the
[02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:22.280]  mulch no it's very small in my new it's just like a grenade it's only get five
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:27.320]  meters out I mean you're gonna get a little shrapnel it's not that crazy and
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.800]  everyone just goes and they just their mind starts spinning without even taking
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:35.920]  the time to sit down and actually properly research what happens in these
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:39.560]  situations I'm telling everybody out there guess what there's a really good
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.200]  chance that passport was probably untouched well here's another thing the
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:46.200]  average American doesn't travel or the most untraveled people in the world
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:49.840]  except for North Koreans they don't care their passports around you got to have a
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:55.120]  passport in Europe to do anything yes I have mine on me now I'm gonna have mine
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:58.240]  on me every day that I'm out here that's what you have to do because if you
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.840]  get stopped you don't have it you're screwed I mean I just think it's
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:04.840]  ridiculous that people think that everything's gonna be like it is in
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:09.800]  Hollywood stop being brainwashed by the TV and actually find out what happens
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:13.440]  and it's not all it is well my point is I'm not a mad at the caller and I get
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:17.120]  some of his frustrations you know there's they're saying how did I say all
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:21.060]  this other stuff was fake and now I'm saying this is real well used to al-Qaeda
[02:57:21.060 --> 02:57:25.320]  leaders were like the grandsons of ADL heads and stuff and defense link would
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:29.800]  upload the videos and it was all fake and in and now these are real armies this
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:35.280]  is a real move this is a proxy war I mean this is this is hard core the
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:39.520]  Arab Spring was Western financed the globalist are overthrowing our allies
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:43.420]  they're destabilizing they're destabilizing us I'm opposing the
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:49.480]  globalist program it's very very simple Joe go go back to the the day after
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:52.400]  Michael Brown was being killed the black lives matter people out there were
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:57.600]  fine but since then and over what a year now it is completely changed into
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:01.040]  something different it is not what it was at the beginning when they first
[02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:04.960]  started this whole big movement in America that's a source taken over it
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:11.560]  exactly but that's the thing things move along stuff changes you know yeah we
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:14.040]  might have helped start this stuff but guess what it's out of control now and
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:16.960]  they're on their own doing their own stuff this real terrorism they're real
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:19.960]  people out there who hate us and they're gonna do harm it's gonna happen again
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.840]  unless we start doing something about and the bigger question is we need to
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:27.960]  blame the government and people running it and say what are you doing instead
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:30.800]  there's just this debate about should we take revenues or not of course not
[02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:35.160]  because it's coming from a terrorist war zone it's incredible we're gonna come
[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:38.600]  back and take a few more calls and Leanne McAdoo takes over we got Joe Biggs

[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:35.600]  air James thank you mr. Jones yeah I greatly first off I greatly appreciate
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:40.600]  all that you guys do love your coverage love you being on the forefront of the
[03:00:40.600 --> 03:00:46.200]  info war look my point was is that you know lately Texas has been in the
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:52.520]  forefront governor Abbott you know refusing refugees spearheading you know
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:58.880]  at least observing the jade helm 15 and I believe it's time to kind of flip the
[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:05.200]  script on the globalist and start doing our own problem reaction solution
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:13.080]  governor Abbott George Soros you know his owning of Home Depot and Lowe's you
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:18.760]  know why couldn't we legally go after the assets of the Home Depots and Lowe's
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:23.360]  well I agree that George Soros should be sued for his criminal activity I mean
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:28.440]  if anybody can be sued for overthrowing Ukraine and helping fund the refugees and
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.080]  the rest of it I mean it's just there's got to be an end to this guy
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:37.200]  politically right and and indict him criminally for providing material
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:42.160]  support for terrorists you know freeze the assets of Lowe's and Home Depot in
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:47.160]  Texas start taking the offensive add on I agree I mean Abbott shouldn't just
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:50.640]  wait till the White House cooks up some indictment against him he's pretty much
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.480]  been on the offense but that's a good point right and and you know again
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:02:00.840]  giving the problem reacts let him react to us you know let them react to us
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:05.280]  and I'm always about getting on the offense no no I hear you let me jump
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:09.680]  James it's a great point I don't know if you can legally go after companies that
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:14.080]  somebody's part owner of but I mean certainly if Soros does business in
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:20.560]  Texas I mean they've indicted Rick Perry because he used he vetoed state funding
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:25.880]  to an ethics commission run by the county attorney who was caught attacking
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:29.880]  police drunk I mean it's totally in his purview they indicted him why can't we
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:34.320]  indict them for all their crimes Joe bags yeah I understand I mean that's
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:37.720]  something we should definitely try I mean but it like you said those those
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:41.200]  guys have deep deep pockets it's hard to go after something like that that has
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.160]  that much money because at the end of the day they're gonna pay everybody off
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:47.640]  and get whatever it is they want that's the that's the sick thing about this
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:52.200]  world well Soros up in Connecticut lives about a mile from a private airfield and
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.520]  keeps a big wide-body jet fueled and ready with pilots he always keeps the
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:01.680]  jet he's got a helicopter on his property he's ready to run at any moment
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:06.280]  yeah he's a literal James Bond villain let's go ahead and talk to Steve in
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:09.800]  Tennessee last time last caller we have time for before we hand it over to
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:15.880]  McAdoo go ahead Steve I listen to you Google Cooper and Art Bell on the same
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:20.040]  day one time that's how long I've been listening and what drove what drove
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:26.360]  Cooper nuts drives me nuts and that is that the house of thought ISIS and al-Qaeda are
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:35.920]  kzars the new order is being set up by kzars the their religion is a Babylonian
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:42.600]  Talmudism also called Wahhabism and trying you know they do pray on the
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:46.080]  minorities which are the Sunnis just like I do here with the black lives
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:51.440]  matters they pray on minorities even the Shiites do yeah they do their dirty work
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:57.800]  but the new order is trying to establish the new Khazaria that's why Kiev when
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:03.840]  Mars says that Kiev is a new Jerusalem and airfads talking about the greater
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:09.680]  Israel project they're setting up the new Khazaria before they establish the new
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:14.640]  world order I know it's been said that the Saudi House of Saud are have no
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.040]  claim to any of that area I thought they were better ones that the British
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:24.080]  intelligence hired to take over some of the camel routes there where a lot of
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:28.600]  the spices and things were coming through that region of the world I'll have

[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:57.200]  shots to your doorstep uber has teamed with passport health and epidemico a
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:01.400]  data mining company owned by booze Allen Hamilton to provide flu shots right to

[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:12.720]  shot was only 18% effective last year so this year's numbers can only get
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:18.280]  better or can they uber health provided more than 2,000 vaccinations last year
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:22.600]  and this year they're gonna have up to 10,000 flu shots available with hundreds
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:27.280]  of nurses ready in uber vehicles across the country but it's only one day you
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:31.800]  can read more about it and booze Allen Hamilton at info wars dot-com rob do
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:38.840]  reporting and sign up for our newsletter at info wars dot-com forward slash insider that's
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:43.680]  right so now you can have door-to-door delivery of the flu shot you don't have
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:48.240]  to go to any any at your hospital or go to visit your local nurse they're gonna
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:54.240]  have nurses on demand you just go sign up to uber and choose the label uber
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:59.280]  health so rob do thanks for joining me now break this down for us because uber
[03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:04.600]  seems to really be expanding into many different markets they really don't want
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:07.920]  you to leave your house yeah you know their mission is to get us all not
[03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:11.760]  driving right essentially but now they want to you know have nurses come it's
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:17.520]  it's a $10 charge for the nurse to show up and they can give shots of up to 10
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:21.600]  people at a time so you could split the cost with your colleagues and say
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:26.760]  $10 and so who's financing all this this is what I really want to look at but I
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:30.000]  just think it's amazing that you know it's not enough that they push it at
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:33.960]  every grocery store you know they're gonna give you gift cards 10% off this
[03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:39.080]  for getting the flu shot every corner pharmaceutical company store you know
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:43.240]  see where it's 18% effective it doesn't even counteract the right that's going
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:45.840]  around that season they never want to tell you that they just want you to get
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:48.840]  that flu shot they want pregnant women to get it they want the elderly to get
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:52.240]  the double dose I mean it is crazy what they want to push and now they want to
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:56.560]  drive these to your house or your place of business and give them to you and you
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:00.600]  know last year was a force for cities Boston New York Washington and Chicago
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:06.240]  this year 38 cities wow and so when I started looking into this article as a
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:10.840]  Washington Post article and we posted it last night what what interested me was
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.880]  the company involved and they're called Epidemic Co and they're a public health
[03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:21.520]  data mining company owned by booze Allen Hamlin epidemic co epidemic they
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:27.800]  trap they track epidemics and passport health they're like a poor traveling
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:30.600]  kind of nurse service so that makes sense that they're involved even though I
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:35.160]  don't agree there's an epidemic we're there right so I started looking at
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.600]  booze Allen Hamilton and I put on the bottom when I had a Mikhail post this
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:43.800]  on info or so you got to post this and then be sure you you put a link to one
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:47.200]  of our articles booze Allen Hamilton is actually a daily Paul article booze
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:52.200]  Allen Hamilton what you don't know about Snowden's former employer and this is a
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:56.320]  company that gets 99% of their revenue from the US government they work for the
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:02.120]  NSA the IRS all the armed forces FBI Homeland Security you know James
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:05.520]  Clappers involved with them and then they have this character named Dove
[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:10.440]  Zakeem who works with the company and he also owns a company called Systems
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:15.440]  Planning Corporation which they did the investigation into the WTC bombing of
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:21.560]  1993 he was the Comptroller of the Pentagon during which 2.3 trillion went
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:25.720]  missing remember that was the day before 9-11 that Romsfeld came out and said we
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:29.560]  don't know what happened to hit that part of the Pentagon we're all now we'll
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:32.400]  never get to the bottom of that his company's also involved in flight
[03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:36.720]  systems capable of remote controlling aircraft and who owns booze Allen
[03:13:36.720 --> 03:13:41.280]  Hamilton the Carlisle group which is owned by the Bushes and bin Laden so it
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:46.440]  makes you wonder why a large company like this is putting is working with Uber
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:52.640]  and this other health provider to track where these vaccinations are going who's
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:56.600]  getting them because all that's done through Uber you're using your you know
[03:13:56.600 --> 03:14:01.160]  code and whatever when you're at your account to order it right so how you
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:03.400]  know a lot of people on Twitter speculating that they're doing this to
[03:14:03.400 --> 03:14:07.400]  track how effective the flu shot is at giving the people flu instead of
[03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:11.880]  actually preventing the flu because you are being ejected with a virus right or
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:16.760]  seeing how that particular strain of flu that may or may not have been lab
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.760]  created travels and how quickly it travels and if it can be contained or
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:25.400]  controlled and and now they're doing it in 38 cities so they're really gonna
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:29.760]  have and it's a large section it's you know the most more populated cities
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:34.480]  that's where Uber is more effective so that's that's on Thursday so that's
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:37.240]  tomorrow that they're gonna be doing this I would like to challenge somebody
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:42.240]  too bad Austin is not one of the cities but to have the nurse come and show up
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:45.400]  and then provide a form that says you're gonna take full responsibility for any
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:49.080]  side effects that may happen after I take this shot see if they sign it and
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:52.440]  that's a thing it take video of it you know shoot some video of the Uber nurse
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:56.080]  coming to your door with the flu shot in hand right and even educating the
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:14:59.120]  Uber nurse because a lot of times they don't even want to read the package
[03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:03.440]  insert but that's one of the things with this with the share economy is that
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:07.640]  there's they're not sharing in the responsibility if something bad happens
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:12.160]  like you see a lot of these stories where a girl might get raped or a driver is
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:15.920]  beaten by a drunk person in their in their car or something like that but
[03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:19.760]  how to Uber how are they ultimately responsible for it well how are they
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:22.800]  gonna ultimately be responsible if someone is injured by one of these
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:27.600]  vaccine right that was brought to them by their $10 service I mean very cheap
[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:32.000]  compared to what normally an Uber drive costs or an Uber you know experience
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.160]  costs but I guess they're not picking somebody up they're just delivering a
[03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:40.160]  nurse right and it just blows my mind and you know reading that I had to do
[03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:46.000]  that hop topic last night and we put it up today and you know it just I'm
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:50.400]  totally amazed at where our country is going how crazy it's getting so quickly
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:54.520]  with all the PC cur the political correctness stuff the vaccine pushing and
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:15:58.000]  it really there's really few people you know standing up and pushing back on
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:01.640]  this stuff there are some great websites out there that are doing it but I'm
[03:16:01.640 --> 03:16:04.920]  just totally blown away at this right well it's all just about acceptance this
[03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:09.320]  is the future that's being created and don't you even worry about it it there's
[03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:13.400]  nothing you can do to stop it just like we have the big text is welcome for
[03:16:13.400 --> 03:16:19.040]  Google's self-driving cars right Austin is basically the the hub for it they've
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:23.360]  always been enthusiastic about innovation so we're gonna have these self-driving
[03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:28.280]  cars on our streets and just kind of being dumped on us whereas I know
[03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:31.960]  California has tried to set up some regulations for them but they're like
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:35.680]  yeah the Austinites keep it weird they like they like anything new and
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:38.760]  innovative you know we didn't like public trend people don't like public
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:41.600]  transportation they like their cars you know if you have a choice what are you
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:45.080]  gonna do drive your car or go take the bus the only reason we ever take the
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:47.920]  bus is if we're going to an event downtown and there's no parking which is
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:50.760]  done by design to get people out of their cars they don't provide parking
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:53.880]  anywhere so that's the only reason people use you know those services like
[03:16:53.880 --> 03:16:58.920]  if they have a choice yeah or like I would prefer to take me a bus or the
[03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:05.560]  Amtrak or something if it could get me to and from downtown at night safely but
[03:17:05.560 --> 03:17:10.440]  they shut it down at night so for those of us who you know can't drive downtown
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:15.840]  it's like no it's not for you and so it's just basically a useless tool that's
[03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:20.120]  out there that's just why people continually vote against it totally now
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:24.280]  going moving on to I guess Paris what's going on with the shootings there's been
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:28.200]  some fallout and our and our friend up in Washington Spokane Washington Ozzie
[03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:33.600]  Kinesovich has asked his deputies to carry extra guns or guns and extra ammo
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:38.120]  with them especially when they're off-duty why to possibly stop something
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:42.600]  like this so he's saying he's actually saying guns stop crime yeah and he wants
[03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:46.840]  his people radical I know of course one sales have surged following these Paris
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:52.640]  attacks and then Obama comes out the next day or so afterward and and doubles
[03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:56.160]  down and says gun control is going to be the big thing for his last year in
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:59.760]  office yeah because that's what helped those people in Paris was uncontrol you
[03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:03.320]  know for two hours they were stuck in a theater just being picked off I mean I
[03:18:03.320 --> 03:18:05.920]  read the stories these people were lying down pretending like they were dead
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:09.880]  just so they wouldn't get shot because anytime somebody moved boom they would
[03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:13.120]  get picked off the spotter and somebody up in the balcony shooting people there's
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:18.000]  another story there on our site about how they were actually coming by and
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:24.280]  cutting their cutting their insides basically just letting right exactly and
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:29.520]  then just someone actually wasn't shot because they kicked him in his fake leg
[03:18:29.520 --> 03:18:33.840]  and he had lost his leg and it was only because he had that fake leg and they
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:38.920]  kicked him in and he didn't respond that he was able to survive and I mean this
[03:18:38.920 --> 03:18:44.440]  is I've had people commenting on the video that we posted up saying was that
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:47.880]  what you would want you really think that you could stop a terrorist attack
[03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:52.400]  you want a bunch of drunk people at clubs with guns and and the thing is
[03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:55.880]  it's like the people who have these concealed carry they're not the ones
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:19:01.080]  that are going out and committing these mass atrocities they're responsible
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:04.360]  well and in the wake of that there's people in Spokane actually there was
[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:07.680]  40 people who were just citizens who went out to get their concealed carry
[03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:12.680]  permit and and that led me to a site called gun watch and and they have this
[03:19:12.680 --> 03:19:16.440]  was posted in 2012 and it was Matt it's called mass killings stop by armed
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:21.360]  citizens so here's a church shooting in Colorado Springs was stopped by by the
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:25.440]  shooter being shot by a church member with a concealed carry permit and Santa
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:28.360]  Clara gunshot shooting was stopped by an armed citizen after the shooter
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:31.440]  declared he was going to kill everyone and the police found a list of victims
[03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:35.880]  in his car and only the perpetrator was shot right and actually there are so
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:39.400]  many instances of this and when we come back I actually want you to talk a
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:43.240]  little bit about there was another mass shooting it was one guy he had five
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:48.440]  bullets right and he was able to save a thousand people from four terrorists who
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:51.840]  specifically targeted this church thinking that everyone there would be on
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:56.880]  arm man with one guy surprise we'll be right back

[03:22:59.880 --> 03:23:05.640]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:09.640]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[03:23:09.640 --> 03:23:12.840]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:17.120]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:21.360]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:25.400]  family warm the standard answers are firewood, coal or propane but the problem
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:29.880]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:33.760]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:37.840]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:42.800]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress

[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:23.760]  hour overdrive and I'm Leanne McAdoo I love that song that's like my ultimate
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:29.360]  top-down driving through the desert road trip song but I'm here with Rob do and
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:32.720]  we were just before the break we were talking about the fact that gun sales
[03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:37.760]  surged after this Paris attack Obama wants to double down though on the gun
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:42.240]  grabbing saying that's going to be his top issue and for the remainder of his
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:47.320]  time in office but you are giving us some statistics of times when one person
[03:24:47.320 --> 03:24:53.360]  helped stop a mass attack yeah and I want to end that with an interview that
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:57.040]  David Knight did back in June five bullets to save a thousand people from
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:01.840]  four terrorists and this is the story of Charles Van Vicke who was armed with a
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:06.800]  38 revolver with five bullets he stopped four men with AK-47s grenades and
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:09.800]  Molotov cocktails who stormed their church and we're gonna kill the thousand
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:14.200]  people that were in there they want to kill everybody and he stopped them one
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:17.880]  catch haste them off with a gun with five bullets and now he's a you know a
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:21.520]  missionary and talks about this contrast that to the story because we talk
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:25.120]  about Knizovic wanting his cops to be armed at all times five people shot by
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:29.440]  local police in 48 hours over the weekend that was in Miami and we had that
[03:25:29.440 --> 03:25:33.640]  off-duty cop that went and shot a guy who was a drummer in a band his card
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:37.800]  broken down and he thought this guy was coming to rob him so the guy pulls up
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.920]  behind him he jumps out and off-duty cop shoots him and I want to end with this
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:45.720]  and I don't want to pick on police but I mean they really are they're doing
[03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:49.280]  better than the burglars now and in stealing things from right making more
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:54.920]  money than police civil asset forfeiture exceed all burglaries in 2014 police
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:26:02.600]  have forfeited I guess stolen 4.5 billion from people in 2014 contrast that
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:07.360]  with a 3.9 billion and property losses by burglary so police are now taking more
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:13.720]  assets than criminals and of course they also have a license to kill so hmm well
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:17.120]  I want to go ahead and let's throw this John Bowne report because while we're
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:20.280]  talking about the fact that Obama is doubling down on the gun grab he's
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:24.280]  also blatantly disregarding the concerns of the American people with this
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:29.160]  refugee crisis in the wake of the terror in Paris President Obama is
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:34.000]  blatantly disregarding the very real concerns of the American people rather
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:39.680]  than review the policy to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees after the horror of
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:45.120]  the world witness just five days ago Obama clutches like a madman to his
[03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:50.320]  power and stays the course on the Bilderberg fueled globalist demand that
[03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:56.200]  he oust president Bashir al-Assad from Syria rather than do whatever it takes
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:27:01.520]  to protect the United States Obama is leaving the gates wide open as he shuns
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:07.240]  the overwhelming concerns of Americans and aids an invading force to quietly
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:11.440]  enter the United States people are flooding social media to encourage
[03:27:11.440 --> 03:27:16.160]  Americans to call their congressional representatives to stop the resettlement
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.320]  of Middle Eastern migrants after government officials and contractors
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:26.480]  admitted the migrants cannot be tracked or vetted properly nearly 80% of states
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:32.360]  receiving the most migrants have GOP upper house majorities of the 19 states
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:38.960]  that took in the most refugees per capita in 2013 and 2014 15 have upper
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:44.680]  house legislatures dominated by Republicans in comparison only three of
[03:27:44.680 --> 03:27:50.400]  the 19 states are democratic the FBI is already admitted the US can't vet all
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:54.560]  the migrants for terror ties we can only query against that which we have
[03:27:54.560 --> 03:28:00.960]  collected and and so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in
[03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:04.880]  a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database
[03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:09.160]  we can query our database till the cows come home but we're not gonna well
[03:28:09.160 --> 03:28:13.240]  that we nothing show up because we have no record on it you can only query what
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:17.960]  what you've collected and and with respect to Iraqi refugees we had far
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.600]  more in our databases because of our country's work there for a decade this
[03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:27.880]  is a different situation in the case of area there's you can't go to the the
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:32.280]  government offices in that country they're in disarray you can't go
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:37.840]  interview people who know people who are applying for this status do you
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:49.560]  disagree with the FBI director when he says that vetting Syrian refugees is
[03:28:49.560 --> 03:28:54.000]  extremely difficult if not impossible well mr. Chairman I'm not sure he said
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:58.480]  it was impossible certainly the the not only the Department of Justice but all
[03:28:58.480 --> 03:29:02.920]  of our agencies will make every effort to vet every refugee coming into this
[03:29:02.920 --> 03:29:06.720]  country from the databases to the interviews that those individuals are
[03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:10.760]  subject to to the biometrics screening as well let me go on certainly there are
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:16.440]  challenges to that process because of the situation in Syria recently a Syrian
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:21.000]  migrant who was relocated to Louisiana went missing the group accommodating
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:25.640]  him admitted it doesn't track the migrants the LA Times is reporting that
[03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:29.000]  more than half the right now coming up after the break David Knight will be in
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:32.880]  here and we're gonna be discussing this vetting process if you want to watch the
[03:29:32.880 --> 03:29:36.080]  rest of that report it's on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube it's called

[03:34:10.400 --> 03:34:14.480]  product is revolutionary its effectiveness increased after the second
[03:34:14.480 --> 03:34:20.120]  month in a big way I use a little extra on performance time no ill side effects
[03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:25.000]  at all so there you go and that's just two of hundreds of our five-star reviews
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:30.400]  get your supermail vitality now while supplies last it's an excellent holiday
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:36.480]  stocking stuffer and that's at info wars life comm now David Knight joins me now
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:40.920]  because I want to while we're kind of talking about this you know the holiday
[03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:45.600]  tis the season and everything it's Thanksgiving coming up and so it wouldn't
[03:34:45.600 --> 03:34:50.720]  be Thanksgiving without the typical racist memes that come around talking
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:55.160]  about how terrible white people are and all of that the Europeans but now there
[03:34:55.160 --> 03:35:01.440]  is a new meme that I'm seeing on social media it's Thanksgiving related and it's
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:06.080]  if you guys can see this picture here on my phone you can actually view what I'm
[03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:11.080]  looking at if you go to info wars dot com forward slash show but it's a meme and
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:15.440]  it's got a Native American there with the pilgrim and the Native American is
[03:35:15.440 --> 03:35:20.320]  thinking what if we let them in and they turn out to be violent religious fanatics
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:25.240]  so of course this is playing on the theme of letting in these refugees sort
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:28.160]  of saying you know here they're saying well what would have happened if the
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:33.080]  Native Americans wouldn't have let the Europeans in well you know I look at it
[03:35:33.080 --> 03:35:36.760]  in another way hey didn't really turn out too good for the Native Americans did
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:40.120]  it so yeah that's true well but the thing is though that that's based on a
[03:35:40.120 --> 03:35:43.240]  cartoon understand it's fitting that it's a cartoon because it's based on a
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:46.800]  cartoon understanding of history look we if you go back and you look at history
[03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:51.280]  understand the relationships between the pilgrims and the Indians initially
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:54.400]  were very good both sides wanted to get along it was in their best interest to
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:58.100]  get along that's what we celebrate at Thanksgiving we celebrate that we
[03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:03.280]  celebrate God's provision for us and and that's not something that we're saying
[03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:06.080]  you know we're going to annihilate the other people that wasn't the intention
[03:36:06.080 --> 03:36:09.040]  of the pilgrims to come here they wanted to live with other people as
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:11.920]  matter of fact they wanted to share with them what they thought was the most
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:16.240]  valuable thing they had their relationship with God with Christ but
[03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:19.560]  what happened over a period of time was that the government stepped in and the
[03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:24.200]  government betrayed and and created problems because they violated the
[03:36:24.200 --> 03:36:27.480]  treaties just like our government by has violated every treaty with us as well
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:32.400]  that's what Russell means American Indian movement founder said he said we're
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:35.840]  in white were white men fear to tread he said the government has violated every
[03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:40.320]  treaty they ever made with Indians in America and he said and now they're
[03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:44.040]  violating the treaty that they made with you white man the Constitution and so
[03:36:44.040 --> 03:36:49.040]  the problem really is how do we keep governments accountable and honest how
[03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:53.680]  do we keep governments from fomenting just unrest between two different groups
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:57.440]  how do we keep them how do we make them obey the law who watches the watchers
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:00.760]  that's really the fundamental question and it isn't a cultural thing it isn't
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:04.960]  that the pilgrims were evil you know we go back to the Civil War and you look
[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:10.200]  at the the notion that is also a cartoon history notion that this was all
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:15.800]  about it was an altruistic movement to free the slaves from the evil South that
[03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:21.000]  clearly isn't the case you look at what these same military people did like
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:24.200]  General Sheridan who said when I'm finished with the Shenandoah Valley the
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:28.120]  most fertile valley in the area said when I'm finished with it a crow won't be
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:30.920]  able to cross from one end to the other without carrying his own food with him
[03:37:30.920 --> 03:37:35.920]  and that same guy and do just a couple years went out West attack the Indians
[03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:40.480]  in a movement of genocide and said the only good Indian is a dead Indian we
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:43.760]  have to understand where the threat is coming from and we need to stop with
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:47.760]  this cartoon history of pitting one group against another saying that religion
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:52.160]  is a problem it isn't the problem solution well and it's exactly happening
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:56.440]  again today it's very cyclical so now they have we're talking about the
[03:37:56.440 --> 03:37:59.920]  governments have gone in they've supplied all the weapons the ammunition
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:04.520]  they've fomented this jihadi crisis that is there in the Middle East and
[03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:10.920]  created this refugee crisis and then now they're playing on our morality saying
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:15.320]  well we've created this refugee crisis but now you're a bad person if you do
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:20.960]  not open your doors wide open and let these people in where they get the
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:24.560]  moral authority exactly that that's what jeb bush is saying to us and of course I
[03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:29.520]  think you know just as with his father George HW when he went to Japan he he
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:34.160]  stood up and threw up at a state dinner and he became a verb okay to do a bush
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:39.360]  came to Bush was something like that it became synonymous with throwing up okay
[03:38:39.360 --> 03:38:44.760]  in Japan basically what we need to do turn Jeb into a verb in other words
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:49.520]  clueless the guy is a total Jeb okay and evidently he doesn't care what the
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:53.200]  general public opinion is either because he just wants to continue and
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:55.960]  double down with what's being done he says look we don't want to keep these
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:38:59.280]  people out of the country instead we need to solve the problem there and of
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:03.640]  course his solution to the problem is more war more involvement a bigger wider
[03:39:03.640 --> 03:39:08.680]  war that's much deeper that's going to create more refugees as well as create
[03:39:08.680 --> 03:39:11.960]  more terrorists and that's what a lot of people don't understand we've got this
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:15.920]  article from Mikhail talking about hackers who are angry at the governors
[03:39:15.920 --> 03:39:19.440]  who said we're not going to take people who are unvetted just as we saw in the
[03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:22.960]  report from John Bowne they don't know who these people are they don't know
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:27.800]  where they are they don't know you know so there's absolutely no understanding
[03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:31.440]  or control this and yet when you look at Jeb Bush talking about this he says
[03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:34.800]  there's a broader issue at stake here where a group of people who declared war
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:37.680]  on Western civilization our country we're going to fix it and he talks about
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:41.240]  how he's got experience because he working abroad because he worked for
[03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:44.680]  Barclays and Texas Commerce Bank abroad of course he's also got domestic
[03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:48.280]  experience because he worked for Lehman Brothers okay this guy is nothing but a
[03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:52.760]  part of the class that has created this problem the bankers the military
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:56.000]  industrial complex and then he goes on to say and I'll read this one last quote
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:02.800]  from the Jeb he says his brother and his surge in 2007 was an incredibly
[03:40:02.800 --> 03:40:07.360]  courageous act against the popular will he did something against the public and
[03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:10.640]  he goes but it was a right thing to do and it was a great success well I don't
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:16.840]  think it was look at Iraq today okay it wasn't a success Jeb okay when when he
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:21.560]  does this kind of stuff his numbers are plummeting and public opinion nobody
[03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:25.600]  is believing this but of course Jeb can rig it I mean I'm sorry Jeb can fix it
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:30.720]  that we know what that we know what that fix is that's what he did yeah he got
[03:40:30.720 --> 03:40:34.320]  his brother elected president against the popular will just like they had the
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:37.560]  war against popular will and so when we look at hackers who are pushing back
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:40.680]  some of the hackers push it back against ISIS but other hackers have said
[03:40:40.680 --> 03:40:45.560]  they're going to go after the governors we had this story from Mikhail yesterday
[03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:51.000]  hackers threaten governors for refusing refugees and this is a an organization
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:56.120]  Krakas with attitudes CWA they said and they spoke with Mikhail an exclusive
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:40:59.720]  story they said we will be targeting governors who are stopping refugees from
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:02.960]  having a place to stay in their state and they were saying exactly the same
[03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:07.320]  thing you began with Leanne that we we have created this problem and it's wrong
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:10.440]  for us to refuse these refugees well there's a better way to solve this let's
[03:41:10.440 --> 03:41:14.480]  stop the war let's target the people who are starting the war let's go target
[03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:17.800]  Jeb Bush if you want to target somebody because he's still pushing for this type
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:23.080]  of of a policy or whoever you think is responsible for fomenting this war for
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:26.960]  making us trying to make us Al Qaeda's Air Force people who are pushing that
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:31.480]  those are the villains because they're not trying to really solve the problem
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:35.360]  they want a greater larger war right and they want to play on your moral
[03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:41.160]  sympathies to to force your hand in this and you know one of the big issues they
[03:41:41.160 --> 03:41:45.840]  say with the vetting process is that there is no no database to vet the
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:49.040]  people who are coming in they could say anything they want I'm this person I'm
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:54.040]  Jim Jones and it doesn't they haven't mastered the human domain in the Middle
[03:41:54.040 --> 03:41:58.040]  East they don't have this infrastructure that we have set up here in the West where
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:01.120]  they're able to track and surveil everything I mean even though they're
[03:42:01.120 --> 03:42:04.280]  even though they are you know under surveillance and still get away with
[03:42:04.280 --> 03:42:08.280]  this I don't want biometric biometric tracking you know Hewlett Packard has
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:11.200]  made a lot of money essentially being the sole vendor because they're so
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:13.840]  connected inside the Israeli government they're the sole vendor of this
[03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:17.600]  biometric system out there they lost a competition I think at one point the
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:22.160]  EDS so then they purchased EDS and of course you know we could talk about
[03:42:22.160 --> 03:42:26.760]  Carly Fiorina and her deep ties to the CIA but I don't want biometric controls I
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:29.680]  don't want them to create to bring these people because that's the next
[03:42:29.680 --> 03:42:35.160]  situation they go into these other countries they attack them they assassinate
[03:42:35.160 --> 03:42:38.560]  people with their drones they start wars there they create refugees we bring
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:42.080]  refugees over and they also create terrorists people who are angry and what
[03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:47.680]  we did in America and justly so I'm not I'm not saying there's a
[03:42:47.680 --> 03:42:51.280]  equivalent here but I'm saying that understand the blowback that you're
[03:42:51.280 --> 03:42:54.800]  creating here okay bringing those people in so they can do the same thing here
[03:42:54.800 --> 03:42:59.200]  and the next solution that they're gonna sell us land is a biometric tracking
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:03.080]  for everybody but then of course they will not keep us safe exactly but they
[03:43:03.080 --> 03:43:07.240]  won't apply that to their jihadi surrogates because that's exactly what
[03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:10.720]  these people are their surrogates for unrest their surrogates to bring in a
[03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:13.960]  new world order and biometric tracking is gonna be a big part of that right
[03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:17.080]  because they are pushing obviously for the biometric tracking that's what they're
[03:43:17.080 --> 03:43:22.600]  gonna need to be able to vet these refugees but also saying that in 2016
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:27.160]  the big thing is also going to be doing away with encryption because that's
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:31.200]  also stopping them from being able to do this but meanwhile the borders wide open
[03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:35.760]  bring them in and one of the things that you know you want to point out is the
[03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:39.600]  fact that these eight jihadists or whatever that they have been able to
[03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:45.080]  identify at this point they were French nationals they you know it wasn't they
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:49.520]  didn't just come from Syria they were French and so these were young men who
[03:43:49.520 --> 03:43:53.880]  were right for radicalization they couldn't find jobs there was you know
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:57.680]  obviously some sort of an issue there in France I mean a lot of people can't
[03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:01.480]  find jobs there but it wasn't it's not their parents who were brought in from
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:06.320]  Algeria Tunisia all these other places they were fine it's their kids and so
[03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:10.920]  Obama is really pushing this thing of of oh they're frightened of widows and
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:15.240]  orphans and things no it is these very people who grow up and they're angry
[03:44:15.240 --> 03:44:19.600]  about the fact that for what has happened to their country why they had to
[03:44:19.600 --> 03:44:23.480]  become refugees in the first place and now they come here and they're not going
[03:44:23.480 --> 03:44:27.080]  to be able to find jobs because hey guess what most of America can't find
[03:44:27.080 --> 03:44:31.560]  jobs I mean there's a huge job I don't think it's totally economic though and
[03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:34.880]  I don't agree with Bernie Sanders that it's about climate change either I don't
[03:44:34.880 --> 03:44:39.080]  think Al Qaeda and ISIS were created to fight climate change no there's a
[03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:42.640]  religious element to it there's a cultural element to it and yeah there is
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:46.200]  a clash of cultures and that's what they're trying as Bobby Jindal said
[03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:50.000]  and he just dropped out yesterday but he had a great quote he said immigration
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:55.040]  without assimilation is invasion so it takes two to assimilate you know it
[03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:59.560]  takes two to tango okay there's a lot of people who are being brought into
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:04.160]  this into the Western civilization both in Europe and America who do not
[03:45:04.160 --> 03:45:09.320]  wish to be a part of that society and the past immigrants were a great thing
[03:45:09.320 --> 03:45:13.080]  they were booned to our society because they were coming here to live under a
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:15.960]  system that they admired that they wanted to be a part of that they
[03:45:15.960 --> 03:45:19.000]  considered to be better than what they were coming from they understood that
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:22.840]  and so when you had these early waves of European immigrants that were coming in
[03:45:22.840 --> 03:45:26.480]  in massive numbers in the early 20th century that was their mindset they
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:29.840]  were not coming here for a welfare state there was no welfare state now you
[03:45:29.840 --> 03:45:32.600]  have people who are coming here because of a welfare state they're coming here
[03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:36.840]  because they want to take this country over and they just want to loot it okay
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:39.800]  or they're angry and they've got a chip on their shoulder nevertheless when
[03:45:39.800 --> 03:45:43.760]  people come here and they do not wish to assimilate that is nothing short of an
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:47.520]  invasion it was exactly right with that that's of people need to understand
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:51.440]  that he's succinctly stated the situation immigration without assimilation is
[03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:56.000]  invasion and that is what the elites who are pushing world government have
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:45:59.400]  deliberately set up right and well and that's why you look where these where
[03:45:59.400 --> 03:46:03.520]  these jihadists come from there in Belgium it was like the no-go zone they
[03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:06.320]  weren't assimilating into the culture that they were creating their own
[03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:10.800]  separate area right carving that out exactly right and that's where it was
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:15.560]  born and it was able to to breed and manifest this and they were able to move
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:19.600]  about freely and it's a no-go zone and they want those here you know they want
[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:24.200]  to have their own sharia law courts here and we can't allow that to happen and
[03:46:24.200 --> 03:46:28.040]  not saying you know you want to be of religious freedom you know it's the
[03:46:28.040 --> 03:46:32.280]  United States of America but we all have to be under the same rules of this
[03:46:32.280 --> 03:46:37.040]  Constitution here that's right yeah we can argue about history I disagree
[03:46:37.040 --> 03:46:41.720]  completely with that cartoon history that's there but we understand the path
[03:46:41.720 --> 03:46:45.760]  forward regardless of what happened regardless of whether you agree with my
[03:46:45.760 --> 03:46:49.160]  position on Thanksgiving and history and everything else you need to understand
[03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:52.520]  that if you're going to bring deliberately bring people in and try to
[03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:57.320]  balkanize the West that is set up for one reason and one reason only and that
[03:46:57.320 --> 03:47:00.720]  is to destroy Western civilization to destroy borders to destroy the nations
[03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:04.320]  that will stand in the way of the New World Order right and Bernie Sanders is
[03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:08.840]  right to one degree that there is an indirect relationship between terrorism
[03:47:08.840 --> 03:47:12.280]  and climate change and I did a one-minute report on this people be here in
[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:16.240]  this on news but it that relationship is that both of these things have been
[03:47:16.240 --> 03:47:21.320]  created to usher in a world government one of them is a beard for the right the
[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:24.200]  other one is a beard for the left the leftist want to save the environment so
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:28.080]  yeah let's have world government the right wing wants to have open trade and
[03:47:28.080 --> 03:47:31.080]  free trade which they think these transatlantic partnerships are about and
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:36.000]  they want quote-unquote safety and freedom or safety and security so you
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:40.120]  know they support a police state they support this this world government
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:42.960]  they'll be ushered in with a trade agreements but these things are beards
[03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:45.600]  they're not going to give you what you think they're not going to save the
[03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:48.120]  planet they're not going to make you safer they're not going to make you more
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:51.560]  economically prosperous or have free trade it's managed trade it's crony
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:56.440]  capitalism right it's total corporatism and yet they're going to sign onto that
[03:47:56.440 --> 03:47:59.640]  because that's their political bias right and then a lot of people would say
[03:47:59.640 --> 03:48:02.480]  well why would they want to do that it doesn't make sense why would they want
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:06.560]  to bring their own economy down they're separate from us it's just like the
[03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:10.560]  hunger game so they have the districts and everyone everyone who's poor is in
[03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:14.000]  their little district and then you have to drive miles and miles to you know if
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:17.200]  you're allowed to drive somehow you can get there to where the elite say and
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:21.280]  they're you know gorging on food so much that they have to make themselves vomit
[03:48:21.280 --> 03:48:24.560]  so they can continue eating and gorging on food while the rest of the world is
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:29.480]  starving so this is the society that they're wanting to create in the future
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:33.240]  that's why they're okay with globalization open borders because it's not
[03:48:33.240 --> 03:48:37.760]  that they're gonna all come down with us there's gonna be the upper class and
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:41.720]  the lower class it's because the same people created Hitler and created the
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:45.640]  communist they want to lower everything they want to concentrate everything and
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:49.400]  you can see what happened in Bernie Sanders beloved Nicaragua you know where
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:53.840]  they had the bankers are making 700% return on investment but the people
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:58.600]  can't even find food water and medicine right always happens that way it is by
[03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:02.600]  design and both fascism and communism were designed to do that they were
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:07.840]  designed to level the economy leave a few elite in charge and those elite
[03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:11.200]  that's exactly what they want with their their their elitist government they
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:14.400]  don't want a path for people to be able to rise up and challenge them to have
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:18.160]  upward mobility that's why you've got people like FDR setting up the tax
[03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:23.160]  rates putting a an additional burden of 40% taxes on the poorest people on the
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:28.480]  income tax and the payroll tax 90% yeah exactly when he came in the
[03:49:28.480 --> 03:49:32.200]  poor people as I talked about yesterday we're paying 4% income tax period when
[03:49:32.200 --> 03:49:37.440]  he got finished their income tax rate went to 29% and he levied a 15% payroll
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:42.800]  tax on him so he put a 40% burden on these people that's socialism for you
[03:49:42.800 --> 03:49:47.920]  stop the upward mobility put this heavy burden on people because the government
[03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:51.200]  is going to make the choices for your life you won't have the ability to make
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:54.360]  the choices for your own life right and they they don't ever want to look at
[03:49:54.360 --> 03:49:58.800]  those examples of where socialism has completely failed communism has
[03:49:58.800 --> 03:50:02.400]  completely failed they only want to look at Denmark or Sweden or places where
[03:50:02.400 --> 03:50:07.080]  frankly the people there are very homogenous they all think the same so
[03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:10.480]  you're not gonna be able to have that in a society like the United States of
[03:50:10.480 --> 03:50:15.920]  America where we are the melting pot everyone also are starting out from
[03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:19.560]  position where they're much wealthier than people were in Central America when
[03:50:19.560 --> 03:50:24.720]  communism was imposed on them and so they have much farther to fall and they
[03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:28.440]  want to accelerate that that's the clout and piven strategy these are two
[03:50:28.440 --> 03:50:31.760]  socialist political scientists who wanted to do this and they said hey
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:35.400]  we've got to accelerate this somehow so we can create a complete communist state
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:38.600]  that's why they're bringing in the immigrants into the wealthy countries as
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:42.040]  well well absolutely now David stick around because after the break I want
[03:50:42.040 --> 03:50:46.240]  to touch on this moral issue you're seeing this a lot you know prove your

[03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:19.560]  Knight now we we know that there are 20 plus states now who are refusing to
[03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:23.920]  bring in Syrian refugees and then of course this is coming out today a
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:28.560]  Tennessee GOP leader says he wants to round up the Syrian refugees and remove
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:33.120]  them from the state he's actually saying let's use the National Guard to round up
[03:54:33.120 --> 03:54:38.040]  any Syrian refugees who have recently settled there in Tennessee and this may
[03:54:38.040 --> 03:54:42.520]  be this may be really concerned a little bit because it kind of reminded me of an
[03:54:42.520 --> 03:54:46.960]  article that we had at info wars calm did you know America now similar to
[03:54:46.960 --> 03:54:52.200]  1930s Germany and this is Illinois Mike wrote this article and he's talking
[03:54:52.200 --> 03:54:59.200]  about the parallels between 2015 America and 1933 Germany and how we are
[03:54:59.200 --> 03:55:05.680]  basically ripe for another dictator to come in with a populist opinion to round
[03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:12.400]  people up deport ethnic and religious minorities and get it done so this is
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:17.000]  kind of where I'm I'm kind of on the fence here with this with this whole
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:21.160]  refugee crisis bringing them in and out because obviously yes you have people
[03:55:21.160 --> 03:55:25.520]  who are fleeing there a lot of Muslims being killed there as well as
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:29.800]  Christians and others so they're not all jihadists I get that you do have
[03:55:29.800 --> 03:55:34.400]  genuinely people that need help but at the same time you also have jihadists
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:38.800]  that are embedding themselves within these refugee communities and of course
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:44.560]  you know in social media they're really saying well what about Matthew 2535 you
[03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:47.860]  know or what about you know the foreigner residing among you must be
[03:55:47.860 --> 03:55:51.640]  treated as your native born love them as yourself for you or foreigners in
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:57.600]  Egypt so I mean there's moral I would say to my Christian friends who bought
[03:55:57.600 --> 03:56:00.840]  into the leftist paradigm the same thing I say to my Christian friends who bought
[03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:06.080]  into the rightist paradigm that is don't use government as a surrogate and let's
[03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:09.380]  talk about the right first of all talk about how the right looks at the
[03:56:09.380 --> 03:56:12.280]  problems of addiction whether it's alcohol or drugs and they want
[03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:16.640]  prohibition and what they have done is they have used government as a hammer
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:22.160]  against people and they have essentially created a rain of terror again in our
[03:56:22.160 --> 03:56:25.520]  country with this war on drugs and I would say to the people on the left
[03:56:25.520 --> 03:56:30.640]  don't use government as a surrogate to practice charity because that's what
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:34.080]  they're advocating if we want to know what this really should look like take
[03:56:34.080 --> 03:56:38.040]  we're talking about the terror attacks in France and Alexis de Tocqueville who
[03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:41.360]  came from France to America in the early days of the American Republican
[03:56:41.360 --> 03:56:45.600]  wrote democracy in America he was absolutely amazed at the generosity and
[03:56:45.600 --> 03:56:48.960]  the charity of the American people they had the means to do it because they
[03:56:48.960 --> 03:56:51.960]  didn't have a government that was robbing them blind and then doing it very
[03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:55.840]  poorly okay that's the problem with one of the problems of the welfare state so
[03:56:55.840 --> 03:56:58.760]  they had the means to do it they were also motivated to do it because their
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:02.600]  Christian faith if you want to know how society should how society could work
[03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:07.640]  how America succeeded in the past take a look at a democracy in America look at
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:11.280]  his diary as he traveled through the United States that's really the way
[03:57:11.280 --> 03:57:15.080]  that it could work and if we didn't have an American foreign policy that was an
[03:57:15.080 --> 03:57:20.240]  empire building foreign policy that had put Syria and the crosshairs decades
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:24.720]  ago with General Clark talking about this then we wouldn't be involved in
[03:57:24.720 --> 03:57:27.120]  all these foreign entanglements we wouldn't be starting wars we'd be
[03:57:27.120 --> 03:57:30.080]  minding our own business that's where the Christianity starts when we make
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:33.520]  government a god when we say that every problem needs to be solved by the
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:38.240]  government whether it is in income inequality or whether it is adduction
[03:57:38.240 --> 03:57:42.480]  or whether it is some conflict in a foreign land everything needs to be done
[03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:45.720]  by a centralized controlled American government that's where we go off the
[03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:50.080]  rails let's look at how this would be done if we had a free and open society
[03:57:50.080 --> 03:57:52.960]  where people were free to help each other because they had the resources
[03:57:52.960 --> 03:57:56.280]  where we minded our own business and didn't start these wars in the first
[03:57:56.280 --> 03:57:59.760]  place right I think I agree with you back in the day we really did used to
[03:57:59.760 --> 03:58:04.560]  have the moral high ground people it was our Christian values and we did go out
[03:58:04.560 --> 03:58:08.000]  there and we really genuinely wanted to help people yes you can still do it you
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:11.720]  can still help these people individually absolutely well David Knight thank you
[03:58:11.720 --> 03:58:15.240]  so much for your perspective as always on this we're gonna be talking about
