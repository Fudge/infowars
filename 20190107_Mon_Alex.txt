[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:11.000 --> 00:26.000]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.000]  It's a war that comes to mind.
[00:33.000 --> 00:55.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:55.000 --> 01:06.000]  I've got so much incredible news to cover that I've been running around the building the last 10 minutes.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  I'm literally catching my breath right now.
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.000]  Just when you think the Democrats and the globalists can't get any lower, or more arrogant, they do.
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  And I was going over all these clips and all these news articles and what I want to play today, and I've got to be very judicious to even get to half of it.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  And it made me think about all the clips I didn't play in the last few days.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  I've got all this world exclusive stuff to break down. I've got all this other huge news that's breaking.
[01:36.000 --> 01:47.000]  Just every bit of it, more insane than the last. The head of the World Bank appointed by a Democrat has resigned.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  Major world shakeups on that front, big shakeups, the Federal Reserve coming, as we told you.
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  That's all intertwined. The World Bank is the basic foreign arm of the Federal Reserve.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  The World Bank's U.S. controlled, the IMF's U.S. and Europe controlled.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  And the entire globalist order is coming down around us.
[02:10.000 --> 02:24.000]  China is threatening open war. The Chinese dictator has come out and threatened to attack Taiwan, threatened to invade Taiwan, threatened to attack U.S. ships.
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  They had more big threats this morning and the ships entered the South China Sea.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  And there it has not been disputed for hundreds of years. The Chinese now claim it's theirs. They threaten to attack U.S. destroyer.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  This is just some of what's going on. The big mega banks are trying to plunge the U.S. economy.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  America is in a trade war against the globalists fighting for its life.
[02:45.000 --> 03:01.000]  And the average leftist with their talking points has gone into overdrive to create racial and cultural division for a planned civil emergency that we have the documents on from Soros
[03:01.000 --> 03:13.000]  that Info Wars broke last January a year ago and that got no coverage of their plan to incite race riots as the trigger for martial law.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  You'd think that might be big news. But instead I just have Soros funding lawsuits against me to shut me up. Never going to shut anything up.
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  I can die today. The signal goes on. People understand globalism. They understand the new world order. They understand the attack on free press.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  They get it. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the first time in her decades perched on the court trying to deep six the country.
[03:40.000 --> 03:49.000]  She's had lung cancer tumors removed as you know a few weeks ago. Well she didn't show back up for key votes.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  So it looks like she's getting ready to make the jump into hyperspace and we wish her happy trails beyond the veil.
[03:58.000 --> 04:09.000]  I hope she lives a long time. I don't really wish harm on anybody but I tell you it's like that leaf on the tree in autumn that last brown leaf.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  One of the last old Democrats up there running this country down.
[04:14.000 --> 04:34.000]  And you know what told Johnny Cash that in that song you can run on for a long time run on for a long time sooner or later going to cut you down sooner or later going to cut you down.
[04:34.000 --> 04:43.000]  We return the battle for human destiny and so much more straight ahead.
[04:43.000 --> 04:55.000]  Oh and by the way hacker group has released with the second tranche of documents proving they have the smoking gun of inside job 9 11 hacker group releases 9 11 papers says future leak will burn down the deep state.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Stay with us.

[06:32.000 --> 06:45.000]  Go tell that long tongue liar, go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back fighter, tell him that God's gonna cut him down, tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[06:45.000 --> 06:57.000]  It's Monday, January 7th, 2019. My goodness gracious is the world not in crisis, but let me make the big announcement.
[06:57.000 --> 07:04.000]  I've been sitting back watching Trump very, very carefully to see if he's A for real, which I know he is at a gut level.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  And I've already seen through his action and B, is he gonna go on the offense, which is the only way out of this?
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  Or is he going to start going on the defense and let me announce to everyone.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Donald Trump is big time on the offense.
[07:18.000 --> 07:34.000]  And he's got a list of things like any good executive, any good faithful American would do of what is the top priorities that he's following in that order of prioritization.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  And his moves against the chai comms that are the number one global threat against this country allied with the criminals inside our government.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  It's the nexus point, the axis of evil.
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.000]  That combine is being dismantled savagely.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  And that's why you see the traitors saying kill him, saying murderous family, saying impeach him, that's why you see them freaking out.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  Because these flat rags know that their time is very, very short.
[08:07.000 --> 08:23.000]  But we're now entering the beginning of the maelstrom, the black squall, the tempest, the tornado, the typhoon, the hurricane.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  This is it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:35.000]  And I'm just glad America wasn't totally taken over at the end, because we were set up to just be collapsed right into the new world order, right into the EU and the chai comms.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  And it's just an incredible time.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  Even the New York Times has the headline.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  Zero hedge has it.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  President Xi orders Chinese army to prepare for war.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  Chinese ships today when a U.S. destroyer went through for right of navigation, an area that's always been open.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  The China does no claim on, but they are claiming they have threatened to attack our ships.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Told them to turn back or they would be sunk, the destroyer and others.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  Well, the destroyers didn't turn back.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  And if the Chinese would have fired on those ships, they would have been sunk.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  And then we'll see if they want to try to get their ICBMs or cruise missiles off the ground or out of their submarines.
[09:18.000 --> 09:34.000]  But the satellites and the weapons systems, you better believe, and the lurking, fixed-wing platforms lurking around China were being watched at every point and being prepared to be targeted.
[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  So when Trump does stuff like this, the full Pentagon has the teeth out, claws out from space, from the ground, through cyber commands with the whole deal ready to take the chai comms out.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  That's how close we are to World War 4.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  The Cold War was called World War 3 by Russian and U.S. tacticians accurately.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  This is World War 4, and if it goes hot, it's the end of the planet, probably.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  Now, the United States has almost launched preemptive attacks on China before, and I'm hoping that's not what's going to happen.
[10:08.000 --> 10:16.000]  But if there's any evidence that they're going to go hot with any of those submarines or any of those silos, Trump's going to hit China.
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  And that's why they have Mattis and all these other traders up there saying, oh, we made sure to never be out of town so that he wouldn't nuke people.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  Yeah, that's right, because the U.S. has a policy until Trump got in under Obama to absorb a first strike under the Presidential Decision Directive.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  Well, guess what? That directive's been rescinded, buckos.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  We're not just going to sit here and bend over to the chai comms or anybody else.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  If they try it, there's going to be a nuclear war, they're going to get their ass blown off.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  And that's why Trump's been trying to be nice with Russia, at least on the surface, so that we don't fight a two-front war that we lose.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  But believe me, there'll be a nuclear winter, but we can wipe the chai comms out in 20 minutes.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  20 minutes, there'll be 500 million of them dead in a hammer.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  Every one of their cities will be vaporized, and that's just the old-fashioned weapons.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  But don't think the chai comms don't have some dirty stuff.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  They're going to release bio weapons the minute they get nuked.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  They've got sleeper cells all over Europe and all over the United States with race-specific bio weapons that kill Anglos.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  So don't think it's going to be that easy, but don't worry, we've got bio weapons as well.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  Everybody's going to die if the trigger gets pulled.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  If I was a selfish person, I'd be in some armored redoubt in Idaho that just looked like a hilltop with my family.
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  But I'm not. I'm here, and I believe in God, and I believe that we pray and we take action that this can all be averted.
[11:49.000 --> 12:02.000]  But America can't just roll over to the dirty proboscis of the New World Order and let it run its stinking tentacle into us.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  It's not going to happen.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  So it's a big world, big things happening.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  Everything Trump's done to the chai comms and their allies has cut their money off, cut their fraud off, cut their intelligence agencies off,
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  arrest the head of their biggest spy network with their 5G control grid coming in.
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  Last year, Trump takes aim at World Bank over China loans.
[12:24.000 --> 12:33.000]  U.S. back money backing Chinese projects in Africa, Latin America, you name it.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  As I told you, getting loans cheaper than U.S. companies or citizens do.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  And the private federal reserve says, oh, China can have 10% growth rates. We can't even have a 4.5. That's too fast.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  So they raise interest rates on us, but not on the chai comms. And Trump's mad about that.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  So he said it was wrong, and he said, I'll remove you.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  So he said, OK, I'll resign. That was a year and a half ago.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  October 2017, Trump made a big deal about that.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  That's an article out of foreign policy, especially the CFR arm of the Washington Post.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  So when you read that, that's the establishment talking. And now he's stepped down.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  Just another big sign. Jim Young Kim resigns as president of the World Bank.
[13:20.000 --> 13:30.000]  He will stand down by February 1 for private sector before expiring of his term in three years.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  Jim Young Kim is to step down as the head of the World Bank, sending shockwaves through the international aid community.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  Oh, the aid community. Oh, yes.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  Aiding the destruction of the sellout of the U.S., the Panama Canal, everything else.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  And oh, he was appointed, of course, by the Democrats.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  He was appointed by Barack Hussein Obama.
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  So all the CHICOM officers are being removed out of our country's system.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  We created the World Bank. We run it. Supposedly to spread aid to the world.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  It's been spreading globalism and destruction of the third world.
[14:09.000 --> 14:18.000]  And the CHICOMs come in and bankrolling Chinese projects all over the world to exploit populations at levels never seen.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  It makes the British and the Dutch colonists look like angels.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  The Chinese leave nothing for anyone.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  But it's okay.
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  World Bank Kim to resign effective February 1.
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  President Xi orders Chinese army to prepare for war and threatens to invade Taiwan or attack U.S. ships.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  And today they threatened it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:53.000]  China confronts U.S. with fury as American missile destroyer sails through disputed South China Sea and challenged a Beijing.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  China officially threatened to attack the ships and warn Washington they may attack.
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  Scrambling warships and aircraft to intercept and make threats upon the ships.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  In landmark speech, Xi threatens violence against Taiwan, demands peaceful reunification.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  U.S. destroyer sails through disputed South China Sea as trade talks kick off in Beijing.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  We urge the United States to immediately cease this kind of provocation.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  So I think that's some pretty big news, isn't it?
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  And you'd think back home in America, the average American, the average leftist would figure this out and stand with their country.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  But no, they have been born and bred to hate the nation by the globalists in this long-term plan to bring us down.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  And they believe Americans standing for sovereignty and the Bill of Rights and Constitution and prosperity and justice
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  and prison reform and pulling out of all these wars to be able to fight the chicoms and defend the border.
[15:51.000 --> 15:59.000]  They believe Trump's the bad guy. They love war. They want to keep blacks in prison longer. The left now loves Jim Crow.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[17:22.000 --> 17:38.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the Empire of the World. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.000 --> 18:00.000]  In his former colony, the U.S. had to save the Empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:51.000 --> 21:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide as another Chi Com operative. He certainly gave them US money for Chinese globalist projects around the world, steps down from the World Bank leadership as the head of it.
[21:12.000 --> 21:25.000]  And it's absolutely central and critical to everything for folks to understand that the globalist, the Rockefeller UN combined set up China since 49 to take over the world economically and militarily.
[21:25.000 --> 21:35.000]  And they gave them all one sided deals. We've been in Afghanistan 18 years, mainly so that China can now extract up to $44 billion a year in rare earth minerals.
[21:35.000 --> 21:48.000]  We extract zero out of Afghanistan. We're there for their security so they can come in with their heavy equipment and mine it out and then a few US and global traders make money with the Chi Coms.
[21:48.000 --> 22:05.000]  That's how these companies are profitable. If you've got $100 billion on average a year of US security in Afghanistan alone to haul all that lithium and other goodies out of there, then it's pretty profitable.
[22:05.000 --> 22:20.000]  Remember when we took over Iraq and the US got zero of the oil but China and France got it all? And everybody was saying, oh, Bush is doing it for oil. No, Bush was a globalist trader.
[22:20.000 --> 22:38.000]  His father set up the deal with China in the 70s to open it up and do this deal. George Herbert Walker, the devil, the globalist, the Democrat Republican, the Rockefeller Republican, he set up the deal with the Rockefellers in the 70s.
[22:38.000 --> 22:53.000]  And when Nixon balked at it being a one-sided deal, they removed him. Early 70s. Has been going on before that, but it's been official. So you have to understand, we go in and spend, what was the Iraq War? $3 trillion?
[22:53.000 --> 23:05.000]  To secure trillions in oil for the Chi Coms. Nice little deal, but then the money's back channeled to the Bushes who walk around where cowboy has to go, I'm a good taxing boy.
[23:05.000 --> 23:15.000]  I'm going down to Dairy Queen having me about Buster today.
[23:15.000 --> 23:31.000]  Think about that. In Iraq, and I can go further. Oh, oh, who had the deal? In 1980, the deal was signed in 1978, Jimmy Carter transferred the Panama Canal that no one can even build today, they think.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  Tens of thousands died building it. The French couldn't build 10% of it. We came in and built it.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  Teddy Roosevelt, we just gave it to him.
[23:42.000 --> 23:54.000]  Just like we gave him the missile technology and the hydroelectric technology and the aerospace technology and the nanotech technology and the genetic engineering technology.
[23:54.000 --> 24:03.000]  And then had regulations here, which I agree with, that didn't let us do immoral things like cloning, but let them all do it in China.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  How you like them apples?
[24:07.000 --> 24:18.000]  So this has been the complete bleeding out of America, basically taking blood transfusions from us and giving it to China until we're now a shriveled person from these vampires.
[24:18.000 --> 24:29.000]  And Trump says, you know what? You're not going to fully kill us. And they go, you are the enemy. Get rid of him, says Hollywood and the Democrats and the neocons and the woke William Crystal.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  Now the left's like, man, we like William Crystal, the neocon war monger that was for all these evil wars and selling America out in one side of trade deals.
[24:37.000 --> 24:52.000]  Now the Democrats on MSNBC call him woke and hip hop rappers go, man, you're woke, bro. Praising their war monger and saying, how dare Trump?
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  How dare him try to pull us out of these wars? How dare him pass criminal justice reform so black people don't get triple the sentences for the same drugs that whites use?
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  How dare you literally are saying this?
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  But then Kanye West comes out and says, no, I'm 100% behind Trump. He said he'd do that. He did that. That's a really nice thing.
[25:14.000 --> 25:24.000]  And I can't believe the Democrats helped engineer putting black people in prison. Hillary Clinton got it passed, called them animals, so they need to be brought to heal like a dog.
[25:24.000 --> 25:35.000]  So she gets praised by people like Sean King and, you know, the new Black Panther Party and all these other groups who will talk about when we come back.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  Who are busily trying to get a race war going in this country.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  Who is that white lady that poses a black lady and she still doesn't?
[25:47.000 --> 26:00.000]  Rachel Dolezal. Every time I see this Sean King guy on the news, it's like a white guy with a little eyeliner mustache.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Dalcom X. I mean, I don't know what's going on here.
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  But why is it always a white dude posing like a black guy leading black people into rioting?
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  And I'm talking about, of course, all the countries on the edge of war and all this craziness is happening.
[26:20.000 --> 26:29.000]  Even after Tip, Texas Sheriff and Sean King push false narrative in Jasmine Barnes' murder.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  Oh, yeah. He was already arrested Saturday afternoon in front of the news cameras.
[26:35.000 --> 26:46.000]  A black guy, other shooter black guy, they come in, they admit that they thought it was a mistaken identity, thought it was a drug car at 6.30 in the morning at this gas station, convenience store.
[26:46.000 --> 26:54.000]  They shoot the portable girl and they were still tweeting at that time that it was a white supremacist.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  There's your white supremacist, your TV viewer, two black guys.
[26:58.000 --> 27:08.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that's what this comes down to and the media seizing on this, pushing this narrative, hyping it till the end of the earth.
[27:08.000 --> 27:20.000]  And then it took them till Sunday night to start retracting, not the old stories, but saying, okay, it was mistaken identity, probably a drug deal gone bad or something, or they thought it was a drug deal and shot these people.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  And we're not going to show you mug shots. We're not going to show you.
[27:25.000 --> 27:35.000]  Oh, it's a black guy. We've been saying for a week it's a white guy and there's white devils and there's a national crime epidemic of whites killing blacks, which isn't true.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  No, they just kind of removed the story out of the news.
[27:38.000 --> 27:52.000]  And now we learn that Sean King last Wednesday was contacted by folks telling him exactly who the shooter and the driver were.
[27:52.000 --> 28:09.000]  But he passed that tip on to the sheriff who sat on it and they kept putting out the composite even Saturday night after one guy was in custody and it already pled guilty.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Did you hear that?
[28:11.000 --> 28:23.000]  He already had him and the sheriff was putting out whitey because he got a milk it for every drop you can get in race-based politics.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  That's Sheriff Ed Gonzalez down there in the blue oasis of Houston, the blue sewer.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  So there you go. And then you got Sean King. Can we put Sean King up?
[28:37.000 --> 28:46.000]  I mean, I could take a black marker and put a little thin mustache up there and then say, I mean, he looks like a famous 1940s actor.
[28:46.000 --> 28:56.000]  Who's the guy in the Gamba the Wind played Red Butler? I mean, that's what he actually looks like. It's a white dude.

[30:13.000 --> 30:20.000]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.

[33:20.000 --> 33:42.000]  Okay, Roger Stone is only popping in for one segment because I saw it in the New York Times yesterday and most of the time the New York Times is lying or spinning or twisting, especially when it has to do with America or Trump or the Second Amendment or Christians or anything else that's good.
[33:42.000 --> 33:51.000]  But they were saying that Roger Stone, according to insiders, was the creator of the idea of a wall.
[33:51.000 --> 33:57.000]  And so I called Roger this morning and I said, is that true?
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  And he said, well, yes, but let me be specific and clarify.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  And it's not about who gets the credit, the media trying to spin it as a good rhetoric point, but a bad idea.
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  I now more than ever think it's a great idea because it's a symbol of national sovereignty.
[34:13.000 --> 34:21.000]  It's a make work project, but also it will save a lot of lives and the U.S. has built walls around Iraq.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  We've put up fences in Afghanistan.
[34:23.000 --> 34:35.000]  And the idea that the Democrats are demonizing the idea that we even have borders and that they say that it's evil, if we even have a barrier, is just ridiculous.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  So it's a symbol.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  And he has shut the government down.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  He said he wouldn't back down.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  He hasn't.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  They try to spend it and say, well, the Democrats may agree to a metal barrier.
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  If you've got 30 foot metal slacks that are bars, it's a wall.
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  A cell wall is a membrane.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  It's not stone or concrete or metal.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  A wall can be anything.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  It's the Chinese Great Firewall of censorship.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  If it blocks people, if it's physical, I think steel is better than even concrete.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  And the designers have said it is the best design to not be scalable and to not have people get through it.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  But they spin it like he's not keeping his promise.
[35:19.000 --> 35:29.000]  All Trump's done is kept his promises, now especially trying to pull out of Iraq and other areas and being blocked by out-of-control Pentagon individuals.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  He promised to get prison reform through.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  He did that.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  He's not going to go through all the accomplishments, getting out of the TPP, getting thousands of factories to come back.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  But so we can talk to the admitted progenitor, the coiner of the wall, Roger Stone.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  Talk about an influential guy.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  Trump's chief advisor up until the middle of the campaign hounded by Robert Mueller.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  Also is asking him, is it true that Mueller is going through his garbage as well?
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  I've been going through ours.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  I know at my house and here at the office.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  So Roger, getting your take on this wall situation and the inside baseball on that as the man who had the idea to do it.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  I think you're uniquely set to be able to talk about it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:29.000]  Well, first Alex, I appreciate the opportunity because it's Donald Trump who identified unfettered immigration as a burning issue for this country.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  It's Donald Trump who came up with the idea of a barrier on our southern border.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  All I did was suggest the rhetorical flourish of calling it the wall.
[36:38.000 --> 36:47.000]  And then he road tested it out on the road in rallies and in mass crowd events.
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  And it was a hit and therefore he continued to use it.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  But as I've said many times here on informers, nobody tells Donald Trump what to say or what to do.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  He is certainly open to political advice.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  You know, listen, but he makes his own decisions and he identified immigration.
[37:07.000 --> 37:17.000]  And he's the one who inserted it in his announcement speech after he came down on the escalator, for which, of course, the National Press excoriated it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:25.000]  By looking at the New York Times headline, Roger Stone invented wall as a way to remind Donald Trump to bash immigrants.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  We want to stop the flow of 90% of the heroin and fentanyl into our country.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Well, let's be clear. First, they demonize you and lie about you.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  And they take something true that he wanted a barrier.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  You should call it a wall. You know, it's stronger. You're a builder.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  The iconography is more powerful, which is true.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  He tested it works well. Plus, it's what he already believed.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  It's what he's been saying for decades. It's what any sovereign country has.
[37:48.000 --> 37:57.000]  And then they spin it like he was so addled and couldn't pay attention and had no memory that you developed this to manipulate his narcissism.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  Total made up crap. That part's not true.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Yeah, nobody manipulated Donald Trump.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  And I was frankly surprised that he made immigration the centerpiece of his announcement speech.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  And it had the desired effect.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  And the wall, as you know, came somewhat after that.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  But it'll keep hanging tough and it's driving the Democrats insane.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  I agree with you. A metal barrier, you know, razor type spikes at the top is a wall.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  Any way you want to slice it may be less expensive than concrete.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  We had a great show in the world the other day.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  You could make this out of hemp generated concrete, even less expensively.
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  But the key thing is that he's not going to fall in the face of extraordinary establishment pressure.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  There was a major piece in yesterday's New York Times, the people versus Donald Trump making the case for impeachment.
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  And it was pure olinsky. Everything they accused Donald Trump of every single thing is exactly what they have done.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  What Mueller and the Clinton and the Bushes and the Deep State have done.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  It was tough to ask. It was like Alice in Wonderland. It was so out of touch with reality.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  Roger, pulling back from this in just a hypocrisy, here's an example.
[39:14.000 --> 39:22.000]  Golden Globes winner decries the wall surrounded by a wall of barricades and security.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  Dogs, federal police, state police, local police, border patrol,
[39:28.000 --> 39:36.000]  they brought them all in to guard the Hollywood turds who live behind 10-foot, 20-foot walls around their neighborhoods.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  Then 10-foot walls around their houses, sometimes 20-foot walls.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  I know Quentin Quarantino's house because I would do somebody that lived next door to him.
[39:44.000 --> 39:54.000]  It had, Roger, 25-foot walls with spikes on it all the way around the house in the middle of the Hollywood Hills next to $10 million houses.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  His house was over $10 million. But this latest guy, this is on infowars.com, folks.
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  Golden Globes winner Brad Simpson described the wall as hateful last night while surrounded by a wall of barricades, security and armed police officers.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  So they were behind a 10-foot spike wall and hundreds and hundreds of police.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  He said they tell us that we should be scared of people that are different from us.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  They tell us that we should have walls around ourselves.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  He said adding those forces of hate and fear are still with us.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  This is literally the globalists trying to collapse our country.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  Roger, this is crazy. We have another AP reporter.
[40:31.000 --> 40:42.000]  I'm sure you saw this last week on national television on Meet the Press and MSNBC say there is no caravan and that it's made up by white supremacists.
[40:42.000 --> 40:51.000]  Now, look, the whole thing is extraordinarily phony. Let's face it, the hypocrisy, the stench of hypocrisy ground these globalist Hollywood types is out of control.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  They travel with armed guards. They live behind jaded communities and high walls.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  We have nothing against people of color. We have nothing against people from foreign countries.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  My wife's an immigrant. Donald Trump's wife is an immigrant.
[41:03.000 --> 41:15.000]  But there's a legal way to come to America and anyone who denies that those who are coming here illegally are bringing drugs and crime in disease is ignoring the statistics and the facts.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Donald Trump's trying to protect the country. This isn't about bashing anybody.
[41:19.000 --> 41:28.000]  It's about having an orderly system and legal system of immigration as opposed to letting criminal mobs just invade the country at will.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  Barriers are part of territorialism, part of security, part of privacy and any civilization.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  We all have front doors for a reason. We all have screens on the windows for a reason.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  That's why we have locks on our core doors. Everyone gets this.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And I just can't lose a mantra of your white supremacist.
[41:47.000 --> 41:55.000]  That's what we're talking about, about the Democrats, by Nancy Pelosi and Cortez, is that the wall is a monument to white supremacy.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  No, I think it's a wall to sovereignty and survival.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Well, Donald Trump has said it dozens and dozens of times. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[42:05.000 --> 42:24.000]  And I'm very proud of the way he's hung tough on this in the face of a mountain of like tuberation and just a tsunami of hate directed at his attention when all he's trying to do is protect the American people from rising crime and epidemic of drugs and disease.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  Well, Roger, stay right there, because I said we don't do one segment. You've got to go.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  But I want to do a few more minutes on the side because we didn't get into Mueller and breaking into your trash can.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  All the latest is final report, supposedly coming out next month, how desperate he is.
[42:36.000 --> 42:46.000]  And I also want to play that clip, as I mentioned it, of MSNBC reporter, AP reporter on MSNBC saying there is no caravan.
[42:46.000 --> 42:55.000]  I mean, this is insane. And then more on two black dudes now admit they shot the portal of black girl and the white folks are still getting blamed.
[42:55.000 --> 43:17.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  That's been incredible.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.000 --> 43:51.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.

[46:17.000 --> 46:30.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[46:30.000 --> 46:41.000]  We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want people out of the suburbs.
[46:41.000 --> 46:50.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's the David Knight show.
[46:50.000 --> 46:56.000]  Never missed your show. Any day. I mean, never.
[46:56.000 --> 47:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.000 --> 47:46.000]  You can see the Vanguard of thousands of illegal aliens from Central and South America trying to break over the Mexico San Diego border. This is still ongoing. This is from a few weeks ago.
[47:46.000 --> 47:59.000]  There's more footage of what happening at night just last weekend as everybody knows. But according to MSNBC guest AP White House reporter claims migrant caravan never reached the U.S. border.
[47:59.000 --> 48:11.000]  She's trying to get the job from Jim Acosta for Biggest Liar. He says it doesn't exist. Remember when he grabs the microphone back and then they said that was fake footage we put out.
[48:11.000 --> 48:22.000]  Texas Monthly gave me the Bum Steer Award. I'm going to cover the magazine for putting out a fake video. Any more on can see we just zoomed in. I'm telling you these people are next level.
[48:22.000 --> 48:30.000]  The caravans are real. Bigger ones are coming. The UN is sponsoring them. And then they have the nerve to say it doesn't exist or she is.
[48:30.000 --> 48:45.000]  On the back and forth on where he wanted the wall and whether the wall would be in California. And what I heard from the White House press secretary this morning, communications director Sarah Sanders, press secretary, was a lot of fear mongering.
[48:45.000 --> 49:00.000]  Sarah Sanders saying this morning 4,000 terrorists are apprehended at the border every day. That's not true. Jacob Sobroff will fact check that for us in a moment. But the president is also talking about smugglers and talking about all the crime that pours in on the border.
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  Is this just all about making it seem like there is a crisis? Is that their strategy?
[49:06.000 --> 49:18.000]  Certainly the president's remarks right there, rambling as they were, were delivered like a campaign speech. It wasn't like an update to reporters about legislation. It was the same rhetoric we've often heard about him discussing how this threat that exists at the border.
[49:18.000 --> 49:27.000]  Couched in the same sort of dangerous terms we heard about that caravan, which of course never did arrive, at the southern border of the United States. That this is still feels for the president, it's a base play.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  It's an attempt to be strong for the people who have supported him. That he feels like he can't give them up.
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's Jonathan Lermey, AP reporter, and then Katie Turd. That's actually her name. T-U-R-D.
[49:41.000 --> 49:49.000]  What do you change your name? Okay, that's fake news. Her name is Katie Turd. But I mean, what an incredible liar.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  You've got 200,000 dead in Mexico. Hundreds of thousands they can't find. Mass graves everywhere.
[49:54.000 --> 50:05.000]  Venezuela, they ate their dogs and cats three years ago. A thousand starving to death a day. Total war all over the place. Society collapsing. Even the few safe zones breaking down like Cancun.
[50:05.000 --> 50:17.000]  And they're up there saying it doesn't exist. Show again. What do you make of this, Roger, where they go next level? When are we going to hit peak lying?
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.000]  And as a political strategist, I know you to tell the truth or I wouldn't work with you. They always call you a dirty trickster. You kind of play along with it. I guess you want the mystique.
[50:24.000 --> 50:32.000]  So the ladies think that's cool. But I actually know you to be a straight shooter and not even want to fudge anything, which is good because that's how you lose credibility.
[50:32.000 --> 50:40.000]  They point at you and me and call us fake news. And these people are literally out there with their butt hanging out saying the sky isn't blue.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  What is this tactic? Or is this just desperation? Or what is this?
[50:44.000 --> 50:56.000]  You know, unfortunately, the two parts strategy, Alex, they have, you know, access to the airwaves, access to the Internet, and they spend their lives in an outrageous campaign of propaganda and distortion.
[50:56.000 --> 51:04.000]  At the same time, they're trying to silence us. They want to take info wars off the Internet. They want to take us off the social media platforms.
[51:04.000 --> 51:14.000]  And that's not just us. It's just hundreds of thousands of individual, if not millions, individual conservatives, libertarians, Trump supporters, and let there be no mistake about it.
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  If they take me down, if they take you down, if they take you into the wars down, Tucker Carlson is right behind us. So is Sean Hannity.
[51:21.000 --> 51:31.000]  They're already trying to take Mike Savage down. Rush Limbaugh or Ingram, all the people I love, all the people who are telling the truth, they're all targeted.
[51:31.000 --> 51:39.000]  They have a better chance of spinning their lives if they can silence us. So it's a two-part strategy and it's insidious.
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  They really want to grab control of the political narrative, which they lost control of in 2016.
[51:45.000 --> 51:53.000]  I learned about this at about six o'clock this morning, and then I reached out and was told, hey, you know, we're trying to work it out with Twitter.
[51:53.000 --> 52:02.000]  We think it was a Southern Probably Law Center operative or something, which literally took down Franklin Graham on Facebook and they had to take it back. They said for dehumanization.
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  Ali Alexander was threatened by a Marxist that said, I'm going to come kill you. He said, well, be ready for the ambulance.
[52:07.000 --> 52:13.000]  Twitter suspended at Ali Alexander, who's a political strategist and a great guy, Jack Pasalba tweeted it.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  I was asked not to talk about it because they want to try to fix it behind the scenes, but now that it's broken, I'm going to go ahead and cover it.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  Ali Alexander permanently banned on Twitter, Roger.
[52:23.000 --> 52:32.000]  Look, they banned me a year ago, more than a year ago. I had 450,000 followers because I hurt Dick Tapper's delicate feelings.
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  Their rules are elastic. They only apply for conservatives, libertarians, info warriors.
[52:37.000 --> 52:47.000]  When they advocate violence or when they advocate pedophilia, as Mindy Robinson has exposed right here on the Alex Jones show, that's no problem at all.
[52:47.000 --> 52:54.000]  Those people don't get banned. The people with a little blue check mark who still hate, who advocate violence, they're untouched.
[52:54.000 --> 53:01.000]  But if you are a conservative, they will invent reasons to censor you and take you off the platform.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  Well, I love how they left the guy up that said, I'm going to come kill you.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  And then you're like, okay, well, get ready. You're going to be leaving in an ambulance. That's a normal response.
[53:10.000 --> 53:18.000]  That's the ultimate crime to a leftist is to say, I will defend myself against you.
[53:18.000 --> 53:30.000]  Yeah, no, it's obvious that it is very contrived. The president needs to direct his Department of Justice to undertake antitrust action immediately against these social media giants.
[53:30.000 --> 53:43.000]  His prospects for reelection, the prospects for the passage of the rest of his reform agenda is reelection, even in a legacy, all dependent on access to a free, vibrant, robust, unfettered internet.
[53:43.000 --> 53:51.000]  Isn't it good news that Louis Gohmert, and I want to shift here briefly into the Mueller, let you get back to the reporters you've got there on this very subject, Internet censorship.
[53:51.000 --> 54:02.000]  Gohmert said to Sundar Pachai, basically, I know you're lying, and we're going to strip your immunity under Section 230 away. You are censoring.
[54:02.000 --> 54:13.000]  And now we have all these new internal Google emails from high-level folks admitting it, and then they're publicly in news, vice presidents admitting that they're putting down searches that are negative for Democrats.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  I mean, this is, this is, I've never seen such naked lying.
[54:16.000 --> 54:31.000]  Well, in fact, it's a perfect segue because Adam Schiff and the House Democrats want Robert Mueller to prosecute me for perjury when I sat there with you and we watched Sundar Pai under oath to lie, after lie, after lie.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  China, I couldn't even find it on a map, he said. We're not working in China. Oh, no, we're not tracking anybody.
[54:37.000 --> 54:47.000]  There's no effort to disadvantage conservatives or Republicans in our gold search. I mean, this guy purging himself repeatedly and he will pay no penalty whatsoever.
[54:47.000 --> 54:57.000]  Meanwhile, while while Mueller and the boys are trying to invent perjury on my case, we're nonexist. I told the truth before the House Intelligence Committee, I went voluntarily.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  I was there for four and a half hours. Everything I said was true.
[55:00.000 --> 55:11.000]  And that brings us to the final point. It's all over the news that they're getting in your trash. Somebody gets in the trash at my house. Neighbors have seen it. We've caught it on video.
[55:11.000 --> 55:18.000]  They're breaking into your trash. This means Mueller is really, really desperate. You think they're going to try to cook up a perjury trap on you? Or what do you think?
[55:18.000 --> 55:26.000]  Well, I think it's going to be very hard because I've had some of the best attorneys in the country look at my testimony and they just don't see it.
[55:26.000 --> 55:40.000]  Because he said that I made errors. They would be errors in my favor, meaning I did forget that I had exculpatory text messages in an old cell phone that proved definitively that Randy Kredico was my source regarding the significance in the October release.
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.000]  Exactly. So you found evidence backing up what you said. You can't be. In fact, you have such a great memory on all this. It blows me away. I have a great memory. I can't remember half this stuff.
[55:47.000 --> 55:58.000]  But Roger, regardless, Mueller, it looks like is going to come up completely empty because there's nothing there. Or will they try to use Corsi completely discredited to then bear false witness?
[55:58.000 --> 56:07.000]  Well, that was, I think, their plan. Their plan appears to have fallen apart when he refused to plead to one count of giving me emails that he never gave me.
[56:07.000 --> 56:18.000]  But Alex, for those who say this is wrapping up, I point out the judge just extended the grand jury for Mr. Mueller by another six months. So you wonder whether they're ever going to wrap up?
[56:18.000 --> 56:34.000]  And you wonder whether Mr. Mueller is focused on Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, myself? Who knows? I mean, it is exactly as the president said a witch hunt and a whole new round of House Intelligence Committee means more giant legal bills for me.
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  I mean, I lost my health and life insurance in seven weeks. I couldn't pay the premiums.
[56:39.000 --> 56:49.000]  No, I understand. And then they line, say you're worth 10 million. They just make, they say net worth. He's put up a fake number on the Internet and then no one supports you because they think you've got all this money.
[56:49.000 --> 56:59.000]  Roger doesn't want to get into tales here, but he lost his house and he didn't want to make him happy. But just tell them, Roger, they've almost bankrupted you. He lost all your lobbying clients. They're running you into the ground.
[56:59.000 --> 57:12.000]  That's the whole plan. They try to weaken so you don't have the resources to fight. And then like Mike Flynn, you're forced to plead guilty to something you didn't do. People can go to stonedefensefund.com and help me. You've been an enormous help Alex.
[57:12.000 --> 57:23.000]  So is everyone at M4 Wars? I am fighting for my life. They try to crush you financially. No, I'm not worth $20 million or $10 million or $1 million. That's all fake news on the Internet.
[57:23.000 --> 57:36.000]  Believe me, the stuff they say about me is pure crap. I mean, yeah, you could technically say all the equipment, all the everything is, you know, worth. You can say intellectual property could be extended. I'd be worth $10 million. They're in $10 million sitting there in a bank.
[57:36.000 --> 57:44.000]  But they say that so we don't get support, but the listeners understand it's not true. They stand with us in FullWarsStore.com. We need your support as well there. We'll be right back. Thank you, Roger.

[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm going to play this important report that John Bowen put together on Taiwan facing a Chinese offensive, a Chai Con offensive.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Then we come back. Start your engines. I've mentioned a lot of this news, but I'm going to go into Ruth Bader Ginsburg, not showing up after her cancer surgery.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I'm going to get into the young Turks caught in more incredible race baiting. I'm going to get into Alexander Cortez and the craziness she's involved in.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  This poor little black girl killed by two black men. They've pled guilty and the media is trying to cover it up now. It turns out the sheriff knew three days before and basically it looks like, well, he knew and nothing was done.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  It's crazy. He kept saying it was a white guy. So we're going to break all that down the other side, but here is the report.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  They've had everything from the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Texas Monthly.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Try to piss down the backs of the American people and tell them that Info Wars had a horrible year.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Info Wars had an amazing year of being directly over the target and predicting the launch of nationalism worldwide, the rebirth of populism,
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  and that the globalists would try to kill the economy and that they would try to collapse our borders. We're proud to be here telling the truth.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  We're proud to be here standing firm for this nation. Now, because you'd think this would be top story on the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  I saw this this morning and I went, wow, let me type that into Google and Bing and there was nothing being said.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And I said, well, I don't just believe zero hedge. I said, not that they're bad, but Ronald Reagan said trust me verify.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  So I searched what they said and guess what? It was in the People's Daily. It was in the official statements of the Communist Party of China.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  And in fact, I'd seen a lot of this the last week, the dictator for life, Xi, saying he'll, hey, we already took over Hong Kong, we'll invade Taiwan,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  which we have a defense agreement with, and weapons, including high tech, any aircraft, any ship.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And that was a whole story in of itself that he's threatening, oh, I'm sorry, not just to invade Taiwan and meeting at the big Communist Bureau with live video feeds,
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  with them chanting, we're ready for war. There's almost no US media coverage. And if there is, it's pro-Beijing.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  I mean, it's like this one story, I could do 10 hours emergency broadcast on air. Oh my God, look at their weapons. Look at what they're doing.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  In landmark speech, Xi threatens violence against Taiwan. I didn't just believe this. I went and read it, the damn commie newspaper, demands peaceful reunification.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  So he says we're ready to invade Taiwan. We're ready to blast US forces. We're ready to invade wherever we want.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  He said we're going to take islands and physically hold them that in 2000 year old maps, the Chinese never even laid claim to in the Philippines.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Oh, I'm sure the Filipinos will roll over to that. I'm joking. Didn't go too well for the Japanese. So this guy is on his power trip.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  And let's go through this article, him at the meetings, the videos, the shows, TV viewers, because he's up there with all of them lined up.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  They're weird black suits and everything. And you read these quotes by him and he says, we've already taken Hong Kong.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  We're going to take Taiwan. We'll use forces if we need to. Our militaries are based there.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  If the US tries to block us and enlist these islands that are down in Vietnam and off the coast, we're talking like hundreds of yards off the coast of the Philippines,
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  that we're going to start attacking US ships. So here's the announcement.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  The dictator who heads up a communist dictatorship that's killed five times what Hitler did is threatening to preemptively invade Taiwan and attack the United States.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And that's not the top story in the United States. It's a billion, 400 million people.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  They've got thousands of nuclear weapons. They've got missiles that can hit us because Clinton gave it to them.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  The average American better start getting what's going on. They've been shooting at our ships. They've been attacking our submarines.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And man, in some cases, they're 800 miles away from China. And then he goes over it as a video newscast threatening to preemptively attack the US.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I mean, this is like way past the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is insane.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Well, all last week, the top news story in Texas, and one of the biggest stories in the United States,
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  was that a vicious knuckle-dragging white supremacist at 6.30 in the morning in Houston, Texas last Sunday pumped a bunch of rounds into a family car with a mother and her two daughters
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  shooting one of the poor little girls in the head who died basically on the spot.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  A tragedy any way you slice it. I don't care what color they are.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I'll never forget four or five years ago, there was a black lady scared by checkpoints in DC that happened to have military at him for some drill,
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  and she drove away from it and an overzealous cop shot her.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  I think it was terrible when I said that and she was black.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  There was this overwhelming outpouring of appreciation from black folks on the email and phone calls.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  I mean, thousands of emails, hundreds of calls, the comments centered, letters coming in saying,
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  oh, we know you're good now. Thanks for standing up for her when she was black.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  And I said, because that was in the middle of the Trayvon Martin stuff and the Justice Department trying to foam in a race war, we have the documents.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  And M. Fulworth criticized it. Congress gave standing ovation to the cop that executed the unarmed mother.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  She had a panic attack. It was wrong. The cop was badly trained. You should get in trouble.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And people were like, well, she's black. Why do you care? Oh, I care if she's black or white or whoever the hell she is.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  I don't think like that. Like, oh, let's abort all the black kids, but not the white kids.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  That's the Southern Prairie Law Center. That's the Democratic Party. That's Planned Parenthood.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  That's their mission, their real mission. Look up the history book.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  So it's Sunday morning. And I get up again at about five in the morning.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I go to the computer and I go to CNN. I checked them a lot too. See what the enemy's doing.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  And it's just all this race baiting, all the Trump supporters are racist. They're all evil. They're all bad.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  They're going to get you every other story. And it says new twist in murder of Texas girl, Jasmine Barnes.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  Now, you talk about trying to under the radar or something. It should have been shooters captured, confess, because the local news said that.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  They had to read and read. They wouldn't say the name and wouldn't say when the arrest happened as it had happened over a day before.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And so I typed in her name and it was all national news, New York Times, Washington Post.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Oh, new twist. Mine was the mistake identity. Nothing about what color the guys are.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  You know, there's local news of the video and the tweets and the mug shots.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  And I went, oh my goodness, Google's obviously blocking local news. I'm going to go to local TV stations. I typed in ABC Houston.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Not even remembering it's ABC 13. Boom, front page, black guy. Boom.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  Him being led into the jail, him being arraigned at the court.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  They didn't waste any time confessing, saying he had an accomplice.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  They thought it was another drug car that had screwed him over.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Boom.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  Now, you know, the sick feeling that is to know that I spent 20 or 30 minutes looking at the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  And it was all just kind of buried at the bottom. Oh, new twist. It all had the same headline, different names on the articles, but it's all the talking points.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  What are we going to do? It's not a white guy. We'll just say new twist and hope it goes away.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  We're going to have demonstrations with thousands and thousands and thousands of people out saying white supremacists are killing us.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  We're all being murdered. There's whites killing us everywhere. And the new Black Panther Party leading it.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And Sean King out there, who, again, looks like Red Butler from Gone with the Wind.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Doesn't look like a black guy to me. Sean King's out there stoking it all.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Crazy. This guy's whiter than that other white lady that poses like she's black.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  What's her name again? Rachel Dolezal.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  So we've got Red Butler over here, also known as Clark Gable, the actor, who's been risen from the dead and is now down in Houston.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  He's probably whiter than Red Butler. And he's there.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  I'm not making a joke out of this. These people are sick.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  It turns out on Wednesday he got the tip because he's the main leader down there orchestrating all this.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And he doesn't go out and say, oh, I'm getting tips from people that were there that it was two black men in a car.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  He said, that's just sounded too implausible.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  So he tells the sheriff and he and the sheriff don't say, oh, we've got new leads from witnesses that were there.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  No, they go out and keep putting out until Saturday.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  The day the guys are already busted.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  On Saturday, they are still saying, and the sheriff is still saying, we're looking for the white supremacist
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  and they're finding white guys that have been arrested for different things that look a little bit like the sketch saying, is this him?
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Is this him? And it's in Sean King's Twitter.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  I was reading this morning. Here's this racist piece of garbage.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  We hear this guy who was just arrested for a DWI.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  We hear he's a racist piece of crap.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Let us know what you know about him.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  So he's putting random white guys up on Twitter.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  When they've got a lead, not even acted upon and it turns out it was police separately for a non turn signal and driving erratically to pull the other guy over and then he all freaked out and admitted it.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  As best we can tell, the sheriff's department was the sheriff himself, not the police, was not even going to follow up, I guess.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Because why not? Man, we got a media bonanza here.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  We got sheriff Ed Gonzalez up there, man, talking about white supremacists and everything and getting those votes, boy, down in blue cesspool Houston.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  We got it going on, man.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  You got a mayor down there that wants to teach five-year-old boys to wear dresses and all.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  And you got a cesspool down there.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And then in comes this guy.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  And then they get the other guy and they say, no, we did it.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  We thought it was another drug car.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  We filled it full of holes.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  And the story just disappears.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  But see, the story is, they do damn well what was going on, in my view.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  The sheriff did at least, but they didn't follow up on that because it didn't fit the narrative.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Why, they could have kept that media bonanza nationally going much.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  It could be the new Trayvon Martin.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Who killed Jasmine Barnes?
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  He could be stars.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Why, he could be the head of the Justice Department someday.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Why, they could turn the whole state blue on this, saying murdering redneck Texans out there killing little black girls.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Oh, for absolutely nothing.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Even though statistically, blacks are 10 times more likely to kill whites.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  That's just an FBI statistic.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  You can pull it up.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And I don't dislike black folks, but the fact is the media sold the idea that killing whites is a good thing to do.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Hell, killing cops is a good thing to do.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  And if you're black, you're 10 times more likely to be killed by a black person.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Oh, but the sheriff and Mr. Rededare, they said we just, it was too improbable.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  It was just unbelievable that it could be two black guys at 6.30 in the morning in a mainly black area shooting up a car.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  Oh, that never happened before.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  No, we found the unicorn, white devil senselessly killing a little black girl.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  We've got what we need because, you know, it does happen.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  You get some scumbag, lunatic goes into a black church, kills nine people.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  It's the end of the world.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  All whites are guilty for it.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Some lunatic walked in a grocery store, shot some black folks.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  We don't know exactly why, but it's wrong.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  There are some bad racist white people, but it's pretty rare in 2019 to have that going on.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  But you see, what a good way to start the new year.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Right before the new year starts, you get to roll all this out and now they just want to delete all their articles.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  And they're deleting all the old articles calling it white supremacy and America braces for white killers and vigilantes.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  When we come back, I'm going to play a clip of it.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  The young turds deleted this video, but we got it and it's posted an article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And they're hoping, hoping, hoping you don't go to infowars.com or newswars.com and tweet this or Facebook it because they just want to keep the lie going.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Young turds founder of the group named after the Armenian genocide group,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  young turds delete multiple videos after claiming black shooter was white supremacist motivated by Trump.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Well, guess what you big old stinking turd?
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  You thought you flushed the truth, but we put a snake down on it and we plumbed that turd back up.

[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  People say, why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground. And I knew we had no future and we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.

[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWords.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  So, we got the sheriff given a tip by eyewitnesses. Oh, and of course the tip came from one of the good little national leftist, Sean King.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  He got a tip, he gave it to the sheriff's department, but they thought it was just too improbable that two black men would shoot black people in a black neighborhood.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  That's never happened before, not once, even though, again, you're 10 to 1 more likely to be shot by a black person if you're black than by anybody else.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  And the numbers in some cases are even higher, 20 to 1, 30 to 1, depending on areas like Chicago, where 95% of the people killed are black and 90% doing it are black.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  I'm sad that's happening. But if you understand this, you understand everything.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Why does the Southern Poverty Law Center, why does the ADL, why do the universities all obsess and Google on burying crime statistics?
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  One of their main missions, it comes out in the news, to hide black on white crime, because it doesn't fit the narrative of whites are all guilty and whites are all the devil,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  so vote socialist and be a Democrat and we'll wave a magic wand over you and say you're not racist.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  And it keeps blacks in the literal plantations of the neighborhoods where the Democrats ship the drugs in and run the society and pass the laws to give them longer prison sentences than whites that Trump just repealed with no credit.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Because Trump understands we have to unify the nation and stop this setup.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  He's trying as hard as he can to expose this. Oh, the Southern Poverty Law Center says they fact checked it. There's not more black on white crime.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  That's just not true. Just like AP said, there is no migrant caravan. We fact checked it.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen. Now the unified crime statistics from the FBI show it's as high as 97%.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And in some cities it's as high as 97%. Chicago last time I saw was 94%, but they fight hard to cover that up.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  And you see, you know when the shooter of a white person is a minority because you always don't have a description or in Europe it'll be hundreds of German men raped women in Berlin and in Cologne.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  And then you see the video is it's a bunch of Muslims. Germans raped women. No, Muslim invaders did.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  They still have slave trade in the Middle East and many countries and in Africa. Not here. The West ended it. Christianity ended it.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Fought hundreds of years of wars to try to end it. Finally with the Civil War here.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  But oh, it's only white people. It's this whole cosmology. This is the new religion of the left. This is their whole system.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And so they need to keep this going. And so every time a white person gets killed and racially motivated, it gets covered up.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Or if it's just a robbery, it gets covered up. You never hear the description. And then it's very quiet if they ever bust them.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  But boy, if you got a white doing something, we're going to push that because that fits the narrative to make everybody fight with each other.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  And it's not to advance black people. This is being done. This is meant to make white people scared and racist.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  It's to make black people scared and racist, just like a prison. And we're all divided and the globalists are the jailguards and the warren.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  The warden. This is divide and conquer strategy in the great game period.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  So here's Sink Ugr, Lord of the Turds, young turds, named after a genocidal anti-Christian group that killed a million and a half people.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  He denies the Armenian genocide happened. It's totally public. Well, there's not Christians in Turkey.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Here he is just a few days ago, but now they've deleted all these videos. Here it is.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  So this is terrorism. And we don't know why he did it, but it's not related to anything else.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  It pause. I'm going to start this over. This is terrorism. He did it. There's a sketch of a white guy. It's over. He did it.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  He has this Sean King on all the time. Maybe Mr. King could have told you about the other thing people saw.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  Oh, but we don't need to talk about that. Let's go back to the Lord of the Turds.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  So this is terrorism. And we don't know why he did it, but it's not related to anything else.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  She's not involved in anything. Look, it just bothers me that I have to think about it and she has to think about it.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And we all have to think about, did she do something wrong? She didn't, right?
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  Obviously it's relevant because if there was an earlier dispute, that would explain why it happened, right?
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  But there is no earlier dispute. There was no dispute on the highway. There was no dispute before that.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  They don't know each other. And look, we don't know what's in the guy's head.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  He was wearing a red sweatshirt, not a red hat, okay?
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  But he fires into this random cars with kids in it, with kids in it, and he kills them.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  So was he politically motivated? Was he religiously motivated? Was he ethnically motivated?
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  We have no idea. Or, hey, everybody's got a gun.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Oh, God, it's so much fun to shoot them. Okay. And then, oh, well, like a seven-year-old died, whatever.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  I had fun shooting my gun. Was he just mentally unbalanced? I don't know.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  The country's got a gun. So this is what happens when everybody has a gun.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  You only want to have the Turkish government finishing up the conquest of Istanbul when it was Constantinople.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  You know, 1,000 years later or whatever, you've got to go ahead and mop up the last Christians, right?
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  So only you have the guns and we don't have them. We get it all turdly. We get it all turdly. Here he is.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Look, you know what we're all thinking. Why did he do it? No. And only one possible reason pops up.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  But it could be something else. But right now, the only thing that separates him and her is the race.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  And so, but maybe it's not that. Maybe it's something else, but whatever it is.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Pause again. He just said this guy is guilty. This guy is guilty. Continue.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  It's what I referred to earlier. Of all people, Chelsea Manning taught me this phrase recently. Stochastic terrorism.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  It's when people are encouraged by leaders to do violent acts.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  The leader doesn't say kill this specific person. Doesn't say you should target Jasmine Barnes.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Pause again.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  You have anti-breaking people's ribs, shooting people, attacking, going to their houses, saying kill them.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  And Democrats are saying do that. Then you're trying to blame Trump and conservatives for this little girl killed by two black guys.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Just incredible. Continue. Notice he didn't retract this and apologize. They deleted this video.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  They're trying to send cease and desist orders to take it down. It's fair use, you big, ugly pig. You monster.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  We'll shove this down your dirty throat. Do you want American filth? Play more of it.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  It just encourages you to hate a certain group of people and then random, unbalanced people in a country pop up and do the violence on their behalf.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Pause again. He knows all about this because the young Turks was the group of militia that killed a million and a half Christians that was told and hyped up to do it.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  He's an expert on the type of terrorism he just told you about. What a pig. What a dirtbag. My lord.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  And it just gets worse from here. We'll finish up when we come back.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  But this is disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  It's really unspeakable how he's just dripping with enjoyment, covering all these lies and spewing this garbage.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  I mean, what a lying sack of garbage. What a piece of filth. Why don't you go back to Turkey, okay? We don't want young Turks here.

[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  Israel's done yahoo to make a dramatic announcement. They think he may be resigning.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Outrage after French authors says successful men are attracted to younger women. That's up on Infowars.com.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  The left silence on a legal immigrant who killed officer is deafening. Your play will Johnson's report coming up. That's up on Infowars.com. You need to get that out. Remember, nobody else will if you don't do it.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Globalist World Bank head resigns Trump to nominate new president. That scares the hell out of the globalist.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  We've got so much we're going to be getting to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It's pretty much on her deathbed. All evidence points towards that.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  She's the first time ever to show up for a vote after cancer surgery two weeks ago. And of course, the big news I haven't hit yet.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  I'll hit the start of the next hour before your calls. Hacker Group releases 9-11 papers says future leaks will burn down U.S. deep state.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  And they're having a government shutdown over in the U.K. over not getting out of Brexit.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  And the Yellow Vests have had other giant demonstrations all over Europe against the NWO.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  So we're on the march. The Empire is on the run. I'm going to get more of that. And Trump to travel to southern border Thursday a shutdown standoff intensifies.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  We'll be covering that right here live from Texas.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  But let's get back to what I was just playing. And I got so upset and so angry watching it.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  The first time and the second time I got even angrier because Sink Booger of the Young Turks knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  And he's up there when the left has their vigilante brown shirt mobs of the Young Turks.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Literally is the model for even Hitler's genocide was the Young Turks that Hitler even said that.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  And then you've got him named after a genocidal group that he's exactly talking about claiming whites are running genocide against blacks which isn't happening.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  They're talking about abortion in general. And that's from the globalist.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And then he's up there saying it's a white guy. We know we know he's a white guy.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  And then it turns out that the guest he had on knew that there was a credible report from eyewitnesses of black men in a truck.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  And to Sean King's credit he at least passed it on to the sheriff but didn't go out and say I've talked to witnesses and they say it was black guys.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  He said it was too improbable because we all know blacks have never hurt any other black people.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  It just never happened to conspiracy theory like there is no caravan. There was no caravan.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  It never reached San Diego. It never reached Tijuana.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Trump's lying. I'm lying. Associated Press reports.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  They fact check at the AP magic wand. The sky is not blue. There is no caravan.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  White man killed the girl.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  So here is the dramatic disgusting conclusion of the toxic young turd. Here it is.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  People and then random unbalanced people in a country pop up and do the violence on their behalf.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  And that's called stochastic terrorism. And that's what this one looks like.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  But they're going to investigate. I hope to God they find the guy.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Sean King does wonderful work in this area and has offered a $35,000 reward for whoever can name the individual and then the police would apprehend him obviously.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  It's actually up to 50,000 now.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  I think it's up to 50,000.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  You know, one of their mom was shot. One of her sisters was injured by glass but also like...
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Joe, this is too powerful. I just thought of something else. Back it up please. Oh my God.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I was busy this morning when I watched it. So I didn't watch it with full consciousness.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  Sink Uggur and his guests are saying hashtag Jasmine Barnes with a $30,000 reward.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  By the time they were done, it was 100,000.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  We had all these big people giving hundreds of thousands of dollars like Shaquille O'Neal, all this stuff, which is great.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  It's for the little girl's family.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  But he has on Sean King who knew a couple of days into this that there were witnesses that said it was black guys.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Why didn't he just... I get the reward money and give it to Jasmine's family?
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Got these big rewards up there and he has Sean King on, AKA Clark Gable.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Why this black dude I ever saw? Here it is.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  You know, their mom was shot. One of her sisters was injured by glass but also like...
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  These are babies. Like we're talking about I think a teenager in the front seats.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  One of the kids was six in the back and I don't recall how old the other little girl was.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  But these children saw their sister's dead body. They saw their sister.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  That part hasn't even... We're talking about the physical damage before the rest of their life.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Only a white monster could do this. Africans don't kill each other. Blacks don't kill each other.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Only a white monster. It's horrible. What are we going to do about the white people?
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  This is the same woman that just calls me all these names and calls me to be taken off the air.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  This is a monstrous group of authoritarian dirt bags.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Do you imagine you have shanked the turd and this lady ran the country?
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Man, we'd be worse than Venezuela. Let's go back to these folks.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Before the rest of their life, they have the image of a bullet hole in their sister's head.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  It's horrible. And we shouldn't. I'm glad we are like talking about like, you know,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  even like keeping it in the forefront of our minds like that.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  This could be racially motivated that, you know, no one knows why this happened.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  Not even that there's any possible logical reason, but, you know, people still are curious of a motive.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  But also, the gun laws in Texas are garbage.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And I actually, they're parked, you know, I've lived in Texas for a while and they're like part of the city.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  I bet you money that those guys had those guns illegally and it's stolen them or something.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  But it doesn't matter. We have guns to protect ourselves.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  The highest crime rate in the country, Chicago, sweetheart, where they've taken all the guns.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  And there's more guns you can shake a stick at.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  So, but she's not even as bad as Lord of the Turds, though.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Sinky, because he just said, this is terrorism. This is a white terrorist period.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  He was probably, you know, make America great again. God, here it is.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  Culturally that I just love. They're just unbeatable.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  But the gun laws in Texas are garbage.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  And the gun culture in Texas is absolute trash.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Like people pushing for more guns on campus.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  People wanting, you know, open carry laws everywhere.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  It's not okay. And this is, you know, this is what comes from that.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Oh, really? Not gangbangers out there shooting up a vehicle.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  You were all net up at 6.30 in the morning.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  But let's think about what she's really saying.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  If you study the carpet bagger publication, Texas Monthly and others, the left wants Texas blue.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  So they don't call us idiots and hayseeds and racist morons out of hand.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  They're like, oh, you're wonderful people. We really like you.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  We've ruined all our states, New York, California.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  We're going to come in there and take over your life now, but you've got some garbage laws.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  So let us come down there and let us Armenian genocide you basically.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Just, hey, we took over Constantinople.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  Just give us the weapons and we're going to take care of you.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  People were not turning ours in. Just give us the weapons.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Let us in.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  And we'll show you how we're superior. We'll take everything you've got.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Matt Sink took money from Gulf War dictators, millions, and Soros and the Democratic Party.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  He's got tens of millions of dollars himself, reportedly, and he sits up there as a big squat goblin.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Proud of his slaving ancestors from Turkey taking over, putting the women on the ships,
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  shelling them, the men on galleys.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And that's how he dominates you. That's how he teaches you.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  And Soros today, millions a year on Zodiac boats brought into North Africa to set up the same system there
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  and to capture the West. And he's proud of who he is.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And because we're weak, and because we don't stand up to this Soros-funded monster,
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  the Nazi collaborator Funder, Sink, who's weak and stupid, will rule you, period.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Because you don't have the instinct to see a monster when it's looking you're right in the eyes.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  His ancestors would throw your ass on a galley and they'd shell your mama and your sisters off
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  because he weren't a Muslim.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Oh, now he's a liberal. He's a sheep-dip Muslim.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Give me a break. He's named after Dominion Genocide and he's weak.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  But he wants to chain you up first and get your weapons.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  And then he'll have his way with you and your family.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Ha ha ha ha ha! You big, fat, bloodthirsty dick.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  You are scum and you know it. You filth. You big, fat, lying sack of crap.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.

[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  InfoWarsLife has the formula for you.

[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality Crill Oil concentrate,
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil, or used separately.

[1:44:50.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  and secured more of the Deep Earth crystals of nascent iodine,
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  but chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  X3, now available at InfowarsLive.com.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  that everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to,
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  You know, I just spent three segments going after the young Turks and all these people.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  We didn't get to the part where he has Sean King on there.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  Even after the tip, Texas Sheriff Sean King pushed fake narrative in Jasmine Barnes' murder.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  They said, just blacks cannot kill other blacks.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  As he said, it's so improbable that in a black neighborhood, lower income area known for drugs in Houston,
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  at 6.30 in the morning, somebody gets shot and then you have witnesses saying, no, it's two black guys.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Uh-uh.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  And see, as long as they didn't get caught, the sheriff could still run around and be all over the news,
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  virtually signaling about the evil white people.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  Oh gosh, Wednesday you get the tip, let's not, but other police got to him and pulled one of the fellows over
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  and ended up finding things that led them to have him admit that he'd been the driver with the shooter
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  and that there was a mistaken identity of another drug dealer.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  And that's all in the local news, but you're not going to see any of that.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Remember, it's on infowars.com, it's on newswars.com and only you can go there.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  We're uploading the video that he doesn't want anybody to see.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  It's even longer than what you just saw of the young Turks.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  We're going to put it in the article of Paul Watson.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  It's going to be on our servers.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  So the Turks can't stop you from seeing them saying, this is a white terrorist.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  This is probably a Trump supporter, this poor girl.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  But they never humanized the other black kids killed by blacks or Hispanics for that matter.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  A lot of gang warfare between blacks and Hispanics on both sides is terrible.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  You never hear about the hundreds of thousands killed in Mexico, many of them children, women.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  No, no, no, we're Chicago.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  It's all just, we have a white person, maybe did something wrong.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Whites are all evil.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Shout it from the rooftops.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  Bring in Al Sharpton, 2.0, a.k.a.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  Rededare, a.k.a.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Another, you know what, I want to challenge Sean King into a DNA test.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Remember Rachel Delazol?
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  She's now has to admit she's done that one drop of black blood in her.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  This guy put back up on screen.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  I think I'm probably more black than he is.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  But notice everything's perfectly manicured.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  And the little mustache in all of it is this guy trying to look like he's a black guy.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  I think he's even like, you got green eyes, blue eyes over there?
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  What is it about, is that Rachel Delazol's son?
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  I mean, he's a lot wider than I am too.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  And see if he was albino, he'd have white hair and red eyes.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  We didn't have like little rabbit eyes, like an albino, white person, more black person.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  No, he just, hell, I'm black then.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  You know, actually I am more black than he is.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Hell, they said Bill Clinton was the first black president.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  I guess that's because he didn't like the black ladies a little bit.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  But, you know, I've joked around enough about this.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  This is sick.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  And this thing's just unraveling so fast that the media is trying to delete it all and get it down as fast as they can.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  I mean, look at her.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  She's got perfectly straight hair and then she tries to dreadlock it all out and then puts that big fake wig on top of her head.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  I guess that's a beehive.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Get some honey out of there.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  I mean, she looks like a daywalking ginger to me.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  But see, if she can virtue signal in the new leftist religion, she can put some bronzer on.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  I mean, Trump puts bronzer on just because, you know, the tan looks good, but there she is, man.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  What a transformation.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  And all these fake racist mannerisms that are associated, I guess she thinks with black people, she's got it down.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  You see videos over 10 years ago, none of that.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  But this is when the religion is white people are bad and blacks are God, but you actually aren't helping them.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  Well, the ultimate way to be the ultimate slave master is to be white and pose as if you're black and then manage all the charities and the money that comes in.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  And it all goes to Sean King in Al Sharpton.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  We got a new Al Sharpton.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  You know, Al Sharpton looks like he's about half black.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  He looks like he's got some Native American in there.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  He's black.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  I mean, he kind of overdoes it with the ridiculous mullet and, you know, all the rest of the stuff to try to really, really act like he's black.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  But this guy is a joke, Sean King.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  And maybe I'm distracting my own self from all the huge, mega massive news, but doesn't this make you sick?
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  There should be a criminal investigation of the sheriff because at least Sean King made the report that they had witnesses that said it was to black men.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  But the sheriff went on and didn't say a word to anybody and didn't ever tweet it and kept tweeting till even after the guy was the first guy was busted Saturday, kept saying it.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Just needs to be investigated because I think there's reasonable suspicion here with the motive and what happened and the rest of it.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  I want to keep this gravy train going of looking for that white devil if these two black guys would have slipped off and hadn't gotten that tip while we'll be here in three years looking for the murderer.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  That white devil of Jasmine Barnes.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  We're going to find him someday.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Hell, there could be tens of millions raised.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  Sheriff could be a big star looking for that white devil.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And like Khalid Mohammed said that time for the Black Panther Party, he said, we're going to kill the women, we're going to kill the children, all the white babies, all the white women.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  They said, why do you want to kill the women, a little baby, a little beautiful blue-eyed babies?
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  And he said, because every nine months, the white woman lays down on her back and military enforcement roll out.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  We kill the women, we kill the children, and we kill the babies because GD, we kill them all.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  I saw him on local news 20 years ago give that speech in Houston when I was in a hotel room.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And then he turned the TV on. We kill the women, we kill the children. I said, GD, we kill them all because every nine months, the white woman lays down on her back and military enforcement roll out.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  And later I found another clip because he said it in a debate with, what was that guy's name?
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  You know, I used to have a photograph of him in my memory, he's going for stuff that's really old now.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  Anthony, famous filmmaker, did the Illuminati records.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Reviewed the guy 50 times over the years.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  Anthony, it'll pop in my head in a minute.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  So, I'll figure out the name by the next break.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Anthony J. Hilder, there you go. Go to YouTube, it's probably been taken down because it was an old clip even when YouTube came around 10, 12 years ago.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  Search engine, Anthony Hilder debates.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Anthony Hilder debates, Khalid Mohamed was his name.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  And we'll play the video, but I mean, this is standard stuff where this is what's taught, especially down in Houston.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  And out of this whole deal, there it is, Illuminati records, 2017, Anthony J. Hilder.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  In 1967.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  And I guess they put it back out. Oh, you found the clip.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  We have audio?
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  Why kill the women?
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  First, why kill the babies?
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  They're just little innocent blue-eyed babies because, God damn it, they're going to grow up one day to rule your babies.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Kill them now.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Why kill the women in South Africa?
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  I said kill the women because the women are the military manufacturing center.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  And every nine months, they lay down on their backs and reinforcements rolls out from between their legs.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  So, shut down the military manufacturing center by killing the white woman.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Why kill the elder crackers?
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Oh, crappy crackers in South Africa.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  How in the hell do you think they got old?
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  They got old, oppressing and killing black people.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Oh, yeah, killing black people, however.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  Oh, God, God.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  Kill them all.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  Kill the faggot.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Kill the lesbian.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  And after you killed them all.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  I said that day about Mandela to let you know what he really knows about me.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  Don't know a damn thing.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  I said then you go to the goddamn grave.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  And dig them up and kill them a goddamn kid.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Oh, let's stop there.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  You dig them up and kill them again.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  So, never is this the crime of the left.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  This is what's taught.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And they're up there like using the portal girl's death to create racial division.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  These are sick evil leftists.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  They're the real racist.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  They know what they're doing.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  I'll give the number out, your calls, a ton of other news.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  Stay with us.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Please spread the live links.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym,
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  So go to infowarstore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.

[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  That's what a globalist don't want this show on the air because we're laying out from the globalist's own white papers, their own statements, how the cow ate the old cabbage.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  And creating a very accurate map for folks to overlay with the disinformation that they see in mainstream media to try to then come up with a solution to counter the globalist technocracy.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  What's wrong? Nothing, nothing really. I just feel that it's something strong.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  For more enjoyment and greater efficiency, consumption is being standardized.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately. Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  Bloomberg, the Trump slump. Why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump?
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Well, because the Federal Reserve raved a bunch of interest rates and signaled with regulations that the Democrats in the deep state were going to ignore all of the innovations in the attempt to release a lot of hidden technology to get us out of the technology slump.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  50 years ago, our government drove the innovation that inspired the world and put Americans on the moon.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  Today, many of our agencies rely on painfully outdated technology, and yet we have the greatest people in technology that the world has ever seen right here with us in this room.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  They're openly cheerleading for the economy implode and then blaming Trump for it.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  Just like they've said in Europe, we're going to blame Italy for an economic downturn. We're going to blame the UK for trying to get out of the unelected EU. It's the exact tactic of economic terrorism.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  But even bigger than the Federal Reserve raising all these interest hikes that everyone wants to do with Obama, they've now done what, eight times with Trump and signaled more to come.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  Even worse than that is Nancy Pelosi says she won't rule out indictment impeachment for Trump. And of course, we've got Nancy Pelosi's daughter wearing crazy cat lady glasses to hide the fact that her and her mother have gotten over a billion dollars with her dad since Nancy was in the house.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Just what are your feelings about this person who you know quite well becoming Speaker of the House for a second time?
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding. That's all you need to know about her.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  When I said this was traitorous and outrageous, didn't call for her death or any violence. She went on Fox News and said I was calling for violence.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  And we confirmed that they approached the Justice Department and demanded that I be arrested. But it's okay. She's wearing pink cat lady glasses.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  So if Hitler wore pink cat lady glasses, it'd be okay, right? Hank Johnson, the guy that says that islands float, has come out and called him Hitler and said that he should be thrown out of office.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  Much like Hitler took over the Nazi Party, Trump has taken over the Republican Party.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  We have Sheila Jackson Lee and Alexander Cortez calling for reparations to be paid to black people.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Do you believe President Trump is a racist?
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  Yeah, yeah. No question.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  How can you say that?
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy, when you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident where neo-Nazis murdered a woman,
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's night and day.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  And so now, a growing U.S. economy, new jobs coming back is not seen as something that is an absolute, not as a sure thing.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  And the establishment bets on one thing bigger than anything. I just think it'll be lazy.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  And part of that laziness is mental laziness to not have a memory and just not care.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  And you run into people that haven't trained their memories, and you run into others that had a weak memory before, but as they get older, it just gets non-existent.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  They're living in this moment to moment, and not in a good way. They're not even really conscious.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, massive news just broke, and I'd already confirmed this.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  When we come back, Trump's going to declare a national emergency tomorrow night at 9 o'clock Eastern. Stay with us.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  This is a global exclusive.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  From sources I have in the Pentagon, from sources we have close to the White House, and from our own research understanding U.S. law and history.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  You have all noticed in the last year that I've said Trump must declare a national emergency to cancel the national emergency that Obama put in before he left office in December of 2016,
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  when they knew Trump was coming in and was President-elect.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Not just for border security or integrity of CONUS, but also so that he can then use those emergency powers to remove the bureaucrats and policies that have been put in place that circumvent his administration and his executive power.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  In FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, and also Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com have been hammering this narrative in the last year because this is what must be done.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  And we're in a real crisis against the globalists, the Chai comms, the EU, the economic war, the private fellow reserve.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  We have the head of the World Bank being made to resign today.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  The President can only do that under a national emergency, and there are executive orders in place going back 50-plus years.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  Really before that, to the War Powers Act in 1933, that under any economic emergency, military emergency, or other emergency, particularly the border, the President can do this.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  It isn't martial law. It isn't a civil emergency. It isn't regular laws being suspended.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  It's how the executive interfaces with the agencies and the bureaucracies that are mutinous and ignoring Trump.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  So you notice he's removed hundreds of top people that were working with the deep state, and it's all unfolding very, very fast.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  Now remember, I just said Saturday in a special report that Trump is preparing to institute a national emergency.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  And you notice again, going back months ago, we have pointed that out over and over and over again, because we understand what is at stake here.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  I'm not calling for martial law. The left is spending that. They're the ones wanting civil emergency. They're the ones wanting impeachment.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  They're the ones wanting to bankrupt and plunge the economy. They're the ones trying to break our borders.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  They're the ones having antifa go out and storm everywhere.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  Reagan declared a national emergency with the strike at the air traffic controllers.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  He had to declare it to order them back, essential employees.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  There's been other emergencies. Obama used one and Bush used one to hold us hostages and give trillions to foreign banks in 2008 and 2009.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  Paulson, the head of the Treasury, said there'll be martial law, tanks in the street, and blood if you don't back the president's emergency to Congress.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  If you try to buck it and don't appropriate it, but the president has still done it on his own.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  So Trump's doing this not to sell us out to the New World Order, but to stand up against it.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  And this country is in a major, major crisis.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  So here it is today, Fox News just minutes ago, talking about his announcement, dealing with the wall and it being steel and not concrete, which is still a wall,
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  that he'll be giving a special speech tomorrow night.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  It's going to be from the Oval Office and it's going to be on the country being in a crisis and the president's going to declare the national emergency tomorrow night.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  Then on Wednesday, there'll be a messenger from the White House that marches into the new Congress, into the House of Representatives,
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  and announces to the Speaker of the House that the president has declared an emergency.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Now, normally they don't cover it when they do this. Every president's done it since Roosevelt.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  They don't want you knowing about this. This is how they've done all this stuff.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  This time, when that emissary from the president marches into the sergeant of arms of the House of Representatives, it's going to be all over the news.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Like it's a big, bad, evil thing.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  So how do I know this? I have sources saying it was imminent. I've been telling you for a year it needs to happen.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  We're going to pull up the articles, not just from last week, but a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, three months ago, October 27th.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  All of it. We're going to get that up on screen for you.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  Now, here is Fox News and the president hints at it. He says this country is in an emergency. Here it is.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  We'll build a steel barrier, steel. It'll be made out of steel. It'll be less obtrusive and it'll be stronger.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  But it'll be less obtrusive, stronger, and we're able to use our great companies to make it by using steel.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  We have Fox team coverage. Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill with reaction from lawmakers.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  But we begin with John Roberts, who is live at the White House.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  And that news coming in just a few moments ago, the president to do a primetime address tomorrow night at 9 p.m. from the White House.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  John.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  Good afternoon to you. Yeah, with the Christmas holidays, the New Year's holiday over and everybody back to work except for federal workers.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Of course, if people focus, the president wants to make a case for why he needs to get the money to build a border barrier with a primetime address tomorrow night.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  We do not know if it will be in the Oval Office yet or if it might be one of the other many rooms here at the White House.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  When you do something from the Oval Office, it tends to have a lot more importance attached to it than if you did it, say, from the map room or somewhere like that.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  We expect that the president will probably tweet the location coming up here in the next few minutes.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  But it's clear that he will tomorrow night in this address at 9 o'clock, make the argument from a national security standpoint that the money is needed for the wall.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  The president tweeting, quote, I am pleased to inform you that I will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  The president will also travel to the southern border on Thursday to promote the need for billions of dollars to build a steel barrier along some parts of the border.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  He is going to be going, we have confirmed through law enforcement sources, to the McCallan, Texas area.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  Now, what's interesting is there's about four miles of steel barricade at the border crossing there between the area south of McCallan and Rainosa in Texas.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  But that's an area where it's very difficult to build a wall because you've got the Rio Grande meandering its way all the way west to El Paso and all the way east to Brownsville.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  And you have a lot of private landowners there who do not want to be cut off from the river by a border fence.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  So it's likely that his plans for a border fence would not be applicable to that area.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  But of course, there are large swaths of New Mexico, Arizona and California where it would.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, the president adding some detail to what he wants, saying, quote,
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  the president requests $5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the southwest border.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  A physical barrier wall creates an interrogation.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  OK, so that's from Fox News just literally like 10, 12 minutes ago.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  I'm in the break room and I see the president say because this country is in an emergency.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  Well, I know that's the action he's got to take.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I know he's been mulling it.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  We first told you this over a year ago, another global exclusive and you watch.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  And sometimes he changes plans, but 95 percent chance tomorrow Trump will declare a national emergency.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  So this is this is this is happening.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  And I did a special report on Saturday saying the president is preparing a national emergency.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  He's preparing to introduce a national emergency to the public.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  And then if the globalists try to block securing it and activate their anti for other terror groups.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  There's the Mike Adams article we were talking about from a few months ago.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  The president is set to deal with that.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  So Trump says declared national emergency to stop the deep state.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  January 4th, January 5th article, President Trump is preparing the public for the introduction of national emergency.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  In fact, we probably should just get my special report.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  It's pretty powerful from this weekend and air that in some of the segments because I was particularly focused and I really laid out why the president needs to do this and the reasons for it.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  And so what we'll do is I'm going to open the phones up on this subject and others, but particularly this one.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  And then I think Gerald Salente, who always does a great job, will be fine with me taking a couple segments of the start of the next hour before he comes on to air my piece on that.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  But I want to be extremely focused and clear here.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  We're already under Obama's emergency.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  He has stayed behind embedded networks working against the country. That's now been admitted. I told you that two and a half years ago, but when he was leaving, he pulled that.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  And then he did.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  We know how this stuff works.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  And so the way it operates is they built this whole infrastructure around COG, continuity of government and other systems where the president can't change any of this unless he exercises his power to remove it.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  So if you're cutting the kid out of a car, it's the car wreck that put him in the car all hurt. You're cutting him out. That's the emergency, but the wrecks already happened.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  So they're going to spend this as martial law. That's not what it is.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  It's the president having to exercise executive power to get back control of the bureaucracy.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  We'll give the number out when we come back. Stay with us.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  You may need this herbal tea for relief right away.

[2:20:48.720 --> 2:20:52.320]  You know, most men spend their time studying how football works or how to
[2:20:53.920 --> 2:20:57.600]  act cool. And then that's okay, or how to have a bigger truck, which I've got a big truck,
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:01.280]  I like that too. But you know, I've spent my time studying how the world works.
[2:21:02.080 --> 2:21:07.680]  And when I went and saw the movie Vice, which has got some disinfo and it was very well done
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:14.800]  overall, it's stichety obsessed with COG and continuity of government and the power of the
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:19.600]  executive. And by the president letting him operate as a co-executive,
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:26.240]  he then was able to create a fourth branch of government. That's how powerful the executive is
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:33.840]  if it's unopposed. Now, they've been using the executive to transfer power away from Congress,
[2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:38.800]  the courts and the people. Trump is using it to claw it back and doing it under constitutional
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:44.880]  emergency. So just as I said at the beginning of the show today, all indicators are Trump is
[2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:55.760]  taking the gloves off and putting the big boy pants on. And he's firing the CHICOM World Bank
[2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:00.000]  Head who was working with the Chinese to give them all our tax money to take over Africa mainly
[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:05.360]  in Latin America. I mean, what treason and Trump called out a year ago and just sacked the guy.
[2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:13.760]  And this all indicates the national emergency as I said back in October has already been declared.
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:22.480]  And they're going to send an emissary from the White House Wednesday morning
[2:22:23.680 --> 2:22:28.800]  to the session of Congress. And as you're going to declare, I'm going from memory, we need to look
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:34.800]  this up, it's declared to the House. Sometimes they send an emissary to both. Sometimes they
[2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:38.880]  have the vice president do it, but that gives too much fanfare. Usually they slip it under the rug
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:45.600]  under the door because it can get a little sticky if they're using it to transfer trillions to foreign
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:50.480]  banks or they're using it to do things like that. But this is the president announcing an
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:55.840]  emergency generally for war or famine or calamity and our borders, the left keep saying, oh, there's
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:02.240]  no border problem. Oh, yeah, look at Europe. Look at here. Give me a break. So they're going to spend
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:08.240]  this is martial law. This is the opposite. The country has been crashed. The globalists are
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:11.840]  trying to bring it down. I'm going to explain this again because the media is going to misrepresent it.
[2:23:12.720 --> 2:23:19.760]  Obama declared new emergencies. Six of the eight years he was in office, by the way,
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:25.120]  the emergencies were extended. So he only had to do it six times because he wanted to change
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:30.800]  something and why he said there was an emergency. So you're going to learn that the president in
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:38.720]  October declared a classified national emergency to the executive. And now he's either going to have
[2:23:38.720 --> 2:23:45.520]  a deal by tomorrow night that Pelosi says that they're going to do the wall and all the rest of it,
[2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:49.760]  or he'll declare the national emergency. But it's already been done. So it doesn't matter.
[2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:54.160]  You understand how that works? He just hasn't declared it to Congress to let him know that
[2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:58.560]  he's overriding them. And the only way you could override the president and emergency
[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:04.400]  is impeachment or assassination. It is its own separate branch of government. But you have just
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:12.800]  as state legislatures used to until 1913 and the 16th Amendment, they could recall U.S. senators.
[2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:17.440]  They were creatures of the state to balance out the federal government. House members are
[2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:23.680]  generally elected. Senate members were voted for by the legislature to create a parliamentary
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:29.520]  check and balance. The same year we got the Federal Reserve Act, the income tax, we got the senators
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:37.360]  becoming federal creatures. Well, that was a major loss of states' rights and states' powers.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:41.440]  And I believe we should bring back where we were before the 16th Amendment.
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:46.400]  So things have gotten way out of balance and before the executive had too much power.
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:50.720]  But everything Trump's doing with executive power is very judicious. The Supreme Court's been
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:55.600]  saying he's right on this stuff. And that's where we're headed here. That's why the Democrats
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:59.360]  are so scared. They're not worried about the future of the court. They think they're going to show
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.640]  this up. But if the Supreme Court stands with Trump, during all of this is coming up,
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:11.680]  it's going to be a big problem. You see, the House indites. The Senate tries.
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:17.280]  And it's not going to go there because Trump has all the Trump cards.
[2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:23.360]  The ace of spades. The Clintons and the Obamas were heavily involved with Saudi Arabia on 9-11.
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:28.400]  And he has a bunch of other ace cards. He's got a handful of ace of spades.
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:35.440]  This isn't like a regular card game. He's probably got 20 ace of spades, 20 ace of clubs.
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:39.440]  It just goes down the line from there. It just gets better. It gets more sickening.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:45.920]  And this is just an epic time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen. You need to understand that.
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:51.520]  And I'm proud of Infowars. I'm proud of our audience because you have lobbied the president
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:55.840]  to declare the national emergency. Quite frankly, he's never given an Oval Office address.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:00.000]  They're all saying, oh, we don't know if it'll be in the Oval Office. We don't know.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:04.320]  It's going to be in the Oval Office if he declares the national emergency. And I'm saying
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:09.760]  the national emergency has already been declared, but it will be officially declared.
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:14.640]  And even if Pelosi agrees to pass the border funding and back off,
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:19.520]  Trump will say to speed it up and to hurry it up and to make it work better.
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.360]  I'm going to go ahead and declare the emergency. Oh, look, now Schiff's saying it. There it is.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:32.400]  Trump may declare a national emergency. And then Schiff comes out and says he has the power to,
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:40.720]  but I really hope he doesn't. Look how scared he looks. These criminals that have used old executive
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:46.160]  power left behind by Obama, hoping Trump didn't figure this out, hoping Trump didn't remove it.
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:52.000]  But see, even Schiff can't lie. I forgot I saw that video this morning.
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:56.400]  And because he knows that it's in the Constitution, it's in the law,
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:26:58.640]  he says, well, he has that power, but I hope he doesn't.
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:07.040]  It's not about the wall. The wall's only part of it. It's about checkmating these creatures.
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:13.200]  So again, Obama put executive powers in an emergency that are still operating.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.520]  Trump has to reverse it. He has to fire the head of the Federal Reserve,
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.200]  fire the head of the World Bank. Oops, just happened. But for face saving, he resigned.
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:29.360]  He's going to fire them all. It's like the globalist or Tokyo and Godzilla's Trump.
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:32.640]  And he just came out of the water and he's passed.
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:37.680]  Then we should play Blue Waste or Cold Godzilla when we come back.
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:45.920]  Because if they want to fight, you better believe they're going to get one.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:51.840]  This is the joy of information war. The only thing better would be, I guess,
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:59.440]  the hors d'oeuvres of the physical dainties. But this is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:02.880]  And the country's been on its deathbed. China's threatened in war.
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:05.280]  Where the rest of the Chinese spies, they're rolling them up.
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:09.360]  And that's why the rest of the deep state is flipping out because they are complicit traders
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:13.520]  and they're fighting for their dirty political and physical lives.
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:19.680]  General McChrystal and all this other trash, all these corrupt billionaires on the Chai-Kong payroll
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:26.320]  look scared, don't they? Because they're un-American scum. Their army is a bunch of Antifa Professor
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:34.640]  Professor Methheads and other ass wipes. 877-789, Alex. I want to talk about the national emergency.
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:40.800]  You think Trump's right? You know it's coming. What's how the enemy hit back? 877-789-2539.
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:44.160]  Trump gave us a prelude to this last week. He said it's going to be a hell of a year.
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:47.680]  So strap yourselves in and get ready for a wild ride.
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.960]  Woohoo! Yeah! Yeah! 877-789-2539.
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:29:01.440]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.

[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:14.160]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:19.680]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I.

[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:30.320]  jobs and goes, oh, let's do it.
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:32.000]  We're going to get him educated on that.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  He's not perfect.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:34.520]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:37.960]  Trump is set to declare a national emergency, not just a normal, oh, we're in an emergency
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:42.240]  here or there, but in the federal government to circumvent the bureaucracies and things
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:43.400]  that are holding back America.
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:48.720]  You see the firing, it's not a resignation of the CHICOM operative that transferred hundreds
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:52.800]  of billions of our money to the CHICOMs, as if they didn't need more of it.
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:58.840]  America is now taking control of all the international systems that it helped create, and what we
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:03.320]  claimed was for promoting democracy worldwide, but it's really been for promoting globalism
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:09.280]  on the New World Order, and croning capitalism, and Trump is taking control of the bureaucracy
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:15.440]  and accelerated rate as we enter hard to believe the third year of this term, and the battle
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:16.440]  is joined.
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:18.800]  All right, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:24.840]  A lot of people probably noticed I haven't plugged today one time, get a t-shirt, get
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:27.280]  a book, get some great supplements, help funder operation.
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:31.120]  I'm so focused on all these developments, I'm not doing it, but just know this, without
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:34.800]  you supporting us at m4store.com, we wouldn't be here.
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:39.280]  And you know, the Democrats and Soros have tried to run off all our sponsors over the
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:42.880]  years, and then they try to take our banking away and brag about that, getting some of
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:43.880]  our payment processors.
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:48.600]  I mean, this is the criminal garbage, and now they're trying to take Franklin Graham's
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:52.000]  credit card process, the other one from Mainline NRA credit card processing.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:55.760]  It's all out of San Francisco, man.
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:36:59.800]  That's why we've now found bulletproof sponsors that are some of the biggest in the country,
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.520]  where they build a whole new website, private label it, they're not even afraid of being
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:08.520]  attacked, but I said, let's just, let's just build these sites, have it be a private label
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.520]  that you run that's highest quality, I know it's the best because of all the studies and
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:17.000]  all the awards, we put it out, and we have all the benefits, again, people, great products,
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:22.640]  funding or operations, you fund your operation, and they can pound sand trying to harass
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  you and your employees.
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:31.520]  And so the first one is Washington's Reserve, washingtonreserve.com, there's big banners
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:42.160]  up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, I don't like marijuana, we still fly all glory
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:43.360]  down at the courthouse.
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:49.360]  No, to get serious, we had a magazine years ago, it was successful, but time-wise, it
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:54.600]  was successful, but not successful enough, so quit doing it, and we got a CBD oil advertiser
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:38:01.160]  in it that was from him, had no THC, none, but just the really good organic hip that
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:05.000]  has the good properties, I've shown all the good things medically, it's just amazing,
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.600]  go do your own research, and I have some, even family in these Texas are like, Aleph,
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:14.600]  you're sure you're not selling the marijuana to the kids, are you?
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:21.240]  Because they saw the magazine and I said, no, well I saw a marijuana leaf on there,
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:25.080]  yeah, there's over 300 varieties of hemp we know of that doesn't have THC, but that's
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:28.640]  all the good stuff, George Washington grew it, the Constitution Bill of Rights is on
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:34.000]  it, it's amazing, and I'm not going to go over all the benefits, we have over 30 products,
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:38.720]  this is in the top three companies in the nation, and I'm not going to even get into
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:43.480]  who it is, they're happy to do it, they just don't care, but I'm going to leave it, and
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:49.000]  they've been around a long time, but this company's been around 19 years, and it's
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:55.640]  legal in all 50 states, because it's hemp-derived CBD oil, no THC, you know, some of the stuff
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:02.080]  from regular marijuana, they test it to get some of a certain level, they arrest you,
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:05.160]  Trump's signed a bill to stop all that, everybody on the left hates that, they're like, we want
[2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:08.720]  to go to prison, you damn right wanger, but the Democrats are like, we'll throw your
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:13.400]  ass in prison, and keep blacks in, Democrats go, hell yeah, seriously, hell yeah, keep
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:18.160]  blacks in prison, and you smoke marijuana, go to prison, Trump's like, well wait, that's
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:22.200]  not reasonable, shut up you damn Nazi, I'm like, well okay, and he's like, we'll bring
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:31.240]  the troops home, no, we'll have the lowest black unemployment ever, no Hitler, no, anyways,
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:35.400]  I could have entered CBD oil, I could have had it, as you know, for all these years,
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:41.080]  I haven't, because I wanted to wait and see it all settle out, and this is the stuff they
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:45.560]  sell at Whole Foods, even though this isn't as good a quality, I mean the company that
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:49.760]  I do business with, it does sell at all these big places, and this is private label, and
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:55.560]  since they're not putting it into a store, it's on average 20% less than it is in stores,
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:59.560]  so we have items for $20 up to $200, because it's very expensive though, the processing
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:06.400]  and all of it, but it's very, very powerful in what it does for, look, there's 30 plus
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:11.720]  products, and it is a magic plant God gave us, it's amazing, and now you can grow hemp
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:16.680]  in America again yourself, every other country could grow it, even though there's no THC,
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:20.360]  but we couldn't, Trump just stopped that, so I keep saying how great Trump is, this
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:23.840]  is what's really happening, so I just saw it as a bellwether, we'd already made this
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:28.440]  decision before Trump did all this, this is the top company, top-rated, one of the oldest
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:33.280]  in the nation, and I just made the decision, I said, it was actually Tim's idea, he said,
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:36.360]  look, let's just build a beautiful site with them, have them run it, do everything directly
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:41.680]  from their great factory in Colorado, and have it sent all over the nation where they
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:47.520]  handle the whole deal, so it's there, you want safe, good, non-marijuana CBD, that all
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:51.120]  the studies and stuff shows better than the marijuana variety of it, because some of that
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:54.720]  stuff can brain damage you now, the studies out, like I already said, I don't need a study
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:40:58.600]  to tell you, the weaponized marijuana they got out there can brain damage people, well,
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:03.640]  this isn't even regular marijuana, this is hemp, totally different animal, it's like
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:09.560]  a horse in a goat or something, it's totally different, it has all the attributes of CBD
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:12.960]  that's getting patented and using all these medical patents and everything else, and it's
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:19.880]  amazing and it funds our operations, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139, so now
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:24.920]  I promise, we're going to go to break and I'm going to come right back, bam, bam, bam,
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:28.680]  what do you think of Trump, the national emergency is going to declare tomorrow from the Oval
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:33.600]  Office and its first Oval Office address to the country, to get out ahead of the globalist
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:37.440]  trying to collapse the border, but they're going to say it's a cover for a power grab,
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:41.800]  well, no, the globalist already power grabbed it with Obama's emergency, he signed when
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:46.120]  he left to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda where he put billions into
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:51.520]  the CIA, Department of Defense, and into the Democratic Party to take down free speech
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:58.400]  and turn the CIA leftist, not the general CIA, but the leftist CIA, that's the foundation
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:03.800]  CIA, the policy wonks, you know, the CIA that wants to turn your five-year-old boy into
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:10.680]  a girl, those freaks, he's got to get them out, and only a national emergency allows
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:19.320]  it, so you think there's been firing so far, all of you little tally-whackers out there,

[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:28.520]  Here's the President last week and then just yesterday.
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:33.600]  Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authorities to build this
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:39.760]  wall without congressional approval and second on Mexico, you have, yes I have and I can
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:41.120]  do it if I want.
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:45.240]  So you don't need congressional approval to build this, absolutely we can call a national
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.880]  emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely, no we can do it, I haven't
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:55.360]  done it, I may do it, I may do it but we can call a national emergency and build it very
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:48:01.920]  quickly and it's another way of doing it but if we can do it through a negotiated process
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:03.400]  we're giving that a shot.
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:06.000]  So is that a threat hanging over the Democrats?
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:10.400]  I've never threatened anybody but I am allowed to do that, yes.
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:15.240]  No we're looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency, just
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:21.960]  read the papers, we have a crisis at the border of drugs, of human beings being trafficked
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:27.520]  all over the world, they're coming through and we have an absolute crisis and of criminals
[2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:34.840]  and gang members coming through, it is national security, it's a national emergency.
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:38.240]  Now folks I told you months ago and I told you last week he's going to declare a national
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:42.680]  emergency because we're in one and that will fix the border problem to a great extent and
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:49.000]  it'll also remove the Obama operatives and that's why he's already done it, you saw the
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:53.280]  head of the World Bank go, the US controls that, Trump is exercising its power.
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:58.200]  The one thing the Democrats are scared of, shift doesn't look so smart now, I was watching
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:05.000]  during the break CNN, suddenly Pelosi's praising Trump and wants to be friends, they thought
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:09.760]  they had him totally bamboozled, they could walk him in America in front of a damn firing
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:14.400]  squad, he's not declaring the emergency to be in an emergency, he's declaring it to
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:20.600]  have the powers to remove the face suckers Obama put in, what Trump calls the embedded
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:25.680]  Obama people in his administration, I call them stay-behind networks because that's what
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:35.520]  they are in the CIA manuals, again they want me off the air folks because I do study and
[2:49:35.520 --> 2:49:40.400]  I'm not bragging here, but it's like I'm trying to teach a bunch of young people how to shoot
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:44.240]  a rifle and I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards, I'm going to show them I can do that
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:50.080]  so they listen to me and I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards and I can also tell you
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:55.000]  how these globalists operate, I know what I'm talking about and I know the general
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.960]  audience gets that but you need to be confident around your friends and family because we're
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:04.720]  in a damn emergency, this country's fighting for its life, I told you the Chai comms were
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:08.800]  going to start threatening war because they work with the deep state in this country that
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:12.920]  deserve to be hung from their damn necks, you think I want to get up here and talk like
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:18.240]  that, that's all I can do to be honorable, these people are traitors and if you don't
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:22.480]  meet them at that level they're going to eat our lunch, we've got to stop being a bunch
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:27.560]  of candy asses here and admit where we are, okay I'm going to your calls, I'm going to
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:31.000]  take calls a few segments and Joe Sloan is coming up, I'm going to play my emergency
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:35.920]  broadcast, I guess I did it Friday, I stayed here late Friday, this Friday night, I bet
[2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:39.360]  how Trump prepares the public for a national emergency, it's very key where I lay out the
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:43.440]  case, I know the president and the White House, I know the White House watching it, his advisers
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:46.840]  watched it, we got it to him but they already know all this stuff, it's just that the president
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:52.480]  needs to know we support him and understand what's going on, let's go to your calls,
[2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:56.000]  Alex in Montana, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:04.680]  Hi, yeah, I definitely am in support of Donald Trump, definitely think he should do it and
[2:51:04.680 --> 2:51:13.680]  definitely have his back if anybody tries to disagree stop him, I'm also planning, I
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:17.720]  lost my job in the government shutdown, so I don't really not doing anything right now,
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:23.320]  so I'm selling all my stuff that I have and I'm going to go to Washington D.C., they're
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:29.160]  taking me up a couple of weeks to get the money together, I'm a broke joke but I'm definitely
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:34.120]  going to be going down there, I'm going to be protesting the Democrats, telling them
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:38.280]  that demanding that we need to get these communists and socialists out of our government.
[2:51:38.280 --> 2:51:42.400]  You know that's the smartest thing I've heard Alex, we need to be peaceful, we need to have
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:46.880]  eyes and ears to watch for procters, the Democrats say if Trump tries to stop the open borders
[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:51.400]  or tries to invoke executive power to remove the Obama people, that they're going to have
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:56.280]  anti-fun others start rioting and burning, so we need to be peaceful, I agree, I've
[2:51:56.280 --> 2:51:59.160]  already been to D.C. twice the last few months and I'm going to be there again soon, don't
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:03.800]  worry, everyone needs to be ready to get to D.C., in fact I would start going to D.C.
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:08.080]  now just to be safe and then if something doesn't happen the next few weeks, you know
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:12.600]  it's okay, but I think now is the time to go to D.C. and remember they use marching
[2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:18.040]  as a distraction on the mall, the media never covers you there, they cannot ignore you during
[2:52:18.040 --> 2:52:24.640]  press conferences that they have in the halls and the left yells and screams and takes over,
[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:29.920]  we're just polite and take over and dominate, show the power and go to the congressmen and
[2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:36.160]  women's offices, go talk to them, you're a citizen, they work for you and so Alex you're
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:42.160]  absolutely right and we salute you, damn right, well I'm so fired up right now, I can hardly
[2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:48.160]  contain myself, Warren in New Hampshire, you're on the air worldwide, Warren, thanks for holding.
[2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:49.160]  Alex.
[2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:50.160]  Yes sir.
[2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:55.960]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for 20 years and you're right, you do know a lot, now as
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:53:01.600]  far as the war was concerned, that's a great move, it's a really great move, but what's
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:08.120]  going to happen is if the other party isn't taken care of with an emergency, do the wall,
[2:53:08.120 --> 2:53:13.200]  that's right, but the one thing we got to do is we got to take back our money supply,
[2:53:13.200 --> 2:53:17.840]  people just don't realize that damage is done, the New World Order couldn't have done what
[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:22.680]  they've done without it, that they control it, now people don't understand that, let's
[2:53:22.680 --> 2:53:27.520]  do the wall but then let's take back our money supply, there goes your IRS, there goes your
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:31.640]  IRS, well you know they killed Kennedy over that and the word is Trump is talking about
[2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:33.240]  taking over the Federal Reserve.
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:40.040]  Yeah, I'm 6th to 7th and I've studied this a lot, I know how it works and I'm gonna tell
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:47.400]  you kindly, you don't have any guests on the show that come John that knows how it works,
[2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:53.680]  all they do is read books, now who prints those books, all they do is go to college,
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:53:58.120]  now who tells a professor what to teach, nobody knows how it works.
[2:53:58.120 --> 2:54:02.120]  Oh my God, these callers Warren, you're even better than the last caller, exactly, I don't
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:06.080]  get all my intel from their books, I get it from the leaked documents and how they actually
[2:54:06.080 --> 2:54:10.760]  operate and you're right, they distract everybody with oh let's protest, which is okay in a
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:16.160]  town but no, go to the offices of the politicians, physically go talk to them at their church,
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:20.320]  you know, get in their faces in a nice way and the same way, I've learned from studying
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.560]  how it really works, you have a private Federal Reserve in New York, it controls the universities
[2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:28.800]  and tax-free foundations of the billionaires who don't pay taxes and then they then all
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:34.400]  literally work to control the country and sell it out to set up an authoritarian system.
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:39.880]  Oh yeah, so let me tell you another thing about the money supply, the people would only
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:45.920]  think of it as a coupon system, it's only paper, so how do the people get cornered to
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:51.960]  believe that the money has been devalued, that's just another way of raising prices
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:55.960]  on you at the same time keeping your wages down, you know?
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:55:01.480]  You're absolutely right, you're absolutely right and it's, and again we have a good
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:05.680]  president and a good monetary system, you can create wealth instantly with the exuberance
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:10.520]  with new technology, with new innovations and Trump knows that and is trying it, he's
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:15.320]  basically like JFK, Ronald Reagan meets the better parts of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:19.880]  make work projects and all of it is about we have the energy, we have the brains, we
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:23.680]  have the technology, if we'll just announce we're open for business.
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:31.600]  Correct, and what people don't understand also is if you control your own money supply,
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:35.920]  look at the shambles of the school system, okay, what they teach and all that, that
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:38.200]  would all go by their boards, you know why?
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:45.120]  It's our, we control it and we're not funding it, we're not funding any petafile rooms,
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:46.120]  you know?
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:49.240]  Exactly, you call it the Austin Independent School District, it's not independent, we
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:52.960]  have to take it all back over and then we can have schools of their local, God bless
[2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:57.360]  you Warren, I appreciate your call, great points man, these callers are on fire, Jerome
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:00.360]  in New York, I'm just going in order, Jerome you're on the air.
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:05.600]  Hey Alex, hey Alex, we finally got us an actual president with a spine, that would have novel
[2:56:05.600 --> 2:56:10.800]  idea that is, hey let me tell you something about what's going on down there on the southern
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:19.120]  border, all those immigration lawyers, all those 501c3s, charitable organizations, that's
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:20.120]  a big industry.
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:23.520]  Oh they're all, I'm going to hold you over, I was going to air my emergency report from
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:26.720]  Friday but I'm going to take calls for two seconds and let Salente take over because
[2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:29.880]  I respect him, but your call is so good Jerome, stay there because I looked at the clock,
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:30.880]  I was a little late.
[2:56:30.880 --> 2:56:34.800]  Come back, I'll give you a couple of minutes, I want to hear this, folks I know about all
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:39.440]  this because I live in Texas, I follow the news and I know insiders that actually are
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:46.680]  involved in it and then people who aren't involved in it and we've had judges in Texas
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:52.240]  that are even Democrats that stood up against this and they get shot and I'm just going
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:59.440]  to leave it at that, I mean this is serious damn business and the Mexican mafia, MS-13,
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:04.560]  they're just the handlers for the Democrats on the deep state and elements of the DEA
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:10.480]  and the CIA and that's come out in court and man they got dungeons at the coyote smuggling
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:14.720]  groups all over Texas, they've got them in Austin where if they find out, they get your
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:18.000]  idea that you've actually got money or you're doing something, they then suck money out
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:21.800]  of your family and they catch them, the police even find out and do something and then they
[2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:27.440]  get shut down, people are chained up in dungeons in Austin and it's again, I don't want to
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:32.600]  blame Hispanic people, it's not some versus signal but it's literally leftist Democrats
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:37.520]  are feeding on an underclass of Hispanics and that's why they want to keep them undocumented
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:42.840]  from child running to prostitution to drug running, you're absolutely right, the Democratic
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:46.560]  Party runs MS-13.

[2:59:14.240 --> 2:59:17.120]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:22.880]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:27.680]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:31.760]  to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:37.280]  got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual
[2:59:37.280 --> 2:59:41.760]  level, I physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at
[2:59:41.760 --> 2:59:54.840]  InfoWarsStore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[2:59:54.840 --> 3:00:13.200]  The Alex Jones Show, just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm, they told you never
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:34.800]  hear, someday the mountain might get him but the Law never will, someday the mountain
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:44.440]  get them. The law never will. That's just a good old boy. You know my mama loves me.
[3:00:44.440 --> 3:00:48.120]  All right let's go back to Jerome in New York. He's bringing up a really good
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:52.080]  point. Spend three four minutes on this brother because this is key. It's even
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:57.800]  come out mainstream Senate reports. The news admits it sometimes. They are using
[3:00:57.800 --> 3:01:02.680]  thirty-something million undocumented illegal aliens in this country and so it
[3:01:02.680 --> 3:01:05.280]  is true that most of them are hard-working. Actually it's the truth and
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:10.240]  they're not bad people but a certain percentage are the manager class lawless
[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:14.080]  criminals, whacked out of their brain in super macho culture of killing each
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:17.640]  other, killing police and then you've got managers above that in the Democratic
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:21.680]  Party and intelligence agencies. That's come out in court and I don't want to you
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:24.240]  know say too much here because a lot of us are going to be in confidence and I've
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:29.760]  confirmed it over the years but this is a big sick joke. Go ahead. Yeah you know I
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:36.000]  saw a list of items on a negotiating that Trump I guess is presented to the
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:41.160]  Democrats and one of them was 2,000 detention beds. You know what I did? I
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:44.360]  got on a phone and called my congressman and asked them. They go oh we don't know
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:47.480]  what that means. Well you know what that means. That's for the ones that's come
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:50.980]  across and give them something. Give them three hops and a cots for 20 days and
[3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:56.080]  let them lose. You know that's all that's about. Oh Bito Bragg last week he
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:00.280]  said oh we released 1,200 here, 5,000 there. He was bragging how they're
[3:02:00.280 --> 3:02:05.720]  releasing everybody. That's that those liberal judges out there on the West
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:09.440]  Coast they know well you can't hold these people but for 20 days and you
[3:02:09.440 --> 3:02:15.280]  got to let them go. Well all those those immigration lawyers and all those 501c3
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:20.040]  charitable organizations going there just like vultures. And let's be clear they
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:25.640]  attach the anchor baby all the money and skim most of it and then make the
[3:02:25.640 --> 3:02:31.120]  woman work in a factory and then send the kid to daycare and then get money off
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:35.880]  the kid. Oh sure well yeah that you know you can put them up in your house and
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:38.440]  the government pays you you know for each other. That's right in fact the
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:43.640]  average Democrat gets paid $7,500 a month to hold three people in their
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:48.080]  house and then sign them all up to milk the money. Oh my god the Democrats are a
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:54.280]  criminal force. Oh yeah sure it is. Well you know President Trump that border
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:59.160]  security is his flagship. Without that he's not going to be re-elected or if he
[3:02:59.160 --> 3:03:03.360]  does it he'll get by by the skim you know by the hair on his chinny chin chin to
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:08.720]  get re-elected. The Democrats know it he knows it everybody's supposed to. Jerome you're
[3:03:08.720 --> 3:03:12.360]  calling from New York but I was about to say hair from the chinny chin chin. Are

[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:11.800]  doing it since your reporter challenge my youtube page now broke over a thousand
[3:07:11.800 --> 3:07:15.240]  subscribers I've been doing it every day still and I just want to thank you so
[3:07:15.240 --> 3:07:19.880]  tell us your youtube page my friend it's chase the patriot the same name all one
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:25.280]  would have done well yeah I've put in a few times I just had a whole four hour
[3:07:25.280 --> 3:07:30.600]  marathon live broadcast yesterday it was all about how watch my show instead of
[3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:35.640]  watching the NFL and I just tried to do anything and everything you do a great
[3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:39.120]  job and and you know whether your video gets a thousand views or ten thousand
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:42.480]  views or a hundred thousand some of your bigger videos or 150 like a small one
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:45.720]  you're fighting back and of course you know they shadow band you that's why
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:49.640]  everybody should promote everybody else that's how we do it and ram it down their
[3:07:49.640 --> 3:07:55.480]  throat oh definitely my biggest is only 26,000 but I'm still small potatoes but
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:08:01.240]  hey on the topic today I really only 26,000 people I mean Julius Caesar it is
[3:08:01.240 --> 3:08:06.800]  heights never spoke to have any people that's amazing one video thank you very
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:10.520]  much sir it's all you know I've been trying to do my best but but on today's
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:14.760]  topic I'm really worried and concerned about both President Trump and Mike
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:19.760]  Pence because now that we have Nancy Pelosi third on the list you know most of
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:24.760]  America has a short-term memory when it comes to political history we've had
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:30.920]  presidential assassination they had dramatic changes to political spectrum
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:35.920]  so Abraham Lincoln completely changed reconstruction and McKinley I hear what
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:39.000]  you're saying I don't think Mike Pence and President Trump should probably ever
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:43.120]  be in a room alone because I agree the deep state might set off a nuke to get
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:45.760]  rid of him that's a really good point the Democrats have said they want to kill
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:49.120]  Trump and Pence already tried to kill all the members of the conservative
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:52.840]  caucus at that baseball game attack look at Rand Paul you're right I'm really
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:56.080]  worried about the president because he's winning America's winning and the
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:09:00.200]  Democrats and their chai-com buddies are really upset but Alex here's the
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:04.280]  here's the alarming part you've been alluding to it as well Kennedy was the
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:07.480]  last one to get assassinated and one of the biggest things of course was going
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:11.040]  after the Federal Reserve he had the executive order ready to be signed and
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:14.760]  put in the action the same thing now we hear kind of the same rhetoric out of
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:18.440]  President Trump and he's trying to go after the Federal Reserve and it's just
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:22.040]  one of those things we all need to be a worried about you're right the last time
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:25.600]  a president tried to take control the Federal Reserve he got his head blown
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:29.680]  off and Trump just fired the head of the World Bank which is basically the same
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:33.520]  thing it's the same it's like a double-headed Hydra thank you I'm sure
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:36.880]  Gerald Salente will have something to say about that oh yeah he's got something
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:41.160]  to say I can see him over here like a wild bull in the in the pen ready to be
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:46.320]  released the titan we're gonna release the kraken gates go up when he comes in
[3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:51.760]  live okay thank you chase good points who's been holding the longest now here
[3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:58.040]  any mini-mini moe Nick in Michigan you're on the air thanks for holding
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:02.040]  hello Alex thanks for taking my phone call the second time we've ever been
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:05.520]  able to speak over the line this one to say thank you and thank you to the crew
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:10.680]  thank you if it was if it was life.com if I could plug a few products out big on
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:15.680]  the survival shield we have the super blue 4x3 toothpaste ultimate fish oil I
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:19.120]  just ordered a few more months supply of that we wouldn't be here for you man
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:23.480]  you're really pissing Soros off thank you so much Nick you know I'm just calling
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.080]  to voice my support for Trump but I think that they've the Democrats or the
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:31.920]  elites have kind of forced his hand on this and this is the only way he can go
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:37.560]  about it as you've said and if we can just support him in this and end the
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:41.440]  border controversy before the next election so that it's not a talking
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:45.960]  point for them you know just to go against him that's kind of how I'm
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:49.800]  feeling about it and if I could comment about our geoengineering a comment about
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:53.480]  that after oh yeah I love how the media says it doesn't exist and then it's all
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:59.400]  over CFR Smithsonian AP oh Russia China the EU control their weather with
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:04.200]  antennas and jet spring stuff and of course they're doing this so yes we're
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:08.520]  talking about real stuff but but notice the critics still say we're crazy if we
[3:11:08.520 --> 3:11:12.240]  talk about it because they want to ridicule Americans trying to have a
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:16.640]  debate about something where there's been an international treaty since 1978
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:22.000]  banning it yep and I think that as you can see in the media all these talking
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.520]  points that they put out about you operation mockingbird all they can do is
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:29.360]  try to discredit you at this point Alex they can't they can't say what they can
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:32.920]  point out that what you're saying is wrong because the evidence you know is
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:36.360]  there to show that it's not well you know it's funny you say mockingbird
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:39.800]  mockingbird was what Frank Church discovered was an older name of a 50s
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:44.160]  and 60s CIA program to put out a story and have it regurgitated you can see it
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:49.440]  everywhere we're saying and it's in it is literally Obama funded university
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:11:55.440]  people to be in the CIA and set them up to destroy me two and a half years ago
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:59.760]  and it's admitted they have hearings saying this and I literally have these
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:03.520]  people I'm not complaining but like you think of a CIA like James Bond these are
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:08.800]  all like methhead pedophiles and people I mean I am so honored to have the
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:13.680]  average leftist CIA officer is literally a pedophile that that Boinkers
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:17.480]  little kids every I mean I'm not kidding so I am so honored to have the
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:22.800]  pedophiles hating me good whatever annihilate me I mean I am not part of
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:27.040]  your sick Freco cult so just get it through your head you will be defeated
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:31.360]  you will be crushed end of story but yes you're right operation mockingbirds
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:35.040]  alive and well but they're not wanted but mockingbirds not talking through a
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:40.240]  powerful corporate press anymore they're talking through basically a blown out
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:47.120]  burnout discredited husk I about the geoengineering I do some work for geo
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:54.360]  engineer I did not hang up on that caller he dropped his line maybe that guy was

[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:15.760]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but

[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:37.120]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:42.640]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[3:18:42.640 --> 3:18:47.800]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to

[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:58.240]  jump in for a couple segments here but what do you got coming up today but I
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:01.520]  wanted it I don't know your view on this yet Trump's talking about taking over the
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:05.600]  Federal Reserve declaring a national emergency to circumvent Obama's
[3:21:05.600 --> 3:21:09.000]  emergencies the head of the World Bank who we know was giving all these hundreds
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:14.280]  of billions of China but not to US for development wow looks to look to me like
[3:21:14.280 --> 3:21:17.560]  Trump's taking the gloves off I don't know your view on this yet so don't
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:20.600]  that respond to me I'm gonna punch out but want to hear what you had to say and
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:24.400]  thanks for co-hosting well thank you and thank you for all that you do and all
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:29.800]  the people at info wars to put truth out there in a time of junk news not even
[3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:36.680]  fake news dumb down news on the economy and the Fed you know we had called this
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:45.760]  past September September 19th 2018 to be exact an economic 9-11 that was two
[3:21:45.760 --> 3:21:53.160]  days before the S&P 500 peaked among the reasons the primary reason was the
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:59.400]  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had announced just prior to that that
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:03.200]  they were going to raise interest rates not only this past December which they
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:12.800]  did but possibly three to four times in 2019 that changed and we heard him come
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:20.640]  out last Friday and this is what he said this is from the Fed share quote
[3:22:20.640 --> 3:22:27.800]  we're listening sensitively which isn't great language to the messages markets
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:36.560]  are sending if we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans
[3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:44.080]  would cause problems we wouldn't hesitate to change it Trump just stopped
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:53.320]  the first strike of the economic 9-11 Trump Trump power and we've been saying
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:59.840]  this for months that the president in fact does have a lot of power over the
[3:22:59.840 --> 3:23:05.480]  Federal Reserve Chairman now remember this statement that Powell made last
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:16.640]  Friday came following the news of outstanding job numbers over 300,000
[3:23:16.640 --> 3:23:26.880]  jobs created this is the best year of job creation for a decade wages went up
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:36.120]  go back to last February when news not as good as that came out Powell came out
[3:23:36.120 --> 3:23:40.360]  and said they were going to raise wages and that was the beginning of the end
[3:23:40.360 --> 3:23:49.440]  of the Trump rally all of a sudden with some of the best numbers in new
[3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:56.560]  employment to be seen they backtrack and now they're not going to raise
[3:23:56.560 --> 3:24:06.080]  rates the Fed futures are betting not only will there no be no rate raises
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:13.840]  this year they may also be rate declines we're not saying good or bad right or
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:18.760]  wrong we're just saying what is because the only thing that you stuff the
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:31.520]  equity markets following the panic of 08 was some $26 trillion worth of monetary
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:35.120]  methadone I'm gonna get out of here but let me just state this then and see if
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:38.880]  I'm right from your view we don't love the bubble we don't love the system they
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:42.120]  created but they build it up for the big banks to get all the money none of it
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:45.480]  goes to people Trump comes in divert some of the public he gets it's a bubble
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:49.480]  he's like get jobs back stabilize things politically before this goes down we
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:53.400]  get ready for this crisis he tries to stabilize it and the Federal Reserve
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:56.800]  comes in and goes no we're gonna reversal the policy we have for Obama
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:25:01.960]  Krugman said you'll never hit 3% now you're at 4.5 we're popping the bubble
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:07.440]  and then trying to blame Trump pop it fine don't blame Trump and now he's
[3:25:07.440 --> 3:25:10.880]  going after the head of the World Bank the Federal Reserve is hanging by a
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:14.760]  thread he's moving is going to declare a national emergency tomorrow which other
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:18.960]  presidents do they don't make a big deal about it so I actually positively see
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:23.160]  them witnessing Trump trying to make a real recovery with the with the screwed
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:26.720]  up things he had because he's damn he did damn if he didn't and they are
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:31.440]  literally trying to block that because they didn't want nationalism Americana a
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:36.600]  better trade deal you know basically being being being validated is that
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:40.680]  accurate is that wrong Gerald well I don't know why they're doing it but what
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.640]  they're doing is bringing down the global economy because again you look at
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:51.320]  negative interest rates in Japan they're just hate no I agree everybody else gets
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:55.080]  free money but us that's what I'm saying so clearly enough I'm saying what I'm
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:26:00.000]  saying though Alex is that when you're looking at what's going on globally it's
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  a global slowdown so you have negative rates in Japan you have negative rates
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:11.160]  over in in Europe and now we're hearing from China they're lowering their
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:15.600]  reserve current their reserve ratios for banks to loan more money they're going
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:19.640]  to be sure and the IMF the World Bank the Federal Reserve say give everybody
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:23.000]  else free free money but us exactly that's what Gerald you get it that's
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:28.720]  what I'm saying everybody gets zero but us that's exactly so that's what I'm
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:34.080]  saying the way we said that would bring down the economy would be rate rising
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:39.840]  interest rates stop all this baloney if everybody's bs-ing about tariffs and
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:45.800]  trade wars every damn day tariffs and trade wars if they could add up to two
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:51.520]  they would know that all of Trump's tariffs on China next year if they're
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:59.400]  fully implemented will only account for bringing down the Chinese GDP 0.7
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:06.000]  percent nothing all it has to do is with the Federal Reserve raising money
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:11.640]  raising interest rates the country can't take it so what I'm saying is I'm
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:21.320]  saying to you Alex Trump just trumped Powell Powell bent Powell bent over he
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:27.440]  came out with a statement on Friday that only a little boy a courageous little
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:33.520]  guy with an attitude would say in the language that he said to say listen
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:41.120]  everybody I'm full of crap everything I told you in September I'm just full of
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:46.640]  baloney I didn't mean a word of it because I bend down to pressure and
[3:27:46.640 --> 3:27:52.520]  that's the way you get to be the head of the any of these organizations you've
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:59.000]  got to be a suck up a bow down and take it up Gerald give me your real takes I
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:02.480]  respect you at the end of the day Trump's got a messed up situation he
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:05.480]  sees everybody else getting free money but us he doesn't even like it but he
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:09.960]  says fine at least we're going downhill give us a little a little a little a
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:14.360]  lethal injection here a little bit of hospice opium we're about to die I
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:17.960]  mean I mean I think that what Trump's saying is stop giving us a one-sided
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:23.480]  deal exactly I must I'm saying I need some in favor against it or not I'm
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:28.960]  saying if you want to do this understand the implications because take a look at
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:34.160]  the housing numbers take a look at new mortgage applications holy hell you're
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:37.800]  on I'm not just saying this you are on fire and your analysis of this is the
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:41.640]  most accurate of my own mind that I can't even articulate Gerald Salente is in
[3:28:41.640 --> 3:28:46.920]  fuego he's gonna break this down but he's right Trump just broke the Federal
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:52.560]  Reserve he just fired the head of the World Bank this is incredible
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:57.640]  pain in my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse relief for body

[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:42.240]  propaganda and distortions of the facts and I was talking before about the
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:46.920]  economy and how we had come out and said that it was going to be an economic
[3:34:46.920 --> 3:34:56.080]  9-11 it was based solely on the fact of rising interest rates was that monetary
[3:34:56.080 --> 3:35:00.200]  method drove up the markets and now you're pulling it out markets are going
[3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:07.040]  to go down so too is the economy again look at the housing data apartments by
[3:35:07.040 --> 3:35:10.120]  the way apartment rentals are going way up because people can't afford to buy
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:16.040]  homes and with interest rates moving up makes it much harder so the numbers are
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:23.400]  there and so what we're saying is that if the whole world outside of the United
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:29.160]  States is going with low interest rates they just had it they just up in
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:36.120]  Canada Fed met they didn't raise interest rates over there in Australia
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:44.360]  poof that housing markets going down they didn't raise interest rates so it
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:50.200]  over there in the ECB European Central Bank you know what they're going to raise
[3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:57.880]  interest rates they have negative interest rates well we might raise them
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:08.560]  by the summer of 2019 it's coming summer
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:15.800]  everybody's with low interest rates and they're all injecting money into the
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:28.760]  economy auto sales in China fell 3% in 2018 their first decline in about two
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:41.240]  decades China's retail sales boop down to 15 year lows oh and you heard about
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:48.840]  Apple you saw that stock dive last week when they said that their sales over
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:57.280]  there in China slumped and they blamed it on two things trading tariffs was
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:06.240]  there's no tariff and trade wars again that's all BS minor minor the effects
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:12.960]  0.7% of everything goes into play that will hurt China that's not people are
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:19.600]  in buying cars people aren't going to retail because who we're afraid of
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:26.400]  tariffs and trade wars grow up junior who you're talking to cookie well cook I
[3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:32.120]  got to be proper Timmy we're in that cat really dressed cool yeah one of our
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:37.600]  top trends by the way is that you know the Kings James Bible they say that the
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:44.120]  meek shall inherit the earth we say Kings James spelt it wrong it's the geeks
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:49.440]  have inherited the earth look at the way these people present themselves look
[3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:54.360]  at them that's the style that they have that's the passion that they have you
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:58.040]  can see how they dress how they look how they talk and who they are just look
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:03.280]  at Zuckerberg the only thing that changed from Steve Jobs to him is a
[3:38:03.280 --> 3:38:11.920]  color in a t-shirt from black to blue going back to cookie a cook or cook with
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:17.600]  his crap that their sales have gone down in China because of trade wars and a
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:22.800]  slow in economy the reason their sales have gone down is the same reason they've
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:31.040]  been going down now for two years cookie your product is too expensive and
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:36.800]  Huawei and other manufacturers that had taken over are coming out with more
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:42.480]  innovative products that are a lot cheaper than yours so save your cookie
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:51.120]  crap for somebody else junior that's what's going on there's a global slow
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:39:05.000]  down China they announced that they weren't going to increase cheap dough
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:12.320]  going into the system that was a week ago now China steers cash to small
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:20.160]  businesses oh small businesses yes small businesses employ about 90% of the
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:26.480]  people in China they're dumping all the dough they can to boost up the Chinese
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:37.360]  economy Japan negative interest rates bond yields 10-year bond cash it in in
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:42.240]  10 years you get less than what you're boarded for who's buying them the
[3:39:42.240 --> 3:39:50.320]  government's buying the central bank students five trillion dollars in debt
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:40:01.600]  China's GDP came in last quarter minus 2.5 there's a global recession coming
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:07.240]  underway over there in Europe I got a good deal for you want to invest in one
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:13.880]  of those banks because I'm joking I don't give investment advice bank stocks
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:21.520]  are down 25% last year 2018 and Deutsche Bank that big German bank down
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:40.960]  nearly 60% in stock value one after another European bank takes helm of
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:52.440]  troubled Italian leader that's right they got real problems going on so what
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:41:00.400]  Alex is saying about the Fed raising rates aggressively while they didn't do
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:05.040]  it before is 100% right and again I'm not taking a stand on this but what's
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:11.360]  right is right you don't raise rates when the whole world's rates are going
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:22.040]  down because not only does it hurt the United States and again I'm no fan by
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:32.560]  the way of what Powell said over there before about watching the markets he
[3:41:32.560 --> 3:41:40.400]  said we're listening sensitively to the messages markets ascending the equity
[3:41:40.400 --> 3:41:45.120]  markets are not the global economy or not the national economy data gamblers
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:51.880]  markets the casino players that drove this thing up way out of sight without
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:57.880]  true price discovery so I'm not in favor of giving the markets to boost without
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:06.440]  boosting the rest of us so going back to raising interest rates while the rest
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:11.200]  of the world is lowering them and pumping more money and because when
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:15.440]  China starts pumping more dough in the value of their currency is going to go
[3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:23.640]  down we have a 250 trillion dollar global debt problem you're building it
[3:42:23.640 --> 3:42:28.360]  bigger as the dollar gets stronger they got to pay off that debt they got to pay
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:33.560]  off that debt in dollars a lot of it so the weaker their currency goes the
[3:42:33.560 --> 3:42:38.480]  stronger the dollar goes the more trouble they're in and the Fed's putting us in
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:42.920]  more trouble you know what I think the Fed should do I'll tell you in a minute

[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:58.240]  came out with our top trends this year and one of them has to do with what alex

[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:13.080]  sensible about this if we can if you don't have enough to take care of your

[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:55.480]  out so one of our top trends is called human waves go back a hundred years
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:49:03.960]  ago and they were about let's say 1.6 billion people on the planet 1.6
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:09.760]  billion in a hundred years we've added over 6 billion people so from the
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:16.840]  beginning of time in 1915 1916 1.6 billion people
[3:49:16.840 --> 3:49:24.680]  2019 over 7.6

[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:40.280]  according to a recent Gallup study the 6th of the world's adult population some
[3:49:40.280 --> 3:49:45.920]  750 million people not including children want to flee their home countries
[3:49:45.920 --> 3:49:53.400]  to escape war poverty conflict and disease in Latin America south of the

[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:28.440]  this together into a bigger picture one of our top trends back in September now
[3:50:28.440 --> 3:50:33.320]  is September Trends Journal and in the website by the way is TrendsJournal.com
[3:50:33.320 --> 3:50:44.880]  TrendsJournal.com history before it happens was triangle of death what we
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:56.120]  said is that there's going to be a movement between Brazil Venezuela and
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:51:07.200]  Colombia excuse me Brazil Argentina and Colombia to overthrow the government of
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:11.440]  Venezuela they got some big problems down there
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:16.360]  millions of people are fleeing Venezuela getting away from the poverty the
[3:51:16.360 --> 3:51:23.320]  corruption the destruction and if floating if flowing into Colombia and
[3:51:23.320 --> 3:51:32.320]  other countries down there they want to get rid of Maduro and now just as we
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:37.600]  had forecast again history before it happens foreign diplomats urge
[3:51:37.600 --> 3:51:46.760]  Venezuela's Maduro to hand over power now this isn't coming from a crazy
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:53.200]  group out there this is a report by AP foreign ministers of the Lima group
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:52:00.920]  gathered for a meeting concerning Venezuela in Lima Peru and the group a
[3:52:00.920 --> 3:52:07.000]  dozen Latin American governments in Canada delivered a blistering rebuke to
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:13.760]  Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro on Friday it's last week questioning the
[3:52:13.760 --> 3:52:21.880]  legitimacy of his soon to begin second term and urging him to hand over power as
[3:52:21.880 --> 3:52:30.280]  the only path to restoring democracy in his crisis-wracked South American
[3:52:30.280 --> 3:52:34.360]  country yeah like everybody else's democracy right have you heard this
[3:52:34.360 --> 3:52:40.040]  story before anyway the Lima group by the way it was only formed last year it
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:45.160]  make it sound like this thing's been going on a long time so and now we just
[3:52:45.160 --> 3:52:51.520]  had our Secretary of State down there Pompeo or Pompeo and he was also on
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:57.360]  video from this Lima group and now there's talk about the US opening up a
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:53:06.040]  base in Brazil so we're saying is if you think things are bad now if war
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:16.880]  breaks out between Colombia Brazil Argentina against Venezuela you're
[3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:28.360]  going to see a flood of refugees like you have never seen before this is going
[3:53:28.360 --> 3:53:34.920]  to be a major issue and now as we're looking at again remember the reason
[3:53:34.920 --> 3:53:39.320]  people are leaving I just talked about South America take a trip to Africa
[3:53:39.320 --> 3:53:44.920]  wonderful time going on there in the Congo huh it had an election about
[3:53:44.920 --> 3:53:50.560]  almost two weeks ago they haven't decided who one yet yeah it's one country
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:58.320]  after another Sudan people are out in the streets by the millions one country
[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:06.760]  after another destabilized South Africa they're only in a recession up going
[3:54:06.760 --> 3:54:11.640]  back to South America wonderful time going over there in Argentina just got
[3:54:11.640 --> 3:54:18.280]  a 57 billion dollar bailout from the International Mafia Federation they
[3:54:18.280 --> 3:54:23.720]  got interest rates over there between 60 to 70 percent Peso lost about 50
[3:54:23.720 --> 3:54:29.240]  percent against the dollar Brazil though everybody's you know both scenario both
[3:54:29.240 --> 3:54:33.480]  scenario okay great did get they just in there getting out of their worst
[3:54:33.480 --> 3:54:38.440]  recession in a hundred years going back to Africa you think the people are
[3:54:38.440 --> 3:54:44.520]  going to try to get into Europe and those wars going on in Libya and by the
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:51.480]  way this baloney about we're going to get rid of ISIS in Syria had nothing to
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:55.920]  do with ISIS Obama the Nobel Peace of Crab Prize winner
[3:54:55.920 --> 3:55:01.600]  hitlery Clinton Samantha Powers Susan Rice and lowlife Kerry the Secretary of
[3:55:01.600 --> 3:55:12.760]  State or whatever he was most hit Clinton became Secretary of State the they
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:19.520]  launched that war to get rid of Assad all you got to do is google it up that was
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:24.840]  about the war in Syria had nothing to do with ISIS the ISIS are by the way they're
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:29.920]  funded by Saudi Arabia and the United States I was talked about Libya first
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:35.360]  that's when they put that group together to get rid of Gaddafi the United
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:42.320]  States is the ones that have caused this destabilization in the Middle East so
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:46.800]  now you have all these people being bombed out of their houses it's a huge
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:55.360]  issue and it's going to be a dominant one but you know what in America the
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:02.640]  numbers aren't that great as to how many people are really against it they had
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:08.640]  them here a second ago here they are poll found that 65 percent of Republicans
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:15.040]  say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country Democrats
[3:56:15.040 --> 3:56:25.960]  37 percent it's not only America it's the world again robotics taking over more
[3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:31.440]  and more jobs more and more people coming on to the planet it's gonna be a
[3:56:31.440 --> 3:56:38.880]  huge issue but people are talking without putting it together on a global
[3:56:38.880 --> 3:56:47.440]  scale so as I say all you folks that say bring in more illegal immigrants open
[3:56:47.440 --> 3:56:53.760]  your house up bring them in feed them clothe them educate them pay for their
[3:56:53.760 --> 3:57:00.840]  health care house them if that's what you want to do but don't ask me to do it
