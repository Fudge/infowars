[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:34.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.280 --> 00:45.520]  I'm going to attempt to be calm to be focused to be cogent and to walk
[00:45.520 --> 00:53.760]  through all of the news that we have before us here today but when I got up
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.840]  at about 6 a.m. this morning and went to prisonplanet.com because it is updated
[00:59.840 --> 01:11.160]  first every day I saw a video by the International Center for 9-11 studies
[01:11.160 --> 01:18.520]  they of course were involved suing NIST with others the federal government
[01:18.520 --> 01:26.600]  agency to get videos released thousands of them of the firefighters and police
[01:26.600 --> 01:32.880]  during the 9-11 attacks because the New York Fire Department police department
[01:32.880 --> 01:40.240]  have in all of their units camera people in the last decade plus now it's
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.160]  become more prolific even small departments you'll see it even you know
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.800]  roadside checkpoints or community events you'll see police there with
[01:48.800 --> 01:52.280]  cameras documenting what's going on in case something happens they've got a
[01:52.280 --> 01:59.920]  record of it similar to squad car cameras and that's the problem with big
[01:59.920 --> 02:11.240]  brother it can backfire I called Paul Watson this morning and I asked him to
[02:11.240 --> 02:17.080]  do a special report on this that the skeleton of is going to be up in the
[02:17.080 --> 02:22.560]  next 10 minutes at info wars.com but he's going to be adding to it throughout
[02:22.560 --> 02:31.000]  the day and when you just see one more of these videos where firefighters are
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.440]  talking about before the towers collapse in one case before the second plane had
[02:36.440 --> 02:45.000]  even hit the other tower saying that there were explosions going off in the
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.840]  lobby in the lobby of one of the towers the first tower to be hit this is this
[02:53.840 --> 02:58.800]  is you know a long time before the building collapses and we go back to
[02:58.800 --> 03:04.800]  William Rodriguez the hero who went around opening doors and in saving
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.440]  people and helping people and barely got out and he got out as the building
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.720]  collapsed and he came out that day to local news they said what did you see
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.600]  and they said explosions bombs and we have firefighter tapes and police
[03:16.600 --> 03:22.280]  tapes where they say bombs are going off and on this latest video it's it's
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.560]  it's several firefighters sitting there bleeding dust all over them the only
[03:27.560 --> 03:31.360]  thing we've cut is the cussing you can't blame them after going through
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.560]  something like this and they're saying you know we got to get out of here there
[03:34.560 --> 03:38.800]  could be more bombs they could go off anytime there's bombs in these
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.480]  buildings these are trained professionals and then the media tried to
[03:43.480 --> 03:48.240]  spin it and said oh you know when Willie Rodriguez and police and firemen you
[03:48.240 --> 03:51.800]  later talked about this but also in the past videos that were shot live that
[03:51.800 --> 03:57.680]  day and they said well gas fuel went down the elevators to the to the lobby
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.120]  well the well the elevators are staggered there are you know many many
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.920]  floors memory says over 30 floors up you go up elevators have to get off and
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.120]  then the elevators are staggered they're not continual there there were no fires
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.800]  lower down in the floors there were no you know natural explosions caused by a
[04:18.800 --> 04:27.920]  generator blowing up or whatever they're down there in the building and one of
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.600]  the major towers and there's bombs going off everywhere and then you just come
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.960]  to the realization even though we have all this evidence of 9-11 being an
[04:37.960 --> 04:41.160]  inside job the official story being a fraud but just when you see another
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.560]  video like this it really hits home just how right we've been and I have a sick
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.520]  feeling I'm not happy that I'm right about this I wish it was men in caves
[04:50.520 --> 04:55.620]  that's a lot less scary than the criminals that run our government run our
[04:55.620 --> 05:02.520]  police being the terrorist hello friends this is Alex Jones you've heard me talk

[06:02.960 --> 06:07.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.320 --> 06:11.680]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.960]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:15.960 --> 06:20.320]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.320 --> 06:24.400]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.400 --> 06:28.960]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.080]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.080 --> 06:37.040]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.040 --> 06:40.880]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:40.880 --> 06:43.600]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[08:10.280 --> 08:13.240]  radio network
[08:16.080 --> 08:25.600]  it is Wednesday the 6th day of October 2010 I'm Alex Jones your host G. Edward
[08:25.600 --> 08:32.160]  Griffin on his new documentary dealing with the geoengineering weather
[08:32.160 --> 08:36.200]  modification programs that are now being partially declassified I'll be
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.920]  talking about the new film he has produced what in the world were they
[08:40.920 --> 08:46.560]  spraying coming up in about an hour and 25 minutes from now we'll also have the
[08:46.560 --> 08:56.200]  director of the film a journalist on with us now at the bottom of the hour
[08:56.200 --> 09:02.000]  when Watson's report is posted at prisonplanet.com I'm gonna go into this
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.860]  in full and play the different video clips and audio clips for radio and
[09:07.860 --> 09:14.320]  prisonplanet.tv viewers so we have a clear concise report on this but I got
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.360]  sick to my stomach I mean physically got nauseated this happens occasionally
[09:18.360 --> 09:23.120]  when everything we've documented everything we've researched just gets
[09:23.120 --> 09:30.000]  more added to it that further confirms what we're talking about I wish every
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.440]  day that 9-11 was not an inside job I wish it was a foreign enemy I wish it
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.720]  was a few hundred ragtag men in caves that were turbines on their heads that
[09:41.720 --> 09:48.280]  is not scary it's a little scary but but it's it's not one one millionth as
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.480]  scary as a giant military industrial complex who on record has staged other
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.680]  terror attacks operation gladio hundreds of times in Europe operation Ajax
[09:58.680 --> 10:05.160]  Gulf of Tonkin Northwoods Army field manuals training black op captains and
[10:05.160 --> 10:12.360]  above how to stage terror that's two years old and admitted leaked by wiki
[10:12.360 --> 10:15.280]  leaks the Pentagon admits it's real and once I said they would arrest whoever
[10:15.280 --> 10:23.400]  had released it they can find them I wish every day that it was men in caves
[10:23.400 --> 10:29.000]  but it's not my friends and when you really get into 9-11 truth when you
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.560]  really research it and government-sponsored terror and false flag
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.480]  events it just never ends there is so much evidence the official story is
[10:37.480 --> 10:43.240]  such a ridiculous lie I mean I mean there's simple things like within eight
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.800]  hours of the attacks they had one of the unburned passports of one of the
[10:48.800 --> 10:55.040]  reported Saudi Arabian hijackers found at ground zero there were hundreds of
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.480]  millions of papers hundreds of millions thousands and thousands of offices with
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.560]  tens of thousands of papers mainly Wall Street firms there were you know in
[11:05.560 --> 11:11.000]  some areas 10 15 20 feet of papers on the ground all over lower Manhattan there
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.880]  were several inches of papers several feet of dust asbestos the rest of it
[11:16.880 --> 11:26.160]  and magically the FBI finds a passport and then finds another one two
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.760]  passports in one day that you've got planes going 550 miles an hour they fly
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.640]  into aluminum and steel structure buildings there's a huge fireball
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.800]  there's fires and and and two passports fly out to the ground that is one of
[11:41.800 --> 11:50.200]  thousands of smoking guns of 9-11 it's a fraud it's a lie it's a joke same thing
[11:50.200 --> 11:58.000]  at the airline that crashed in Pennsylvania they magically found one of
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.520]  the passports there as well this is a sick joke and it just goes on from there
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.040]  you have Barry Jennings the deputy head of emergency management in New York
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.200]  City at building seven at the command center and he comes out from the
[12:16.200 --> 12:20.920]  building building seven in the morning with dust all over him with the head of
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.400]  emergency management and says that there were explosions before the building
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.680]  even caught on fire hours before it even collapsed building seven the 47 story
[12:30.680 --> 12:39.120]  building then we get an interview with him for loose change final cut and then
[12:39.120 --> 12:42.880]  suddenly he starts getting threatened and he says please don't use it and then
[12:42.880 --> 12:51.840]  he winds up dead within a few days neighbors we've talked to neighbors
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.440]  neighbors say that he just that the family just moved out in days just
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.880]  disappeared probably a witness protection program who even knows if he's alive
[13:00.880 --> 13:07.400]  or dead this has the classic MO of him being put under but I mean he may have
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.920]  died of a cancer that killed him in a week I mean one of those cancers that
[13:11.920 --> 13:18.560]  kills you like a cold in a couple days kind of like Jack Ruby who took out the
[13:18.560 --> 13:23.200]  Patsy Oswald and we're gonna be playing all of that but there's a new video up
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.320]  on prisonplanet.com new video 9-1-1 fireman secondary explosion testimony
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.000]  nearly released footage obtained from this by the International Center for 9
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.200]  11 Studies they had to sue to get these shows firefighters describing secondary
[13:37.200 --> 13:40.240]  explosions shortly before the collapse of the Twin Towers and and of course a
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.000]  few weeks ago that they released video of explosions going off in seven before
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.920]  the other towers that even collapsed nothing has hit it no plane no debris
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.000]  building seven is literally it's got to be 300 yards away from even the North
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.960]  Tower and there's explosions going off and then Jennings reports the fire
[14:04.960 --> 14:08.240]  department comes in and gets them out and there's dead bodies all over the
[14:08.240 --> 14:14.160]  floor in the lobby first thing black ops does is detonate a bomb to cause
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.040]  confusion before they go in and burn the place down the CIA was in the building
[14:18.040 --> 14:24.280]  defense intelligence FBI all total more than 20 federal agencies IRS the list
[14:24.280 --> 14:31.200]  goes on and on so so we've got people very credible witnesses saying bombs
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.480]  going off in building seven before North and South Tower had fallen do you
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.960]  understand this we have the police we have the janitors we have the firemen
[14:41.960 --> 14:48.600]  in many videos but to the local newscast saying there were explosions going off
[14:48.600 --> 14:53.600]  before the buildings fell namely the North Tower that Willie Rodriguez the
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.800]  hero was in who went back in to unlock doors and to get people out of stair
[14:57.800 --> 15:01.480]  wells because the elevators were shut down and they were trying to get through
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.640]  and the elevator and stairwells are staggered you know they don't go
[15:05.640 --> 15:08.000]  straight up and down there's different levels you have to get off at certain
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.920]  elevators get off at certain you look at the blueprints online certain stairwells
[15:13.920 --> 15:16.520]  you know get off to get on other stairwells it isn't straight up and
[15:16.520 --> 15:23.320]  down and everything Rodriguez talked about and others talked about has been
[15:23.320 --> 15:26.520]  born out to be true and now they've released a lot of the audio tapes just
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.440]  hundreds of firefighters and police talking about there's bombs going off
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.840]  there's got to be bombs everywhere down here this is incredible so at the
[15:35.840 --> 15:40.200]  bottom of the hour or a little bit after I'm gonna do the full report here but I
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.720]  did want to play this video for radio and prison planet TV viewers right now
[15:44.720 --> 15:50.360]  and this is unedited this was shot by the New York Fire Department the only
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.160]  thing that we've bleeped out is the firefighters using the f-word and who
[15:54.160 --> 15:57.960]  can blame them one of them is bleeding out of his nose they've got cuts on them
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.760]  dust and we've got all these other tapes to a police saying get back they're
[16:02.760 --> 16:05.920]  bringing down seven they're gonna blow that building up and then the news says
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.000]  building seven has fallen and it hadn't fallen but they were already putting the
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.840]  official story out they full started that's very common just like you know
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.920]  Australia and New Zealand and several other countries hours before Lee Harvey
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.760]  Oswald was captured or his name was released they had already done off the
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.760]  wire they hadn't happened in the US or Europe or England but they got their
[16:30.760 --> 16:38.760]  time zones wrong they'd already fed them Lee Harvey Oswald they'd already so
[16:38.760 --> 16:52.200]  again stunning evidence on that front so the video is up on prisonplanet.com
[16:52.200 --> 16:57.120]  and Paul Watson's article just went live minutes ago let's put that back up
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.080]  there thank you video this is the headline this is the article to get out
[17:01.080 --> 17:04.680]  to everyone and then below it Watson all day is gonna be adding more evidence
[17:04.680 --> 17:08.960]  because there's so much it takes days just to get all the old articles we've
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.680]  written all the old videos all the hundreds of admissions all saying the
[17:12.680 --> 17:18.440]  same thing firefighters police deputy head of emergency management medical
[17:18.440 --> 17:23.880]  workers janitors all the same thing see you can't pick and choose what you want
[17:23.880 --> 17:27.280]  to believe I know it's frightening that the globalist did this I know it's
[17:27.280 --> 17:31.240]  frightening they clearly use private contractors to set this up I know it's
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.040]  scary to know we've got a government as bad as Hitler who firebombed his own
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.040]  capital to bring in martial law but now they admit homeland security is for you
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.000]  gun owners conservatives libertarians while you were sold on tyranny in the
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.320]  name of hate and brown people that wear turbans who by the way were founded by
[17:48.320 --> 17:52.440]  the CIA the Taliban and al Qaeda that's on record while all that was happening
[17:52.440 --> 18:04.040]  Sybil Edmonds the high-level FBI NSA liaison interpreter has now broken her
[18:04.040 --> 18:10.360]  gag order earlier this year she testified before the 9-11 Commission and she
[18:10.360 --> 18:13.720]  said look the information I told the Commission the information that they
[18:13.720 --> 18:18.320]  gagged me from telling anybody is that I was listening to conversations with the
[18:18.320 --> 18:23.480]  commanders of al Qaeda working for the CIA in narcotics trafficking weapons
[18:23.480 --> 18:27.720]  trafficking human trafficking and terror and that they were about to launch a
[18:27.720 --> 18:41.480]  major operation under CIA command do you understand that this is on record and as

[24:18.120 --> 24:22.960]  the bottom of the buildings and this just confirms everybody else and the
[24:22.960 --> 24:29.400]  local newscast and all the witnesses but then Nest and others and FEMA guarded
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.440]  the site wouldn't let anybody get in to look at it and now we know why because
[24:34.440 --> 24:37.600]  they were shooting their own video and their own video shows what happened the
[24:37.600 --> 24:44.040]  columns blasted off control demolition the whole nine yards we're gonna do a

[25:06.480 --> 25:12.560]  clip after video clip after video clip after video clip after video clip a
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.040]  police environment and the deputy head of emergency management bombs going off
[25:17.040 --> 25:20.320]  in all three buildings including building seven not even hit by a planer
[25:20.320 --> 25:26.600]  debris way down the road no doubt they were running the attacks out of seven
[25:26.600 --> 25:32.040]  that's why the mayor at the time Giuliani went on ABC News that morning and
[25:32.040 --> 25:39.600]  said it's very strange we're running a drill called tripod too in the also told
[25:39.600 --> 25:45.480]  CBS News in building seven but in the drill building seven is under attack so
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.760]  we were told days before by FEMA and remember that deputy had a FEMA said oh
[25:50.760 --> 25:54.120]  yes we arrived in New York September 10th the night before so we were able to
[25:54.120 --> 25:58.240]  respond quite well the next morning yeah they had to be there to be involved in
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.120]  the cover-up and then Giuliani is talking out of school and saying yeah we
[26:03.120 --> 26:05.960]  were running a drill that morning so we've moved everything to mobile command
[26:05.960 --> 26:09.640]  units out at the end of the pier but yeah you've got to manage your stage
[26:09.640 --> 26:16.080]  attack don't you and see most people in the fire department police department in
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.400]  the in the emergency management they're not involved this is all the drill
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.680]  they're waiting for an attack on the buildings boom it happens and they're
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.440]  in control of it and their command center the county and city and state
[26:26.440 --> 26:29.800]  command center were all in building seven they all had their command trucks
[26:29.800 --> 26:36.240]  moved but Barry Jennings he was still in the building and they get word that the
[26:36.240 --> 26:41.760]  first tower has been hit and within minutes boom boom boom lights go out
[26:41.760 --> 26:47.240]  he's going through the building trying to get out goes down the stairwell gets
[26:47.240 --> 26:52.680]  down to the bottom there's dead bodies everywhere nothing's hit seven
[26:52.680 --> 26:58.520]  meanwhile Willie Rodriguez is in the north tower he's one of the head
[26:58.520 --> 27:02.280]  janitors he's got the master key he's going in to get people out the lobbies
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.040]  blowing up firefighters citizens are going around with their faces blown off
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.280]  he described it like a horror movie just blood their skin completely burned off
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.760]  people on fire ah bombs going off all over the place collapsing lobby the
[27:18.760 --> 27:26.960]  elevators are 30 floors up they stop and stagger it wasn't jet fuel coming down
[27:26.960 --> 27:33.760]  there was only fires for a few floors under the impact points most the fuel
[27:33.760 --> 27:36.960]  dissipated that we have the firefighter types for their reporting we've knocked
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.600]  out almost all the fires in both towers there's people standing in the holes in
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.880]  the buildings waving their shirts remember the woman the man help me
[27:45.880 --> 27:53.160]  helicopters help me help me like something out of the movie King Kong and
[27:53.160 --> 27:58.000]  it where she's up on top of the Empire States building and then seconds later
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.400]  giant four-foot-around beams are shattered and ejected 600 to 800 feet and
[28:05.400 --> 28:14.120]  the building is demolished into tiny pieces and we have photos from the day
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.080]  of the rubble the big major beams sliced off at an angle you don't slice them
[28:18.080 --> 28:21.240]  straight across because the beams because of their pressure can still
[28:21.240 --> 28:27.600]  stand you slice them at an angle so they slide off like a hot knife through
[28:27.600 --> 28:39.280]  caramel now we come back we're gonna play this new tape this is shot by the
[28:39.280 --> 28:44.560]  fire department and seized by NIST thousands of these videos that they
[28:44.560 --> 28:51.280]  refused to release have been ordered released I mean I've become so desensitized
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.840]  of this two weeks ago the same group that sued the International Center for
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.040]  9-11 studies that's a group of support they're the real deal everybody needs to
[28:58.040 --> 29:03.160]  really so I'm gonna get them on they released another video where there's
[29:03.160 --> 29:06.880]  bombs going off in building seven well we already knew that but we already had
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.400]  the deputy head of emergency management telling us that and others this is
[29:12.400 --> 29:20.880]  going on at you know nine o'clock in the morning eight hours later at 5 25
[29:20.880 --> 29:26.680]  building seven 47 stories collapses into its own footprint and 25 minutes
[29:26.680 --> 29:32.960]  before they're on two different live feeds BBC World BBC 24 saying the exact
[29:32.960 --> 29:36.560]  same words about it fell in its own footprint from fires and I knew right

[29:39.400 --> 29:43.680]  same thing live then see an end of the same thing and I said probably an
[29:43.680 --> 29:47.720]  internal Reuters and then years later they admitted okay Reuters gave us a

[33:14.000 --> 33:20.080]  the GCN radio network there's a reason I'm one of the most attacked and demonized
[33:20.080 --> 33:26.600]  people by government Southern Harvey Law Center ADL internet trolls Cointel
[33:26.600 --> 33:32.640]  Bro it's because I've committed my life my name my treasure my wife my children
[33:32.640 --> 33:38.000]  to extreme danger and the system doesn't know what to do with somebody like
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.200]  Alex Jones so I do need your prayers ladies and gentlemen because the attacks
[33:43.200 --> 33:47.640]  are intensifying because we understand the enemy's operations and we are having
[33:47.640 --> 33:51.120]  a huge effect reaching millions and millions of new people and that's what
[33:51.120 --> 33:57.000]  scares the system we're not just preaching to the choir every week and the
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.240]  crew has done a great job you know I saw this video about six thirty in the
[34:00.240 --> 34:05.080]  morning did research then decided about ten to pull all the old clips along with
[34:05.080 --> 34:08.680]  this new clip and the problem is so many of these clips have profanity in them
[34:08.680 --> 34:12.760]  with police firefighters and others who just lost friends and themselves are
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.880]  injured talking like sailors that you know just got home for leave and we've
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.360]  been trying to review all these videos and then most of them have cussing then
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.000]  we have to go find versions that we previously played years ago in our
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.640]  computer to be able to play the ones that don't have the cussing but here's
[34:30.640 --> 34:36.280]  the new video and again the search term today is huge explosions that will lead
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.880]  people to this Paul Joseph Watson article that details this whole history
[34:39.880 --> 34:44.200]  this is just one aspect of the inside job that there were bombs in all those
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.200]  buildings they blew them sky-high then you get into all the other areas it's
[34:48.200 --> 34:52.800]  just every area you look at it's it's unending okay I'm sorry it's an inside
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.080]  job okay I wish our country wasn't run by complete psychopathic murders who
[34:58.080 --> 35:02.640]  will shoot up Guatemalan children and black people in this country with
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.320]  syphilis and watch them die I wish they didn't take 4,000 plus foster children
[35:07.320 --> 35:12.840]  declassified and radiate them to death in the US I wish they weren't put the
[35:12.840 --> 35:16.520]  sodium fluoride in the water to give you cancer and give me cancer and attack
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.360]  your genitals and reduce your fertility I wish that every major GMO crop in
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.320]  every major study didn't cause organ failure in every mammal species okay I
[35:27.320 --> 35:30.640]  wish the globalists weren't out in the open saying they want to set up a world
[35:30.640 --> 35:34.440]  government and kill us they're not just going to bankrupt the country they're
[35:34.440 --> 35:37.920]  not just going to lower your standard of living they're going to intensify the
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.560]  amount of soft kills they're putting out there and don't you get it FBI agents
[35:41.560 --> 35:45.240]  and defense intelligence people I know most of you know the truth and are
[35:45.240 --> 35:48.680]  supportive but those of you that work on the dark side of this don't you get it
[35:48.680 --> 35:53.920]  that that that that you are going to be destroyed by this even if you like power
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.760]  and dark evil and being part of this don't you understand you're going to be
[35:57.760 --> 36:08.320]  annihilated as well I mean I pray I pray that this doesn't have to continue the
[36:08.320 --> 36:12.640]  government's been hyping nukes going off in the country what if you think they
[36:12.640 --> 36:18.100]  got a police state going into high gear stage in 3,000 deaths at 9-11 the
[36:18.100 --> 36:22.760]  PNAC said a year before in September 20th 2000 barring a Pearl Harbor event on
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.640]  the mainland of the US we won't be able to launch these wars against Iraq and
[36:26.640 --> 36:33.160]  Afghanistan and Iran if if they'll do something like that ladies and gentlemen
[36:33.160 --> 36:37.720]  they'll do anything and they're destroying our entire civilization our
[36:37.720 --> 36:44.400]  entire society is under attack by this so let's go ahead and start getting to
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.280]  the clips here is the new clips of bleeding and injured firefighters and
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.560]  one of them looks up and he goes there could be bombs in all these buildings
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.080]  we got to get out of here here's the new clip that NIST didn't want you to see
[36:58.080 --> 37:02.880]  and there's literally thousands of these videos that the Center International
[37:02.880 --> 37:07.160]  Center for 9-11 studies and others sued and God the one two weeks ago is bombs
[37:07.160 --> 37:10.520]  going off and building seven at nine something in the morning just what
[37:10.520 --> 37:18.080]  Jennings said you're like well why would they have planes crashing and bombs
[37:18.080 --> 37:23.880]  going off that's a black up you know I've read about Operation Ajax in 1953
[37:23.880 --> 37:27.760]  when they were taken over Iran the CIA this is declassified led by Kermit
[37:27.760 --> 37:34.200]  Roosevelt and MI6 commanders blew up mosque machine gun crowds attack police
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.960]  stations did random things like you know set fires at a horse stall people like
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.680]  well why do that just just confusion they'd randomly shoot people in the
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.960]  street confusion confusion and then they blamed it on Muhammad Mosaddek handed
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.520]  out handbills saying he had done it and then they used Muslim extremists to
[37:54.520 --> 37:58.280]  overthrow him then put the Shaw in who then suppressed the Muslim extremists
[37:58.280 --> 38:04.120]  who brought him to power you know Hitler took over a lot of the Middle East
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.040]  covertly in the North Africa physically he went in in the years before he
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.320]  launched his wars and made deals with the Arab League and others and all the CIA
[38:12.320 --> 38:18.840]  had to do at the end of World War two was step right in OSS MI6 then CIA in
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.280]  47 was step in right where Hitler had been with those networks and promised
[38:24.280 --> 38:28.920]  the Muslim extremist go overthrow this secular government and we'll put you
[38:28.920 --> 38:34.600]  in power and they double cross them the radical Muslims work for the globalist
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.080]  look at Saudi Arabia where 15 of the supposed 19 came from there's another
[38:39.080 --> 38:44.240]  Saudi prince you know top relative of the king you know raping and biting
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.960]  somebody to death in a hotel room and he may not even get in trouble that's in
[38:47.960 --> 38:53.080]  mainstream news today are we ever told Saudi Arabia's bad no no no no no no no
[38:53.080 --> 38:59.200]  any secular government that doesn't put women in burkas any secular government
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.520]  that has 60% of their college graduates including doctors being women like Iraq
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.880]  they're going to be set up demonized and destroyed does it mean Saddam was
[39:06.880 --> 39:11.920]  perfect no but he's a lot better than Saudi Arabia he was our stinking ally
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.400]  until the globalists set him up and told him to invade Kuwait April Gillespie
[39:15.400 --> 39:23.000]  it's on video they gave him 30 plus billion to attack Iran eight years before
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.120]  and it was the same teletype same message do you want me to attack Iran they
[39:28.120 --> 39:33.160]  said we're not going to get involved in her Arab affairs he said yes sir and
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.400]  launched the attack he was put in power by black ops by the people that run this
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.360]  government our government has been seized by foreign banks we don't have a
[39:42.360 --> 39:46.000]  government anymore we don't have a country and no one's safe from these
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  people the sky is the limit with their hubris and their imperial arrogance and
[39:51.000 --> 39:58.160]  the Hutzpah the bravada the machismo whatever you want to call it okay the
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.840]  globalists got it they're bold they're in charge because they are bold they will
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.960]  blow up three buildings in front of you and tell you men in caves did it they
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.520]  will order nor had to stand out in front of you and even when Norman Panetta
[40:12.520 --> 40:16.800]  comes out the head of the transportation department in the bunker with Cheney
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.800]  and watches Cheney order the stand down of the Pentagon defenses when the planes
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.720]  six 60 miles out 45 miles out 10 miles out I mean it's all there people say
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.880]  well something this big it would come out it did come out I've interviewed the
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.160]  police the firemen who saw the countdown to blow up building seven years
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.800]  before somebody at CNN leaked because people hadn't captured or had forgotten
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.080]  about it live singing in saying get back they're gonna blow up building seven
[40:46.080 --> 40:50.440]  it's coming down keep your eye on that building exactly what Craig Bartmer and
[40:50.440 --> 40:57.280]  other police officers told me to my face literally shaking in New York looking
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.320]  over their shoulder you think they like this stuff but see there's the big lie
[41:01.320 --> 41:08.680]  offered don't believe in 9-11 truth it's communists that believe it you know out
[41:08.680 --> 41:15.760]  of the full spectrum of top Japanese officials former German defense had
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.360]  former head of German intelligence former head of Italian intelligence
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.480]  former Italian president coming out saying 9-11's an inside job I mean do
[41:24.480 --> 41:27.920]  they talk about any of them on the news no they'll go pick some guy like Van
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.600]  Jones who signed a petition for a new investigation and then decried 9-11
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.800]  truth and say see if you are for 9-11 truth you're a communist the system is
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.200]  hoping and putting all their money on the fact that you'll just get scared to
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.000]  talking about 9-11 truth they're hoping with every ounce of energy that they've
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.640]  got that that you won't look at the evidence or if you learn the evidence
[41:50.640 --> 41:53.760]  you'll just shut up so they can stage more terror attacks that's their agenda
[41:53.760 --> 41:57.400]  and take our freedoms and take our rights and put this high-tech electronic
[41:57.400 --> 42:05.960]  jackboot straightjacket over our society that's what's happening so 9-11 being
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.640]  an inside job is hidden in plain view and they hope you're delusional and
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.920]  weak-minded and that choose to not look at the evidence choose to not believe it
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.200]  you can't choose what reality is if you stick your finger in a light socket
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.840]  you're gonna get shocked if you jump in boiling water you're gonna get burned if
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.520]  you pour gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire you're gonna get
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.040]  burned if you let foreign banks come in and issue tens of trillions of fiat
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.800]  currency and buy up the planet you're gonna be enslaved it's all happening
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.320]  okay I wish it wasn't an inside job but the truth is the truth is the truth
[42:42.320 --> 42:47.880]  okay it is now here are the firefighters here's the latest clip that NIST had
[42:47.880 --> 42:51.720]  been suppressing there's now hundreds of these coming out thousands of videos
[42:51.720 --> 42:58.160]  total each one more bombshell in the last confirming what all the other videos
[42:58.160 --> 43:02.280]  in testimony and radio chatter said there were bombs going off in those
[43:02.280 --> 43:08.760]  buildings from the minute the planes hit and during the entire time in the
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.480]  lower floors below the basement they were blowing the main supports they were
[43:13.480 --> 43:30.800]  doing it in rolling explosions let's go to the take the whole building just
[43:30.800 --> 43:37.800]  collapsed inside the lobby yes it was definitely secondary explosion we was
[43:37.800 --> 43:47.800]  inside waiting to go upstairs I don't know about the first one but I know the
[43:47.800 --> 43:54.800]  second was it was terrible then it was a third one too after that was inside the
[43:54.800 --> 43:59.480]  building waiting to go upstairs and they just let loose everything just let loose
[43:59.480 --> 44:05.200]  inside the building so what you tell me is that there was a plane or whatever we hit the building in the secondary explosion
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.680]  three explosives after that we came in after the fire we came when the fire was
[44:09.680 --> 44:13.800]  going on already we was in the staging area inside the building waiting to go up
[44:13.800 --> 44:19.960]  still right the whole lobby collapsed on the lobby
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.040]  ma'am after that everybody tried to make their way out
[44:24.040 --> 44:35.680]  the building so black very large airplane fly right into the second
[44:35.680 --> 44:42.920]  over came out of the south right in front of our eyes just so surreal like a movie
[44:42.920 --> 44:55.600]  second second we were in the building for the third one collapse on this drive here for the other one people don't understand there may be more any one of these buildings can blow up
[44:55.600 --> 45:12.480]  it's ain't done yet that is three firefighters one of them senior
[45:12.480 --> 45:19.400]  who went into the north tower exactly as Willie Rodriguez the hero said and many others
[45:19.400 --> 45:27.840]  which have been with these firefighters I've been with these police at bars and hotels and when we've met with them and they are shaking they're
[45:27.840 --> 45:33.680]  looking over their shoulder they told me how they've been threatened and this is like living in an action
[45:33.680 --> 45:44.360]  adventure movie action adventure movie but this is real this is real ladies and
[45:44.360 --> 45:52.360]  gentlemen and you notice so you can't have firefighters getting there too early
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.000]  you can't have firefighters noticing bombs that are in the building so you
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.840]  have it pre-planned when the main group gets in to get ready to go upstairs this
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.280]  before firefighters started going up this is you know 15 minutes or so into it's
[46:04.280 --> 46:07.320]  what Willie Rodriguez says and that's exactly what they're saying they go in
[46:07.320 --> 46:15.160]  they're staging and the lobby just starts blowing up and the same thing
[46:15.160 --> 46:21.080]  happens in the other tower and the same thing happens at seven but seven's not
[46:21.080 --> 46:25.120]  hit by a plane and the same thing happens because you can't have the police and
[46:25.120 --> 46:27.960]  fire people that aren't part of the attack going in and seeing what's
[46:27.960 --> 46:31.800]  happening and then Rodriguez well this is going on he'd be you know opening
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.320]  closets and opening doors you know in the smoke and he'd open it there'd be
[46:35.320 --> 46:40.680]  dead bodies people who'd been killed shoved in them they were busy killing
[46:40.680 --> 46:44.760]  members of the teams that had been there that day who they didn't want to know
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.120]  what was going on that's always what happens you kill a lot of the assassins
[46:48.120 --> 46:53.880]  remember the former deputy head of the FBI mr. O'Neill who had been fired from
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.560]  the FBI and told British newspaper the Telegraph quote they're gonna let
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.840]  Al Qaeda attack to get a police state in America and attack Afghanistan he was
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.720]  then hired as the new head of security and his first day at work was September
[47:05.720 --> 47:12.640]  11th and he died in the towers now here's Barry Jennings down the street after
[47:12.640 --> 47:18.200]  he gets out of building seven hours and hours let me see this is after nine
[47:18.200 --> 47:30.140]  o'clock it collapses at 530 3 and 5 is 8 this is 8 hours plus before building 7
[47:30.140 --> 47:36.240]  falls here's Barry Jennings the deputy head of emergency management who didn't
[47:36.240 --> 47:39.280]  get the memo to be down with Giuliani at the new command center because they
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.680]  pulled out of the building here he is telling you what he saw here's Barry
[47:43.680 --> 47:48.780]  Jennings from this space back on chambers in that area so now they're
[47:48.780 --> 47:51.920]  walking back toward the World Trade Center and as we keep letting you hear
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.720]  the personal stories the survivor stories of exactly what happened inside
[47:55.720 --> 47:58.760]  the World Trade Center when that first plane went in and of course the
[47:58.760 --> 48:02.400]  collapses since then we're gonna bring more of those to you now Barry Jennings
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.120]  you're on the 8th floor you work for the city housing department explain to me
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.040]  the moment of impact me and mr. Hess the corporation counsel on the 23rd floor I
[48:11.040 --> 48:14.080]  told him we got to get get out of here we started walking down the stage remains
[48:14.080 --> 48:19.520]  at the 8th floor big explosion who was back into the 8th floor and I turned the
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.480]  hedge I said this is it we're dead we're not gonna make it out of here I took a
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.560]  fire extinguisher and I bust the window out this one is general this gentleman
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.240]  here heard my cries for help this gentleman right here and he said kept
[48:31.240 --> 48:34.320]  saying stand by somebody's coming to get you they couldn't get to us for an
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.880]  hour because they couldn't find us I thought that was it I thought I thought
[48:36.880 --> 48:40.840]  we're dead I thought that was it I started praying to Allah I said that's it we're
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.200]  going what was it like for you you were inside there as well this
[48:44.200 --> 48:50.400]  pandemonium I mean it was something like out of a Bruce Willis die hot movie he
[48:50.400 --> 48:53.760]  was there and he was crying and there was another gentleman crying and and for
[48:53.760 --> 48:57.600]  help we couldn't get to him we tried to get through the which we went through
[48:57.600 --> 49:01.560]  the buildings we were lost both staircases with the backsides completely
[49:01.560 --> 49:06.120]  blown away there was no way to access as we couldn't get to him and finally one
[49:06.120 --> 49:11.000]  of the fire department team found him we didn't think we didn't think that we're
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.560]  gonna make it well certainly you got out many others didn't of course we don't
[49:14.560 --> 49:17.680]  have a number right now fatalities or injuries all right but I want to
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.840]  translate a story to you now that that's building seven before it collapsed now
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.360]  that's in the morning now they've now released NIST footage of Jennings and
[49:28.360 --> 49:31.680]  Hess the head of emergency management screaming for help confirming the other
[49:31.680 --> 49:38.080]  witness and they've released audio you can hear on the video of explosions
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.400]  going on I mean nothing's hit seven there's a few windows knocked out for
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.960]  small debris suddenly boom whole side of the building's blowing out then NIST
[49:48.960 --> 49:52.400]  gave six different reasons why seven fell now they've had to retract all those
[49:52.400 --> 50:00.240]  and they don't say why it fell overbuilt to sustain a terror attack now we come
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.600]  back we're gonna play fire department described the bombs planted in the
[50:06.600 --> 50:12.680]  World Trade Center it's as if they had detonators boom boom boom the stoop the

[54:12.840 --> 54:17.720]  couple times a year and it's in our computers but I thought we had the one
[54:17.720 --> 54:22.000]  without the cussing where they're talking about you know the bombs the
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.360]  detonators it'll take a little while we've got the clip they're having to put
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.840]  beeps over the firefighters so that'll be in the next segment of the segment
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.440]  after that but we do have one clip from New York TV when they were interviewing
[54:33.440 --> 54:38.200]  them that day where they're not cussing and they're talking about molten steel
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.720]  coming down the channel rails like it was a foundry that's where they smelt
[54:42.720 --> 54:49.600]  metal it's like lava so here is that clip
[54:49.600 --> 54:56.680]  I think he just did it to who knew I to be honest with I think it he might have
[54:56.680 --> 55:02.520]  thought that was it for us to help you get down below and you'd see molten steel
[55:02.520 --> 55:08.760]  molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry
[55:08.760 --> 55:18.680]  like a lot of screaming there wasn't a lot of yelling obviously there was no
[55:18.680 --> 55:27.400]  machinery I mean those and that they're in there not understanding why this is
[55:27.400 --> 55:30.920]  when the planes have hit they're going in and there's molten metal just pouring
[55:30.920 --> 55:36.160]  out they're like what what is this folks jet fuel burns maybe 1800 degrees steel
[55:36.160 --> 55:40.800]  starts weakening at about 2500 it starts melting past 3000 depending on its
[55:40.800 --> 55:47.000]  its makeup what type of steel it is and that's what the thermal photographs by
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.160]  NASA from its aircraft show of temperatures months later in the pile of
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.880]  over 2500 2600 degrees some of the reading show were 3000 this is months
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.480]  later this was high-tech weapons that they were using in their high-tech bombs
[56:05.480 --> 56:11.880]  and I've got a list here of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.480]  eleven twelve thirteen fourteen different clips Justin Paul Joseph Watson's
[56:17.480 --> 56:23.360]  article I'm begging you if you've been a critic of 9-11 truth and you haven't
[56:23.360 --> 56:26.280]  looked at the evidence and you make jokes about it this isn't a joke this is
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.160]  your life we're talking about our lives go watch all the firefighters go watch
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.040]  all the videos understand this is impossible understand that Willie
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.840]  Rodriguez who was you know this big hero on national TV that he was then
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.480]  demonized for saying no there were bombs going off the firefighters all know
[56:45.480 --> 56:48.560]  about it there were bombs going off down the bottom of the World Trade Center
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.880]  North Tower he's a hero you know he's had the courage to come out with many
[56:53.880 --> 56:57.280]  others and then they get ridiculed and and then for nine years they say the
[56:57.280 --> 57:00.720]  dust isn't bad for him it turns out the government knew and lied about it and I
[57:00.720 --> 57:04.200]  saw the New York Post call the firefighters and police ambulance
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.600]  chasers that are trying to get medical care just like our troops who are
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.760]  exposed to the depleted uranium our troops are exposed to the depleted
[57:12.760 --> 57:18.200]  uranium the Army's own reports know it's gonna give them cancers birth defects
[57:18.200 --> 57:24.280]  kill them with degenerative cancers and other disorders and you know they just
[57:24.280 --> 57:30.920]  say doesn't matter the Pentagon and the and the veterans affairs the VA will
[57:30.920 --> 57:34.920]  not give them medical care for the DU because they won't admit DU's hurting
[57:34.920 --> 57:38.920]  them when the Army's own manuals have had the head of the Army's DU program on
[57:38.920 --> 57:44.720]  the show a lot of his team have died he's had 20 plus surgeries that's
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.080]  destroyed his kidneys that's because that's where it comes out of the bones
[57:48.080 --> 57:52.120]  and the body and you know really concentrates in the kidneys and the
[57:52.120 --> 57:57.960]  the urinary tract he's got cataracts from it and that's what their own reports
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.560]  from before Desert Storm and the new war the Army knew this back in the 50s when
[58:02.560 --> 58:06.920]  they were looking at using DU as a weapon they said we can't it causes organ
[58:06.920 --> 58:11.400]  failure it attacks the kidneys it causes skin cancer it causes cancer of the
[58:11.400 --> 58:17.520]  sinus wherever it it concentrates it's like asbestos but hundreds of times
[58:17.520 --> 58:22.320]  worse this is what they think of you don't you understand that they're
[58:22.320 --> 58:28.280]  murderers who see human life as less than worthless they see it as a negative
[58:28.280 --> 58:33.600]  as trash to be taken out they see it like dog droppings in your house they

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.400]  them in New York who saw they were saying what's going on this is at 5 you
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.680]  know 20 something in the afternoon why are you saying get back from 7 and they
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.880]  said they're bringing it down you know the firefighter commanders the police
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.040]  commanders and the globalist spin this and say you're saying the fire chief and
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.200]  the police were involved no they're compartmentalized they're told get back
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.040]  it's coming down so they didn't hide that fact they go get back it's coming down
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.880]  keep your on that building it's gonna be blowing up in a minute and you've had
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.400]  all the local newscasts that we've aired where they were saying we're thinking
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.120]  about blowing up seven well then the question is how did you blow up seven
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.720]  so quickly how did you get bombs in a building that had already blown up in
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.800]  the morning when nothing hit it as police and the deputy head of emergency
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.760]  management Barry Jennings and others have set on record but I had interviewed
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.960]  people who said this exact same thing before it happened I talked to an EMT as
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.520]  well who walked up and said what's going on why get back and it was a plain
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.400]  closed person on the radio identifying themselves as part of the medical team
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.200]  and they said look look I can't tell you I can't tell you and then all of a
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.000]  sudden he just turns the radio and it's seven six five four and he goes just
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.760]  run for your lives and use why you see cops and firefighters everybody starts
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.280]  running Amy Goodman when she had a local show the head of democracy now she's
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.680]  there and you see her and she's you see firemen and police running there's
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.980]  building seven a few blocks down and and she's going what's going on and I've
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:28.240]  talked to the police the firefighters the medical workers who all saw this the
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.960]  countdown the screaming the yelling and we've got footage from multiple local
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.320]  stations and seeing in as they're saying get back they're bringing it down and
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.360]  Amy Goodman starts running and boom boom boom that sucker goes down in its own
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.560]  footprint at freefall speed and the government lied and said no it wasn't
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.400]  freefall you know because that would mean bombs and later they said okay it was
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.280]  freefall freefall now let's go ahead and play this clip of the cops saying get
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.360]  back get back to keep your eye on that building it's not going to be there in
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:20.000]  a minute here it is
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.320]  just in the last few seconds another building building number seven one of
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:37.240]  the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed this is
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.560]  no small building as you can see if 47 stories it would stand out in most
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:51.280]  American cities what did Dan rather say he said let's go to tape of building
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.000]  seven seconds after it fell he said let's replay the tape this is reminiscent
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.480]  of where they use dynamite to knock a building down Peter Jennings said the
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.680]  same thing but you can hear the police going get back it's coming down it's
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:11.080]  not going to be there and you hear they're like you hear that you hear that
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.120]  all these clips are in Paul Joseph Watson's article right now video 911
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.640]  firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers collapse the North Tower
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:28.280]  that was all seven same story with the North Tower but this is a long time you
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.640]  can go to the timeline from Willie Rodriguez and others a long time before
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.480]  it fell firefighters had just gotten there they were going into the lobby boom
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.840]  and then boom boom same thing in building seven how do you create
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.360]  confusion how do you make sure all the cops and emergency workers don't figure
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:52.080]  out what's going on you blow up several floors of building seven at least 10
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.720]  minutes after the towers had been hit you go to the timeline a little bit
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.440]  more than 10 minutes and then they're trying to get out of the building and
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.360]  boom you're not going anywhere you aren't on the team that got the warning
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:12.280]  you're not part of the dark side now how important is it to get this new video
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:18.000]  that we played earlier in the last hour video 911 firefighters reveal huge
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.120]  explosion before twin towers collapsed and then you read the article and it
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.640]  goes through everything and has a links to all the videos and it's already a
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.760]  lengthy article Watson is going to be adding more evidence because it's a
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.680]  bottomless pit of evidence all day long to this article hurt Nemos getting it up
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.960]  at info wars dot com right now we need your help to get this story out to
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.320]  everyone because the globalist have built their global war they have built
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.760]  all their tyranny their naked body scanners their secret police their
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.160]  citizen spies their mayac and homeland security reports and now switching from
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.240]  al-qaeda being the enemy to conservatives libertarians gun owners
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.880]  returning veterans and they're training youth teams to hunt down and kill
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:06.200]  veterans at new york times scouts trained to take on veterans you cannot
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:19.320]  make this type of stuff up again ladies and gentlemen again this is so hardcore
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.560]  what's happening this is so huge what's happening and I wish this wasn't true I
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.200]  wish this wasn't the case okay I wish that 9-11 wasn't an inside job but it
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.160]  is just with the bombs just with the buildings that's total proof and the
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.840]  thermite residue and all that evidence then you got nor at standing down you
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.680]  got cheney ordering the Pentagon to stand out in front of Norman Panetta the
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:48.760]  head of transportation you've got the head of the US visa section in jettison
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.440]  Arabia springman being told you know I'm not gonna let these people in they've
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.680]  got terrorist backgrounds state department says don't worry it's a CIA cover
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.680]  you know let Muhammad out at all these people in that's what he was told then
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.280]  we have MSNBC hijackers trained at US military bases you have James Woods the
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.240]  actor a week before the attacks on a plane and atta and others are getting up
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.800]  like doing drills they thought they were doing you know airport security drills
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.440]  they were hired by Homeland Security boy do they get set up and we now know the
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.160]  FBI was paying for their houses their credit cards this is all come out they
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.040]  had Israeli shadowing them as well the art students this all even came out on
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.920]  Fox News she got all this intelligence going on and James Woods tells the
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.880]  flight crew when the plane hits its destination he tells everybody they
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.440]  say don't worry about it a day later the FBI shows up and basically says shut
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.360]  your mouth about what you saw and we know atta and then we're doing drills
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.800]  everywhere and good people in government who aren't part of the dark side they
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.280]  tried to stop all this like Anthony Schaefer the colonel and now it's come
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.920]  out with other witnesses the Pentagon that he's telling the truth that they
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.560]  were blocked from stopping Al Qaeda was running this operation because Sybil
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.560]  Edmonds who was tracking it as an FBI translator listening to the NSA tapes
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:18.600]  she said on the day of 9-11 the CIA was commanding Al Qaeda in Afghanistan for a
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:25.880]  major attack running Al Qaeda Sybil Edmonds running Al Qaeda she told the
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.280]  9-11 Commission that and they slapped a gag on her but she broke the gag last
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:36.800]  year a lot of courage they can't shut us all up but they they want to cover this
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:43.520]  up shifting gears because you ever Griffin is coming up and we're gonna
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.520]  play a special video interview we did last week with him in Los Angeles
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.840]  concerning the new film what the world are they spraying dealing with geo
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.320]  engineering we're gonna play that video clip at 33 after before we go to him
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:05.920]  live but for the rest of this segment and the next I want to get into the
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:16.080]  economy because it is incredibly important obviously gold has hit another
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:23.640]  all-time record today and we'll put that on screen and to talk about this what
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:33.000]  is it 1345 dollars and 50 cents it's not even taking a breather normally does
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.080]  before it goes back up again it's up $4.90 today and while I'm digging out
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.000]  my financial news stack that I know is here somewhere in front of me I wanted
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.840]  to bring Ted Anderson up to give us a report on what he sees happening in
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.920]  the precious metals market today Ted Anderson thank you for joining us yeah
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:00.160]  thanks for having me up today Alex we did hit a high already today at 1350 40
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:06.600]  silver won over $23 an ounce 2309 like you said it's right now I've got it at
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:14.040]  1340 680 2305 for silver the the resistance level now was moved upward
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:21.000]  from that 300 that 1350 level now to 1375 gold and the the support levels at
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.960]  1313 which is up from 1300 Alex golden silvers breaking loose and breaking
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.480]  forward again we're still in early October you know Morgan Stanley is is
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.400]  out of the business of manipulating the market according to what they say from
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.680]  the news yesterday that could have a lot to do with why gold is going up I know
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.400]  the dollar is falling you know a lot of a lot of things that used to be in place
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.120]  aren't in place anymore so there's gonna be a little bit more of a free market
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:55.160]  movement in the gold and silver and you know Alex you and I just said it last
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:02.000]  summer please get into gold and silver do it now while the prices are low we're
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.320]  still in you know I mean gold right now at 1350 for those of you who have been
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.200]  thinking about it but haven't moved yet you know you're now looking at 1350
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.080]  rather than 1200 and if you if you wait my guess is you're gonna be paying over
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.720]  $1400 an ounce in that spot range for gold well I mean I've got MSNBC and AP
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.080]  saying 2000 in the near future so so we've actually been squeamish I have
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.200]  gold as an emergency backup remember that Bloomberg headline yesterday the
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.320]  ultra rich are buying gold by the time the ultra rich are taking physical
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:44.240]  collection of it and the Federal Reserve was back out today saying and
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.960]  Quirk Nemo's got an article about it in info wars.com that they are going to
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.480]  accelerate the devaluation of the dollar we'll talk about what that means the
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.240]  only way I know to somewhat protect yourself is nothing's perfect from

[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.480]  while they were devaluing the currency globally in a concerted devaluation

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:06.320]  it's to the banks and in its debt by the executives of the bank in companies
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.960]  they gave themselves loans in I just saw on the paper a few days ago a Texas
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  bank where the executives have stolen billions and the news my dad actually
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.920]  showed it to me with this Texas based bank said that well since they were the
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.800]  executives it you know doesn't matter if it's accounting fraud or controller
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.960]  fraud they're not going to get in trouble with this one Texas bank for
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.600]  stealing over three billion dollars for themselves the bank went under because of
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.680]  bad loans but they get to keep the money hey that's good work if you can get it
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.120]  it's a special criminal class that gets away with this Ted it's all coming to
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.400]  ahead they're devaluing currencies worldwide gold is shooting up I think now
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.840]  is the time I mean it's not rocket science for folks to calling it gold and
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.400]  silver and I know the deals at mitusresources.com the deals were linked
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.680]  to an infowars.com are excellent but the radio specials are the very best now
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.360]  you're about to run a goal that again you bought a few weeks ago just like you
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.640]  bought around a goal that you bought a month ago what are your specials now and
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.560]  how long can you hold them well the specials are the same as they were
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.760]  yesterday despite the fact that small silver and gold is just rocketed upward
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:19.760]  $10 the walking Liberty half is at $10 and 83 cents Franks for a 289 British
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.680]  sovereigns 362 we again we have bags of silver $20 liberties here's a good one
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.640]  1685 $20 liberties usually carry a premium that's much higher than that
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.840]  and related relativity to spot gold there's there's a whole long list of
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.520]  things we just barely touched on it yesterday notice you still have buffaloes
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.400]  on your site I do because I'm trading them onesie twosies man if you want to
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.000]  have a buffalo or two you can order them and I'll fill that order but you're not
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.720]  gonna get a hundred of them the creature from Jekyll Island you mentioned
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.520]  yesterday Alex is that I'm selling it at 1995 we put a silver dollar in there
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:01.560]  silver is $23 an ounce excuse me excuse me it was 26 you've lowered it with
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.640]  silver dollars on average are going for about $25 a piece spot silver over 22
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.560]  $19 you get a $19 book and basically a free silver dollar yeah well but there
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:18.600]  is $6.50 for the priority shipping so all together it's 2645 but you know I
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.800]  don't care where you where you look under what rock across the entire world
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.680]  right now try to buy silver dollars you're not gonna buy a silver dollar and
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.120]  get it shipped to you for less than 26 smackers no you're not and that and then
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:36.800]  you get the creature from Jekyll Island book which is just a great essay on what
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.640]  you know how the Fed came into existence and what they've been doing Ted you
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.480]  cannot beat that 800-686-2237 Ted is has been around for 30 years but he's
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.680]  becoming you know a major player because these radio specials and nobody can
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.480]  match him and Ted is a wild man but again even though these are great deals
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.760]  it's gonna go up and the next deal will be great because it'll be less than what
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.320]  anybody else has but get involved now folks that is I mean that's what I'm
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:13.480]  doing 800-686-2237 800-686-2237 it's key when you call to explain this is the
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.640]  radio special from Alex Jones because your prices are more of it's not the
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.640]  special right they are and every now and then somebody will call in and say hey I
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.200]  want that buffalo coin and the and the broker is gonna give him a price that's
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.600]  current and they're gonna say wait a minute you have it on the internet and
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.440]  it's a lower price the reason why that is because it's a special for Alex you
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.000]  have to mention that and then they know that that's right the the link is in
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.040]  Steve Watson's latest article that is out dealing with $2,000 gold expert says
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.800]  it's a given that it will exceed 2,000 it's an info wars.net

[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:41.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.960]  really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from

[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.840]  yes the film what in the world are they spraying I think is going to be a very
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.560]  important film and it's going to shock a lot of people
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.680]  interesting deal Christina this is of interest not just in this country but
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.120]  European countries and frankly all over a lot of folks interested well Dave you
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.520]  mentioned that climatologists and others who study the atmosphere believe that
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.680]  they'd be able to surely spot any kind of signs of an ominous plot scientists
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.280]  gathered at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting in
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.520]  San Diego to discuss the plausibility of implementing various geoengineering
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.720]  campaigns throughout the world all under the guise that the earth has a man-made
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.760]  global warming problem that can in part be solved by spraying aerosol aluminum
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.240]  and other particles into the sky to block the sun when these scientists were
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.080]  asked about existing aerosol programs they stated that no such programs have
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.520]  been implemented to date this contradicts the claims of many who state that
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:25.080]  worldwide aerosol programs have already been started they are spraying
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.760]  something I think everyone's innate intelligence tells them what they see in
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:33.320]  the sky those crisscrossing and these these white trails that go to horizon to
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:38.760]  horizon that's not just ice crystals forming at the back end of jet engine
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.760]  those ice crystals are absorbed into the atmosphere very soon you can see them
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.080]  trailing along right behind an airplane as it flies across the sky there's a
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.920]  little trail of white smoke and it just follows the plane it disappears that's
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:56.040]  totally different from these billowing fumes of smoke that go from horizon to
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:01.440]  horizon and spread out and by the mid afternoon the sky is milky white it's a
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.280]  result of a relatively new industry springing up called geoengineering
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.920]  there's a group of scientists and political figures and corporations who
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.480]  are planning to make a great deal of money in changing the nature of our
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.800]  planet is called geoengineering fighting global warming by putting a chemical
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:28.320]  dust in the atmosphere and reflecting harmful radiation back into space we
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.320]  take to measuring to mean deliberate large-scale intervention in the system
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:38.200]  there are a variety of schemes that have been discussed for geoengineering and
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:45.200]  classic example is injecting reflecting particles into Earth orbit and they
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.800]  say that it's just in the talking stage right now they say we're talking about
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.960]  spraying aluminum and bury them into the into the atmosphere and they say we need
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.800]  to do studies to see if there are toxic effects and so forth and they're saying
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.560]  all the right things as though they're deliberating it but the evidence is
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.640]  abundant now that this has been going on for over a decade it's been going on
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.200]  it's going on right now as we speak believe it or not military aircraft
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:15.160]  flying through the region is dropping chaff small bits of aluminum sometimes
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.360]  it's made of plastic or even tele-sized paper products but it's used as an
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.720]  anti-radar issue and obviously they're up there practicing now they won't
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.680]  confirm that but I was in the Marine Corps for many years and I'll tell you
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.120]  right now that's what it is this is inevitably military or something going
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.320]  on the government the Air Force you see this kind of a pattern like this you
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.880]  can rest assured there's something going on they're actually little bitty
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.400]  magnetic and little bitty strips of whether it's aluminum we all we now know
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.120]  what they're spraying we can identify it there have been many laboratory tests
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.920]  taken of not only the soil and the water but from the rain water and from the
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.560]  snow now this comes from the sky you can't say it came up out of the ground
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:03.760]  and these tests have been taken from atmosphere and rain water and snow in
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.240]  areas that are hundreds of miles away from industrial centers so you can't say
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.000]  it's being blown there from a smokestack or something like that and what
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.440]  they're finding is an alarming high level of toxic substances on Mount
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.360]  Shasta for example you should find no aluminum whatsoever in snow up there
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.960]  because it came from the sky it's 60 times higher on the snow on Mount
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.320]  Shasta extremely toxic hikers are drinking that stuff they're gonna kill
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.920]  themselves so they lose their minds or something like that and we find this all
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.520]  over not just in Mount Shasta we found high levels in beautiful islands of
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.320]  Hawaii where they've been spraying a lot and you take the samples out of the
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.760]  rainwater this stuff is coming from the sky but to make matters even worse
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.680]  they're lying to us about it and that's the message in our film what in the
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.840]  world are they spraying
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  I'm G. Edward Griffin I'm one of the producers of the video what in the world
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.720]  are they spraying in my view it's one of the most important documentaries you're
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.360]  going to see perhaps in your lifetime order it now it'll be delivered on
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.000]  October 22nd but get your copy now so you'll be one of the first ones to have
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.440]  it
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.320]  this film what in the world are they spraying goes a long way towards waking
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.980]  the people up so I salute the filmmakers and I ask all of you to get
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:44.320]  involved today and to make sure that everyone in your circle understands
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:50.160]  just how deep this globalist program is the film is what in the world are they
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:59.400]  spraying pre-order it now and see it first on DVD at info wars calm ladies
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.360]  and gentlemen we are live and you just saw the new five and a half minute
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.920]  trailer that we shot last week with G. Edward Griffin in southern California
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.320]  it's up on info wars calm and prison planet calm if you want to go see it of
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.920]  your a radio listener you can find that it the video is titled G. Edward
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:26.080]  Griffin talks about new chemtrail film it's also at the Alex Jones channel on
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.520]  YouTube and if you want to pre-order it it's going to be shipping out on or right
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:34.760]  after the 22nd of October it's completed it's now going into the
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.400]  manufacturing process I've seen the final of it very very powerful film
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.720]  because it's the first film post-disclosure they haven't disclosed it
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.480]  fully but they go yeah we've been doing some testing want to do more testing but
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:51.560]  we know it's a huge secret global program there was a Nobel Prize handed
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.280]  out in the early 90s for the idea the White House science are John P.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.920]  Holdren talks about it they're gonna save us from global warming by
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.120]  spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts that are very toxic on the
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:06.680]  population and of course G. Edward Griffin is a writer and documentary
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:12.200]  filmmaker and he really needs no introduction and of course he's in our
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:17.960]  film Fall of the Republic he's also in the film I produced Invisible Empire and
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.760]  these films are very well done they're very well documented and they're
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.920]  waking people up yes you know all about this most of you but your friends and
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.960]  family don't and so you can give them what in the world are they spraying and
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.000]  it's going to be shipped out in the order that they're received usually just
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.080]  takes us a few days to ship out all the pre-orders once we can officially
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.640]  release it what in the world are they spraying available at info wars.com or
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:48.400]  by calling toll free 888-253-3139 you can also write to us and by the time we
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.120]  get your order in the mail it should be about time to ship it out to you at PO
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:41:04.440]  box 19549 Austin Texas 78760 again PO box 19549 Austin Texas 78760 or 888-2533139
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:09.680]  the easiest way to get it is the online video bookstore at info wars.com and
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:13.080]  we're going to add today some combos where you can get the video and get some
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.280]  of my films discounted while you're at it makes a great Christmas gift but the
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.560]  fact is the the main mission here is to expose this global secret program and
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.320]  several of the big facets are covered in G.F. Griffin's film you know we even
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.080]  sent camera people some of the same government you know meetings that are
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.120]  actually in this film where they're admitting that they want to do this and
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.400]  are looking at it but we have all the declassifications we have the patents
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.400]  where they can mix it with the jet fuel where they they've been already testing
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.120]  it you know they call this giant global program testing but some countries don't
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.480]  have it some do any country basically dominated by the angle American
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.320]  establishment has chemtrailing going on all the time and it's weather
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.880]  modification but it's more than that and I was excited to see that they were
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.840]  making a film because my film that had that covers chemtrails partially in my
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.640]  years of research we're working on two years won't be out till next year so I'm
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.720]  we don't have time who knows what we'll be next year this is a great film order
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.960]  what in the world are they spraying at info wars.com and get it first also
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.840]  there's gonna be an event where they're gonna premiere it on the 22nd out in
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:23.360]  Atlanta Georgia and we'll also tell you about that as well but going to G. Edward
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.400]  Griffin G. Edward it's good to have you here with us and I'm glad that you're in
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:31.280]  this film and have put your name behind it and are producing it because this is
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.840]  vital information. Well thanks Alex I'm glad to be here and turning that around
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.680]  I'm delighted that you've got such an intense interest and knowledge on this
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:45.440]  because you know you're you're the kind of a guy with the credibility and the
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.400]  following that can really put this over so thanks for doing that. Oh you bet tell
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.280]  us how you I mean you when you started researching aerosol spray weather
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:59.840]  modification persistent jet contrails as they're known and about this film. Well
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.080]  I kind of backed into this Alex as you probably remember I've always had a
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:09.280]  strong interest in the topic but I've never had the time to dig into it myself
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.200]  and do some really original independent research I've always depended on the
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.640]  research of others and still it's pretty much that way but I wished I had had
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.120]  time but I was so tied up with the issues relating to the Federal Reserve
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.240]  system and and alternative health issues and so forth. The items in which I've
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.320]  worked mostly in the past I just didn't have time to go any further into this
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.440]  chem trail issue. I had strong feelings I had enough information but I knew that
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.680]  it wasn't these simple vapor trails it wasn't just contrails as they say but
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:44.280]  anyway beyond that I wasn't really prepared to offer myself as any kind of
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.120]  an authority. Well it turns out that there was a couple of there were a
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.880]  couple of young filmmakers Paul Wittenberg and Michael Murphy that decided
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.560]  they were going to do a video investigation of chem trails so as luck
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.840]  would have it they called me and asked if I had an opinion on it and so would I
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.000]  mind making a statement for their cameras. I said oh sure I've got an opinion on it so
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.040]  come on over so that's how I met these fellows so I gave them my little
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:17.040]  statement on camera and then they put it up on the internet and well it was
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.120]  such a strong response and we discovered that there are people all
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.080]  over the world that are equally concerned and just dying for real
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:29.960]  information so anyway to make a long story short Paul and Mike and I decided
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.120]  to pool our resources I decided that if I could go on and try and provide some
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.160]  funding and ask for donations to get this film done give them the money to
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:44.120]  complete it that then they could run with it. Well they went to Hawaii they
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.680]  went to Europe they went all over the US right just amazing and and since I
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:52.400]  announced you know a year ago or so send us footage of chem trails I've gotten
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:45:01.000]  them from Australia Spain Russia Mexico I mean time-lapse of just a blue sky and
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.320]  then it's just turned into pure trails that hours later are still there that's
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.960]  not ice crystals. Absolutely not and it's amazing you know I get a lot of
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.080]  flak flak just as you do I'm sure from people say well yes it really is I
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.440]  crystals and they try and justify it and of course they can make a pretty
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.200]  interesting case until you start looking into the details which we don't want to
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.400]  go into all that now this common sense tells you that these are not ice
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:30.480]  crystals and of course the proof of the pudding is that you measure what's
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.120]  coming out of the sky I mean there's stuff coming out of the sky and you can
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.320]  catch it in rainwater you can catch it in the snow and these fellas have been
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.040]  around at the world as you mentioned and they're talking to researchers who've
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.680]  done exactly that one interesting case was up in Mount Shasta area where my
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.880]  gosh you can't think of a more pristine area than that it's hundreds of miles
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.960]  away from any industrial area so you can't say well this is just smoke
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.400]  coming out from the smokestacks or something like that and they went up
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.280]  and up to these snow caps on top of Mount Shasta and that's supposed to be
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.000]  about as pure water as you can find anywhere in the world and they tested
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.920]  it and lo and behold there's aluminum in it aluminum and barium now there's not
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:18.120]  supposed to be any aluminum and barium falling out of the sky that's supposed
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:22.040]  to be zero but what did they find well it's interesting that the EPA has a
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:27.240]  measurement that triggers an alert you have to do something if there's as many
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:32.320]  as a thousand parts per billion of aluminum in in water so what did they
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:39.640]  find up there 60,000 parts per billion in pristine snow water well and that's
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:45.040]  60 you know that's a what is that that says 60 times greater than the level
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.960]  that requires government action and you've got the test all over California
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.440]  Hawaii other areas that are even higher than that in pristine areas Hawaii I
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.680]  mean what's going on in Hawaii there's no there's no reason for aluminum and
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:01.480]  barium and strontium to be falling from the sky in Hawaii so anyway you can
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.200]  argue to your blue in the face about these are contrails or these are ice
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:10.200]  crystals but the proof really is in what is falling from the sky so that's
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.680]  that's you know that's I think where we should focus rather than this issue of
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:21.360]  cam versus contrails well absolutely but I mean Aaron Dachs was up here late
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.880]  last night but if he's here now will you guys bring me the big blue folder
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.320]  because next hour I want to go over our research I mean I'm not waiting till my
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.240]  film comes out next year I've seen your film it's excellent it covers a lot of
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.680]  key facets that are admitted and then gets into some of the things that are
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.320]  being discovered but I want to actually show people the patents the admissions
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.440]  you know if you search the terms there are thousands of universities
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.400]  Department of Energy the Pentagon they're all up there quote doing testing they
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.880]  call it testing but now for the public they're coming out and saying oh we're
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.440]  about to start testing and people 15 years ago when I was first covering this
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.120]  with experts who'd gotten samples they were saying aluminum dioxide barium
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:05.880]  salts then magically what is that White House science are say magically what do
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.000]  all these big scientific journals say we want to spray aluminum dioxide barium
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.440]  salts all in the atmosphere to create nuclei to block out the sun to protect
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:22.320]  us from global warming it's exactly what researchers said 15 years ago like
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:27.200]  Mr. Carnacombe and and so many others exactly what Jim Keith said 15 years
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:32.360]  ago and you know they killed him I mean it's just all right there and so we've
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.920]  gone from being laughed at I mean I remember being on the radio in 1996
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.360]  people saying what is this with these trails it's the summer they're like 5
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:43.720]  thousand feet they're persistent it makes me sick when they hit me I mean you
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:47.040]  know before people were even calling them chemtrails people were talking about
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:51.880]  this well yeah they had the evidence has been there as you said were at least
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:58.040]  15 years and it's just amazing to me how so many of my associates never
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.200]  noticed I mean the sky is covered with these crisscrossing trails horizon to
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:07.720]  horizon and by mid-afternoon it's milky gray and it's coming down you can see
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.800]  sometimes it just sort of streaks down you can you can feel it in your lungs
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:16.840]  people are complaining about having congested lungs there people are getting
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.880]  analysis and finding these chemicals in their hair and their fingernails and
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.280]  their bloodstream chemicals at high levels that aren't supposed to be there
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:28.720]  and I noticed all my friends look up say chemtrails chemtrails what chemtrails
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.800]  I mean my gosh it's just amazing I guess it's a modern phenomenon we live in
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.280]  big cities we don't look up because normally you can't see the sky anyway
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.720]  it's tall buildings everywhere you go but it's amazing how people are in
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.760]  denial let's say well oh yeah I see those well there's something wrong with
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.560]  those I don't know I guess they never looked at the sky before but I think
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.360]  what it is is that there's a tendency for people to believe authority so if
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:00.160]  authority says it's nothing but contrails then that's it that's the end of
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.320]  it or if authority doesn't bring it to their attention and say there's
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.960]  something wrong then they say well there's nothing wrong and as you know
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.680]  Alex there's a big move now for prestigious scientific groups to try
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.400]  and convince people that these are nothing but contrails like NASA has
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:20.560]  come out fairly recently with the on their website you can go there anybody
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.640]  click on it and I'll explain to you in detail how all of these streaks of
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:28.800]  smoke and and everything and nothing but ice crystals and the reason that's
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.480]  we're seeing more of it now than before they say is because there's more air
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.640]  traffic now than before let's talk about that when we come back and then get
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.560]  into the aluminum in the soil and what that means to plants and with Monsanto's
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:47.760]  up to the film covers with devastating accuracy and then we'll show that next

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:15.880]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:23.360]  George straight was singing seashores of old Mexico
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:30.200]  it sounded so good I got a night there we are back live with the G Edward Griffin
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.280]  and we have Michael J Murphy one of the other producers and directors the
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.920]  journalist political actors from Los Angeles area and he's put out this
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.760]  great film what the world are they spring available at info wars.com it'll
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.560]  be premiering in Atlanta on the 22nd G Edward Griffin will be there we'll give
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:51.480]  you a website coming up the next hour so you can get tickets to that attend that
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:58.280]  side issue I'm speaking at the coconut Grove in Santa Cruz on the 24th of
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:03.640]  October it seats 800 they've sold almost 700 tickets with me plugging it twice
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.600]  that's what I keep telling people I don't do speaking events folks very
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.840]  often because I don't have the time though we can reach a lot of people make
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.960]  local news do all that should I do five or six radio interviews a day and make
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.200]  films and reach tens of millions or should I fly around giving speeches but
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.320]  because I'm already out in California in a secret investigation I'll just leave
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.960]  it at that I'm gonna kill two birds with one stone because the great folks out
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.960]  there at that station have done this in fact we'll put up their website on
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.040]  screen and now I'm talking to MZ who owns the two stations I'm on it covers
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.600]  San Francisco you name it big stations we really appreciate him that's the main
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.920]  reason I'm going he's now wanting me to come in on Saturday and speak to 1500
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.600]  and that'll probably sell out in four or five days I mean I think to really show
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:57.040]  up Glenn Beck who couldn't get 700 just to show people how the real power of
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:00.880]  this show and the real Patriot movement maybe we should have an event in DC in
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.800]  six months and have 500 towel there I mean I don't think people understand
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.560]  folks you know the amount of people we're reaching when I say we're reaching a
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.840]  million live on the show over a million after when it rebroadcast I mean you know
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.640]  at current growth rates it'll be three million a day in a couple months it's
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.480]  I'm not bragging it's actually very daunting to have this responsibility on
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:24.040]  me but shifting gears before we get back into the chemtrails you ever
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.120]  Griffin you've talked about this I mean what's your breakdown of the level of
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.720]  the explosive awakening we're seeing and the globalists are openly saying they
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.480]  want to start censoring the web now well I think you've pretty well covered it
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:42.080]  is explosive is that it's exponential and on this issue of geoengineering or
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:47.480]  chemtrails whatever you want to call it it was already such a massive
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.840]  proportions that I didn't realize it I thought from my personal experience that
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:57.720]  you know we have a hard road to hoe there in the beginning getting people
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.520]  interested in it and I think as I mentioned before when I put it up on our
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.560]  little website which doesn't have anywhere near the exposure as yours as
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.880]  well we're interested in doing a video anybody want to help us why we were
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.400]  inundated with responses immediate responses I mean within two days we had
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.760]  this whole thing done from all over the world people were you know contacting
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.840]  us from all of the basically the NATO countries where they have all the
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.780]  spray going on so yeah it started off with such an explosion that I couldn't
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:31.480]  believe it and it's gotten even more so I got a phone call just before the
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.640]  show here from a fellow in Toronto as a bookstore there he says we want to do a
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.360]  screening is that okay okay of course it's okay we're delighted and so people
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.200]  are just volunteering to do the kinds of things that in the past we used to have
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.080]  to promote you know we'd have to go out and say we do this we do that we want
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:54.320]  to promote this and now they're coming to us and say how can we help so we've
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.720]  really touched a nerve here and I think you're right Alex if you want to go on
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:05.560]  the road or put something to show just just for the media purposes just show
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:10.120]  the massiveness of this movement I think it probably would work out exactly as
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.680]  you said it's incredible we're gonna come back and get into human
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:18.200]  experimentation you just to show you know they don't care of aluminum hurts
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.920]  you they don't care this is part of their larger plan they call it killing
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:28.240]  more than two birds with one stone don't forget we're making this search term
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:34.720]  number one today you the listeners and it is huge explosions that will lead them
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:38.080]  to the new videos released by next to firefighters saying bombs in the
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.320]  buildings
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:53.080]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hundreds of nations have
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:57.760]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:02.320]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:06.600]  from underneath the Americans at home turning members influence on our
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:10.800]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:16.040]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:21.200]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.560]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:29.720]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:33.160]  Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:39.400]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:44.760]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:51.160]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV
[01:59:51.160 --> 02:00:00.520]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:29.480]  Alex Jones here's the headline from prisonplanet.com Obama administration
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:33.960]  pressures ISP to censor websites because they haven't been able to pass their
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:36.840]  cyber security act where everything's wired to the federal government it's
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.360]  already wired they just want to be able to officially do it we've got this
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:46.680]  article from mainstream news is what Paul Watson sources and they say we want
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:50.040]  to just be able and in fact you saw Lieberman say this last year he wants
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:53.720]  his office to be able to tell YouTube when to take something down there's no
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.440]  judge there's no jury there's no free speech everything censored by hair
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.920]  Lieberman and you know that's the scary thing here gee ever driven before we get
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:06.800]  back into chemtrails in your new film is that we are exponentially growing we're
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.200]  going to win we can see the end of the finish line we're actually ahead of the
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.600]  globalist they're trying to come out in the open intimidate us tell us to shut
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.720]  up make us think that they're invincible you know the Borg can't be stopped you
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:24.360]  will be assimilated and resistance is futile but they are really putting up
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.160]  trial balloons and promoting it in Europe as well to really start censoring
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.320]  people there's no question about that they've been talking about that for
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:39.320]  decades haven't they I remember when the internet first became a reality a lot of
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  my friends some of whom pretty well known but say don't worry about it we
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:48.080]  won because they can't they can't censor the internet it's just physically
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.360]  impossible I thought are you kidding they can do whatever they want that these
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.720]  these guys run the governments of the world and they have the police power
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.000]  they can intervene in some way oh no you're wrong at the internet is different
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.040]  well anyway we've seen it all change and now yeah they've got the technology they
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.240]  can throw the switches they can pass the laws and make anybody that doesn't
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:12.160]  comply guilty of some kind of a heinous crime and way they go but that's the
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.200]  that's the bad side of the good side is that the movement of awareness that
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.320]  we're discussing is is growing in exponential fashion and there comes a
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:22.920]  point I don't know where it is but there's a tipping point where they
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:28.240]  just can't get away with it anymore without some kind of a massive negative
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.960]  reaction that shows up in the political arena that's why they're you know
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.400]  planning to I think they're planning to have some kind of a major crisis event
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:45.120]  so as to to distract from all that and regain that momentum in favor of let's
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.440]  have more security let's you know have more police action here to protect us
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.760]  from this dreaded enemy could be a terrorist attack it could be a
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.800]  biological attack I don't even know is what they might dream up global warming
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.480]  global economic collapse global poverty they've always got a solution give the
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.880]  central banking families and the royalty the power to set up a private
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:10.600]  world government that sets all the rules and levies taxes yeah and that's all for
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.920]  our good you see it just like this global warming theme but they're not
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.680]  doing that to control the population or to make money or increase their
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.800]  political power they're doing it for us they're doing it to save us to save our
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:25.720]  planet to improve crops and all of that nonsense that they dream up and
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:29.000]  unfortunately many people believe it because they want to believe it you
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.800]  know they're they're in love with authority they're in love with licking
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.240]  boots I guess they don't feel good about themselves briefly before we go to
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.440]  break it back into the chemtrails and human experimentation and your
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.480]  discoveries on aluminum and the patents and all the rest of it well with this
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.040]  aerosol program that's now starting to come out of the shadows into the open
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.440]  because we've been exposing it but briefly dealing with 9-11 we've seen
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.680]  all these new terror alerts ahead of the election are you concerned about
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.480]  false flag events I'm very concerned about that Alex because you know anybody
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:06.840]  that's been following this movement for any amount of time knows that that's one
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:13.160]  of the the the most powerful cards they have up their sleeve when it used to be
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.880]  that when totalitarian leaders were getting in trouble and losing support
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:22.360]  at home they would start a war that was the traditional time-tested method of
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.680]  bringing the population back under the control of the ruler but now it's a
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.760]  little refinement on that it's not just a war but it's a war that's triggered by
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:37.080]  some kind of a false flag event so that the people are angry they think we've
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.200]  been attacked we've been injured you know we've been insulted we can't stand by
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.560]  and just let this happen now let us get behind our glorious leader and fight

[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:17.360]  okay the next 45 minutes or so I need to do the last segment on the news blitz
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:20.680]  because there's just so much I haven't gotten to but this is a big issue a
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:25.920]  secret NATO country it's in all the NATO countries it isn't in other countries
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:29.480]  in our NATO control we've noticed the Anglo-American establishment nations
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:33.960]  huge aerosol spring weather modification program but that's only one part of it
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.400]  and now they're coming out with more and more of it in fact as you guys find
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.960]  Aaron's big blue folder with all the documentation well let's call him and
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:43.520]  get him up here I know he worked till about midnight last night because I'm
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:47.000]  meant to have that today I like to run back and get in his file cabinets during
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.920]  the break is I want to show you just some of the patents and the admissions
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.600]  we'll also take a few calls before they leave us on chemtrails specifically
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.600]  1-800-259-9231 but Michael J. Murphy again as a journalist and
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:02.840]  filmmaker and he's produced this film and what the world are they spring
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.440]  available at info wars.com with G. Edward Griffin Michael tell us about as much
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.280]  of the film and I've seen it it's excellent as much of the film as you
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:14.200]  want to give away and really the big discovery here that all about old
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:18.040]  Monsanto they're they're rearing their ugly head again aren't they that's
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.400]  right with the GMOC but Paul Winterberger as well as involved with the film we
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:27.360]  brought him on to the project maybe did a great job but essentially our
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.960]  investigation into these programs started at the American Association for
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.280]  the Advancement of Science conference where geoengineers proposed brain 10 to
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:41.200]  20 million tons of toxic aluminum into the sky or do what they call with the
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:48.000]  stated goal to cool the planet so after that meeting when when they literally
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.920]  they're coming out publicly addressing this issue and essentially selling it to
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.800]  the public in denial that these programs have been already implemented but what
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.280]  they're saying is that they're looking at these however we went around
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:09.240]  literally over to Europe over to several different states here in America and we
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:14.920]  researched tasks which revealed extremely high levels of aluminum
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:20.820]  barium strontium the areas where they've been finding these tests in the
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:27.120]  rain snow and soil they've all also been finding major declines in the forest
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.840]  and in the crops that are producing because as the scientists that we spoke
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.680]  to aluminum barium and strontium will increase the pH of soil so for instance
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:43.240]  in Northern California they have seen at a bare minimum 10 times the increase
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:48.560]  in the alkalinity in their soils and the scientists up there believe that this
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.680]  is the direct result of the spraying of aluminum barium and strontium what a lot
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:59.840]  of people believe these programs are in part obviously it's a multi-agenda
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.080]  operation but they believe thinking about this new GMO state that it could be
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:10.680]  in an attempt to kill off anything that's natural and organic because there
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:16.360]  is a new GMO aluminum resistant seed that has been manufactured that will
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:22.600]  thrive in a high aluminum soil oh don't worry you know all these major crop lands
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.560]  have been poisoned and normal natural plants won't grow in it but Monsanto's
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:34.760]  got a whole new seed line corn wheat whatever it is canola soybeans it's
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:39.080]  all being developed it's all being patented we've got stuff that'll grow
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:43.960]  when nothing else will oh you notice your trees all over central Texas are
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:48.920]  dying oh on the California coast they're dying and arborist and plant experts are
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.560]  testing it and saying it's aluminum and they're dying in Hawaii but they'll don't
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:59.040]  worry Monsanto's not just developing major food crops now they're coming out
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:03.800]  with GMO palm trees they're gonna come out with the tea tree oil they've got it
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:10.280]  all for you isn't that sweet of them very true and that's a concern for for
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.200]  many of us and we also filmed for a week on a remote part of the island in
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:18.600]  Maui, Hawaii and I know that you saw the film Alex but for a week we Paul and I
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:23.680]  stayed on this little organic farm and we ate off of the land you know we go out
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:29.560]  pick our lunch literally off of the trees and and make food and a growing
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:34.760]  concern on that part of the island is you know I really admire the way that
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:39.200]  people there live because it was they were free they didn't have to exchange
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.480]  money to eat oh well S-510 went in that because you're not allowed to even grow
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:49.160]  and eat your own food under that and that's just one part of it yeah and
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:55.120]  that's very scary to many of us who are aware of that but they're concerned that
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:59.120]  not only with the new legislation this might be an attempt to kill off anything
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.560]  that's on their land and you know I couldn't help but to look forward and
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:07.120]  say what if it's going to be like in ten years so the people that live here are
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.480]  going to have to go to a corporation for a corporate fee and what are the
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.560]  requirements for that will they have to get licensed will they have to pass
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.520]  certain exams what will be the taxes and we know the honey bees are dying all
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:23.560]  over the Western world and NATO countries mainly we know that a lot of
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:27.120]  crops are having trouble you guys interviewed scientists and others who
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.720]  would go into streams and you know talk about how just ten years ago it was
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:35.360]  full of you know all sorts of life but now it's dead and what do they find
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:42.480]  loving aluminum yes and in major quantities and you know I'd like to
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:47.800]  bring to light a test which was taken on Mount Shasta and as a baseline about
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.600]  seven years ago they took a snow test and it revealed seven parts per billion
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.720]  aluminum also barium and strontium at much lower level however one year ago
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:04.080]  Francis Mangels who is a retired USDA biologist took another test and I just
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.280]  want to throw this out there how high do you think that test was after it was
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.120]  60 parts 60 parts per billion or 60 times the safe level 60 thousand I
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:20.760]  think I already gave that away Michael in a previous excuse me it wasn't 60 it
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:29.320]  was sick give us those numbers it was 61,100 parts per billion oh excuse me so
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:35.360]  it was just how many times over the safe level is that that's over 61 times the
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:40.560]  safe level established for drinking water and people are climbing that mountain
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.920]  and they're using the snow to hydrate and by the way you have a clip in the film
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:50.600]  of a local newscast in Washington state with the guy going look I was in the
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:55.920]  military this is some kind of military spraying of aluminum here not just you
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.640]  know chaff more than that and and that you there you have the newscast in the
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.200]  very area where you're finding the aluminum in high levels and you've got
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:08.160]  the newscasters saying look at this this is not a natural weather system
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:13.800]  exactly and there are literally this has been on the corporate mainstream media
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:18.600]  just not at the level of attention that that we believe that it deserves it's
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.960]  been covered a little bit here a little bit there but you know something so
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.800]  damaging I mean aluminum is so toxic to ecosystems but also we interviewed a
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:32.600]  lot of physicians and health care professionals and they said aluminum is
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:38.920]  extremely toxic to human health and we've seen God in the ten-year period in
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:44.360]  LA County we've seen over 200% increase in all timers and at the same time
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:49.880]  worldwide we're seeing an incredible increase in aluminum related illness
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:55.880]  well we're now seeing early onset and even you know youth people 25 30 getting
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:01.480]  Alzheimer like symptoms and then we've had top brain scientists on like Dr.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:05.600]  Blalock Russell Blalock and they're just seeing it across the board not just the
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.360]  tin cans we're drinking out of that are that are coated in bisphenol A that's
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.880]  bad enough I mean this is a this is incredible I mean this is so big and
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:17.840]  it's out in the open now more and more it's coming out in the open give us your
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:23.000]  breakdown on all of this geograph and the discovery of Monsanto developing
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.080]  these aluminum resistant seeds well I certainly have to go along with the
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:33.520]  general observation that corporations like Monsanto they're certainly not the
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:38.960]  only ones in the field they're you know they have buildings full of scientists
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:44.720]  and marketing experts who are looking for ways to make money using you know
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.840]  their expertise which is geoengineering so naturally we know that they have to
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:53.640]  be looking at this just from a pure business point of view met they are
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.160]  they admit they are there they brag about it and then they tell their
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:00.800]  stockholders that's what they're doing and and that's on the basis of how they
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:05.320]  pay dividend and all that sort of thing I do say however that we have to be a
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:10.080]  little cautious when we talk about this because these people are not dumb and
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.880]  what the information they reveal even in their patents may not be trustworthy
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:20.320]  because for example not I want to get too deeply into this but just to give you
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.160]  an idea that of the pitfalls on the the minefield that are out there for us I've
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:30.640]  been talking with the with a biochemist recently that said well the kind of
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.600]  aluminum that is in the patent that we're talking about is an aluminum which
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:40.640]  believe it or not is considered to be acidic it had been depending on the
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:45.320]  molecular form of it there is a form of aluminum that is acidic at least it's
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:50.880]  more acidic than other forms which are clearly in the in the alkaline range and
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:56.080]  they said he said that if they sprayed that on the soil it would have the effect
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:02.240]  of actually preserving the acidic quality of the soil rather than making it
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:06.520]  alkaline I said how can that be well he explained it to me he convinced me as a
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:11.200]  scientist he said you know he's PhD guy is this it's been his life work and I
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:16.440]  said oh I see because of the cation's or this little electron connections that
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:21.360]  it measures as more acidic it that's right so we both concluded that well
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.800]  that means that what they're spraying may not be what they patented for it
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:30.640]  may be so absolutely there's hundreds of patents that I'll show listeners yeah
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.200]  this right here this is just one of the folders of our research for our chem
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.040]  drill film and we know it's a whole bunch of different programs and
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.360]  operations but but here's the 64 million dollar question into both of you what
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.840]  type of aluminum do they find on Mount Shasta well if they didn't ask for any
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.560]  specific type of aluminum however getting back to the patents I've spoken to a lot
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:56.520]  of scientists as well in the concern while everything that it says is truly
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:02.800]  correct aluminum can easily be activated because it's a very complex metal so
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.160]  yet you know what while it is 100% correct with what he says there's still
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:11.000]  that doubt because they are spraying aluminum and it can be activated very
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.600]  easily so you know we don't want to completely rule that out however it is
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:20.120]  something that we're careful um yeah that's the only thing we just have to be
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:25.080]  careful and and I might add just to finish this out that this this fellow I
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:28.280]  was talking to said well there is another ad there's another aspect of this
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:33.120]  that has nothing to do with pH so what what could that be is it well it's that
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:38.440]  he said all forms of aluminum tend to inhibit the ability of a plant to
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.800]  uptake moisture so maybe we're looking at the wrong thing in this pH level any
[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:48.160]  form of aluminum will inhibit the plants ability to uptake moisture and that's
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:53.960]  the reason that these seeds have to be genetically modified to deal with the
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:59.040]  moisture question not necessarily the pH question so it gets complicated regardless
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:02.120]  they've covered up the program we know the program's real this is Alex Jones
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:06.040]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:09.400]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.240]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:16.360]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:20.280]  possible that could even happen again so our friends and solutions from science
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:25.000]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.280]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:37.400]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre

[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:18.200]  next segment we have Michael James Murphy on the producers and directors of
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.400]  what in the world are they spraying the powerful new film we have the interview we
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:25.880]  did in person with Jebra Griffin last week mixed into a new trailer up at
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:30.520]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com for what in the world are they spraying we
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.840]  premiered that earlier in the last hour here's this giant folder I've got while
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.840]  they're talking I'm gonna be flipping through it we've got a giant section on
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:42.120]  patents including something I've never seen anybody cover for mixing aluminum
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:46.840]  to oxide and things with jet fuel to disperse it I mean this is incredible
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:52.160]  and this is just one small folder even though it's about four inches tall of
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:57.240]  all of this garbage that's going on and and I think what Jebra Griffin said is
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:02.320]  absolutely accurate we don't know the larger operation we just know that old
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.240]  timers did test and said it's aluminum to oxide barium salts and other things
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:11.480]  and now they admit oh we want to do test with this to spray from jets I mean
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.640]  it's exactly what the old timers analyzed it to be and we know there's a
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:20.760]  weather modification an over-the-horizon radar use of this I mean there's a lot
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.920]  of things going on here Jebra Griffin well that's right and it's enough to
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:31.040]  make your head spin and sometimes I think that's not to our advantage we
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.080]  had we covered too much and people to get in overload and they tend to just
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:38.280]  drop away because they can't you know can't hold it all up there the first
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.480]  time around but I think the bottom line and the thing to keep really focused on
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:48.080]  is that the evidence is now overwhelming that they are dumping toxic stuff on us
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:53.480]  they're spraying toxic stuff on us supposedly for our own good and to make
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:59.800]  matters worse they're lying about it that's all we really need to know before
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.320]  and we ought to be energized into action with that information whether we
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.480]  understand all of the rest of this is you know it's almost secondary they're
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.400]  spraying us they're killing us they're making us sick and they're lying to us
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.080]  about it that's right I remember about five years ago a caller called the show
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.680]  and because you don't know the term to search for we had a lot of government
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:23.640]  documents about weather modification and chemtrailing but nothing we have like a
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.760]  thousand times now I mean I'm buried in it to my neck and the caller said Alex
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.360]  search indirect and semi-direct aerosol campaign indirect and semi-direct
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:38.000]  aerosol campaign and you'll find it all and I magically put it into Google and
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.200]  it was tens of thousands of governments universities department of energy and it
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:51.760]  was just a C bigger than the Manhattan Project literally of just wild testing
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.600]  of everything you could imagine going on aluminum being one small part of it but
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:03.240]  but something that keeps rearing its its ugly head but your comments on that G
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:07.920]  Edward and mr. Murphy well go ahead Michael well you know I can address
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  that while we believe these they're spraying much more than simply the
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.280]  aluminum barium and strontium we just focused on on what's being found which
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:21.240]  is scary enough and I'm gonna go back to the ecological problems that they're
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.280]  seeing around the world and then the health problems of course that that has
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.480]  seen a major increase with with just addressing that you know and we are
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.840]  just scratching the surface with the film we're hoping that other people might
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.600]  address this and question it and look into it more do you more than scratch
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:41.940]  the surface you show they admit they've been doing testing now they're
[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:46.560]  proposing it and publicly and then denying they're even doing testing when
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.000]  you put them on the hot seat they absolutely aren't fatigued denying
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.440]  this sort how Jeremy Ross Michel and myself were at the AAF meeting and we
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:01.960]  confronted them on the current appointment of these programs and they
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.520]  flat out denied it and then we finished the film in Washington DC where Jeremy
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:12.000]  all and myself went and we addressed over 35 members of Congress and senators
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.480]  all who for the most part they were literally running from the issue in what
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:23.520]  appeared to be a cover-up and we also addressed our Gordon who is the chair of
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:28.000]  the science and tech committee who just completely alluded the question when we
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.680]  spoke to him about the current deployment so well no no and if somebody
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:37.480]  was took from what I was saying that this film was only scratching the
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.560]  surface this film is extremely deep and covers a whole bunch of key subjects
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.480]  that's the point I was making I'm drowning in it I've been trying to make
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:51.120]  one for two years and it's just so much evidence and so many different programs
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.360]  I don't know where to start so I salute you guys getting this film out so
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:59.360]  quickly well one of our one of our decisions we had to make right up front
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.720]  is you know how many issues or sub issues do we cover in it I kind of look
[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:08.160]  at each other that man we'll be we'll never get it done if we try and cover
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:12.600]  every aspect of it so that was a decision just to focus on the the spraying
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.800]  parts and the toxicity part and you know a moment ago when I said they're lying
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:20.640]  to us about it that's a pretty strong statement and I don't make statements
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:24.440]  like that unless I'm prepared to back it up and the two areas in which they're
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:29.400]  lying to us one is that they deny that this is underway and the other area is
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.320]  that they deny that they know anything about toxicity on the film you see one
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:36.280]  of these scientists say well we don't know if it's toxic we haven't looked into
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.800]  that yet and now we have the papers right on the internet that show that they
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:43.560]  have looked into it and they found out it's terribly toxic so they're like
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:51.520]  let's let's expand on that after the break long segment coming up we're on
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:59.800]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:05.000]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.200]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:12.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.760]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:20.200]  body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:24.560]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:28.920]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:33.800]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:40.920]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:45.120]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:51.440]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:56.120]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[02:30:56.120 --> 02:31:02.680]  that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:06.560]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:10.320]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:14.240]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:18.640]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of

[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:00.840]  they'll find out at Atlanta premiere.com now gentlemen continuing here G. Evergryphon
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:04.560]  you got cut off by the break you were getting into how they're lying how they're
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:08.680]  trying to cover up and you find the very scientist owned papers and I'm showing a
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:16.280]  counsel on foreign relations paper that they put out three years ago where they
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.720]  just came right out admitted geoengineering workshop on unilateral
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.440]  planetary scale geoengineering and oh guess what they talk all these
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:31.280]  government heads talk about chemtrailing spraying the atmosphere with
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:36.240]  aluminum dioxide so G. Everg please continue yeah I think it bears repeating
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.280]  Alex because I've said that these people are lying and that's a very strong
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:45.320]  statement and because I wouldn't say that unless it was easy to prove they're
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:49.680]  lying at two levels first of all they say that the spraying activity is not
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.320]  going on they're just discussing it and well that's so we've got that nailed
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:59.560]  that that's for sure that's been going on for at least 10 years longer but now
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:02.960]  that to me more important than that is that they say well they don't know
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:07.260]  whether this stuff is going to be harmful to to health or not is what we
[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:10.520]  haven't looked into that yet but we certainly must do that we won't start
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:13.920]  this spraying you understand until we've checked that out and made sure that you
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:18.080]  know it's okay and now we find out that there are documents all over the place
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:21.760]  and you can even get them on the internet documents showing research studies
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.600]  put out by the military for one thing where they've checked into the toxic
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:30.080]  effects of these compounds and the conclusion of these reports is that
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.640]  they're highly toxic so you know that the scientists who are promoting this
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:39.120]  are aware of those tests so that means that they're lying to us now this is
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.520]  serious stuff and we we're talking about the survival of the human race and
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:46.800]  they're lying to us about it so I can't think of it if this doesn't make
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:50.000]  somebody mad I don't know what will they must already be drinking too much
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.640]  fluoride in that water well there's a major parallel to and I want both of you
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:01.440]  to speak to this mr. Murphy first the parallel is 20 years ago or 19 years
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:05.880]  got to be technical the army's own reports said depleted uranium is deadly
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:11.240]  we can't use it in regular combat because it will get increased cancers
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:17.080]  organ failure it's deadly then they went ahead and use it in 91 now they're
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:20.880]  using it at shooting ranges and proving grounds everywhere they're using it in
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:27.960]  wars in Serbia and in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Iraq and it's 15 times the
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:31.760]  birth defects and cancers in children in Iraq in the cities where it's used
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:35.200]  that's in British Medical Journal it's three to four times deformities and
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.360]  cancers and troops they know this and they just have made the decision we're
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:42.760]  going to use this and put it out everywhere and again it goes to not just
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.440]  Tuskegee but now oh we're sorry we shot up men women and children with syphilis
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:52.200]  by the thousands in Guatemala that came out late last week and this really goes
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:56.440]  to the point of they put out video games for kids like super mega worm where you
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:00.680]  go around as a worm ridding the earth of humans killing women with baby carriages
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:09.320]  in police they have Al Gore climate you know funded groups like 1010 out saying
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:12.240]  if you're not gonna do something about global warming we're gonna kill you and
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:15.600]  it shows them murdering children I don't know if you've seen that and you and
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:19.760]  they're now saying eco fascism is good in the Guardian we need tyranny you know
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.560]  we don't care if you don't want to pay us carbon money we're coming for you it's
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:27.520]  an excuse for mass murder and excuse for death and these people are spraying
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.800]  their own families with the with the aluminum they're using the du and it
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:35.640]  really they are just psychopathic people with a death wish who want to kill
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:37.880]  all humans when you really read what they have to say
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:42.160]  gee ever griffin I want to get your take on that and mr. Murphy well I'll start
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:45.760]  the ball rolling on that I'm sure you're right Alex there are a lot of
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.880]  psychopaths out there that really hate the human race and that they've been so
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:54.080]  indoctrinated I suppose that they feel that all of the problems the world
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.400]  especially the ecological problems are a result of that ugly species called
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:03.360]  homo sapiens and so they kind of think of themselves as being a godlike and not
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:07.280]  really hope was homo sapiens themselves they're sort of above it all and
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:10.080]  they're there yeah there are a few people that really want to see the
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:14.640]  elimination of the human race or greatly reduced in any rate but I think
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.320]  there are a lot more people fit into a different category which is that they
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:22.080]  they're part of this collectivist system and they're they're imbued with this
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:27.240]  desire to follow authority no matter what and they're part of the system and
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:30.600]  especially you find this in the military you just follow orders you don't
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:34.560]  question and they feel like they have power through the system through the
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.040]  system yes that they their power derives from the fact that they don't
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:42.560]  question and so I think there are a lot more people in that category they're
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:45.840]  given an order or they see that they're part of a movement they don't question
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:50.680]  it they just go along with it and maybe in the deep recesses of their minds they
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:54.200]  may think gee I wonder if this is good for humanity I wonder if it's good for
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:57.480]  me or my family but they don't think about that too much because they know
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:01.520]  that in the world which supports them doesn't allow that kind of thinking so
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:08.480]  I think it's that element more than this conscious desire to get rid of the
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:14.160]  human race Michael your take on that you know I definitely agree with that one
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:17.480]  thing you know we're reaching out to the people who are flying these planes
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:22.000]  are in who are involved with these programs I believe that a lot of these
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.560]  people do not know exactly what they're doing so we're hoping to awaken some of
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.480]  those people it's really question things you know with that being said you know
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.560]  if you look at the Rockefeller's the Rothschild and their eugenics policies
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:40.960]  you know there clearly is an agenda to reduce the other earth population I
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.240]  forgot to say Bill Gates who is a heavy funder in the geoengineering program
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:51.040]  oh he's huge he's got a bunch of patents for hurricane machines Kim trailing I
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:57.000]  mean he's there absolutely and I you know he's funding David Keith and Kim
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.560]  caldera and and we know you know what what what is behind this man so I think
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:07.880]  at the highest levels yes there are plans to definitely hurt and make people
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.840]  sick and to lower the population however I think that again a lot of people
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:16.400]  involved with these programs are really not aware of how damaging and how much
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:20.880]  damage they're doing you know we if we're hoping to reach out to the pilot so
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.920]  they might know that what they're doing is hurting their children could be
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:29.280]  hurting their parents you know so so that's really something that we're
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.360]  trying to do is we have to reach out to everybody well I just hope that
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:38.240]  everybody out there who's been laughed at for talking about persistent jet
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:42.880]  aerosol known by layman as chemtrail and and all of you that are concerned
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:47.520]  about this will understand this is a professionally well balanced focused
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:54.080]  documented film what in the world are they spraying and it is the best film
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.000]  I've seen out there of many because so much of this is now coming out in the
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.800]  open and it's also great filmmakers and G ever griffin behind it people need to
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:06.720]  get this film you need to show it to everyone you know guys I'll put you on
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:11.120]  the spot here you know all of my films I want people to air them on access TV to
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:15.840]  make copies of them I know you got a lot of producers and filmmakers involved in
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:20.080]  this you have to get there okay for it but I I mean obviously if you tell the
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.360]  grassroots air this on access TV make copies give it to people obviously for
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:27.480]  nonprofit not for sale purposes or you could lose control of your of your work
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:32.400]  but I mean you have any plan on that to really try to get people to have this
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  film go viral yes Alex I'll address that one that was our plan from the very
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:41.480]  beginning is to is to put this up on the internet and they have people make
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:46.400]  copies of it and you know our only hope is that we can cover the production
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:52.440]  expenses then make enough return to make it worthwhile for the filmmakers Paul
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:55.640]  and Michael you know they're spending a lot have spent a tremendous amount of
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:42:00.320]  time on this project once that's done when we expect that will probably be
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.960]  within a few weeks after release and we get the first whatever it is 10 20 30
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:12.040]  thousand copies out there then that's when we put it up on the internet and we
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:16.600]  do want to make this viral we do we want people to make copies and we're we
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:21.880]  have a series called project red pill which is a little a DVD that we produce
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:26.160]  over at the reality zone that's our that's our little company and project
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:33.480]  red pill is a DVD which has anywhere from five to six full-length
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.120]  documentaries it's not high resolution it's the same resolution as you would
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:44.760]  find on the internet but those are sold for under a dollar each and we ask
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:49.440]  people to buy those and then make copies of those and in other words we want
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:54.600]  tens of millions of copies of this thing to be put into circulation it's the
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:59.320]  only way we can make an end run around the controlled media absolutely and
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:02.760]  that's been the secret to our success you know people didn't believe me that
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:06.760]  they'd signed you in agreements to hand over our national parks and areas to you
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:10.000]  in control so I went out and interviewed people showed the documents went there
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:16.920]  and you know and and really we were some of the first in in the in 96 97 to
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:21.240]  really pioneer what so many others are now doing and that's great because they
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:24.960]  can't just killing Alex Jones or a G. Edward Griffin or set us up or put us in
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:29.600]  prison because there's so many other people coming online so many thousands
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:36.400]  of filmmakers and authors it is a powerful powerful powerful thing let's
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:43.400]  take some phone calls let me see who is up first here Michael in Florida you're
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:47.760]  on the air with G. Edward Griffin and the other filmmaker Michael J. Murphy
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:53.360]  welcome how you guys doing tonight good Michael good hey I got a question and
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:57.960]  forgive my ignorance on the way that our our house our whole atmosphere works but
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:01.800]  um I just I just shot a very quick bit of a chemtrail over my house in central
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:06.200]  Florida and it was very obvious that at the tree top level the winds were
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:09.800]  blowing at about 20 miles an hour 30 miles an hour to there really swaying
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:14.000]  good and then there's about three or four thousand feet the clouds were moving
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.920]  you could visually see all the clouds moving in the sky yet the the chemtrail
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:24.080]  that was above us was maybe 500 maybe a thousand feet above the clouds but it
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:27.960]  wasn't moving at all well there's different weather you know strata
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.480]  there's different you know prevailing winds jet streams and jet streams are
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.040]  pretty easy to forecast one of the big jet streams coming out of China and
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:43.800]  across the western United States dumps between New Mexico Texas and Louisiana so
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:47.800]  so much the toxic waste from China ends up dumping in here and that could be some
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:53.080]  of the aluminum and toxins we're already seeing but I mean specifically you know
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:57.120]  you're asking why why was the chemtrail moving at a different rate you can see
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:59.880]  weather systems where clouds are going this way and other clouds are going that
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:04.720]  way that's normally a you know natural function you want to comment on that
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:08.840]  Jebra Griffin or mr. Murphy well yeah I just to confirm that there are wind
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.360]  currents at different elevations and they often go in different directions it's
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:20.640]  kind of like looking at that a big bowl of water if you've dumped some some
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:25.320]  oil into the water you could see the currents of the water they stir it up
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:29.520]  you can find you know some at some levels that the dye moves in one direction
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.400]  and in other levels it may move in another direction for a while and then
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:37.880]  before he gets all mixed up so it's the normal phenomena and that's why the
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:41.440]  Pentagon's declassified in the 60s they were able to direct major weather
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:46.280]  systems and dump jet streams with water directly into flood people and that's
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:49.400]  one of the most declassified areas that we've interviewed of course been
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:53.160]  Lennox and the father of weather weapons that's going to be in our film let's go
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:56.720]  ahead and talk ma'am one more comment Alex on that thing I think it's
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:02.680]  important to know that in in Hawaii for example the people there although they
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:08.680]  were being completely sprayed very seldom did they see the planes because the
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:14.540]  planes apparently were flying off the edge of offshore and letting the chem
[02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:19.640]  trails ride in with the wind currents yes so if they they know about that and
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:23.840]  that's another they know where to spray to target something sometimes 5,000
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:28.480]  miles away people say planes aren't spraying you at 20,000 feet mr. Jones to
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:32.760]  hit you on the ground it's going somewhere else exactly that's right it
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:37.000]  was also interesting because it is kind of covert because you don't see the
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.960]  planes but when we were there we also spoke publicly about the issue in earth
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:48.080]  people to do rain test and of course they did we didn't we're unable to get it
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:52.240]  into the film however these rain paths again revealed very high amounts of
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:56.800]  aluminum barium and strontium just what we suspected so they absolutely let's
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:02.120]  talk to Woody in Seattle what are you're on the air hi Alex thank you for
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:08.040]  taking my call I've been taking a lot of time and effort in researching chem
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.560]  trails over the last two years I've been retired I'm retired 25-year law
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:16.680]  enforcement I put extensively across the United States and I've seen it
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.920]  virtually in every major city in every medium-sized city that I've traveled
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:26.280]  through and some of my research indicates that initially this goes all the way
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:32.960]  back to the 19th when they discovered that the ozone shield was basically
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:39.080]  disappearing and that the scientists basically devised this program initially
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:42.960]  to combat the deterioration no I've seen that I've seen that from the 70s in
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:46.440]  our documents that's exactly the research that's one I believe that's a
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:50.040]  cover story because they what four years ago they had a government issue
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:55.280]  textbook for sixth graders that said oh we're spraying you like a sunscreen to
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.680]  save the earth Jebra Griffin comments well I agree with that and they always
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:03.220]  come up with some explanation for why they're doing it I mean they're gonna
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:07.000]  repair the ozone hole and all that well that was the truth why they keep it
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:12.800]  secret then right yeah right on I'm gonna skip this break just keep you guys
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:15.680]  to the end of the hour we don't skip breaks a lot but this is just too
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:20.640]  important what we're doing today well Woody anything else so I just want I
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:25.600]  just wanted to tell you that also if they can go back and research the
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.680]  Montreal Protocols they'll also discover that the pesticides that we've been
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:38.080]  using all over the United States on our crops also contributed majorly to your
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.640]  phone cut out I'm gonna let you go somebody called you on a fax machine
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:48.200]  they will ban pesticides that are not very toxic and bad for humans and lie
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:52.840]  about DDT that did not make the the eggs thin that's admitted now in other
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:58.400]  hoax but then they'll allow incredibly deadly pesticides and herbicides to be
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:04.880]  used you guys want to comment on that oh we didn't lose the caller we lost one
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:13.840]  of the one of the guests okay well us okay okay and we have G Edward or yeah
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.760]  I'm back on my phone just went dead a moment ago okay that I think that was
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:23.400]  our phone system then went dead because we lost everybody the caller was talking
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:28.880]  about how they'll ban pesticides like DDT and lie about them but then they'll
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:35.720]  authorize really deadly pesticides to be used well sure in another words we're
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:39.560]  talking about hidden agendas here how many how much evidence do we need you
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:43.760]  know this is back to my my heart statement about they're lying about this
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:48.320]  it's hard for people to believe that the authorities and they've trusted all
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.760]  these years will actually lie to them about such an important issue but there
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:59.360]  it is folks you cannot deny it anymore well it goes back to just this I mean
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:03.440]  literally in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement and a special
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:06.520]  ends this week folks to buy one copy and get three free and give it to folks you
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:10.080]  know three-hour film I mean there were thousands of where they radiate
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  children to death and kill troops with nerve gas our own troops this is nothing
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:16.760]  it's horrible but it's nothing compared to the other stuff they've done you know
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:21.080]  injecting Guatemalan children with syphilis that's who these people are of
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:25.800]  course they're doing all this stuff with the chemtrails they're playing God yep
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:32.200]  that's it they absolutely are well it's amazing I'm gonna skin skip this final
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.360]  break it's a network break so station should carry it appreciate everybody
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:41.080]  let's try to get Mark Wesley Sue and Lex on quick questions or comments Mark and
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:46.800]  Florida you're on the air hi Alex I've been working outside for the past 12
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:52.240]  years with the the lawn maintenance in Florida West Central Florida and I can
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:51:02.480]  speak through firsthand experience that literally it takes the grass growing
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:06.320]  time has cut in half like the grass is not growing it doesn't matter if it
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:12.200]  rains all week um I've heard people talk about how you get joint pains when
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:17.800]  they're in the sky and it's all true no no farmers all over are saying they've
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:21.320]  never seen vegetable gardens not grow it's happening to our family with
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.320]  property in East Texas guys you cover some of that in the film don't you well
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:31.000]  we absolutely do and we spent some time with Francis Mangles and Dane Wiggins and
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:36.160]  Francis of course is a retired biologist and he's saying just that he also does
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:41.680]  gardens for people and in gardens are struggling you know in that area in as
[02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:46.280]  well around the country and around the world also Dane made that statement
[02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:50.800]  is similar to the gentleman about the grass the grass is not growing it's
[02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:56.160]  about half of the height of what it once was all over northern California trees
[02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.640]  are just dying everywhere literally everywhere in Debra Whitman of
[02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:05.040]  environmental voices has been begun testing the trees that are dying there
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:09.920]  is this white residue on the bark and of course he's been finding very high
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:13.600]  amounts of again and the bats are dying and they're finding aluminum and the
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:19.000]  bees are dying I mean this is this is sick and meanwhile the UN and Bill
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:24.400]  Melinda Gates have over 45 bunkers many of them hidden north pole other places
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:30.720]  bunkers hidden with armed guards guarding giant seed vaults I tell you G. Edward
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:34.200]  Griffin this looks like a moon raker scenario to me yeah it's really weird
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:39.240]  and that seed vault issue has often caused me to puzzle why do you suppose
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:43.160]  they're doing that are they really trying to to guard the seeds to the
[02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:46.600]  expect that's what they're doing may just wipe everything out and then I start
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.120]  over again or is it are they guarding them to make sure that nobody else
[02:52:50.120 --> 02:52:55.120]  guarded them I don't know it's you know your your mind can run wild with things
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:58.160]  like this there's so many unanswered questions no I mean after they wreck
[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:02.600]  everything that stuff's going to be the most valuable thing on the planet yes
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:05.800]  but they're gonna sit on top of it make sure that you and I don't get hold of
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:10.000]  it and they've got mega companies doing whatever they can sometimes paying a
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.920]  hundred times over the PE ratio for small heirloom seed companies yes okay
[02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:20.760]  there's our next business venture everybody let's go form an heirloom seed
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:23.600]  company there you go we've got some great sponsors doing that mark great
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:30.200]  points let's talk to Wesley in Oklahoma hey thank you hey can you hear me
[02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:34.880]  yes I can all right thank you I just wanted to talk about you know mr. Griffin
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:38.680]  said you know how they ride along with the current and last Thursday I was at
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:42.880]  school here in Tulsa, Oklahoma and I went in at 930 and I saw it up in the
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:47.760]  clouds that you know there was an ex exes of trails and when I got out of three
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:51.360]  I'd noticed those trails had moved along with the wind except they didn't move
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:57.760]  like clouds and then so you know that goes into you know to the point of how
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:01.600]  you know it's the whole drift thing but hey hey about two years ago the major
[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:06.560]  meteorology Association Noah came out and said there's now not three kinds of
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:11.160]  clouds a new cloud in the last decade has appeared so there's now new clouds and
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:16.040]  you look at the classification it's a chem trail yeah and not so you know I'm
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:20.160]  I'd text you know and deep I try getting people that look you know look up and
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:24.840]  say yo that's not a cloud and uh and I agree with mr. Murphy you know you you
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:27.600]  can only be lied to for so long before you got to start reaching out to other
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:32.520]  people and uh you know with mr. Griffin uh he's talking about you know that the
[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:36.440]  godlike people that you know we get rid of the human human race I have found an
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:44.360]  article Friday night if you google it is you can you can type in we can all
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:51.120]  change one two three with no spaces in it and that article should be a helpful
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:54.720]  article yeah we have BBC articles where it says elite believe we will split into
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:59.560]  two species it goes back to HD Wells who's a big globalist and yes they're
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:04.040]  on complete male maniacal power trips we're almost out of time quickly Sue in
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:08.800]  Pennsylvania you're on the air yeah hi Alex mr. Griffin for taking my call I
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:12.680]  I'm just really interested in this and considering with all the fluoride that
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:16.080]  we've been doused with I've read a lot about it and I've read that the fluoride
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:20.280]  ion has an affinity to bonding with aluminum that better their spring up
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:26.000]  yes dr. Blaylock has the two excite each other and and have a magnifying
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  effect right right and due to all the neurological diseases that have been
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.600]  increasing with the brain plaques like MS and you know all the other diseases I'm
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:41.360]  just saying is this a possible that they're using these different avenues in
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:45.680]  collaboration with each other for their you know original intent which is you
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:51.760]  know trying to kill us well it's certainly possible and some of us might
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:57.240]  even think it's probable but you can't go much further than that I would love to
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:04.040]  see a study to hill if these neurological diseases are at a higher rate in
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.960]  areas that are heavily fluoridated in the water supply we actually have those
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:13.040]  studies you do yeah in Canada and the US and China the IQ is upwards of 20
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.800]  points lower and there's massive increases in neurological disorders we're
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:20.440]  out of time sue by the way I was wrong there were four types of clouds they
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:23.840]  discovered a fifth type and when you look at the news articles it's chemtrails
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:28.240]  they're showing oh look there's a new cloud type and it's chemtrails I mean
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:32.480]  watch old movies from the 60s 70s and 80s you are commercials you never see
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.200]  chemtrails now in the TV ads it's chemtrails you can't go out and shoot
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:41.400]  most the time without these being there folks get the film get it out to
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:45.640]  everyone support filmmakers like G. Edward Griffin and Mr. Murphy support us
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:49.000]  who are selling it and you know premiering it shipping it out to folks
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.400]  please get what in the world are they spring at info wars.com show it to
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:58.800]  everyone you know gentlemen good luck with your screening I'm sure it'll sell
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:03.440]  out and with a huge crowd out there in Atlanta on the 23rd of this month God
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.320]  bless you. Thanks a lot Alex. God bless you. Amazing God bless you sorry we don't
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:11.360]  have time to get to the other callers I've got a few final items I wanted to
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:16.120]  hit we're doing a search term today hopefully it'll be number one to send
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:22.640]  people to the huge new 9-11 information that has come out in fact I'm looking for
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:27.480]  Paul Joseph Watson's headline there but it deals with these new firefighter
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:36.320]  videos that got released it is it is so important and the new search term is for
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.600]  folks that don't remember it so to lead them to the article video 9-11
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:45.080]  firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers collapse prisonplanet.com
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:51.920]  the search term is huge explosions huge explosions and it's we searched it in the
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:55.280]  first hour second hour keep searching it let's keep it on top and I want to
