[00:00.000 --> 00:05.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's unprecedented.
[00:05.240 --> 00:11.760]  I have scores of clips of mainstream media calling for info wars to be taken off the
[00:11.760 --> 00:12.760]  air.
[00:12.760 --> 00:17.680]  We have Nancy Pelosi's venomous daughter leading the attempt to overturn the election with
[00:17.680 --> 00:22.920]  the electors saying that I caused her to get death threats, so I need to be shut down.
[00:22.920 --> 00:28.200]  This is last night on Cavuto after I was told by sources that they're coming after
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.200]  me via Pelosi.
[00:29.200 --> 00:33.040]  Meanwhile, electors are being harassed to not vote for Trump, the opposite of what they
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.040]  claim.
[00:34.040 --> 00:41.600]  But here's John Bowne's report.
[00:41.600 --> 00:47.200]  Barely two months after the United Nations nominated Wonder Woman as an ambassador for
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.880]  women and girls, the UN announced that they would be ending Wonder Woman's ambassadorship.
[00:52.880 --> 00:57.640]  In October, the United Nations said it was about women and girls everywhere who are
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.520]  Wonder Women in their own right and the men and boys who support their struggle for gender
[01:03.520 --> 01:05.080]  equality.
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.120]  But the announcement was met with protests and a petition complaining that the fictional
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.320]  superhero was an inappropriate choice to represent female empowerment.
[01:15.320 --> 01:22.280]  A large breasted white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in shimmery thigh-bearing
[01:22.280 --> 01:29.200]  bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots, is not an appropriate spokeswoman for
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.720]  gender equity at the United Nations, the petition said.
[01:33.720 --> 01:41.520]  Of course, the petition missed the point, leaning on racism and sexism to express their disapproval
[01:41.520 --> 01:48.680]  of Wonder Woman, a daughter of Zeus, an Amazonian princess of Mediterranean origin, seeker of
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.480]  truth and justice, armed with her lasso-of-truth and bulletproof bracelets, representing the
[01:54.480 --> 02:00.240]  best qualities in all women and girls, no different than Superman and his identical
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.920]  role model status to men and boys.
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.680]  But unfortunately, there is a darker side to Wonder Woman, that the petition failed to
[02:08.680 --> 02:09.680]  point out.
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.360]  American psychologist William Moulton Marston created Wonder Woman.
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.400]  He based Wonder Woman on the personalities of the women he was in a polyamorous relationship
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.400]  with.
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.880]  Marston drew from the nature of his wife, Sadie, and Marston's live-in mistress, Olive
[02:27.880 --> 02:33.320]  Byrne, who just so happened to be the daughter of Ethel Byrne, who opened the first birth
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.840]  control clinic in the United States with her older sister, Margaret Sanger.
[02:38.840 --> 02:44.840]  But better representative to push the UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, achieve gender
[02:44.840 --> 02:51.600]  equality in the empowerment of all women and girls than a superhero based on Olive Byrne,
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.680]  representing the beginning of the eugenics movement in the United States while simultaneously
[02:56.680 --> 03:00.540]  promoting polyamory, which isn't bad in itself.
[03:00.540 --> 03:05.640]  People are free to live their lives as they choose, but on a widespread scale, Marston's
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.600]  extramarital arrangement thumbs its nose at the family unit.
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.200]  If the United Nations had missed the connection that Marston's feminist superhero represented,
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.920]  the UN certainly supports Marston's intentions as the UN spearheads Margaret Sanger's campaign
[03:22.920 --> 03:24.080]  of eugenics.
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.080]  Back in 2012, the United Nations declared that birth control was a human right.
[03:29.080 --> 03:35.920]  That same year, CNS News reported in 2012 there were more black babies killed by abortion,
[03:35.920 --> 03:42.920]  31,328 in New York City, than were born there, 24,758.
[03:42.920 --> 03:49.160]  And the black children killed comprised 42.4% of the total number of abortions in the Big
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.840]  Apple, according to a report by New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.200]  The Washington Times reported, Sanger shaped the eugenics movement in America and beyond
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.760]  in the 1930s and 1940s.
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.840]  Her views and those of her peers in the movement contributed to compulsory sterilization laws
[04:08.840 --> 04:16.240]  in 30 U.S. states that resulted in more than 60,000 sterilizations of vulnerable people,
[04:16.240 --> 04:22.640]  including people she considered, quote, feeble-minded idiots and morons, end quote.
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.320]  She even presented at a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1926 in Silver Lake, New Jersey.
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.680]  Sanger wrote, we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,
[04:34.680 --> 04:39.560]  and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of
[04:39.560 --> 04:42.200]  their more rebellious members.
[04:42.200 --> 04:47.760]  The United Nations shouldn't hide behind superheroes to promote their 17 sustainable
[04:47.760 --> 04:50.040]  goals of world domination.
[04:50.040 --> 04:55.520]  We know who their real heroes are, John Bowne for Enforce.com.
[04:55.520 --> 04:59.920]  Excellent report by John Bowne, take a pop story, turn it towards real news.
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.600]  To listen to the mainstream media, you would think that we're engaged in covert ops in
[05:04.600 --> 05:06.400]  the 50s at the height of the Cold War.
[05:06.400 --> 05:10.520]  There's an article up, it's on our website, it aggregated from zero hedge, and it talks
[05:10.520 --> 05:15.280]  about how NBC is reporting the, quote, new intelligence shows that Putin personally
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.040]  directed how hacked material from the Democrats was leaked and otherwise used.
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.440]  Now, they cite this intelligence coming from, quote, diplomatic sources and spies working
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.440]  for U.S. allies.
[05:24.440 --> 05:29.640]  They go on to say that Putin and the hack that was perpetuated against the DNC involved
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.600]  Americans believing that their lives under Obama and by extension Hillary were bad enough
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.000]  and they needed to change, so hence Russia was then involved.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.600]  This ridiculous insinuation is also vastly circulated by the New York Times, which talks
[05:42.600 --> 05:48.160]  about how the FBI and the CIA are confirming that Vladimir Putin became personally involved
[05:48.160 --> 05:51.680]  in a covert Russian campaign to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.
[05:51.680 --> 05:56.040]  I cannot make this up, these ridiculous claims are believed by the people reporting them
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.040]  in the mainstream media.
[05:57.040 --> 05:59.040]  I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:59.040 --> 06:04.040]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of Korea.
[06:04.040 --> 06:09.040]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[06:09.040 --> 06:13.160]  Let me just read a little thing here from agenda 21, the American system of justice
[06:13.160 --> 06:16.440]  must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[06:16.440 --> 06:39.920]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, and
[06:39.920 --> 06:46.920]  beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand,
[06:46.920 --> 06:52.640]  DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin,
[06:52.640 --> 06:58.920]  want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue, revelation, the movie.info, let's
[06:58.920 --> 06:59.920]  fix it.
[06:59.920 --> 07:03.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.680]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[07:06.680 --> 07:12.720]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[07:12.720 --> 07:17.680]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[07:17.680 --> 07:22.640]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.760]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[07:27.760 --> 07:29.480]  you can to purify your air.
[07:29.480 --> 07:34.480]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.680]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.640]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.240]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[07:47.240 --> 07:50.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[07:50.800 --> 07:54.000]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[07:54.000 --> 08:05.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then fullwarstore.com.
[08:05.520 --> 08:20.400]  We're only 35 days out from the historic election of the 45th President of the United States
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.280]  bearing fruit and him actually taking office, but he's still only president-elect.
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.560]  It is Thursday, December 15, 2016.
[08:29.560 --> 08:35.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.520]  Thank you for joining us.
[08:36.520 --> 08:41.000]  This is the battle for the Republic.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.520]  There is a compilation of enemy media the last week and a half attacking me, globalist
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.960]  occupation government media, and just like NPR and other channels, they are afraid.
[08:51.960 --> 08:55.560]  They're saying he's convincing, he's dangerous.
[08:55.560 --> 08:57.880]  Shut him down.
[08:57.880 --> 09:00.960]  We have a First Amendment, but not for this.
[09:00.960 --> 09:03.960]  Get him off the air.
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.080]  CNN, MSNBC, CNN.
[09:09.080 --> 09:13.000]  This doesn't even have the NPR clips where they're like, he's convincing, he's dangerous.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.400]  When I read WikiLeaks where you call us dumb and how you want us to be poor and in the
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.520]  dark and alone, it's like a panic is that we want them desperate, in the dark alone
[09:24.520 --> 09:25.520]  and poor.
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.280]  I know you agree, Mr. Podesta, move forward operations.
[09:31.280 --> 09:36.680]  We must please, we must please George Soros and break the will of the American people.
[09:36.680 --> 09:42.040]  We need to bring these WikiLeaks back and just do more reports on them and just keep
[09:42.040 --> 09:43.520]  hitting them with it.
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.560]  But I got to tell you, yesterday Larry Nichols was coming back on today.
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.280]  He said, listen, I got a call and I know for a fact he knows Senator Sessions and I know
[09:53.280 --> 09:56.520]  for a fact he is one of the big leakers to the inquirer and others because I've had the
[09:56.520 --> 09:59.080]  head of the inquirer on, so that's what he says.
[09:59.080 --> 10:03.600]  I've been interviewing Larry for 21 years, former Clinton Insider, and he said, listen,
[10:03.600 --> 10:07.320]  I don't know what you've done, but I got off the phone this morning, he was already scheduled
[10:07.320 --> 10:09.360]  the day before to come on the show.
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.560]  He said, I got off the phone this morning with one of the deputies of Senator Sessions,
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.600]  about to be the Attorney General, and they're trying to figure out how to stop the Democrats
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.000]  from doing a plan they've got to come out before Obama leaves office and to have hearings
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  in some federal suit with Info Wars as a test case, which by the way, this is going to raise
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.360]  us to a Valhalla level, I mean, but it's meant to hurt the rest of the free press.
[10:36.360 --> 10:41.200]  Info Wars can't lose, this is just total destiny, having the enemy try to shut us up.
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.720]  So people ask why I'm so excited, this is fabulous news, you understand history, because
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.840]  escape is not my plan.
[10:47.840 --> 10:52.960]  I will face them alone, that's what this comes down to, but we're sitting here looking at
[10:52.960 --> 10:59.720]  this unfold, they are desperate, and I've always talked about this magic moment.
[10:59.720 --> 11:04.040]  When the mainstream media collapses, the dinosaur government collapses, the globalist program
[11:04.040 --> 11:09.280]  collapses because we're promoting Americana, prosperity, freedom, sovereignty, the family,
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.440]  everything normal, natural, that are epigenetics, our culture, our history has ingrained in
[11:14.440 --> 11:15.440]  us.
[11:15.440 --> 11:21.080]  But they could take our parents away at birth, lock us up like zombies, people would still
[11:21.080 --> 11:27.920]  cry out with a hunger for freedom, it's in the DNA of humans all over the world, but
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.680]  more so than others, it varies in every culture.
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.120]  And so they're not putting the genie back in the proverbial bottle.
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.760]  But the fact that they're hitting the absolute panic button with, the Russians ate my homework,
[11:42.760 --> 11:48.440]  the Russians stole the election, the Russians are behind everything, because calling us racist
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.960]  and homophobes doesn't work anymore.
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.000]  It's weird how a lot of the right wing Christians who are good people, and I understand their
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.520]  issues and their problems with the whole leftist promotion of homosexuality, I get it's an
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.360]  agenda, I don't hate people individually, but you saw the media lie about Trump that
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.440]  he was anti-gay, so you went and supported him when he never, never, never said that.
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.080]  So now they're kind of freaking out going, whoa, again, this is all part of the deception
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.440]  of the mainstream media.
[12:16.440 --> 12:21.200]  They lied about the polls, they lied about everything, they got caught lying.
[12:21.200 --> 12:23.640]  They're in free fall.
[12:23.640 --> 12:28.440]  And so we always do, they hit this moment where government is desperate, backs against
[12:28.440 --> 12:34.480]  the wall, the corrupt elements, when the leftists are desperate, all over the world, from Spain
[12:34.480 --> 12:46.600]  to Italy, to the UK, to Iceland, to the United States, to Brazil, the system is panicking.
[12:46.600 --> 12:49.280]  The system is melting down.
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.320]  And so they're desperate, and out of their desperation, out of their hysteria, like a
[12:54.320 --> 13:00.880]  drowning man, they are going to make even more mistakes and destroy themselves completely.
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.320]  When they come out and say on every channel, we must shut down Alex Jones, the bottom of
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.840]  the next hour, as I have guests coming up, I'm going to air a 18 minute special report,
[13:10.840 --> 13:17.000]  a compilation of just the latest attacks, and they end with, we believe in the First
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.280]  Amendment, but Alex Jones has to be shut down.
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.520]  And then you add, Nicholson, I got this call, and they intend to, whether Trump gets in
[13:26.520 --> 13:31.960]  or not, they intend to shut you down by name as the case point, and Nancy Pelosi is in
[13:31.960 --> 13:38.280]  total hysteria, and she's basically a gangster, demanding that you be shut down.
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.800]  And let me tell you, folks, that woman went into office worth half a million dollars,
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.840]  it's worth 400 and something mill, and her husband is a major kingpin.
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.280]  So anything happens to me, look at Pelosi.
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.680]  The reason I say that is, when these people have to get themselves puffed up and in a
[13:53.680 --> 14:02.200]  rage to pull triggers, and sign checks, and execute things that are absolutely evil,
[14:02.200 --> 14:07.920]  like Pelosi's doing right now, which is just wonderful, lady, I'm on the field in the arena
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.480]  to face you, strike me down, I'll become a thousand more times powerful than you can
[14:13.480 --> 14:14.480]  possibly imagine.
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.200]  And yes, that's a cheesy Star Wars analogy, but that's how history works.
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.920]  It's an allegory.
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.480]  It rings true because it is true.
[14:23.480 --> 14:28.080]  Nichols says that on the show, and all fair was just like, man, you bet I've never seen
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.240]  anything like this, sessions is completely worried about you behind the scenes because
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.480]  they understand it'll domino the entire free press, they are dug in, I've got that for
[14:36.480 --> 14:37.480]  my other sources.
[14:37.480 --> 14:42.480]  I knew they were going to choose for, you know, press secretary three days ago before
[14:42.480 --> 14:44.800]  anybody did, but of course I didn't say it.
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.840]  I knew it was going to be Rex Tillerson, wait before his name was even out there, and I'm
[14:48.840 --> 14:49.840]  not bragging.
[14:49.840 --> 14:52.200]  I'm just, I can be trusted, I have the sources.
[14:52.200 --> 15:01.560]  We have a CIA source, we'll just leave it at that, joining us live on air at 33 after.
[15:01.560 --> 15:08.320]  Now, this same source and two others told me last week that this is absolute pure bull
[15:08.320 --> 15:15.040]  that none of the CIA's involved, that it's a rogue former group of leftists who have
[15:15.040 --> 15:18.200]  briefed the president with no proof.
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.760]  And then the head of all the agencies came out and others came out and testified in Congress
[15:22.760 --> 15:31.280]  on Monday and said from Clapper to you name it, there is no intelligence that Russia hacked
[15:31.280 --> 15:33.520]  or did anything physical.
[15:33.520 --> 15:39.760]  It's not true, but mainstream media and Keith Overman keeps saying 17 agencies say it, so
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.640]  they've now had judges come out, former British ambassadors who met with the U.S. leakers
[15:44.640 --> 15:48.160]  that are U.S. intelligence officers.
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.880]  So I told you on Friday, Saturday and Sunday that special reports on Saturday with the
[15:52.880 --> 16:00.640]  headlines, it's a hoax, there is no CIA, it's a former CIA splinter group making up intelligence
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.000]  just like WMD's.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.400]  So think about that.
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.600]  And now, as usual, what I told you is what really happened and it's all coming out.
[16:13.600 --> 16:15.760]  Now, why do they hate me so much?
[16:15.760 --> 16:22.800]  They know I can talk to the president, boy, if they only knew, they are freaking out.
[16:22.800 --> 16:26.360]  They know the intelligence agencies aren't full of criminals on average and they're sick
[16:26.360 --> 16:27.360]  of the New World Order.
[16:27.360 --> 16:29.200]  They know the troops and the veterans are awake.
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.720]  They know the police, with the whole Soros kill the cops movement, finally converted
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.560]  back to the Republic.
[16:37.560 --> 16:41.320]  They might set off a nuke or something to bring in martial law in the next 35 days.
[16:41.320 --> 16:43.320]  There's only 35 days left.
[16:43.320 --> 16:44.800]  I mean, they'll do anything.
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.600]  America is in a counter-coup against an illegal, globalist takeover.
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.200]  The general public may not understand what I'm talking about when I talk about Operation
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.040]  Valkyrie or Reverse Valkyrie or when I talk about COG or I talk about the National Security
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.280]  Council or I talk about Space Command or I talk about any of these agencies.
[17:03.280 --> 17:04.880]  But the people in them do.
[17:04.880 --> 17:09.000]  So, see, they know, I know what I'm talking about.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  Whether it's General Flynn or a lot of other generals, you think you'll just remove Flynn
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.120]  and your problems will be over?
[17:15.120 --> 17:16.280]  It's like shark teeth.
[17:16.280 --> 17:18.280]  More rows roll forward.
[17:18.280 --> 17:21.800]  Did you get rid of me?
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.160]  Transmission's already been sent.
[17:23.160 --> 17:24.160]  They kill me tomorrow.
[17:24.160 --> 17:25.400]  They shut me up.
[17:25.400 --> 17:27.680]  Everything I've talked about is evergreen.
[17:27.680 --> 17:29.840]  In Hollywood, they call the best films evergreen.
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.920]  They just get better with time.
[17:31.920 --> 17:33.840]  They just get more archetypal with time.
[17:33.840 --> 17:36.520]  They just get stronger with time like fine wine.
[17:36.520 --> 17:37.520]  They kill me, folks.
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.280]  You have to understand, I'm committed to defeating them.
[17:40.280 --> 17:41.280]  I don't want to die.
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.280]  I love life.
[17:42.280 --> 17:46.800]  But I do not care because my children have no future if we don't beat them.
[17:46.800 --> 17:49.280]  So if that's in God's plan, so be it.
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.600]  That's why they hate me.
[17:50.600 --> 17:58.080]  I have transcended them and their narcissistic, materialistic, worldly-based failure.
[17:58.080 --> 18:00.720]  They cannot beat the genuineness.
[18:00.720 --> 18:06.400]  They cannot beat the realness of it that telegraphs and cuts right through like a particle beam
[18:06.400 --> 18:07.400]  laser.
[18:07.400 --> 18:10.280]  They can't deal with it.
[18:10.280 --> 18:13.480]  They can't deal with will, with goodness, with honor.
[18:13.480 --> 18:16.960]  And I'm nothing compared to our forebears, but I am a throwback and I'm bringing that
[18:16.960 --> 18:20.920]  light back into the world just like you are when you stand up and you say no.
[18:20.920 --> 18:25.480]  There are men and women who you're going to see in the decades to come in this epic fight
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.640]  against AI, the globalists, and the things that are coming that will dwarf anything I've
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.280]  done times a hundred.
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.880]  The dynamic human spirit is rising.
[18:36.880 --> 18:39.480]  Humanity is coming back up from the bottom.
[18:39.480 --> 18:46.920]  You can feel the tectonic liberty rising and the enemy can feel it and see it and is
[18:46.920 --> 18:51.480]  howling in pain.
[18:51.480 --> 18:52.480]  I don't wish them any pain.
[18:52.480 --> 18:58.960]  I wish them to leave our space because they will never coexist with us.
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.160]  The evil ones are psychic and cultural vampires.
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.680]  They will never give us quarter.
[19:03.680 --> 19:05.320]  They will never stop attacking us.
[19:05.320 --> 19:06.480]  It is their nature.
[19:06.480 --> 19:07.480]  It is who they are.
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.600]  It is their past history.
[19:09.600 --> 19:16.760]  They are at loggerheads with us of old.
[19:16.760 --> 19:17.760]  Choose which side you're on.
[19:17.760 --> 19:18.760]  Now is the time.
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.760]  I've chosen.
[19:19.760 --> 19:23.320]  My spirit has never been stronger.
[19:23.320 --> 19:30.120]  Committing to going the whole way, never wavering, never faltering, never stopping.
[19:30.120 --> 19:31.640]  You may physically waver.
[19:31.640 --> 19:38.720]  Your body may waver but your spirit must never waver and it just gets better from that point.
[19:38.720 --> 19:45.840]  Now let's break down their attack plan before this special guest joins us of how they're
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.920]  planning to shut down free speech in the next few months and how they're preparing clearly
[19:50.920 --> 19:55.200]  false flagged terror attacks to be blamed on the independent media.
[19:55.200 --> 19:56.200]  I'm Alec Jones.
[19:56.200 --> 20:00.480]  This is the NFO War.
[20:00.480 --> 20:06.560]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.560]  Forget bunkers.
[20:07.560 --> 20:09.600]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[20:09.600 --> 20:14.440]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival bug
[20:14.440 --> 20:19.080]  outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.

[20:37.200 --> 20:42.360]  Unique design distributes weight, feeling lighter, increases mobility and lessens fatigue.
[20:42.360 --> 20:48.520]  Introducing the combat quad bend, CQB, a revolutionary plate forming process that caters to the end
[20:48.520 --> 20:49.520]  user.
[20:49.520 --> 20:53.200]  The CQB is an industry game changer, a must have for the ladies.

[21:00.080 --> 21:03.600]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?

[22:58.920 --> 23:01.440]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.640]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells
[23:05.640 --> 23:07.400]  due to its large particle size.

[24:00.320 --> 24:23.000]  I didn't start a radio show, I didn't make films, I didn't do what we've done here to
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.640]  try to become part of the establishment.
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.680]  I'd rather die before I did that.
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.800]  I want to overturn this parasitic system.
[24:32.800 --> 24:37.640]  I want to see humanity turned loose and set free.
[24:37.640 --> 24:38.640]  I'm Alex Schoen, your host.
[24:38.640 --> 24:39.640]  Thank you all for joining us.
[24:39.640 --> 24:40.640]  Thank you for your support.
[24:40.640 --> 24:47.400]  Now more than ever, your prayers, spreading the word, buying the products to fund the
[24:47.400 --> 24:48.400]  operation.
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.400]  We have free shipping.
[24:49.400 --> 24:53.720]  You can order any of the products at informerstore.com and get them before Christmas if you order
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.640]  by Friday anywhere in the United States that includes Alaska.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.440]  That includes places like Hawaii.
[25:01.440 --> 25:08.320]  By Monday, it pretty much is only the lower 48.
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.440]  So really, you can order through Monday to the lower 48, but the point is we're going
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.840]  to extend free shipping right through to next week.
[25:14.840 --> 25:19.440]  I'll talk about that more later, but we do need financial support.
[25:19.440 --> 25:23.280]  They're on every major channel in the country saying, how do we shut Alex Schoen's down?
[25:23.280 --> 25:24.280]  Do we sue him?
[25:24.280 --> 25:26.160]  Do we go out for sponsors?
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.440]  Do we arrest him?
[25:28.440 --> 25:30.240]  They don't have any backing to do that.
[25:30.240 --> 25:31.240]  I've checked with the lawyers.
[25:31.240 --> 25:38.600]  I've looked at every level of it, talked to congressmen off record and on record.
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.160]  Where they're going is a false flag, a mass shooting where they have someone blamed who
[25:43.160 --> 25:44.600]  they claim is one of my listeners.
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.440]  It's like the guy that went and comic-picked bonk pizza, who by the way, that is a diversion
[25:48.440 --> 25:50.600]  or red herring in my view overall.
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.360]  There are some globalists that are into weird stuff like Podesta who should be investigated
[25:53.360 --> 25:56.040]  to go there, but they distracted off onto that.
[25:56.040 --> 25:57.040]  He goes there.
[25:57.040 --> 25:59.160]  The witnesses we've had on say he didn't fire shots.
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.360]  They didn't see that happen, but the media says it.
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.400]  He visits hundreds of websites, but the FBI under Hillary and under Obama puts out a report
[26:07.400 --> 26:09.360]  saying he visited infowars.com.
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.360]  Isn't that nice?
[26:10.360 --> 26:11.840]  Well, of course he does.
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.880]  I mean, the website gets tens of millions of visitors a week.
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.880]  You can't go in a room of 20, 30 people that some of them don't visit the site.
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.440]  That's like saying he watched Fox News or CNN, but it's the media calling for killing
[26:24.440 --> 26:31.000]  Trump, calling for violence, calling for riots, Newsweek, remember, the case for rioting.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.720]  Cops get killed and the president says, well, that's because the cops are being violent.
[26:34.720 --> 26:35.720]  Cops got to reform themselves.
[26:35.720 --> 26:36.720]  Oh, really?
[26:36.720 --> 26:37.920]  A cop does something wrong.
[26:37.920 --> 26:38.920]  Maybe somewhere else.
[26:38.920 --> 26:46.040]  See a kill a cop, five states over pumping gas or riding a ticket or sitting in their
[26:46.040 --> 26:47.040]  squad car.
[26:47.040 --> 26:49.040]  They're the ones pushing violence.
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.720]  They're the ones getting foreign Chinese money and Saudi Arabian money for the election
[26:52.720 --> 26:55.000]  publicly.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.880]  And then they tell us that Russians are running us.
[26:57.880 --> 27:04.640]  If I'm getting any influence by Russians, I'm a, I'm Santa Claus' son.
[27:04.640 --> 27:07.800]  I mean, this is just made up crap and they know it.
[27:07.800 --> 27:10.400]  So I hear from Nichols.
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.960]  He goes, man, I talked to one of Sessions people and Sessions is really concerned and
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.280]  I know he knows Sessions for going back a long time and he said Pelosi's coming after
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.280]  you.
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.280]  They are.
[27:21.280 --> 27:22.280]  She is so mad at you.
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.880]  They have some federal suit to try to shut you up.
[27:26.880 --> 27:29.440]  And then I noticed on the news, they're saying we got to shut him up.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.680]  What do we do?
[27:30.680 --> 27:33.440]  And then I noticed last night on Kavuto, I didn't learn about about nine o'clock at
[27:33.440 --> 27:35.440]  night at the company Christmas party.
[27:35.440 --> 27:43.560]  People go, yeah, here's Kavuto and it's, it's her saying, Alex Jones got me death-rated.
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.160]  I mean, I pointed out that's what congressmen are calling it.
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.720]  That's what others are calling it is a CIA slash Democrat attempt at a coup, a publicity
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.600]  stunt, a disinformation campaign to overturn the election.
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.600]  That's what that is when you overturn an election.
[28:00.600 --> 28:03.600]  It's called a coup.
[28:03.600 --> 28:05.760]  And boy, let me tell you, she looks like Frankenstein with a wig on.
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.000]  I don't try to be mean, but give me a break.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.320]  And she's so arrogant during the eight minute interview.
[28:11.320 --> 28:13.040]  This woman thinks she's better than you.
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.480]  And then she sits up there and implies she's in danger.
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.760]  This is the whole push I heard before she said it, that Pelosi plans to say, I'm yelling
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.080]  fire in a theater and I've got to be dealt with.
[28:22.080 --> 28:23.760]  And these folks are gangsters.
[28:23.760 --> 28:26.480]  They're saying a lot of these globalists are saying kill Trump openly.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.600]  Well, of course, you know, they may come after Alex Jones as well.
[28:29.600 --> 28:34.200]  I just, if something happens to me, just know this, it's because we were effective and we
[28:34.200 --> 28:36.560]  know who the enemy is, don't we?
[28:36.560 --> 28:39.640]  But let's go out to break with her.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.960]  Her Trump card is Alex Jones wants me dead.
[28:42.960 --> 28:44.960]  Here it is.
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.040]  You owe it to the American people to let me tell the truth and to not lie about what I
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.040]  just said.
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.040]  Yeah.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.720]  Alex Jones said the same thing about me yesterday.
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.360]  Alex Jones and info wars has said that I want to have a coup and assassinate Donald
[28:57.360 --> 28:58.360]  Trump.
[28:58.360 --> 28:59.360]  I've gotten desperate.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.360]  It's not helpful for me.
[29:00.360 --> 29:05.040]  If you're going to lie about what I am saying, that is not helpful for me.
[29:05.040 --> 29:06.040]  It's not safe for me.
[29:06.040 --> 29:07.040]  For my family.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.040]  Donald Trump doesn't like me.
[29:08.040 --> 29:09.680]  He doesn't come on this show.
[29:09.680 --> 29:11.360]  I have no agenda here.
[29:11.360 --> 29:12.360]  I'm just saying it.
[29:12.360 --> 29:13.360]  It seems that you don't know.
[29:13.360 --> 29:17.680]  Don't put words in my mouth that you know we're going to attack and pacify people and
[29:17.680 --> 29:18.680]  make me unsafe.
[29:18.680 --> 29:19.680]  Christine, come on.
[29:19.680 --> 29:20.680]  You want the electors to get this information?
[29:20.680 --> 29:21.680]  No, no, Neil.
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.080]  You need to make sure that you understand what your role is here.
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.080]  Do you want them to switch their votes?
[29:27.080 --> 29:28.960]  Yes or no?
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.720]  What I want to do is get the information.
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.280]  What I want to do is not have you mischaracterize what I say so that I get even more death threats
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.480]  and more insults and more online attacks than I'm already saying.
[29:38.480 --> 29:39.480]  All right.
[29:39.480 --> 29:40.480]  So, Fader, I'm going to play back with the rest of the clip.
[29:40.480 --> 29:42.960]  What she's saying is your free speech gets our death threats.
[29:42.960 --> 29:44.280]  We all get death threats, lady.
[29:44.280 --> 29:47.280]  So, Clare, they want to play the victim.
[29:47.280 --> 29:51.200]  They want to launch all these wars and turn jihadis loose and all the rest of it.
[29:51.200 --> 30:00.480]  On March, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.480 --> 30:05.320]  One can argue that there's a war on Christianity, specifically in Western Europe as a clash of
[30:05.320 --> 30:06.880]  cultures is underway.
[30:06.880 --> 30:12.080]  Heat Street has a report that says that 50 Christian statues in one area were defaced,
[30:12.080 --> 30:14.280]  smashed, or decapitated in Germany.
[30:14.280 --> 30:19.360]  Now, this area, the crime wave began on December the 8th, and in particular, one roadside statue
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.520]  of Jesus on the cross had his face smashed and his right arm broken off.
[30:23.520 --> 30:28.400]  And police in the area are saying that the suspect most likely has a religious background
[30:28.400 --> 30:31.320]  and the crime was committed because of their hatred towards Christianity.
[30:31.320 --> 30:36.560]  He goes on to say, quote, based on the intensity of the acts of the perpetrator, one can conclude
[30:36.560 --> 30:38.640]  that this act has a religious background.
[30:38.640 --> 30:43.160]  Of course, he's talking about, without naming names, the fact that somebody that hates Christianity
[30:43.160 --> 30:47.560]  would go out and begin smashing statues of Christ and other Christian figures is most
[30:47.560 --> 30:50.200]  likely of a different culture and faith.
[30:50.200 --> 30:51.200]  Yeah, no kidding.
[30:51.200 --> 30:54.840]  Never more evident there is a war on Christianity in Western Europe.
[30:54.840 --> 31:24.760]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for infowars.com.

[32:59.080 --> 33:17.480]  35 days.
[33:17.480 --> 33:22.480]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[33:22.480 --> 33:29.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.360 --> 33:34.720]  Alright so Nancy Pelosi's daughter who's organized 50 plus of the electors to go against Trump
[33:34.720 --> 33:39.720]  isn't telling the public when she gets pressed she's forced to that only one of them is a
[33:39.720 --> 33:44.000]  Republican and the other is part of some sub-democratic party group out of New York where they can
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.600]  have multiple parties within the party.
[33:46.600 --> 33:49.880]  She was a Hillary voter.
[33:49.880 --> 33:56.040]  So 50 of the 51 are Democrats and they won't be voting for Trump to begin with.
[33:56.040 --> 34:02.440]  So it's another deception and other hoax to try to manipulate and then force a quote CIA
[34:02.440 --> 34:08.160]  briefing of all of the hundreds and hundreds of electors to intimidate them and give them
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.160]  disinformation.
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.320]  But now we have the head of all the major intelligence agencies coming out on Tuesday
[34:13.320 --> 34:16.760]  and saying it's fake, it's not real, no evidence, no intent.
[34:16.760 --> 34:20.320]  Now you have Clapper going before Congress two days ago and saying no, there's no evidence.
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.480]  I have a stack of mainstream news here now with other intelligence agencies saying there's
[34:25.480 --> 34:26.480]  no proof.
[34:26.480 --> 34:32.760]  Now last week I called separate sources I know some of which have worked with the CIA,
[34:32.760 --> 34:39.720]  others contractors, others for other intelligence agencies including the NSA so I talked to
[34:39.720 --> 34:47.320]  four people but I talked to two with CIA connections or been with the CIA or been contractors
[34:47.320 --> 34:51.400]  for the CIA I'll just stop right there and they said we've talked to people in the agency
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.240]  currently pretty high up this is total bull.
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.280]  And now Congress the CIA saying will not give them a briefing and the other agencies won't
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.360]  because they're saying it isn't true and Congressman King has come out and said this is a disinformation
[35:06.360 --> 35:13.840]  campaign by Obama and a splinter group they're using the term I've used from within the CIA
[35:13.840 --> 35:15.000]  former people leftist.
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.840]  Well look at Bob Baer the big leftist CIA guy on CNN last Friday saying Trump needs to
[35:20.840 --> 35:26.120]  basically have a new election and step down and we need to you know suspend this election
[35:26.120 --> 35:29.920]  then you say oh they're calling for suspending the election they go shut up conspiracy theory
[35:29.920 --> 35:32.360]  stop death threading us.
[35:32.360 --> 35:39.960]  So this is very very important and here's Nancy Pelosi's daughter here's the headlines
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.320]  all over the newspapers the poor victim I've gotten death threats Pelosi's daughter rips
[35:44.320 --> 35:49.920]  Fox News for lying about electoral college and electoral challenge and she says Alex
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.680]  Jones is causing the death threats for simply pointing out she's trying to overthrow the
[35:53.680 --> 35:59.440]  election that's what she's doing with a think tank and a PR firm run by the Clintons but
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.720]  she thinks you're stupid.
[36:01.720 --> 36:05.240]  So I had Larry Nichols on yesterday we've got that clip queued up right I was asked for
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.840]  this morning he's coming back on the clips on YouTube saying I don't know what you did
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.160]  to Pelosi but she's trying to get you arrested or shut down right now and then I noticed
[36:15.160 --> 36:18.820]  last night on the news on other channels it's like we've got to shut him down there's free
[36:18.820 --> 36:23.320]  speech but Alex Jones doesn't get it MSNBC I've got the clips coming up so suddenly
[36:23.320 --> 36:29.200]  I'm being told this via sessions from one of our sources Nichols then at night it's
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.440]  Pelosi's daughter out saying she's in danger because of me and other channels are saying
[36:33.440 --> 36:40.000]  I've got to be shut up so folks they want to use us as a test case then everybody else
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.840]  will fall.
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.760]  They want Trump kicked off Twitter the Washington Post says and Twitter says they're considering
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.960]  it the president quote he's a bully he's going to get people killed because when the union
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.040]  says you didn't get all the jobs back at carrier only 85% he says well you lost them I'm doing
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.520]  the best I can they said that's going to cause violence see our speech no matter how mild
[37:01.520 --> 37:07.160]  must be shut down we must have prior restraint that's how they have hate laws in Europe to
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.760]  restrict nationalistic conservative speech you criticize the Islamists the rapes a woman
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.480]  you post the guy's picture out of the newspaper on Facebook you get banned you get a police
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.880]  visit these people are authoritarians so here is the clip there's a bunch of these clips
[37:21.880 --> 37:28.280]  but it was a nine minute interview of her attacking Cavuto here it is California elector
[37:28.280 --> 37:35.120]  Christine Pelosi leading this charge right now out of San Francisco Christine these 50
[37:35.120 --> 37:43.000]  some odd elector 51 I guess are they how do they break down well all of us are patriots
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.240]  preparing to do our constitutional duty as members of the Electoral College and when
[37:47.240 --> 37:53.600]  we read the Washington Post report last Friday night that indicated the CIA claims conclusive
[37:53.600 --> 37:59.200]  evidence that Russia hacked our elections we thought it was time for us to step up and
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.240]  demand an investigation we want the information declassified as much as past possible so that
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.760]  everybody I know I know I don't want everything and we want to how many are Democrat and how
[38:10.760 --> 38:18.360]  many are Republican we have 50 we have 50 Democrats one Republican and one member of
[38:18.360 --> 38:27.000]  the Working Families Party from New York okay do you want the Republicans to switch their
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.680]  votes or what is this about I want everybody to look at the information Neil I can't prejudge
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.920]  something I haven't seen but I absolutely want everybody to have a chance to look at
[38:36.920 --> 38:42.560]  the information and if it's declassified so the public can take a look at it too without
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.760]  endangering our sources and methods in the intelligence community I think that's that's
[38:47.760 --> 38:56.960]  the role of right there that's where she doesn't want to say that 50 of the 51 people are Democrats
[38:56.960 --> 39:02.240]  but then she's forced to say it here's the clip where she later when when Cavuto saying
[39:02.240 --> 39:05.640]  you're trying to overturn the election which they admit they're doing on their fundraisers
[39:05.640 --> 39:09.120]  she says that's ridiculous that's the same thing that Alex Jones said that got me death
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.240]  threats you'll see I'm not death-threading her she's not showing proof of death threats
[39:13.240 --> 39:19.840]  she's probably getting them but then I mean every day but then it's still my fault see
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.760]  this is hours after I heard her mommy's after me so this is how they're operating here's
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.320]  the clip you owe it to the American people to let me tell the truth and to not lie about
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.720]  what I just said yeah Alex Jones said the same thing about me yesterday Alex Jones
[39:34.720 --> 39:43.520]  and Info Wars has said that I want to have a coup and I'm not going to lie about what
[39:43.520 --> 39:56.960]  I am saying I have no agenda here I'm just saying it seems that you know that you know
[39:56.960 --> 40:11.040]  we're going to you want the electors to make sure that you understand what I want to do
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.160]  is get the information what I want to do is not have you mischaracterized what I say so
[40:15.160 --> 40:19.840]  that I get even more death threats and more insults and more online attacks than I'm already
[40:19.840 --> 40:24.040]  getting part of the reason that Republicans won't sign on to my letter is some of them
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.520]  have said to me point blank I don't want to get that kind of blowback I want a hearing
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.640]  I want a briefing yeah well they've asked for the briefings they've been told by the
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.160]  intelligence agencies it isn't true she'll understand clapper the head of intelligence
[40:39.160 --> 40:44.760]  all of them have come out and said it's not true there is no proof it's made up meanwhile
[40:44.760 --> 40:53.440]  I have a stack of news here with the communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and basically
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.400]  everybody else under the sun was bragging that they were financing Hillary's campaign
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.000]  and then the illegals coming in how is that not outside influence in voting and Democrats
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.800]  wanting non-citizens be able to vote all over the news and Chinese billionaires buying
[41:11.800 --> 41:23.640]  Hillary and just Saudi Arabia's Prince and King brags that they funded 20% of her campaign
[41:23.640 --> 41:29.120]  and they own the Saudis own a big chunk of Fox wonder why it's so anti-Trump now wonder
[41:29.120 --> 41:36.120]  why Megan Kelly is such a such a vicious person now to be clear I said last Friday last Saturday
[41:36.120 --> 41:40.800]  last Sunday and the headlines are there on YouTube we name the show that that it's a
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.800]  hoax that the CIA said this that's why they don't ever give you proof so they said secret
[41:44.800 --> 41:49.680]  and now even the CIA won't come out and say it's actually their report this is show bold
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.600]  it's a disinformation campaign now one of my sources the first source I talked to also
[41:54.600 --> 42:00.920]  made some phone calls of his own and let's just say that let's not even say what he's
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.520]  done with the CIA or what a CIA connections are but they're they're high level and they're
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.760]  not in the pinhead division this is in the real CIA that does the hanging and so he can
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.360]  break down and tell you from the highest levels not just the CIA what the intel is and what
[42:15.360 --> 42:24.040]  he told me last Thursday personally personally face to face has has has now unfolded and
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.280]  has been proven and it's only here and there in the MSM though this is so bombshell that
[42:28.280 --> 42:32.280]  they put out this hoax and what it tells me is with 35 days left they're going to go for
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.760]  broke they are desperate so we're just going to call you anonymous patriot anonymous what
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.240]  that repeat what you told me then the phone calls you made that confirmed the intel you
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.880]  had well first of all thanks for having me Alex I appreciate the opportunity to come
[42:47.880 --> 42:54.000]  on and give my side of this last week while we were face to face we had talked about the
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.040]  news releases and I explained to you that I didn't feel at all that it was anywhere near
[43:00.040 --> 43:06.960]  truthful reached out talked to some contacts that still do a certain job and they verified
[43:06.960 --> 43:15.080]  the same thing basically it is standard procedure when caught doing something wrong you deny
[43:15.080 --> 43:20.560]  you deny you deny and then you make counter accusation and that's basically where they
[43:20.560 --> 43:26.840]  are now they're in the misinformation stage they're doing everything possible to spread
[43:26.840 --> 43:32.560]  anything they can truthful or not in an attempt to divert the attention from what they're
[43:32.560 --> 43:41.280]  doing elaborate on as much as you can because obviously we don't want to get into particularly
[43:41.280 --> 43:47.280]  where these folks are at but it's it's CIA and beyond what you can relate to the listeners
[43:47.280 --> 43:54.800]  and viewers that's the that's not classified alright yeah definitely it reaches beyond
[43:54.800 --> 44:05.360]  just CIA it reaches out into the international intelligence committee or community and it
[44:05.360 --> 44:10.160]  just basically confirms that they're going to do whatever they can and grasp any straw
[44:10.160 --> 44:21.560]  they can in order to disrupt Trump's inauguration to disrupt his taking over as the president
[44:21.560 --> 44:29.280]  of the United States they're going to do that through misinformation accusations and then
[44:29.280 --> 44:35.000]  the easy trump card to pull is well he threatened me so we need to remove his free his right
[44:35.000 --> 44:44.400]  to free speech they are consistently do the same thing and that is free speech is free
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.000]  for everyone until you say something that we don't like and because you and your listeners
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.560]  say what they don't want to hear regardless of the fact that it's the truth they now want
[44:54.560 --> 45:05.000]  to shut you down and and that's coming from your sources yes sir sometimes desperate
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.320]  moves work but really I don't think this desperate moves gonna be very successful but I know
[45:09.320 --> 45:14.760]  that senator sessions is concerned about this but I mean not just me but but it just I mean
[45:14.760 --> 45:21.640]  the whole thing the desperateness of Hillary and Pelosi particularly reads giving up the
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.640]  scurrying off Obama's kind of fading off but it looks like he's gonna let them hang
[45:25.640 --> 45:30.080]  out there and if they're successful somehow he might back them but this is an incredibly
[45:30.080 --> 45:38.280]  dangerous situation it is incredibly dangerous it is a strike to free speech and I think
[45:38.280 --> 45:44.720]  it is just a catalyst to see how far they can push it they test it out with you they
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.480]  see how it works what they under what they don't understand is that even if they were
[45:49.480 --> 45:57.480]  able to get a gag order anything on you personally they can name everyone and there are people
[45:57.480 --> 46:04.280]  out there that will continue to push the message continue to speak the truth and continue on
[46:04.280 --> 46:10.560]  with the mission regardless of whether you are the voice of it or not what about the
[46:10.560 --> 46:14.800]  desperation I mean you you talked about your contacts basically likening it to a drowning
[46:14.800 --> 46:20.360]  person these are grounding people that have nuclear weapons I mean there's got to be some
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.320]  point at which the open treason gets blocked I mean I know Trump's more and more getting
[46:25.320 --> 46:31.840]  on the offensive I know for a fact he's very concerned I'm just gonna leave it at that
[46:31.840 --> 46:37.120]  but somebody's got to stop these people I mean they openly get Chinese money Saudi
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.120]  Arabian money EU money then they claim the Russians are involved then they get caught
[46:41.120 --> 46:47.200]  lying about all that I mean it is a just a rogue group of retired CIA people that they
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.760]  gave a report to Obama and Hillary I mean what does Hillary think they're gonna have
[46:51.760 --> 46:57.960]  a new election that's gonna cause a civil war I agree with you I think that if they were
[46:57.960 --> 47:05.880]  able to sit back now and say we're going to nullify this election and have a brand new
[47:05.880 --> 47:13.240]  one here we are 3035 days out it just leads in directly into what they want it leads into
[47:13.240 --> 47:21.600]  civil war it leads into civil unrest it leads into the possibility of martial law the ability
[47:21.600 --> 47:26.600]  to postpone the presidential elections indefinitely and I think that's exactly what they're doing
[47:26.600 --> 47:33.040]  they're gonna continue to grasp that straws until they either run out of time or until
[47:33.040 --> 47:39.280]  they succeeded what they're trying to do there is a massive amount of work being done behind
[47:39.280 --> 47:47.560]  the scenes in the intelligence community and I don't see them being successful and what
[47:47.560 --> 47:54.560]  it is that they want to do being Pelosi and Hillary and them they're gonna try their best
[47:54.560 --> 48:00.520]  but as we've proven time and time again their best isn't good enough well we know WikiLeaks
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.080]  held back on the really damaging stuff because it would really hurt the country in the world
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.160]  it's so horrible that's the word I've gotten that if they keep pushing doesn't matter how
[48:09.160 --> 48:12.960]  many internet kill switches they've got or wars they try to start stuff's about to come
[48:12.960 --> 48:21.520]  out so bad that it's gonna be completely over for them I believe so alright well I've been
[48:21.520 --> 48:25.600]  asking the questions here my friend anything else you want to add that you've observed
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.960]  or people told you that are pretty high up no sir just again pass the word to the listeners
[48:30.960 --> 48:36.040]  that you know the silent majority is no longer silent in regardless of if you pass the word
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.560]  or someone else the word will be passed the truth will be spread and the American patriots
[48:42.560 --> 48:47.840]  are gonna do what they need to do in order to have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[48:47.840 --> 48:53.320]  what about your info it is what's that I didn't I didn't quiz you on that is that your opinion
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.920]  or educated view that Obama is kind of hedging his bets and wants to fade off in the sunset
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.720]  and that it is Hillary and Pelosi and and Soros that are still crazy or was that from
[49:02.720 --> 49:08.520]  your sources it's more of my personal opinion kind of professional idea I think that he's
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.240]  done what he wanted to do he wasn't successful in any of the things he tried you know we're
[49:14.240 --> 49:22.120]  divided as a nation more now so than maybe ever in our history and he just wasn't successful
[49:22.120 --> 49:29.000]  in whatever his counterculture mission was so now he'll take a step back he'll go off
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.360]  and enjoy the fruits of his labor and the payments that come from him to from other
[49:33.360 --> 49:40.400]  countries and other outside entities and Hillary and Pelosi will pick up the torch and take
[49:40.400 --> 49:45.680]  off running all right well thank you so much for joining us yes sir thank you for your
[49:45.680 --> 49:51.880]  time anything else you'd like to add no sir thank you all right thank you and again that
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.440]  source and others told me what was going on and I could see it as well but that's that's
[49:55.440 --> 50:01.520]  confirmed okay this is totally fake it's not even from the CIA it's just a cooked up couple
[50:01.520 --> 50:08.200]  guys democratic operatives that just put a report out a photo shop you know oh here's
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.800]  our report the Russians are influencing this is ridiculous we're gonna go to break and come
[50:12.800 --> 50:17.440]  back with more news but wait till the bottom of the next hour I have another guest joining
[50:17.440 --> 50:20.680]  us wait till the bottom of the next hour when I play this special report with the news over
[50:20.680 --> 50:24.080]  and over again saying shut me up shut me down shut because I don't really pay attention
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.000]  to it I knew it was bad but it's really bad and again I'm just asking for your prayers
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  and support but understand I feel great this is I'm really having a big effect in my life
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.840]  this is what I prayed for it's what I asked for I want to beat these people and I'm just
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.400]  so thankful to God I mean that I'm not putting a good face on this folks this is good this
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.280]  is really good news we are really hurting these bad people and exposing them to the
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.400]  point where they want to kill me or shut me up and that's we're forcing them out in the
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.040]  open and so all I do is thank Jesus thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for making
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.800]  the enemy move against us to expose them and draw their fire in these uncertain times it
[51:01.800 --> 51:05.920]  makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water if your current

[57:09.880 --> 57:12.720]  all intelligence saying it's not true.
[57:12.720 --> 57:22.520]  far as the wiki leaks connection the evidence there is not as strong and we don't have good
[57:22.520 --> 57:30.360]  insight into the sequencing of the releases or when that when the data may have been provided
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.240]  we don't we don't have as good insight into that.
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.000]  now that's always been known now here's loretta lynch in the hip-hop of the clintons but still
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.240]  she won't say that it's true here it is.

[58:05.120 --> 58:09.920]  been talking about this now for some time since the summer when we began the investigation
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.800]  into the hacks of the dnc and the d triple c and and trying to ascertain who was behind
[58:15.800 --> 58:20.000]  that you know there's a number of things that we do a lot of which we talk about publicly
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.720]  a lot of which we don't talk about publicly in terms of just investigation and the responses
[58:25.720 --> 58:32.240]  that we have this was of grave concern to us so we began this summer to what we could
[58:32.240 --> 58:36.240]  say i thought this clip was shorter than it is we're going to come back play the rest

[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.960]  true there's no evidence that wiki leaks was russia that's because us intelligence is
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.560]  ready to release the info and the people involved are ready to go public at a press conference
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.360]  and i told you this back during the last few days of the campaign it's why they're so upset
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.600]  the reason hillary and pelosi hate me is they know what we're talking about is real and they
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:53.720]  know that info wars is the main conduit that will put this information out and they're
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.520]  really upset as if if you kill me or shut me up you're going to get the other people
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.960]  to shut up you're really stupid all they're going to do is release stuff that is 10 times
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.440]  worse than men's release and if you want that go ahead and try it but it's going to come
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.880]  out even if you shut the internet off which would kill the economy it's going to come
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:23.720]  out in the rest of world you just don't get it do you dumbasses you're a bunch of punch
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:30.440]  back new world order pieces of filth but but here's lynch on c-span admitting that they
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.600]  don't have intelligence that it was the russians here it is unfortunately we didn't see the
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.400]  sort of technical interference that i know people had concerns about also in terms of
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.120]  voting machines and the like but a lot of education went on about that a lot of training
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:50.240]  went on about that and a significant number of states did reach out to dhs and talk with
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.800]  them about those issues and so we thought that was an important step as well to make
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.320]  sure that every state knew they could work with us and as you know that's part of larger
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.160]  clip we played the rest earlier she's saying they didn't see the technical stuff like they're
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.160]  saying they're just saying russian propaganda affected it rt wouldn't even get involved
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.880]  in the election they were so scared to get kicked out of the u.s. they're big globally
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.240]  but not big in the u.s. folks i've looked at the ratings it's almost negligible it's worse
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:23.880]  than cnn but but the point is that they're trying to sell this idea when it's the opposite
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.480]  they were the ones being funded by outsiders and now they have Pelosi's daughter saying
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.400]  she fears for her life because of me and other channels last night cnn saying i need to be
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.080]  shut down because i'm causing violence with no evidence when they're pushing for violence
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.720]  against trump here's larry nickles yesterday in this what was it second or third hour talking
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.520]  about this hours before it was set on cavuto here it is
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.720]  alex did you get my warning this morning that person from uh attorney general to be
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:59.160]  office gave me another little warning alex if they pull this off you're number one on
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:07.200]  the list you're going to be gone buddy info wars will be toast you have been successful
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:15.840]  at getting first in line attention from hillary now remember when they say fake news when hillary
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.720]  comes out saying this fake news is running the risk by the way they're going to come
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.760]  with you with inciting riots uh inciting anarchy that's what they're going to come
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.800]  with you they can't tell you they're coming all of us i guess sure they're going to blame
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:37.000]  the other side to steal it from trombone that's right that's right now what the clinton's
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.920]  do since the day i was with him and i helped design this system so i know it so well what
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:50.720]  you always do is you accuse your enemy of exactly what you're doing sure just like she
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.240]  got money from the chinese and the saudi arabians publicly they bragged about it then she just
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.280]  turns it around she got money from the russians then she turns it around and blames it on
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:04.640]  trombone and by the way i wanted to put a video out yesterday the whole thing he goes
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.200]  on and gets into you must have made Pelosi really mad this is what they're going to do
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.480]  in congress they're going to come after you i guess i didn't explain to folks what i wanted
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.600]  to put out from the live show but i i want that those parts excise that we can rob or
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600]  somebody and put together where he goes into what they're going to do in congress how they're
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.520]  going to sue me what they're going to do what he was told by the source that's not even
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.120]  the meat so i noticed i only put two minutes up on youtube i guess the full interviews
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.360]  up there separately by itself but i wanted that excised see they misunderstood the notes
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.880]  what's been happening is i want a stinger up front because it makes you get triple views
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.000]  where where the meat said and i tell them the exact time i want and then it goes with info
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.920]  wars then they then the interview part i want plays instead they'll just take the stinger
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.800]  and put it out by itself with nothing else i'm just going to have to work on that harder
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.640]  just inside baseball but i've a lot of time to work with the crew i'll just do it live
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.360]  here on air but back stay with us to listen to the mainstream media you would think that
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.000]  we're engaged in covert ops in the fifties at the height of the cold war there's an article
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.520]  up it's on our website it aggregated from zero hedge and it talks about how nbc is reporting
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.720]  the quote new intelligence shows that putin personally directed how hacked material from
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.920]  the democrats was leaked and otherwise used now they cite this intelligence coming from
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:25.800]  quote diplomatic sources and spies working for us allies they go on to say that putin
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:31.280]  and the hack that was perpetuated against the dnc involved americans believing that their
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.560]  lives under obama and by extension hillary were bad enough and they needed to change
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:41.280]  so hence russia was been involved this ridiculous insinuation is also vastly circulated by the
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:46.640]  new york times which talks about how the fbi and the cia are confirming that latin air
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.480]  putin became personally involved in a covert russian campaign to interfere with the us
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.000]  presidential election i cannot make this up these ridiculous claims are believed by the

[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.920]  of the spear who can doubt look i always try to act like a humble person i am a humble
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:30.640]  person but we are the spearhead and it was drudge help blow holes in the narrative and
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.560]  open it up and help just get the ball down the field so and drudges and want the credit
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.360]  either he probably doesn't want it but drudge has been the absolute MVP in all this i would
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.040]  love it to be somebody else more prominent more hated than i am by the globalist this
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.920]  point but i'm the visual guy in their face i think if drudge was on air every day he's
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.840]  more articulate than i i think he'd be the number one enemy if he was on air like i am
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.360]  he's probably smarter he's withdrawn to his high high tower you know the man in the high
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:04.240]  castle but we i mean this is history happening so make no mistake if we succeed we'll be
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.680]  known as the paul reveres in the 21st century if we fail god help us dr grip got a lot to
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.960]  cover on the health front because even the globalists are reeling over us and corrupt
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.360]  we can take care of ourselves and i've been religiously now for two weeks taking the
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.480]  supplements always kind of forget get off them i've been religiously taking them
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.080]  already more energy already lost weight everybody can notice it incredible job you've
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.520]  done with them for his life calm that's not why you're here today tell us about the breaking news
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.800]  well thanks i mean you know when i started studying medicine i was looking at
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.040]  addressing the symptoms of disease as well but the reason why i wanted to come out with
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.400]  the press release is because i wanted to put together a simple program that people can understand
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.640]  and hopefully the trump team will look at this and say you know let's address the root cause of
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.200]  america's health care problem i did the same thing when obama was in office of course no one
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.200]  ever followed through or listened to me but i wanted to put a press release out there because
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.200]  alex first of all when you look at what's going on in this country i mean you look at these
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:08.240]  the democrats and polosian all these people i mean look how mean she looks look how aggressive
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.760]  she looks it's almost like a almost like robots that are just falling apart but you have to
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:21.440]  remember i say that in order to get the america great again we have to get america healthy again
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.320]  and the reason i say that is not you know leaning towards people need to be on pharmaceuticals is
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.520]  only because doing the research that you and i have done and looking back at the root cause
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.960]  it's all about control i mean dating back from the fluoride in the water to the gmo foods to
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:43.280]  everything these have distinct effects they can actually pinpoint people now with all the data
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.560]  analytics and say this person is a radical this person's on the right this person's on the left
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.760]  this person's in a religious person they've even identified genes and they why do you think that
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.840]  they're they're coming out with all these flu shots the flu shots are actually going to can
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:04.320]  target these specific they're genetically uh shut down and control human behavior they admit
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.680]  that by the way you know for 20 years the entire science of vaccines has been about
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.280]  population control behavior control yeah i mean the the fact of the matter is if we really want
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.000]  to change america but we got to get rid of some of these systems because these are the mechanisms
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.880]  that are controlling america keeping you sick keeping you depressed keeping you uh down and in
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:30.000]  not wanting to succeed keep losing yourself confidence making you obese you know causing
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.800]  heart disease causing cancer and causing all these other things i mean insurance premiums of skyrocket
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.760]  deductibles have gone through the route patient satisfaction is at an all-time low insurance
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.880]  carriers aren't covering complementary and alternative medicine americans are spending like
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.880]  one and a half trillion we're going to break stay stay right there dr grip we're going to come back

[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.720]  detailed report of not just the attack on info wars but the attack on free press i mean
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.840]  you're going to hear him at the end of it just over and over again say shut alex jones down it's now time to do it and we've confirmed it's
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.360]  Nancy Pelosi leading the charge i've also confirmed that through trump sources after nickles told me yesterday
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.440]  and and then i didn't even know at dinner it had already been on fox that they're saying
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.760]  basically shut me down i want violence against pelosi uh this is crazy folks we are hurting them
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.520]  that bad but regardless harvard's come out with 25 studies a couple years ago remember
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:23.440]  saying okay fluoride lowers iq on average every few years in a child 10 points i mean this is
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:30.000]  incredible not having iodine lowers your iq 15 points that's mainstream news they call us conspiracy
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.680]  theorists or laugh at us we're the real people we have the scientists on we have the generals on we
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:42.640]  have the experts on most the people in government at the fda and epa have gone public they've signed
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:48.160]  letters three times all their scientists together saying take fluoride out of the water but they just
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.440]  make fun of us and say we're crazy but that's in the news so dr group continuing with your press
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.600]  release that i just told them to post info wars dot com to make america great again we must we need
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.960]  to make america healthy again and we need to make it free again as well let's continue getting into
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.480]  the press release yeah so you talk about the attack on free press and we've we've been talking about
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.280]  the attack on natural medicine for years and years and years because you know that's that's
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:20.640]  another thing that threatens uh their control is having natural remedies for different things i mean
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.920]  our health care system and you don't see this out there a lot in the mainstream media of course
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:30.480]  you don't see anything true in the mainstream media we know that but our health care ranks number
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:37.600]  our country in health care ranks number 50 out of 55 countries we're almost dead last i mean that is
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:46.560]  embarrassing nearly 70 percent of all americans are on at least one prescription drug most are on
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:54.400]  more than that actually 2014 there were close to 50 000 deaths from prescription drugs how come that
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:01.520]  is not everywhere in the news so i mean my plan is not you know something extravagant all i'm asking
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:08.640]  for is just three things and the number one thing is in order to reform health care we have to address
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.680]  the root cause of the health problems you know everybody tries to put band-aids over things
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.600]  and tries to address the symptoms is like breast cancer is up several thousand percentage points
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:23.920]  we never ask why is it exploding we look for a cure instead of the cause yeah i mean we absolutely
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.120]  beyond a shadow of a doubt have proof that the root cause of all health conditions mental wellness
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.960]  conditions all of that stuff is caused and directly linked to man-made chemicals artificial
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:41.760]  colors foods beverages all the toxic ingredients that were lack of nutrients let me add this new
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.840]  studies out you said this years ago but scientific ones we can pull them up i know i'm just throwing
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.360]  us out of the but the cruise really quick watching a lot of tv is linked to women getting breast cancer
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.480]  uh it's also linked to brain tumors and new studies are linking it to depression
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.800]  obviously that's well known but the fact is television and not having a good social life
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:10.240]  and not going outside is literally causing cancer yes and that's part of the number one
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.920]  step in the health care reform is that address the root cause of health problem sure but why
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.800]  why is tv so bad because they're finding it's not just the sedentary it's it's it's women that quote
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.920]  don't have a lot of friends women that tend to be liberal women that watch a lot of television
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.640]  are just dying i guess the body decides you're not doing anything for the species just die or
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:38.240]  what's happening yeah that's that's why we need independent which is actually number three on my
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.520]  plan which is independent advisory boards which are not linked to the pharmaceutical industry
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:52.320]  the chemical industry or the food industry to evaluate the safety and efficacy of all these
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.080]  endocrine disrupting chemicals and i mean we know what they're going to say when the panel comes
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.960]  back and says these are these are directly linked to all these diseases and obesity and everything
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:07.040]  else that's going on uh fluoride pesticides herbicides phthalates refined sugars preservatives
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.840]  all of the things that we've spent 20 years identifying and we have all the research to back
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:18.400]  it up you know we can't just come out and say okay band chemicals band glyphosate band this
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:24.160]  you know what i'm asking for is get an independent team of scientists together well i'll happily
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.240]  they know they know that glyphosates when they develop them grow tumors and animals
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.600]  and they know they they admit it now i mean they admit it by the way for tv viewers obviously
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.360]  you're seeing all these articles radio listeners we're putting mainstream news about lonely women
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.920]  getting breast cancer women that watch tv breast cancer brain cancer and of course that's just
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.560]  studies on women this and it's mainline tv's worse than others they're sending
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:52.560]  carrier signals in that basically tell you to die we're on the march the empires on the one
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:58.640]  they're saying die alex jones and the transmissions radio network die die die die that's what they
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:04.000]  want you live live live one can argue that there is a war on christianity specifically in western
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.600]  europe as a clash of cultures is underway heat street has a report that says that 50 christian
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:15.600]  statues in one area were defaced smashed or decapitated in germany now this area the crime
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.800]  wave began on december the 8th and in particular one roadside statue of jesus on the cross had
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.840]  his face smashed and his right arm broken off and police in the area are saying that the suspect
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.720]  most likely has a religious background and the crime was committed because of their hatred towards
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.680]  christianity he goes on to say quote based on the intensity of the acts of the perpetrator one
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.080]  can conclude that this act has a religious background of course he's talking about without
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.640]  naming names the fact that somebody that hates christianity would go out and begin smashing
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.000]  statues of christ and other christian figures is most likely of a different culture and faith

[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:48.080]  what a despicable piece of filth we're now at war with russia anyone who's not for hillary is an
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.200]  enemy of america it's time to get hard and shut down the free press i'm a liberal named keith oberman
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.880]  in fact this new boil down doesn't even have him saying that about me this bull down we're
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.080]  going to play in a few minutes it isn't even one tenth of what's going on but it's horrible
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.640]  about a group continuing um why do the elites i mean i guess in the wiki leaks i guess you
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.080]  saw some of those wiki leaks where they're like we want to keep them in the dark and pathetic and
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.600]  sad and poor and desperate now we've got them diverted but they're not complying with us we
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:29.840]  we need culture war to contain them we covered this at nauseam but what a nasty group of elites
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.080]  these are horrible people along comes trump that at least wants prosperity and they are so scared
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.720]  of him if you're sick if you're overweight if you're becoming sterile which is happening all over
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.240]  the world if you're mentally unstable you're going to look at the mirror and you're not going to have
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.600]  any self-confidence and you're going to be very easily controllable and it's a money game as well
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:56.960]  alex the pharmaceutical industry i mean they're going to control you they're going to make money
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:03.200]  off of you and that actually leads into one of my other points on my three-step plan is that we
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:09.440]  have to have medical freedom we have to establish freedom of health care people need to be able
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:15.760]  to choose what kind of medicine they want as a matter of fact one third of all americans last
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.360]  year spent over 30 billion dollars on complementary and alternative medicine people want it they're
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.520]  out there begging for it and guess what insurance companies aren't covering it they're paying out
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.720]  of pocket we've got to get back into a wellness state we got to get into a preventative state
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:36.080]  we've got to have insurance need to be required to cover people's choice if somebody wants to go in
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.520]  for natural care or they want to do complementary or they want to do whatever they want to do that
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:46.720]  has to be covered by insurance ultimately that's the only thing that's going to get people better
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.920]  anyway and that's what the big fight is about so my third point is to establish medical freedom and
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.880]  give people the opportunity to choose what type of health care that they want and that they're going
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.320]  to be able to learn from and grow from and because it's all about preventative and it's all about
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:07.840]  wellness you mentioned earlier about the women sitting on the couch with cancer you know there
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.000]  was a report that came out I think yesterday that doctors they're finding and this this is a guy that
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.840]  was just charged by the federal government as a matter of fact and I've been saying this for a
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:23.360]  long time if you get diagnosed with cancer there's a lot of money in cancer and you know I went through
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.920]  an attack when we had our cancer clinic and was followed around and had death threats and everything
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:33.680]  else cancer is a multi-trillion dollar industry and I've been saying for a long time do not believe
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.280]  your doctor go get a second and go get a third opinion because doctors are subsidized if they if
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.720]  they diagnosed with cancer and now a doctor was just charged basically he was telling all of his
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.800]  patients they had cancer and he was charging Medicare and Medicare my grandmother had her lung
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.440]  cut out a million a year my grandmother had her lung cut out and led her death about five years
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.520]  later she was a great lady my dad's mom they said she had a lung tumor and it wasn't even a lung
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.840]  tumor it was like a broken blood vessel a blood clot and they knew it and just still cut her
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.440]  lung out and now they've got these genetic tests where they tell her by they've got cancer and they
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.280]  run in and get all the stuff that's why so many kids uh you know a lot of it is they're getting
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.200]  cancer is the toxins but a lot of us being over diagnosed we're absolutely right doctor group

[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:54.160]  the free press and everything this country and free societies stand for see if you can catch all
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:41:00.160]  the lies and all the disinformation because they are legion citizen a youtuber known as know your
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:07.520]  news has put together a compilation titled the character assassination of alex jones now the
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:14.400]  compilation just takes some of the latest clips of mainstream corporate media demonizing your
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.800]  truly alex jones this is being done to demonize the entire free press in this country what you're
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.080]  witnessing is the same strategy used the last 20 years to censor the press that the communist
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:33.280]  chinese have used they simply call any opposition or any free speech fake news and promptly arrest
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:39.040]  you it's not a coincidence that control of the internet was handed over to an international
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:45.200]  consortium headed up by the united nations two months ago or that saudi arabia has been placed on
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:54.160]  the un human rights commission board tyranny is expanding tyranny is moving against free speech
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:05.760]  because it cannot coexist with a free open society just for the benefit of anybody who's not
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.640]  familiar with alex jones and info wars we've seen trump both retweeting things kind of straight
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.680]  out of the info wars world and alex jones what is info wars and alex jones and why is
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.480]  dollar trump talking about taking pages out of their playbook well it's a website it's really
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.600]  one of the darkest corners of the the media online if you want to call it that they don't do
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:30.640]  traditional journalism but they they spread a lot of theories the radio host alex jones
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:38.160]  who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs jones has frequently
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:43.920]  promoted toxic conspiracy theories theories that sometimes take on lives of their own again you
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:49.280]  can see the unedited version of the character assassination of alex jones on adam green's
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.640]  excellent channel but i decided to intersperse throughout this video just several points
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:01.440]  to see if the viewer can pick up on the blatant propaganda by the way this is only a small
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:08.160]  sampling that you're seeing of the attacks mpr attacks me every couple hours they've got surrogate
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:15.280]  democratic party operatives all over local news attacking me it is a full out assault on the threat
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.000]  that they know that i'm aware of their program i'm using their own documents their own statements
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.520]  against them and they want to take down the news source that is hurting them the most that's why
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.760]  it's more important than ever that you spread the word about info wars dot com our articles our
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:36.960]  videos our information because it is the equivalent of high noon to these psychic cultural vampires
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:45.520]  i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:52.000]  that but trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on jones's show and said your
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.440]  reputation is amazing i will not let you down info wars is the conspiracy theory mega website
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.000]  where the dimmer bulbs among us have long gone to get themselves brightened up without benefit
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.360]  of a surge protector no one blows lid quite like host of info wars trump advisor and alien sasquatch
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:19.440]  love child alex p jones cover aliens captain of america's conspiracy theory mothership alex jones
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.080]  the guy named alex jones who i happen to find very entertaining he's one of those guys who believes
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:30.160]  a big foot was responsible for 9 11 he believes everything info wars host alex jones the liar
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.280]  in chief the self-described libertarian traffics and disinformation unfounded in uendo the southern
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.920]  poverty law center is caught in the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary america
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.440]  and that's saying something notice they use terms like liar in chief when it's known that obama has
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:51.600]  been caught lying to the american people over and over and over again about obama care about wars
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:58.240]  about borders is critical to understand that the predators of mainstream media of fake news
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.440]  are preying on an audience that they believe is unconscious and stupid here's a great example
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:09.360]  of it not just in these tv pieces but all over newspapers that i see every day they show photos
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:16.400]  from cleveland ohio at the rnc where the state police pulled me out of a crowd when communists
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.240]  were viciously attacking me and protected me and got me to my car but all over the news they keep
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:27.760]  showing images of this implying i'm a criminal making it look like i was being taken into police
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:34.640]  custody the overt message not just subliminal is alex jones is dangerous and needs to be arrested
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.160]  well alex jones is someone who's one of the chief conspiracy theorist on the far right trump went on
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:47.920]  his show during the campaign and uh talked about how alex jones enjoyed a wonderful reputation

[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.640]  dwarfing cnn and dwarfing the new york times online if they say it's time to censor the media
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:29.520]  and it's time to shut down info wars and alex jones they're really on tv because we've kicked

[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.880]  coverage in the real news about the growing and booming business of creating fake news president
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:47.600]  obama called the spread of fake news online a threat to democracy facebook and other social
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.280]  media sites are being criticized for not doing enough to stop bogus stories that seem to dominate
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:59.120]  the election cycle remember this is the mainstream media that got caught in thousands of emails from
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:07.920]  msnbc to cnn to newsweek to the daily beast to the daily show having their scripts approved by the
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:13.520]  clinton campaign by the fort foundation and by george soros and now they're sitting around
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:19.680]  attacking us saying we're the fake news when they have the history of lying in polls you name it
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.040]  series of fake news stories and unproven conspiracy theories surrounding hillary clinton
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:30.400]  have persisted on social media since before election day there's so much fake news out there
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:36.320]  the fake news is having such an influence on our lives that today and this is true
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:42.000]  pope trance has said media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.280]  risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement but see cobert thinks
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.800]  you're dumb he thinks you don't know that he got caught working directly with hillary and
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:59.680]  pedesta approving the scripts but it gets worse hillary minions and operatives got caught in
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:06.560]  the wiki leaks creating completely fake news stories and narratives and msnbc and others
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:13.760]  follow their orders to a t fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.320]  audience well this is just the latest episode the damaging influence of fake news a false
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  conspiracy theory with all these conspiracy theories are false about hillary clinton i'm not
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.760]  concerned about the conspiracy theories um there are so many of them i've lost track of them
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:35.120]  and so i pay no attention to them conspiracy theory machine factory do you actually have people
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:44.400]  with college degrees who read these fake news stories and these conspiracy theories
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:50.720]  and then call all of us all of us up is this true and young people is that true now is that
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:57.040]  true you know after about the 20th i'm like no stop part of the reason why we're so susceptible
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.800]  to conspiracy theories right now is that guys like alex jones make a ton of money circulating them as
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:06.880]  widely as they possibly can they use multiple platforms they use talk radio and the internet
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.160]  and they live stream their kind of fake tv shows and they make a very good living doing it when will
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.960]  alex jones lose credibility well there's an audience there's an audience for alex jones
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.720]  alex jones has been around forever i'm assuming he will be around forever usually this kind of
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:26.160]  stuff has no major effect on the united states of america other than lowering our median iq a
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:30.560]  couple of points and making us seem slightly more embarrassing on an international stage right for
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.440]  every additional year and they circulate their insane alien lizard people theories of everything
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.920]  we get a little bit dumber and that's the major effect it has on the united states of america
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:47.840]  but this year is different because this year that little corner that little niche of organized and
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:54.160]  profitable american insanity this year they're out of their corner because this year they're
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.480]  presidential politics he doesn't care that some crazy unstable unhinged person is going to listen
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:06.000]  to his ridiculous garbage show and believe whatever conspiracy theories he's pushing out there and
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:13.360]  go out and actually take action i don't care about his ridiculous rinky dick show or the
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:18.080]  conspiracy theory circle jerk he and his friends engage in on a on a daily basis but what i do
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:23.200]  the democrats calling for is that it literally has an impact on burning down cities leads to people
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:28.560]  getting murdered that's when i she calls me a fat bastard malicious fake news and false propaganda
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:37.040]  that flooded social media over the past year it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:44.640]  world consequences this isn't about politics or partisanship oh no lives are at risk lives of ordinary
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:49.360]  people like in libya trying to go about their days in a failed state jobs contribute to their
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:55.920]  communities it's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly oh it's not hard to stop this

[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:28.080]  red-handed in basically organized fraud racketeering against the american people
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:34.080]  and they turn the whole thing around to quote fake news and how they want to censor the free
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:41.120]  press in this country this is simply amazing as we speak they're trying to line up electors who

[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:55.520]  in domestic propaganda and disinformation over the weekend they passed the countering

[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:29.440]  clinton but the russians somehow hacked in and that's why trump won yes we've gotten trump elected

[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:10.560]  to make people not come to your site look at what facebook's going to put up it's just like the
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.240]  google chrome with the with the professors thing they were putting out a few weeks ago
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:21.520]  you know blocking info wars and it puts up a message disputed by third parties before you

[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:08.560]  the fifties at the height of the cold war there's an article up it's on our website it aggregated
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:14.000]  from zero hedge and it talks about how nbc is reporting the quote new intelligence shows that
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.720]  Putin personally directed how hacked material from the democrats was leaked and otherwise used
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:24.160]  now they cite this intelligence coming from quote diplomatic sources and spies working for us allies
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:30.160]  they go on to say that Putin and the hack that was perpetuated against the dnc involved americans
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:34.880]  believing that their lives under obama and by extension hillary were bad enough and they needed
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:40.880]  to change so hence russia was then involved this ridiculous insinuation is also vastly circulated
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:46.240]  by the new york times which talks about how the fbi and the cia are confirming that latimer
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:50.400]  putin became personally involved in a covert russian campaign to interfere with the u.s

[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:24.880]  from being on facebook and they're going to use politifact that's famously fake they they still
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.280]  say obama care last time i checked was was uh was was free that you know then later they admitted
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:35.360]  it wasn't true uh they said the un isn't involved in our elections i mean they just lie and twist
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.240]  and use other pieces of news as this info they list the washington post as the most trusted

[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:28.720]  will make it easier to report news stories that are fake or misleading they're going to pick on
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:35.520]  their algorithm liberal users you've got to go on in the info war create a fake liberal network
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.520]  i'm telling what you have to do we're going to do this as well as a project we need more crew we
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:44.480]  need more men we need more women we need more fires so we get selected to be part of it so we

[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:10.960]  the fact checker uh at the new york times as a cruel sick joke he's promoted from politico to the
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:21.440]  new york times owned by a mexican kingpin you cannot make it up a company representative told
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:26.960]  business insider that these network would also use signals like algorithms that detect whether a
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:34.160]  story that appears to be fake swing viral yeah like a meme with she lied four died talking about navy
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:39.680]  seals and an army guy just pictures of men can't can't share that determined if it should label

[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:15.600]  in court that something is liable or slander something he's called for that's fine and he's
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:23.200]  going to come out and unfund the cia trying to run this this is crazy there's the deal historically

[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.080]  laying all this out people oh i bet you got sources that's more fake news oh yeah like
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:54.240]  like like the fake news people don't know anything about behind the scenes what's going on
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.240]  i mean if the mainstream media knew who i can talk to who i talked to what i do they would
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:05.040]  crap all over themselves i think they got a good idea this is the last gas to take the country over
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:11.440]  and trump has got to come out and expose it now i'm gonna go to larry nickles who came on yesterday
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:17.040]  and i gotta say he's got a lot of credibility or take him to the end of the hour because larry
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:24.800]  nickles came on yesterday and he said at about 12 30 he said nancy polosi's hopping mad at you i got
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:29.920]  this from sessions guy and they're coming after you they're gonna call for you to be banned and
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.680]  shut down in blacklisted and they're gonna have congressional hearings try to have suits saying
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:37.840]  you're calling for violence and i don't know why polosi's so mad but she's leading the charge then
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.640]  on fox news that night her daughter comes out and says i want her dead and i need to be shut down
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.120]  and then three other channels say i've got to be taken off the year
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:51.360]  let's skip this break because who knows the show even be here soon and by the way a lot of other
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.120]  talk show hosts think oh they'll just go along and tell the line and be left alone that's how
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.080]  they win we've all got to speak out we've all got to say it's wrong or the new fairness doctrine
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.560]  for the internets here which they've called for but notice they always deny it deny it deny it
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.160]  while they organize it because they don't want us to ever organize against it notice they waited
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:14.160]  not on big election not not the day after trying to overthrow the electors or have a recount that
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:19.280]  gave more votes to trump no they waited till christmas now just like the india and all the other
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:25.040]  fevel reserve and the irs all got passed on or before christmas they're all waiting till christmas
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:31.520]  time when you want to sit down and watch a football game and have some turkey i don't blame you go for
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.960]  a hike or go to the movies or go to the church or go hear some christmas carols and they're
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.440]  waiting while you're sitting there trying to enjoy yourself about to ram this through and let me
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:47.680]  explain something being the the spearhead because we work hard we're focused we got great sources
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:52.400]  all the glory goes to jesus christ my personal lord savior and the rest of the credit goes to
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.240]  you the listeners and matt drudge and the patriots and our guests and this great crew
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:01.120]  but let me just tell you something my spirit is i don't like psychopaths and control freaks i don't
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:06.800]  like bullies and i'm i just cannot help but fight them i'm fulfilled don't feel sorry for me feel
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:12.240]  sorry for this country because we tell you being the very first one over the barbed wire is dangerous
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:19.840]  but that's also where destiny lies and vulholla lies i'm here to tell you so i'm fulfilling my
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:25.040]  ancestors destiny through me they're all they're proud lined up with me right now and it's good
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.880]  to be tied into them i live forever in reverse in the present and forward as long as humanity
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:36.640]  isn't destroyed i'm eternal i already live forever and then there's another spiritual domain everything
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:41.040]  with gods and threes and the genetics all of it proves it this is the big secrets it's why they
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:45.280]  hate me this is the secrets they've even sought after i don't even understand them all and the
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:49.360]  point is more of this knowledge is coming into the world the enemy will be broken make no mistake
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:55.600]  the enemy is broken but you have to understand they're dangerous they're horrible they're evil
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:21:00.080]  they could set off nukes to stop trump getting into office they can start a war obama just ordered
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:05.360]  massive trips to flood to the russian border that's in the news today the feds raising rates
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:09.040]  to try to kill the economy because it's starting to grow so fast because of trump they've been
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:16.400]  strangling it themselves consolidating it on purpose it's all happening it's all real they hate
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:20.800]  us because we are the truth we make mistakes yeah like two percent of the time probably
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:23.600]  do they misrepresent what we say and takes us out of context yes
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.640]  because their whole world's ending and i want the traders in the media to know something no
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:38.960]  matter what you do you're you're over mainstream media is over they already plan to use you to discredit
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:43.680]  the press itself because they hated the old press that was not perfect but the endanger the globalist
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:48.160]  now they've used you as their minions to discredit your profession now they hope you'll support the
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:52.400]  end of the free press completely then you'll be shut down and it's going to be press releases out
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:56.720]  of government and corporations with their own press spokespersons that are put out as transcripts
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.720]  and then no one else will be allowed to basically challenge it or they'll be censored with an internet
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:06.560]  id that china's already put in place an internet social networking algorithm remember a year ago
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:14.000]  drudge ran our story that they're going to use a social network uh social score in china where if
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.680]  you criticize the government corporations you get downvoted and soon you can't have a job unless
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:25.760]  that score is at least in the 70s and we said they're going to bring an internet id here for
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:30.560]  taxation control they're going to bring filters in they're going to give your website your facebook
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:36.640]  your page a score they're going to start listing facebook users and twitter users as as not trustworthy
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:42.560]  as bad they're going to make you wear a yellow star like jews in germany or a pink triangle
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:50.000]  but now it's going to be a big f for fake news this is the pure essence of authoritarianism
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  labeling people forcefully with little secret algorithm boards of little hateful
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.880]  lapdog globalists that'll put out lies and they think they're going to beat you just
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:07.440]  like they thought they'd beat trump trump needs to come out against it i'm sure he will strong
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:12.320]  lawsuits need to be filed and all of you now over this christmas holiday need to fight as hard as
[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:17.520]  you can spreading links articles videos i break down of all of this this is the time i told you
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:22.000]  it was coming now you see where are we fake news told you last year they're going to shut down
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.600]  free speech this year try is it happening is that fake no we got too much credibility always said
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.960]  what are they going to do is everything we talk about comes true and our credibility explodes
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:37.120]  that's when the tyranny comes in that's when the shutdown happens but we didn't just lay down and wait
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:43.280]  we affected the battle space larry nickles you said so walk through what you were told by sessions
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:48.640]  guy uh the the to be attorney general who's desperately as you said trying to find out
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:52.480]  how to block them banning free speech ahead of trump getting in obviously they're going to
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:58.720]  shut down speech ahead of trying to overthrow him or kill him now and then pelosi's daughter who's
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:02.000]  i didn't say she's going to kill trump she says i said he's going to you know go after trump i didn't
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:07.360]  say that this is her lies to say i'm victimizing her they her people admit it's a coup but but
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:11.680]  but so that just proves you were dead on with that i talked to some other sources that is the case
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:17.040]  they're seriously crazy enough even though it's not in law to try to go in and put a gag order on
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:23.360]  my free speech outside of even libel suits any of it just a cart blanche european style ban on
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.600]  speech this is really happening so recap what you said yesterday and then let's get into the
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:35.040]  latest information larry nickles former clinton cider you bet alex the uh thing that happened was
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:41.360]  they intend to get two congressmen i don't think they have them yet that are going to
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:51.600]  file lawsuits against you not just for fake news but for invite inciting violence yep inciting
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:59.600]  violence and uh once they filed the suit of course it's going to go to a federal judge
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:05.040]  federal judge that they already have apparently picked out and he will put a gag order on you
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:12.080]  immediately until the case is adjudicated they're coming after you they're coming after
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:22.640]  everybody that is against hillary they are planning alex 100 to take this election back
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.800]  through the electoral college now you've got to understand alex and all of you you've got to
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:37.120]  do if they can stop trump then guess what there's no sessions no jet sessions as attorney general
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:44.480]  then you're back in the mode alex of who are you going to call to stop it imagine this stuff
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:50.640]  that they're bringing forth against you and alredo lynch is the attorney general who are
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:57.600]  you going to fight it with huh who are you going to fight it with how many times have i come on
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:05.120]  this program over the years you have to even kind of throwing up right now but over the years how
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:13.520]  many times have i come on this program and told you absolutely with specificity what was coming
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:22.480]  how many times many times and it comes but you've got to understand folks you don't see one word of
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:29.760]  it in the media and i appreciate you alex pointing out that all of this maneuvering from this electoral
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:37.680]  college isn't it odd that it's going on during christmas when the public guess what genuinely
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:43.440]  interested in something else like when they have their big uh information don'ts when do they do
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:47.600]  them they do them on friday why because they know everybody's in now they're doing over the holiday
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:50.560]  so let's break down the timetable it looks like they're going ahead with this even if trump gets
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:56.320]  in or not he well what do we have to do to counter this because clearly you said you don't i don't
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:01.120]  know what you've done to pelosi but she's insane she's coming after you recap what you were told
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:10.160]  well i was told that she is leading the effort in congress to put you out of business alex it's not
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:18.480]  a joke it's not rumors not fake news she's doing it she's pulling all the strings in congress now
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:24.480]  they've also got willing to accomplish this i found out this morning from the media of course
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:33.600]  and the media is working in concert to bury you they're going to bury you with false articles
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.840]  sure they're demonizing me they're killing me politically before they physically try to shut
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.360]  us down you got it and then you have to understand folks i know you're out there thinking well the
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:49.840]  whole world knows what we're talking about know it doesn't know it doesn't 90% are better of the
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:57.520]  people in america right now get their news on abc nbc and cbs or they just don't even tune into it
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.240]  so so and of course if i'm gonna be shut down i must have done something and then the case is set
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:09.040]  to shut everyone else down where there's smoke people think there must be fire now let's expand
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:17.920]  on this though i've talked to people major media slam you with headlines the people out there bunch
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:23.200]  of them a lot of them think well he must have done something you know alex you must have done
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:28.960]  something or they wouldn't be loading up on you they have no concept that this coup is underway
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.840]  dear god we're about to lose our country well by the way the democrats have now come out and said
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.400]  that it is a coup so now they're admitting they do plan it they want to have an uncloak today
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:44.640]  they've got a bunch of hollywood folks out saying overthrow trump uh they're calling for civil
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.040]  august calling for his death they're calling for banning him off the internet so this is
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:56.240]  insane frothing authoritarianism my sources uh in defense intelligence the cia and the highest
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:03.280]  levels of some other agencies say that if hillary and them try this the gloves come off well now
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:10.000]  now i can't tell you where i got it but once again i just ask you to in a case like this to
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:20.880]  rely on my my history but there are people right now that are coming out and shutting down to
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:31.760]  anyone that will listen that the cia had none no proof of any activity from the russians to be
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.600]  involved the clappers come out lorence had to admit it they're getting their butt handed to
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:40.160]  him right now that's what i'm telling you is they look closely all of them think they're so tough
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:45.680]  they might be able to take me out but man that's it just just everybody knows they see me i'm telling
[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:51.840]  you i'm seen as the trigger we'll be right back stay there larry we're on the march the empires on
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:30:02.240]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network one can argue that there's a war on christian
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:08.000]  unity specifically in western europe as a clash of cultures is underway heat street has a report
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:14.080]  that says that 50 christian statues in one area were defaced smashed or decapitated in germany
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:19.360]  now this area the crime wave began on december the eighth and in particular one roadside statue of
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:24.640]  jesus on the cross had his face smashed and his right arm broken off and police in the area are
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:29.920]  saying that the suspect most likely has a religious background and the crime was committed because of
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.640]  their hatred towards christianity he goes on to say quote based on the intensity of the acts of
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:39.280]  the perpetrator one can conclude that this act has a religious background of course he's talking
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:44.160]  about without naming names the fact that somebody that hates christianity would go out and begin
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:49.360]  smashing statues of christ and other christian figures is most likely of a different culture
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:54.560]  and faith yeah no kidding never more evident there is a war on christianity in western europe

[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:09.280]  fall like every other piece of crap like you before we're hitting the bottom folks we're coming to
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:13.920]  the bottom of the cycle right now there's a long way up now and it's going to get good good for our
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:19.920]  children good for our grandchildren good in the eyes of god there's a lot coming people paid for
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:24.800]  everything we got now i'm more than willing to pay for those in the future because they are me

[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:40.880]  they carry the fire of our species you can't kill me the globalists want to kill the species
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:45.360]  and mutate the species and kill the planet that's why they're evil that's what you should fear
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:49.360]  they come to kill our very genetics
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:58.400]  they're a disease poured out by the fallen one fallen to this planet to bring us down
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:02.960]  can you see what's hiding in plain view in front of your eyeballs but our species can beat it
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.240]  because for the evil to bring us down it has to build a technology that we're able to build that
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:16.560]  it can't and we could take that technology back at any time

[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.640]  and demonizing you in preparation to silence you every trader every piece of garbage like
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:30.880]  sinker the young turk commander who denies it was an Armenian genocide what's he calls himself a
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:38.160]  young turk what's that tell you i mean they're all on there folks saying shut me up shut me down
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:44.080]  in a lion because they can't compete because we're busting them up
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:48.400]  trump gets an office he's got to reverse this attack on free speech
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:55.520]  uh we defend the second we defend the fourth the tenth all of them the number one baby the big one
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:00.560]  he is under attack right now all right larry thanks for holding while i broke that down go
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:04.240]  ahead and go through this i got a bunch of headlines i want to cover a bit but but bottom line
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:12.000]  i got what's the time frame flash news flash between now and end of the year i got a news flash
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:21.600]  the house and the senate under democratic leadership are submitting a bill that they're
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:27.280]  trying to push through with the help of i don't know who they are high ups in the republican
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:37.520]  parties what i was told and they are calling for essentially a 501c3 type approach to alternative
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:44.880]  news on the internet now they feel like the 501c3 has done an excellent job of shutting down churches
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:53.680]  being able to talk about politics from the church and they want that legislation brought
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:58.640]  through to shut alternative news when they say that they basically mean you and drudge
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:07.360]  it's news licensing now the other thing and i talked to a very high up general what's his name
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:14.320]  that was high up in the invasion of iran and he thinks trump may have actually gotten to
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:23.200]  the military in a cool way he said in that by trump picking the generals that he has for
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:31.440]  the leadership roles in his cabinet the military have turned 100 percent against the joint chiefs
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:39.120]  and this is significant alex because this means that we may have just what you were saying earlier
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:46.880]  we may have the force down below the joint chiefs that they're not going to go along
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:53.920]  with all of these illegal orders that are being passed down and will be passed down in the very
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:42:01.600]  coming future so yeah there's resistance building the thing i fear and i do fear it
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:09.760]  is what happens what happens if they are successful and flip in this election and giving it to illy
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:18.000]  you know i worry about your audience about this movement that was behind trump you know
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:26.080]  the american people the average american has been pushed into a box and when they see it stolen
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:31.920]  right out from under us there's going to be no doubt anymore alex it's not going to be secret
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:37.440]  it's not going to be cute it's not going to be hidden from the public the public's going to see
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:44.720]  through this what's going to happen you know that scares me and they're prepared of course
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:52.160]  with the fema provisional government plan they're fair they're ready for what provisional
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:58.320]  government what's called martial law they're ready for anarchy and they believe it to come
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:09.120]  so i ask everybody dear god in heaven please you spread the word about this electoral college
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:17.280]  flip now it's just what you've done talking about it last night i hear hannity talking about it
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:23.360]  he wouldn't have talked about it until you had brought it out but the more people know
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:29.680]  that they're trying this the more pressure believe it or not that it's put on these electors
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.840]  but these these electors they're their citizens they've got to live in the communities where they
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.400]  live they've got and they're being death-threaded by the democrats right now and accuse us of that
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:49.840]  yes it's not us it's not our side i can't find one case anywhere or anyone trying to get them to
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:55.760]  just hold the line and vote for the way the people voted nowhere do you see any death threats
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.880]  they're coming en masse from the democrats they're coming from the liberals that are just screaming
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:08.960]  bloody murder trying to force them alex if we spread the word if people know about it i know
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:15.280]  y'all think well golly what good will that do you have no idea what good it does you saw what you
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:19.440]  did elect and trump that's why the enemy's so scared they know we've almost beaten them that's
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:26.080]  right and these people are maggots alex they're maggots and you know maggots don't like the light
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:34.160]  they cannot stand the light let me give you an example just real briefly i have talked to a couple
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:42.160]  out in california they're in aircraft revision of the allison engine they're up against because
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:46.240]  they're up against losing their business let me tell you why because hillary and bill
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:53.360]  hill made a deal with ross perot jr the ross perot family yes they're still around
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:45:00.720]  and he's been able out in california to vary by airport for a dollar one dollar alex get the
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.760]  federal government to shut them down and then he buys them for one for one dollar to be able
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.680]  to bring in his development of his housing additions and folksy that's what they're doing
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:18.320]  that's how they've achieved all this power they have sold they have sold our property they have
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:25.440]  sold our rights and if you don't want that to continue right now it's that couple in california
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:34.800]  bless their hearts but tomorrow it could be all of you again you have to strip hillary of the power
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.160]  to sell well let me bring this up to you and then i want to go over some really key information
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:45.920]  larry nickles former clinton top insider looking at them and what they're doing and knowing how they
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:50.640]  operate behind the scenes they seem panicked but i know they have a plan but the recount didn't work
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.480]  now they're really you know on the back of their heels with the electors but they're moving forward
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:02.880]  they're getting called out what else will they try and is obama in on it with them absolutely
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:11.120]  absolutely the white house is knee deep in all of this obama knows don't doubt folks and obama
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:20.960]  doesn't know that russia has absolutely had nothing nothing to do with the election now today i just
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:29.040]  saw it on the screen the white house denies the cia being able to tell congress and show them
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:36.720]  any proof for evidence whether it did or did not exist the white house suppressing this information
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:41.040]  from getting out so don't tell me they're not sure but what does it signify that clapper and
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.560]  all these other even established people like lynch have come out and said today and yesterday
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:50.240]  look russia didn't hack us this isn't true i mean i guess they're covering their butt because they
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:57.280]  know this is fake i talked to several sources and some other sources uh yesterday and over the weekend
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:02.080]  last week they said this is all pure bull it's totally made up and we're on record saying that
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:08.720]  last week before this all came out alex the reason some of these people are breaking now is because
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:16.400]  they know one thing that i know that i told you yesterday you let jeff sessions get in as attorney
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:23.840]  general you let donald trump get in as president and all of this is going to come to the forefront
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:27.360]  it is going to come out and he knows he's going to war that's why he's putting all these generals
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:34.400]  and people that'll follow orders that and all of these people know that there's going to be a day
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:41.200]  coming coming to jesus day and there's going to be criminal charges prosecuted against a whole lot
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:48.000]  of people alex for trying to overthrow the american election they're trying to overthrow it and they're
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:55.200]  using every legal and illegal means possible and so yeah you know clapper lynch and those people
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:00.240]  they got to get cover they got to get cover or they're going to be knee deep in a by the way
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.120]  lynch and clapper and all of them i've watched them a lot they look like they're scared you bet they
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.760]  better be they better be because they're in the middle of something that you know what they're
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.080]  not confident anymore alex that it's going to work buddy they're not so sure anymore that whatever
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:23.200]  this cabal decides to do is just going to happen now because i'm trying but but polosi and hillary
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:29.280]  and soros look completely insane when i see them and they think they're invincible alex you can't
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:37.840]  believe for one second that the largest criminal enterprise in the history of the world is going
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:44.560]  to just lay down because of that election and walk away forever you can't believe that you've got to
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:50.720]  know that these people are willing to go to the extreme they'll go to the end of the world
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:59.920]  to complete their agenda buddy and you better listen all of you they're not through i know and

[02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:30.320]  that i haven't done yet of a simple rendition of how the world really works with news versus
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:35.120]  fake news the real paradigm from my perspective we all see through rose color the dark lease
[02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:39.680]  but look at this article in four words dot com there were no russians wiki leaks operative
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:45.120]  claims clinton emails handed over by disgusted democrat whistleblowers one of them got four
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:50.720]  bullets in the back then we have intelligence chiefs coming out and saying that judges saying that
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:56.080]  british ambassador says he met with the person that leaked it but no no it's the russians
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.160]  and like i tweeted yesterday on real elix jones and then and the memes everywhere we've gone out
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:08.400]  for man on the street interviews uh in colorado and in texas and in california no one's buying
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:12.320]  russians did it it's all a big joke everywhere on the internet's a meme you know the russians
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:17.600]  ate my homework uh the light turned red because of the russians uh just you know i've i've got
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:24.480]  not you know a cough because of the russians but here's hillary classic borderline personality
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:28.880]  disorder is what i'd say she's got a little bit of psychotic behavior as well here's here here's
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:34.160]  hillary clinton it's everybody's fault but her you have you have seizures you have a brain tumor
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:41.120]  you can hardly walk half the time crazy woman stop trying to cling to power criminal so here is hillary
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:49.200]  clinton uh blaming everybody but herself why did hillary clinton lose um there is many answers
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:52.880]  to that question is there are people in this country what is this electoral college and how
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:57.200]  does the person who came in second win the presidency we should get rid of the electoral
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:01.040]  college altogether it's completely unfair want to get rid of electoral college just count the
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:08.000]  votes it's ridiculous do you believe russian hacking could actually change the outcome yes russian
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.600]  hacking was part of an effort to defeat hillary clinton did russian hacking helped sway the election
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:19.600]  for donald trump clinton blaved the head of the fbi james combi for stopping her momentum there were
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:23.600]  a number of reasons for this but uh lead among them in my view would be that letter from director
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:31.520]  combi the calling helps trump so-called fake news can have real-world consequences the rash of fake
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.800]  news stories on people's timelines influenced the election presidential campaign that won the
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:44.080]  electoral college fueled by fake news the electoral college russian hacking combi fake news the electoral

[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:06.720]  hacking. Comey. Fake news. The electoral college. Russian hack. Jim Comey. Fake news.
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:12.400]  Not arrogance, not corruption. Not that we're sick of both parties. And it just goes on
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:17.800]  and on. That's up on info wars.com. We should tweet that out. I got to a lot of the news
[02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:21.480]  today. I want to come back and I guess hit this graph I've got that I guess Buckley
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:25.840]  put together with the rabbits folks. And it's pretty simple. It doesn't have all representations
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:29.600]  there all the different media outlets. It just gives you an idea snapshot. I pretty much
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:35.720]  agree with how it's spread out and how it's set up. That's rolling that daily like almost
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:41.480]  over in the best column. I put them in the best column. Again, that's going on. We're
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:45.360]  going to show you this for TV viewers and subscribers radio listeners when we come back and also
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:49.320]  have a graph here somewhere was an article for info wars where we actually posted it.
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.880]  I'm going to retweet that out because I never got to this on air yesterday. It wasn't ready
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:59.920]  till the very end of the show. But look, here's the deal. This is all up to you. If you want
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:03.720]  to lose the first amendment, that means the second. That means be slaves to the globalist
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:06.840]  that literally have it out for the American people in their own words. It's in the wiki
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:13.640]  leagues. Then don't get involved. Don't speak up. Don't defend the second amendment, the
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:19.400]  first amendment, the fourth and fifth. But the first is very popular even with the real
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:25.200]  liberals at the guardian and places like Rolling Stone have come out. So this is horrible.
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:29.720]  Well, it's been done. Facebook's come out and said they're going to have snopes run
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:34.240]  everything and basically ban info wars. So and then next they're going to shut our site
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:38.480]  down itself. This is how they do it. This is a big deal. Spread our links. They hate
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:43.600]  it. It's caught the nails politically to them info wars.com, present planet.com. It's
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:48.080]  news wars. We're in the middle of news wars. Radio network. We're defeating them with competition.
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:53.120]  They want to turn the board over. We have the new product and enforce life dot com bio
[02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:58.640]  true selenium. We've had so many requests over the years for selenium. And just recently
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:05.280]  we were able to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:10.040]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:15.640]  body. It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify selenium is another one
[02:59:15.640 --> 02:59:20.440]  of those absolute must haves. The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid
[02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:25.120]  gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes
[02:59:25.120 --> 02:59:32.520]  in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium. So it really is a all around nutrient
[02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:38.320]  that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking bio true selenium
[02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:41.800]  is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best
[02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:46.200]  out there at a very, very low price exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by calling
[02:59:46.200 --> 02:59:53.800]  toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine. You're listening to the Alex
[02:59:53.800 --> 03:00:11.320]  Jones show. We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:20.600]  network. You know, we engage maybe 2% of the time in satire. Maybe once a month, twice
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:26.000]  a month, we do a satire video or make fun of political correctness. You name it. We always
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.480]  tell you it's satire. It's clearly satire. What MSM does is they take a lot of those
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:33.200]  and they put them on channels and say it's real and that we're we're insane. I'm going
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:39.280]  to keep doing satire sometimes because it's fun. People like it. I like it. It's gallows
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:42.760]  humor. We've got some really hilarious satire. It's a couple of minutes long at the start
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:46.600]  of the next segment. I won't be there. And then coming in Mr. Rappaport from no more
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:51.200]  fake news.com. That's the name of his domain for at least 15 years that I know of. No more
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:57.000]  fake news.com. So he can tell you what the fake news is, but but notice business insider
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:02.360]  isn't going to him that has a site called no more fake news.com. He's been an investigative
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:07.440]  journalist or some of the biggest, you know, TV and newspapers out there as an investigator
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:12.760]  and as a bestselling author. No, no, no, you don't go to him. No, no, no. It's mainstream
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:17.240]  media. It never lies. Facebook is going to use snubs and other fact checkers to combat
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:23.920]  fake news. It says to quote, bury news that they say is fake. Block it. And it's already
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:28.080]  what Google Chrome's doing and they have bots running around saying, I'm making this up
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:34.120]  and that's fake news. No one's trying to censor me, which is a military system where they're
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:39.440]  doing it or the tanks ramming into the Waco church saying this is not an assault while
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:46.720]  soldiers shoot the people inside under orders from Janet Reno. Or they say, Obamacare is
[03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:52.560]  free. No, it's not. Shut up racist. You're fake news. Now I put this together with Buckley
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:57.720]  in the graphics crew yesterday. First off, here's the fake one that they floated out
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:01.000]  the Washington Post. Nobody ever says where they get these lists because they don't want
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:07.480]  to get sued. But it's got info wars down here as conservative and his quote utter garbage.
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:16.600]  Totally fake. We are the worst. Next is hyperpartisan conservative questionable journalistic value.
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:21.680]  The blaze and red stator in that crossing over from that to skewed conservative but still
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:28.640]  reputable Fox News. The Hill all this. That's why they had a coup at Fox and I've got inside
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:33.240]  Intel on that. I haven't really given you yet about how Megan Kelly was paid $6 million
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:39.600]  to basically say that ales went after that whole coup. Got the financial times and then
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:46.680]  over it says mainstream minimum partisan bias and trustworthy. And they say Washington
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:53.640]  Post, New York Times, NPR, the worst, the worst. So they're slick and smooth when they
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:56.680]  rape your rights, but they are the biggest liars. They're the most trustworthy. Then
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:01.400]  you've got the left over here and they're hard to list anybody. They put natural news
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.120]  on the left. I wouldn't call them left and occupied Democrats and groups that don't really
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:10.080]  control over here. So here's the real one. We're going to retweet out the article that
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:13.960]  was posted yesterday about this or get the exact title of it. Can you guys try to pull
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:18.920]  it up? I think it's like a graph of, you know, real fake news put out or something like
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:23.680]  that. And then look, here it is printed up big. I'll shoot a special video about this
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:29.120]  for the mountain news. And you've got tyranny over here and state run corporate influences.
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:35.400]  Okay. On this side. And so the most corporate, most state run are CNN, NPR, MSNBC, media
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:42.440]  matters, ABC, time, New York times, Politico, all those guys going up to independent. So
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:45.400]  I guess you can say the young Turks are a little bit independent. They're funded by
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:48.720]  the Arabs and Soros. I don't know if that's actually completely accurate. The point is
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:51.840]  they're not as bad as some of these. So, you know, they're independent, but they're left
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:56.040]  as, but, but, but not completely. Daily cost is kind of in the middle, Bloomberg and all
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.400]  the rest of it over here, Newsweek, you know, there's still state status, everything, but
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:03.160]  they're over here. Vice and stuff's more in the middle. I think that's kind of accurate.
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:07.040]  I wouldn't say Reuters is, we probably change this up, but it's not perfect. The intercepts
[03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:10.280]  kind of in the middle. I think that's accurate. Rolling Stone is they've done some good work,
[03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:13.960]  a lot of bad work. LA times had a little bit fairer polls, not quite a state run. They're
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:17.400]  still calling for killing Trump. We're all net dailies over here with folks in the new
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:22.880]  America and the Daily Caller and others like Breitbart as being the most accurate with
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:26.880]  info wars and prison planet. That's, that's, that's what we just kind of reverse their
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:31.080]  graph. That's why it's not, you know, perfect in my mind, but all this is just a way to
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:34.160]  illustrate things. We don't claim this is perfect. We don't claim this is the end all
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:38.880]  be all. We're going to ban sites because it's on this graph and that we're God. This is
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:42.680]  just our opinion, our view. They're using these lists created by a woman with a cat in
[03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:45.800]  an apartment. I don't know why it's like old people. They use it like a woman with a cat.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:49.200]  Like that's the magic proof. I'm not joking. To just say, you're banned. You're off the
[03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:54.360]  web. You're bankrupt. You're living in a ditch. Your speech is stolen because we're liberal.
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:05:00.440]  So coming up a very special piece. Well, they've got the proof on me. All right, listen to
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:04.920]  the mainstream media. You would think that we're engaged in covert ops in the fifties
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:08.600]  at the height of the Cold War. There's an article up. It's on our website. It aggregated
[03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:13.920]  from zero hedge and it talks about how NBC is reporting the quote. New intelligence shows
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:17.920]  that Putin personally directed how hacked material from the Democrats was leaked and
[03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:22.800]  otherwise used. Now they cite this intelligence coming from quote diplomatic sources and spies
[03:05:22.800 --> 03:05:27.280]  working for U.S. allies. They go on to say that Putin and the hack that was perpetuated
[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:32.960]  against the DNC involved Americans believing that their lives under Obama and by extension
[03:05:32.960 --> 03:05:37.760]  Hillary were bad enough and they needed to change. So hence Russia was then involved.
[03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:42.360]  This ridiculous insinuation is also vastly circulated by the New York Times, which talks
[03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:47.920]  about how the FBI and the CIA are confirming that Vladimir Putin became personally involved
[03:05:47.920 --> 03:05:51.880]  in a covert Russian campaign to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. I cannot
[03:05:51.880 --> 03:05:56.000]  make this up. These ridiculous claims are believed by the people reporting them in the
[03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:59.480]  mainstream media. I'm Margaret Howe reporting for info wars dot com.
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:06.240]  You ever wonder what happened to America because of what we did on this day? Change has come
[03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:11.440]  to America. Something's wrong and we all know it. I'm sure that Daniels and I'm here to
[03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:15.120]  tell you about it. The nation has been hijacked by international
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:22.320]  forces bent on global governance. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:30.880]  heritage, mom and apple pie. God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:30.880 --> 03:06:36.560]  Revelation dawn of global government. We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:07:02.000]  to it than that. I'm very proud to announce the introduction
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:08.960]  of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic. We wanted to come out with the

[03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:41.080]  been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market. Secure your biome

[03:08:13.200 --> 03:08:22.200]  to fight. You better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war. It's
[03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:51.760]  Alex Jones. Activate comrade Jones phase two. Yes, understand the, the, so we just
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:09:03.520]  got locked. This morning, the Washington post reporting that a secret CIA report found Russia
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:09.880]  interfered in the US election to help Donald Trump win the White House. We are at war with
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:15.840]  Russia. Greg Russian cyber spying on the United States is not anything new or anything unknown,
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:22.280]  but it seems that this takes it to an unprecedented level. It's been a cozy relationship from
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:28.840]  the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed. I hope. And I think
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:34.160]  we'll be speaking a lot with Donald Trump and Alex Jones nation and all of our freedoms
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:38.240]  hang by a thread. And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:55.000]  to scum. We're beholden to scum. Russian scum. You got all that?
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:10.920]  I was in there. They're checking in the dark. Oh, my, my police guy. Activate program.
[03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:23.840]  This is very important. So well, the first part of our mission is accomplished. Mr. Trump
[03:10:23.840 --> 03:10:29.320]  is in the office soon. We have to build the wall. We have to bring the jobs back. We have
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:34.600]  to build the economy and family. Yes, defeat the Americans. Defeat the Americans. Stop
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:38.920]  the tranny bathrooms. Yes. Yes, Mr. Jones. Oh, no, no, let me tell you some of it is
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:45.720]  good, some bad. They loved Hillary so beautiful and pure. And we turned, we turned, we turned
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:50.840]  them from the beautiful angel to the devil. I, I, I'm sorry. I was in America. I learned
[03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:55.880]  that Hillary was good. No, we have to continue to do our mission. But comrades, he will get
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:11:01.160]  angry. They learned that our top agent is Tucker Carlson, the congressman, the congressman
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:06.880]  on TV on the Fox News Exposes. We're carrying water for the Kremlin. We're not carrying
[03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:10.040]  water for the Kremlin. You're making, look, you're a sitting member of Congress on the
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:13.920]  Intel Committee and you can't say they hacked. You're gonna, you're gonna have to move your
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:19.600]  shoulder to R.T. Russian television because this is perfect. That's so beneath your office
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:23.520]  because it's so dumb and you're being duplicitous. Our programs are moving forward to cut the
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:28.640]  taxes and to allow the Americans to breathe again. And the program is working to contain
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:33.600]  the collapse of the United States. So does not fall to globalism. And the report is continuing
[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:39.840]  to not fund radical jihadis and other evils. And the report is continuing to let the families
[03:11:39.840 --> 03:11:44.400]  actually raise their children and not give them the vaccines and lower their IQ. We
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:50.200]  are destroying America as a land. We are doing well. And it's wrong because Hillary is an
[03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:57.040]  angel. It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones. I don't know
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:04.040]  what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be. I began to realize that
[03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:10.760]  she is an angel and she wants to help me. No, no, you've got to be sent for reprogramming.
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:17.760]  Hillary, no. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming.
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:23.760]  All right. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming. No reprogramming.
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:30.760]  Russian scum.
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:53.280]  Russian scum. That's the story. That is the lead story. And Vladimir Putin is the secret
[03:12:53.280 --> 03:13:02.560]  president of the United States, right? Obviously. I mean, that's where all this is going, right?
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:09.760]  Trump is just the cutout. Putin is the president of the United States. This is what we're being
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:16.120]  told, basically. Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And Alex mentioned in the last segment that
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:22.920]  my website, nomorefakenews.com, has been around for 15 years now. So I had a little
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:28.040]  clue at the beginning because I was already working as a reporter for 19 years when I
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:37.520]  started the website. And I had already noticed much fake news coming from the mainstream
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:46.160]  media. That's why I gave the site that name. So now all the chicky-doos are coming home
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:55.000]  to roost. For example, let's look at this here. WikiLeaks, Envoy Craig Murray, former
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:04.720]  British ambassador to Uzbekistan, told Daily Mail that he flew to Washington, D.C. to pick
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:15.280]  up the handoff of the Clinton campaign email leaks in September. And that the source, according
[03:14:15.280 --> 03:14:24.680]  to Murray, had legal access to the information, right? Not Russian hacks. None of this was
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:31.120]  Russian hacks, Murray says. What does that mean? The source had legal access to the information.
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:37.800]  It means somebody inside the Clinton campaign decided that it would be fun for once to tell
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:48.400]  the truth. In an overwhelming tonnage of email release, and so they passed along these emails,
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:57.440]  they leaked it to WikiLeaks who leaked it again. That's what happened. Not the Russians, not
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:06.120]  Putin, not any of these people. Nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with that at all.
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:13.960]  I wrote a piece the other day about the electoral college people who are demanding a briefing
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:17.960]  from the CIA. What do they think they're going to get? I mean, even if they had a point,
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:21.560]  which they don't, what do they think they're going to get? They're going to get a CIA guy
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:30.960]  who stands up there and says, we have evidence that the Russians hacked the election and
[03:15:30.960 --> 03:15:37.960]  gave it to Donald Trump. Then if any of these electors would be so bold as to say, could
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:46.840]  you show us the evidence? Would you like to present us with the evidence? Well, we can't
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:50.920]  do that because that could compromise methods and personnel and so forth and so on, but
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:57.240]  you could trust us because we're eminently believable and we know at the CIA what's what
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:04.600]  and we can assure you that the Russians were in this. That's what they would get. That's
[03:16:04.600 --> 03:16:13.280]  what members of Congress got. That's all they're getting. They're not getting anything else.
[03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:24.840]  So if the CIA and the CIA connected Washington Post, whose owner, Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon,
[03:16:24.840 --> 03:16:31.560]  who has a $600 million contract with the CIA to provide cloud computing services, ding
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:41.480]  ding, remember that, if these people really think they can convince the American people,
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:51.240]  which they're not doing, that Russia and particularly Putin just took over the US election and basically
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:56.440]  handed it to Trump, it stands to the reason they would have to come up with something
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:17:06.520]  specific, something objective. Some evidence, it's called evidence, folks. The factoids
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:11.480]  that you assemble and you put out there that are visible to everybody, they're not going
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:20.880]  to compromise anybody. This is not CIA data anyway. This would be if it existed NSA data
[03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:28.360]  that the CIA is fronting for. So if they've got the proof in the evidence, let's see it.
[03:17:28.360 --> 03:17:34.200]  Let us see it. Otherwise, forget about it. Nobody believes you anyway. Here's what you
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:39.680]  could believe though. I want to jump in right now with the commercial because it's Christmas

[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:08.280]  I don't talk about this in the film social network, of course. You should look at the

[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:27.600]  I predicted at the very beginning that what was going to happen was it would go down and
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:31.760]  discourage the people who had invested. Oh, my God, what's happening? What's happening?
[03:19:31.760 --> 03:19:35.600]  And it would stay there and stay there and stay there. And that's what it did. Started
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:20:00.440]  in at about 40, went way down and then went way up and we will be back. Don't go anywhere.

[03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:14.720]  John Rappaport back sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour here talking about Facebook
[03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:21.920]  before the break. So their stock price after plummeting at the very beginning when they
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:28.000]  went public discouraging all kinds of people who sold and then the insiders bought up and
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  then you look at that stock price. Wow. It just goes up and up and up. Yep. Let's see.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:45.160]  About 120, 125 now. Yeah. It's doing quite well. Quite well. If we look at the max, you'll
[03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:51.440]  see if you go to click on max. Yeah, that's the one. I'm looking at the screen now. If
[03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:56.200]  you're watching, you see it started off just a little bit when they released it under 50,
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.800]  went down, stayed down, stayed down, stayed down through most of 2013, then comes the
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:11.120]  march, the upward march. Boy, making a lot of money, some of the insiders. So they're
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:20.440]  now going to use Snopes. That's right. Snopes, a guy and his wife in the kitchen or in the
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:27.200]  bathroom or on the back porch, I don't know, to decide what's fake news. And then they're
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:34.080]  going to bury it. They're going to bury it down in their news feed because Facebook now
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:43.120]  is a big news operation. Yeah. Or they're going to eliminate it entirely. And they will
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:52.000]  have little algorithms and little robots running around and little whatever and decide if we
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:57.360]  don't like it, it's fake news. If we think it's against the establishment, it's fake
[03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:05.600]  news. If it criticizes the globalist, it's fake news. If it talks about freedom of the
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:19.880]  individual, liberty, very dangerous stuff about America being a nation, much less a sovereign
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:24.920]  nation. Oh, that's bad news. That's got to be fake. That's worse than fake. Let's bury
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:30.520]  it way down. Let's eliminate it all. That's what Facebook is going for. That's what they're
[03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:36.120]  doing. And they're being prompted to do it by major media. I mean, like the Washington
[03:26:36.120 --> 03:26:42.320]  Post, New York Times, CBS, NBC, those people, they're appealing to the social media like
[03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:50.040]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and so forth, Instagram. Why? Because social media are getting titanic
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:57.480]  numbers of hits and views way more than major media. They're running the show now. So major
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:02.640]  media is crawling up to them on their hands and knees to help us eliminate fake news.
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:07.360]  We took such a bad hit during the election. We look terrible now and we're suffering in
[03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:14.200]  great pain and we're shocked and embarrassed and humiliated. Wolf Blitzer almost swallowed
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:19.520]  his tongue on national television when he had to announce that Trump was the winner.
[03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:27.760]  It was tragic. It was desperate and tragic. Help us out. Help us bury fake news wherever
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:35.680]  it may be. And at all, do you think anything like this would have happened if Hillary Clinton
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:42.040]  had been anointed president? Of course not. There would have been no fake news. What fake
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:49.040]  news? We don't care about fake news. The waters are calm and placid now, say the major media
[03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:59.040]  because our lady of the lake has won the presidency and all is well and all is smooth and peaceful
[03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:06.640]  and the world is safe again from this monster and his Russian boss who attempted to steal
[03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:15.320]  it all and everything is fine. Everything is calm. But that didn't happen. Oh, oops.
[03:28:15.320 --> 03:28:23.480]  That's not what happened. A horrible thing instead happened. Major media were caught
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:31.800]  with their pants down and it was not a pretty sight. It was shocking. Shocking, I say. And
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:38.520]  therefore they had to blame somebody. So they blamed everybody that isn't them. That's basically
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:45.120]  what they're doing. If you're not us or with us all the way, then you're the bad guys.
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:51.160]  We're going to bury you because you were the fake news people. Well, I can tell you and
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:29:00.200]  I keep saying this because I've been in the biz since 1982. The fake news is coming from
[03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:08.360]  the major media. It has always come from major media. They invented fake news. It was present
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:13.320]  going back all the way into the dawn of human history. From the first time, the first leader
[03:29:13.320 --> 03:29:23.200]  said, I think we need UNIX, boys. That's who we need is UNIX. These will be the trusted
[03:29:23.200 --> 03:29:32.760]  people, the Kastrati. No desires of their own. They serve me, the esteemed August leader.
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:40.000]  They will spread my news to the people. Of course, it will all be fake, but it's mine.
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:47.120]  So therefore it's not fake if you catch my drift, my logic. And from then on, all the
[03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:55.000]  way up until now. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:30:03.840]  Radio Network. One can argue that there is a war on Christianity, specifically in Western
[03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:09.440]  Europe as a clash of cultures is underway. Heat Street has a report that says that 50
[03:30:09.440 --> 03:30:15.120]  Russian statues in one area were defaced, smashed, or decapitated in Germany. Now this area,
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:19.760]  the crime rate began on December the 8th, and in particular one roadside statue of Jesus
[03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:24.280]  on the cross had his face smashed and his right arm broken off. And police in the area
[03:30:24.280 --> 03:30:29.360]  are saying that the suspect most likely has a religious background and the crime was committed
[03:30:29.360 --> 03:30:34.000]  because of their hatred towards Christianity. He goes on to say, quote, based on the intensity
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:38.440]  of the acts of the perpetrator, one can conclude that this act has a religious background.
[03:30:38.440 --> 03:30:42.960]  Of course, he's talking about without naming names, the fact that somebody that hates Christianity
[03:30:42.960 --> 03:30:47.360]  would go out and begin smashing statues of Christ and other Christian figures is most
[03:30:47.360 --> 03:30:51.920]  likely of a different culture and faith. Yeah, no kidding. Never more evident. There is a
[03:30:51.920 --> 03:30:56.720]  war on Christianity in Western Europe. I'm Margaret Hale reporting for info wars dot

[03:33:23.880 --> 03:33:30.320]  sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour before the break. I was basically heading up to the
[03:33:30.320 --> 03:33:38.160]  very simple equation. Mainstream news equals fake news. That's the story in a nutshell.
[03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:46.640]  That's what they're trying to avoid that everybody is going to discover that everybody is going
[03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:53.920]  to figure it out. We're well on the way. We are replacing mainstream news. They are in
[03:33:53.920 --> 03:34:03.560]  the twilight. That's their twilight saga fading away as independent news takes center stage.
[03:34:03.560 --> 03:34:09.880]  That is what's happening. So they're trying to avoid that anyway they can. I've seen them
[03:34:09.880 --> 03:34:15.240]  do this before not with a concentrated force they're attempting to use now but they're
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:22.320]  going to fail. They're already failing. It's ridiculous. It's a joke. Putin won the election
[03:34:22.320 --> 03:34:28.280]  it was Putin. The CIA says so. Well we all know the CIA can be trusted. I mean we've
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:33.880]  always trusted them. Isn't that what the left has been saying forever that you can trust
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:42.920]  the CIA. No. Oh wait a minute. Oh going back to the 1950s and 60s and all the way up until
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:48.920]  the election it was the political left that was saying the CIA are nothing but a bunch
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:57.120]  of liars and criminals that can never be trusted. Oh yes that's right. But then all of a sudden
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:06.760]  after they lost the election and we're so so depressed by it they suddenly said we can
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:15.040]  believe the CIA. Everybody can believe the CIA when they say something as outrageous
[03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:21.480]  as well. Putin hacked the election. Yeah sure. We know that. Yeah. Yeah. Russian Putin
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:26.040]  Trump they're all in bed together. Yeah we understand that. Sure of course. We've got
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:35.080]  the evidence. We can't show it to you because oh you know super secret but trust us we know.
[03:35:35.080 --> 03:35:45.600]  And all of a sudden the left the left are holding up the CIA as an example of American
[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:59.160]  purity. Yes indeed he do. Yes indeed he do. I love it. Okay. Don't forget. At InfoWarsLife.com

[03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:55.240]  to the state of California. This may take up the rest of the hour and believe me you're
[03:36:55.240 --> 03:36:59.080]  going to want to hear about it because I've got some information here that you haven't
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:09.720]  gotten anywhere else. We're talking about a Senate bill SB 18. And it's in progress.
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:15.680]  This is not just about California. This is about the world. California is the laboratory
[03:37:15.680 --> 03:37:23.040]  where it's happening. This is a bill that's introduced to basically replace parenting
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:29.960]  with the state. Sacrificing children to the state. A bill introduced by the notorious
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:39.440]  Richard Pan who is behind SB 277 mandatory vaccinations for school children in California.
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:46.040]  So I want to just give you a little bit of the flavor of this SB 18. I'm not going to
[03:37:46.040 --> 03:37:53.920]  put you to sleep with this because I could easily do it. I call it swamp gas. All children
[03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:59.600]  regardless of gender class race and ethnicity, national or as in culture, religion, immigration
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:07.320]  status, regardless sexual orientation or ability have inherent rights that entitle them to
[03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:12.920]  protection special care and assistance including but not limited to the following. The right
[03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:18.840]  to parents, guardians or caregivers who act in their best interests, form healthy attachments
[03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:24.520]  with adults responsible for their care, safe and healthy environment, social and emotional
[03:38:24.520 --> 03:38:30.640]  well-being. Wow, you're waving a wand. This is all just going to happen, right? Attain
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:39.040]  optimal cognitive, physical and social development and so on and so forth. Quality health care.
[03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:45.600]  Now notice there are no definitions in this bill of any of this stuff. It's all swamp
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:53.800]  gas but later if this bill passes and please understand this because this is how government
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:39:00.600]  works. They have regulatory agencies, you know, like the CDC and the FDA and all of these
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:07.320]  and each state has their own agencies. They fill in the blanks. They put in the specifics
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:14.200]  after the law is passed and signed. So this could mean in California that kids will be
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:18.480]  forced to take psychiatric drugs whether they want to or not, whether their parents
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:24.960]  want them to or not or you have to eat a certain kind of diet or you can't go to McDonald's
[03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:34.400]  or even if you want to. Wow. Who knows because the state is taking over. It's their job now
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:42.000]  according to this bill to completely supersede parents in guaranteeing all of these things
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:47.680]  to children, any children as long as they're in California. It doesn't matter who they
[03:39:47.680 --> 03:39:53.120]  are, where they came from, how they got there, whether they're legal, illegal, regardless.
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:40:00.960]  Rich poor, everybody's got this. How about child protective services? How are they going
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:06.920]  to define this new law with their regulations? Well, we can show up anytime we want to at
[03:40:06.920 --> 03:40:11.000]  the house and if we don't like what we see, we just take the kids and we put them in foster
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:16.680]  care. It's pretty simple. Yeah, we'll take a thousand pages to spell out all the regulations
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:25.400]  but that's what it'll come down to and it'll be enshrined in law. That's where they're
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:31.600]  going with this and if you don't understand it, you'd better wake up. This isn't just
[03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:37.640]  like some of the anti-vaccine people in California whom I salute. This isn't just about vaccines,
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:45.000]  this new deal, SB 18. This is about everything, education, religion, no religion, healthcare,
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:55.840]  medical care, the right to succeed, whatever that means, parental guidance or guardian
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:41:01.240]  guidance by the state. It's about everything that pertains to the upbringing of a child
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:09.000]  in the state of California and the state will be in charge of that. Okay? You don't believe
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:17.720]  me? You better wake up. Now, here's the deal. Where is this coming from? Because in the
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:24.080]  bill, I don't want to burden you with too much detail but stay with me here, in the
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:30.800]  bill there is a group mentioned called the Peninsula Partnership Leader Council. Who
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:38.760]  are they? Who's heard of them before? And the reason they're in there because that council
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:49.280]  has actually written already a children's Bill of Rights and SB 18 is saying, yes, we
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:54.280]  like that Bill of Rights and everything in the bill is framed around that Bill of Rights.
[03:41:54.280 --> 03:42:01.280]  Okay, so as a reporter, I ask the simple question and so should you. Who is the Peninsula Partnership
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:11.480]  Leadership Council? And I will tell you, it's organized within and get this, the San Mateo
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:21.000]  County Office of Education, one piddling little California County Education Department. Where
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:29.640]  are they coming from? The Peninsula Partnership Leadership Council, I'm continuing here, is
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:37.600]  composed of that, the county superintendent of schools, who cares, the county board of
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:46.040]  supervisors, who cares, and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Bingo, bingo, bongo,
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:53.960]  hello, hello. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation, sponsoring the Children's Bill
[03:42:53.960 --> 03:43:07.320]  of Rights, just happens to have assets of $7.3 billion, hello, more than some nations.
[03:43:07.320 --> 03:43:17.120]  It runs 1,800 philanthropic funds. And here, for your amusement and entertainment and
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:25.200]  education, are some of the corporate partners of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
[03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:34.200]  Alexa Pharmaceuticals, Microsoft, PepsiCo Foundation, Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Bell, Symantec, Unilever,
[03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:44.560]  et cetera, et cetera. Big time, high tech, pharmaceutical corporations, understand? Now,
[03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:50.320]  they're in it, obviously, to figure out how they can make enormous profits. But this goes
[03:43:50.320 --> 03:44:01.600]  way beyond that. This goes up into the upper reaches of what we could call the technocracy.
[03:44:01.600 --> 03:44:08.680]  Because these folks in the government, in the corporations, have a plan. And their plan
[03:44:08.680 --> 03:44:15.680]  is to run society every step of the way by planning it, by engineering it, by saying,
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:22.240]  you and you and you and everybody individually, we set your energy quotas, how much energy
[03:44:22.240 --> 03:44:28.040]  you can consume. We decide, eventually, what your talents are because, you see, we want
[03:44:28.040 --> 03:44:36.400]  to fit you into the happiest place you can occupy in society. We are the engineers. Hello.
[03:44:36.400 --> 03:44:45.120]  We are the technocrats. We are beyond politics and politicians and parties. We are the upper,
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:54.040]  upper, upper reaches of globalism. We are planning the world. And our first step is
[03:44:54.040 --> 03:45:00.640]  to plan the lives from cradle to grave of the children. That's why we support the children's
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:05.680]  Bill of Rights. And that's why we want to put the state in charge of their education,
[03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:13.280]  their medical care, their upbringing, who controls them, who parents them. The whole
[03:45:13.280 --> 03:45:22.520]  works. We want to put them into our system because we understand that the world is a
[03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:30.440]  system. We are the engineers, and we lay it all out. That's what technocracy means.
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:38.560]  This is science, the triumph of science. This is what's happening, folks. This is what's
[03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:43.800]  happening with SB 718. This is what's happening in the state of California. This is what's
[03:45:43.800 --> 03:45:49.800]  happening with Agenda 21 of the United Nations. This is what's happening with the smart grid.
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:56.240]  This is what's happening with, quote, sustainable development. If you want to see and read the
[03:45:56.240 --> 03:46:05.560]  book on this, Technocracy Rising Patrick Wood. Read it yesterday. I don't often make recommendations.
[03:46:05.560 --> 03:46:13.340]  I'm into my second reading of the book. It lays it out, the history, the works. Technocracy
[03:46:13.340 --> 03:46:23.920]  Rising, Pat Wood. So this is what's behind the entire operation of this new bill that
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:32.560]  was introduced out of the blue in the legislature of the state of California. It's the technocrats
[03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:39.280]  of Silicon Valley, in this case, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, blithely saying,
[03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:46.280]  well, what's the problem? We're just trying to engineer the best society for everybody.
[03:46:46.280 --> 03:46:51.280]  Well, it's true. We didn't consult you, the people. We didn't ask you whether you wanted
[03:46:51.280 --> 03:46:59.560]  this. Nothing is really set for you to vote on. We're just taking control because we know
[03:46:59.560 --> 03:47:05.600]  what's good for you because we're the scientists, don't you understand? We're the engineers.
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:12.640]  That's all that's important. We make the blueprint of society, and part of the blueprint is deciding
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:17.280]  who has water, who doesn't, who eats, who doesn't, how much energy you are permitted
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:26.400]  to consume, when you go over your limit and what the penalties are. It's a completely
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:35.240]  enveloping system. That is what technocracy is, and that is the next stage of human evolution.
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:42.920]  That's what these guys are saying. They're very open about it. It's not hidden. They
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:53.320]  take it as a matter of fact, reality every day of their lives. But you don't, and I don't.
[03:47:53.320 --> 03:48:00.000]  And the purveyors of independent news don't. The fake news mainstream does. They're all
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:08.400]  behind this. They love it. They're terrified that somehow Trump may go against their plan.
[03:48:08.400 --> 03:48:15.840]  That's why they have to do away with him one way or another. But this is what's actually
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:24.840]  going on. Technocracy and the takeover, and that is what's happening with SB 18. And if
[03:48:24.840 --> 03:48:33.480]  you live in California, understand that. Understand what's really behind this. Sacrificing children
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:42.000]  to the state of California. And that's how they're being sacrificed. We don't like your
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:47.120]  parents. We don't think they're doing a good job. We're going to take the kid away. We
[03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:54.560]  don't even have to tell you why. We just know there's trouble. Maybe we think you're a troublemaker,
[03:48:54.560 --> 03:49:00.800]  so we take your kids away. So now you learn. Eyes straight ahead. Keep your mouth shut
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:07.480]  up. You want to keep your kids. Yes, it could get to that. Sure. Uh-huh. Right. We want
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:15.000]  to vaccinate your kid with 20, 30, 50 vaccines. We'll do it because it's under proper medical
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:23.680]  care, good medical care in SB 18. That's the standard of science. That we, the technocrats
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:30.120]  of support, therefore, it's going to happen. Psychiatric examinations and screening and
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:35.440]  drugs, of course, from the age of two, your child might be given an antidepressant because
[03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:44.560]  our doctors perceive scientifically now that he or she at age two is suffering from clinical
[03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:50.280]  depression. Oh, it's true. We have no laboratory tests to diagnose clinical depression as a
[03:49:50.280 --> 03:49:56.960]  giant scam. You can look it up in the Bible of psychiatry and you won't find it's finding
[03:49:56.960 --> 03:50:02.440]  laboratory tests for clinical depression, but so what? It's our science. We control
[03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:07.320]  the science and we say that if we want to, we can diagnose your child at the age of two
[03:50:07.320 --> 03:50:15.880]  or three or four through screening with depression. And we can prescribe drugs that will, in fact,
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:23.160]  enhance the possibility of your child becoming completely unhinged, violent, suicidal, and
[03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:33.040]  so on and so forth. An unfortunate adverse effect. That's where we're heading. We decide
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:38.880]  that GMO food laced with Roundup and other pesticides is for your child and that's what
[03:50:38.880 --> 03:50:59.920]  your child will get. And we will be back after the break.
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:04.320]  What if Extendivite really works, but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious
[03:51:04.320 --> 03:51:10.320]  time looking for someone to say, just try it. I have my help today because of Extendivite
[03:51:10.320 --> 03:51:15.880]  and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.

[03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:22.360]  in for Alex. So just before the break I was saying, well look, if the technocrats in California
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:28.800]  or anywhere, but we're talking about California, decide look, your kids need GMO food, laced
[03:54:28.800 --> 03:54:33.840]  with pesticides. This is the best food on the planet. Then that will be the meaning
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:44.080]  of good upbringing. And if you, the parent decides to get up on your hind legs and get
[03:54:44.080 --> 03:54:53.440]  you know tough about this, then you're criminal because if SB 18 passes this bill, they can
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:54:59.760]  define good, bad, and different parenting any way they want to. They can say whatever
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:04.800]  they want. You're eating a vegan diet. You think that's a good idea. It's not a good
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:11.800]  idea. State of California says malnutrition will result. You're eating a paleo diet.
[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:16.440]  You're eating a macrobiotic diet. You're eating this, that, the other thing. Oh, eventually
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:23.000]  the state of get around to saying look, this is a sign of bad parenting. Or they could
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:34.320]  say on the other side, talking to you obese folks now, no more burgers at McDonald's.
[03:55:34.320 --> 03:55:46.160]  No more hot dogs. No more sodas. No more junk food. Outlawed because SB 18 passed. The state
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:53.120]  is now the arbiter of what your kids should have and shouldn't have. And we say no more
[03:55:53.120 --> 03:56:02.280]  of that. No more junk food. You have no choice. We don't care what you think. You have an
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:11.080]  organic garden in your backyard. We don't like that. That's a bad sign. That indicates
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:17.840]  that you're probably one of these, what would you call them, outliers? Probably have some
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:23.720]  strange political views, dissident ideas. We know we are the state of California. We
[03:56:23.720 --> 03:56:29.280]  are the technocrats. We know that regular food grown with pesticides is the same as
[03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:34.360]  organic food. Of course, of course, of course. Therefore, if you have this crazy idea in
[03:56:34.360 --> 03:56:39.400]  your head about organic food, you're dangerous. You shouldn't be in control of your kids'
[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:44.480]  lives. You're bringing them up with the wrong ideas. We, the state, decide what the right
[03:56:44.480 --> 03:56:51.280]  ideas are. That's what's happening in this bill. And that's why this Silicon Valley
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:58.360]  Community Foundation with $7 billion is sitting behind it. They're not just playing around
[03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:06.040]  and having fun. They're serious, you see. And they wouldn't be serious about some empty
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:14.600]  ridiculous bill that just says every child should have a good life if they didn't intend
[03:57:14.600 --> 03:57:21.480]  as time passes to define what that means. Good life, good education, medical care, this,
[03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:29.560]  that, the other thing. Until they have an iron grip upon you. Until they've laid out
[03:57:29.560 --> 03:57:36.080]  the entire blueprint. That's what they're after. They don't just say, oh, well, let's
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:43.160]  back this children's bill of human rights. No. They have an agenda. And this is the agenda
