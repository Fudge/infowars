[00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.248]  It's Monday.
[00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:06.190]  It's Monday.
[00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.832]  28 days out from the election.
[00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:11.955]  There were rules and there was no freedom of choice.
[00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:13.096]  They broke the rules.
[00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.759]  Chris, I was there like you were and they were distanced.
[00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.981]  Those chairs were not close together.
[00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:23.066]  Chris, the way you're starting to harangue me now actually reminds me of what you did to the president during that debate on Tuesday night.
[00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.227]  Oh yeah, I liked him.
[00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:29.111]  No, and then he had to debate not just Joe Biden, but you as well.
[00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.013]  You were not a neutral moderator then.
[00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.154]  I don't mind tough questions.
[00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:38.679]  I welcome reasonably tough questions, but what I don't think is okay is for you to become the effective opposition to the president, okay?
[00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.021]  And everyone there was tested in the crowd.
[00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.542]  They were distanced from each other.
[00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.445]  People can make reasonable decisions for themselves.
[00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.746]  No, actually, they can't.
[00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:51.069]  Keep on praying for our president and our first lady, America.
[00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.690]  We aren't out of the woods yet.
[00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.451]  I have to be back.
[00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.899]  Because we still have to make America great again.
[00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260]  We've done an awfully good job of that.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:10.307]  If you look at the therapeutics, which I'm taking right now, some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they're miracles.
[00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:12.168]  If you want to know the truth, they're miracles.
[00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:19.452]  People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from God.
[00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:22.454]  So I just want to tell you that I'm starting to feel
[00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:24.124]  Good.
[00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:25.065]  This is America.
[00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:26.446]  This is the United States.
[00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.107]  This is the greatest country in the world.
[00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:29.949]  This is the most powerful country in the world.
[00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:37.876]  I can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens.
[00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.497]  I can't do that.
[00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.038]  We have to confront problems.
[00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.060]  As a leader, you have to confront problems.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.863]  There's never been a great leader that would have done that.
[00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:48.430]  I'm doing well.
[00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.110]  I want to thank everybody.
[00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.211]  Our First Lady is doing very well.
[00:01:52.211 --> 00:02:01.535]  Melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she has for our country, the love that she has for our country.
[00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:03.335]  And we're both doing well.
[00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:04.156]  Melania is
[00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.372]  Really handling it very nicely.
[00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:25.745]  President Trump has been treated with the experimental antiviral remdesivir and a single 8 gram dose of an antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is a combination of mouse pus and human neutralizing synthetic antibodies against the virus.
[00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:33.470]  A treatment that is still in clinical trials and the mixture of the two is anybody's guess depending on how the president reacts to it.
[00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:45.618]  President Trump is also taking zinc, melatonin, vitamin D, aspirin, and the heartburn brand Pepsid, which researchers are studying as a possible treatment for coronavirus.
[00:02:45.618 --> 00:03:01.069]  So, rather than allow the virus to take its course, President Trump has laid the gauntlet down in order to return back to the country that desperately needs his guidance and presence to steer us from a head-on collision into Marxist-fueled tyranny.
[00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:09.573]  The photos the White House has been releasing, the videos, we have to show them because they're the only evidence we have of the President's condition, but they are propagandistic!
[00:03:09.573 --> 00:03:15.395]  That's unfortunately the situation we're in, and out of the White House Correspondents Association is calling out the White House right now.
[00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:20.197]  This is the press, the press corps, the press pool that is supposed to travel with the President at all times.
[00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:22.338]  They were not informed about this photo op.
[00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:23.919]  They were not with him when this happened.
[00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.821]  That is a grievous breach of protocol.
[00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:38.350]  And the association is saying, quote, it is outrageous for the president to have left the hospital, even briefly, amid a health crisis, without a protective pool present to ensure the American people know where their president is and how he is doing.
[00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.394]  Now, more than ever, the American public deserves independent coverage of the president so they can be reliably informed about his health.
[00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:46.096]  That is absolutely correct.
[00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:52.381]  And by the way, Ana, if the president was feeling so well, why didn't he walk outside in the fresh air rather than get cooped up in that car?
[00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:57.207]  I mean, that's not a comfortable place for anybody to be in when there's a COVID positive patient.
[00:03:57.207 --> 00:03:59.871]  He could have walked out on the lawn and waved to the public.
[00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.807]  Trump has been buying us pizzas all freaking day.
[00:04:12.807 --> 00:04:14.609]  That is from Trump.
[00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.472]  He has bought over 250 pizzas that keep coming in.
[00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:22.754]  And you know it's from Trump because this s*** isn't gluten-free, alright?
[00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:24.095]  There's meat on there.
[00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:25.336]  Trump's an alpha.
[00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:26.657]  That's why there's so much of it.
[00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:30.886]  And no, CNN, we're not getting paid!
[00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:38.212]  And while Joe Biden calls another lid on his lethargic whack-a-mole basement campaign... If you elect me, I'm not going to have you.
[00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:40.193]  Your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.
[00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:47.578]  President Trump, in the throes of an incredibly dangerous coronavirus treatment, continues to present himself to the people.
[00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:51.461]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.262]  All right, folks.
[00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:55.504]  Get locked, get loaded, because you're about to explode.
[00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:56.265]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:07.248]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with everybody.
[00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:13.313]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, communist Chinese, have come out and said they're going to contest the election.
[00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.715]  They know that Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:21.560]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.645]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election, the Democrats have said they're going to break away
[00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:38.229]  politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext to sabotage the Republic even more.
[00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:50.753]  So, until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed, it's just going to continue to happen.
[00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:57.755]  And so that's the big problem here, is that we have systemic, dug-in corruption by people that hate the country's very existence.
[00:06:11.618 --> 00:06:14.019]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:21.362]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:23.403]  It's Monday, October 5th.
[00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.384]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:27.825]  We are 28 days out from the election.
[00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:32.307]  107 out from the inauguration.
[00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:36.229]  And this is one hell of a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.164]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:43.346]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours on this transmission.
[00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:45.247]  I'm Owen Schroer with The War Room.
[00:06:45.247 --> 00:06:52.491]  And on top of that, you've got Dianna Lorraine coming up with Election Countdown.
[00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.852]  We're going to do a 40-hour live broadcast kicking off Wednesday morning at 8 a.m.
[00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:56.833]  with David Knight.
[00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:06.498]  And yes, it's going to be a 2020 election extravaganza and fundraiser for InfoWars to keep this operation on air in the face of the New World Order.
[00:07:08.212 --> 00:07:09.932]  2020ElectionCenter.com.
[00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:15.834]  Okay, let me just say this to everybody.
[00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:29.296]  When I talk about the issues I break down on the show, I want you to know that we're not exaggerating, we're not making things up, and that this is the reality.
[00:07:29.296 --> 00:07:36.558]  And that 95 to 98% of everything I cover is open source information.
[00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:42.904]  It's not even being denied.
[00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:45.084]  And I had a major brainstorm this morning.
[00:07:45.084 --> 00:08:01.971]  I woke up at 430 and I was doing work and research hours before the family woke up and I stared out across the hills as the sun came up at 645.
[00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:08.414]  And just like I saw what would unfold knowing the pieces of the Gloveless Operation 20 years ago,
[00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:18.966]  I sat there for probably 30 minutes without even moving, other than blinking my eyes, and saw the future.
[00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:21.807]  And I didn't see it through a wormhole in time and space.
[00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:23.668]  I didn't see it through a crystal ball.
[00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:28.790]  I saw it from all the gathered data and information I have and what the globalists promise they're going to do.
[00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:41.920]  And you can run and hide from this for a little while and buy yourself a little bit of time.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.482]  But in the end, we're going to lose everything if we don't confront it up front.
[00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:48.902]  Well, so let me tell you the news we've got.
[00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:54.123]  Let me tell you what's coming up.
[00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:56.183]  I want to see the good narrative here.
[00:08:56.183 --> 00:08:58.224]  Trump goes in for a couple of days, comes out like a bull.
[00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:05.728]  Therapeutics, saving supposedly, so that gives people hope.
[00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:07.569]  And you can see that narrative being played out now.
[00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:09.490]  Markets rallying on optimism.
[00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.351]  Trump may be discharged as soon as today.
[00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:21.297]  It's an article at InfoWars.com from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:29.902]  But when I see what the lead medical doctor did at Walter Reed, and the incompetence they had before,
[00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:37.946]  At a similar facility.
[00:09:37.946 --> 00:09:40.346]  Was Reagan taken to Walter Reed or Bethesda?
[00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:41.846]  Look it up, I can't remember.
[00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:42.787]  In 81 when he got shot.
[00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:45.287]  I know they gave him cold blood.
[00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:46.747]  That caused serious brain damage.
[00:09:46.747 --> 00:09:47.787]  It messed Reagan up bad.
[00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:52.148]  Gave him cold blood.
[00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:54.049]  That hits your brain, it's not good.
[00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:56.709]  Especially when you're old.
[00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:02.450]  But, I didn't just, at first I wasn't that concerned, and then I saw Rendesivir that's experimental, and this other
[00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:06.914]  Artificial nanotech?
[00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:11.318]  Where they grow artificial antibodies, human antibodies, and mix it with mouse antibodies?
[00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:18.124]  And I looked up the study and it said, most of the time this makes the infection worse?
[00:10:18.124 --> 00:10:19.025]  I'm like, excuse me?
[00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:26.773]  You gotta be on death's doorstep for a doctor to even be allowed to do that.
[00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:33.051]  So then I was getting upset at the doctors, and then they came out to a press conference, and I'm sure it was true, because Trump's watching it.
[00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:39.954]  They go, oh, Trump demanded rendesivir and this artificial antibody cocktail.
[00:10:39.954 --> 00:10:41.335]  Well, since when is he a doctor?
[00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:42.395]  I don't care if he's the president.
[00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:44.116]  That's crazy.
[00:10:44.116 --> 00:10:46.016]  And so I reached out to a lot of medical doctors.
[00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:47.777]  I went and did research.
[00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:51.819]  And sure enough, they're all saying this is ka-ka-ka crazy town.
[00:11:00.848 --> 00:11:10.331]  So, he's lucky that he's alive when they're mixing those things together.
[00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:17.833]  But notice it's Fauci that runs all these federal agencies, been there for 40-something years, 45 years, 46 years.
[00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:24.595]  It's Fauci that pushed Rendezvir over zinc and vitamin D and all that.
[00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:35.146]  When Randesivir only helped people, you can look it up, Randesivir only helped 8% of seriously ill patients.
[00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:37.789]  And then it caused all these other big problems on the other side.
[00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:39.771]  I shot a whole report on it Saturday.
[00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:44.717]  Is Walter Reed killing President Trump?
[00:11:45.964 --> 00:11:47.224]  with experimental treatments.
[00:11:47.224 --> 00:11:48.045]  That's the headline.
[00:11:48.045 --> 00:11:49.365]  It's got like 300,000 views.
[00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:50.105]  You should go look at it.
[00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:54.427]  I show all the articles, all the documents, all the medical files, all the medical studies.
[00:11:54.427 --> 00:11:55.787]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[00:11:55.787 --> 00:12:00.649]  Like, don't give a two-year-old aspirin, because sometimes it can give them a disorder that kills them.
[00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:01.569]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:06.150]  I mean, everybody knows you don't mix, like, painkillers with Jack Daniels.
[00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.930]  I'm no doctor.
[00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.751]  I'm no pharmacist.
[00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:09.751]  You just don't do that.
[00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:11.792]  It says in the bottle, don't operate with heavy machinery.
[00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:14.853]  You know, don't... So,
[00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:27.029]  A, those doctors are so out of control they did what Trump told them to do, like he's a doctor, or they're lying.
[00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.290]  I don't know.
[00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.451]  But let's pull up for TV viewers the video page at 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:37.212]  That's a mirror side of Banned.Video, but Banned.Video is banned on Twitter.
[00:12:37.212 --> 00:12:38.012]  You can't share those links.
[00:12:38.012 --> 00:12:40.773]  You've got to go to 2020ElectionCenter.com and then share from there.
[00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:46.134]  And you can see that video I did, also John Rappaport, investigative journalist, did one on these very dangerous criminal drugs.
[00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:51.834]  I just go back to that question.
[00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:56.537]  Why on earth are they doing that?
[00:12:56.537 --> 00:13:01.400]  I can pull it up on my phone, no big deal.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.082]  Go to 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:07.084]  Click on the Alex Jones Show page.
[00:13:07.084 --> 00:13:08.065]  Right there on the left-hand side.
[00:13:08.065 --> 00:13:10.346]  And then you scroll down.
[00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:15.510]  And you'll be able to see the report right there.
[00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.472]  Is Walter Reed killing President Trump with experimental treatments?
[00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:21.001]  351,000 views.
[00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.782]  There it is.
[00:13:22.782 --> 00:13:26.404]  That's how you navigate the site for TV viewers.
[00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:40.992]  And I just hope to God you share that, because I want to believe he's about to get out, but they're going to give him this antibody treatment at least five more times, they're saying, and they're going to give him the Randesivir five more times.
[00:13:40.992 --> 00:13:41.872]  And that's crazy.
[00:13:41.872 --> 00:13:43.854]  So, I get it.
[00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:45.634]  Okay, they say he's positive for coronavirus.
[00:13:45.634 --> 00:13:46.695]  He's got a cold.
[00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:47.816]  It's huge hysteria.
[00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:58.412]  Now people are out in public wearing bubble masks and face shields and husbands are coming home at night wearing and wives face mask inside the home.
[00:13:58.412 --> 00:13:59.574]  It's just all virtue signaling.
[00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:07.833]  It's collapsing the economy, creating a world depression and mass death, and you tell people, hey, you know the shutdowns already killed 2 million people in Africa.
[00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.113]  They admit that, they're dead.
[00:14:10.113 --> 00:14:12.774]  Not coronavirus, but starving to death.
[00:14:12.774 --> 00:14:15.515]  People just don't care because they want a virtue signal.
[00:14:15.515 --> 00:14:17.196]  It feels too good to them to be ignorant.
[00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:22.518]  Well, the economy is falling apart now, so get ready for that because it's going to hurt us here.
[00:14:24.218 --> 00:14:26.740]  The consolidation of power is just unbelievable.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.783]  But we got a call from Dr. Francis Boyle, the guy that wrote the U.S.
[00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:33.406]  Biological Weapons Treaty that became the World Treaty, much of it.
[00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:35.567]  And he has come out and said the exact same thing.
[00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:49.299]  That it is insane, absolutely insane in the membrane, what these doctors did.
[00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:51.941]  And again, it's illegal.
[00:14:53.908 --> 00:15:05.456]  If someone is not deathly ill to even do those treatments, and you certainly don't just do it because the patient says, oh, doc, I think I want to take not one, but two experimental treatments.
[00:15:05.456 --> 00:15:08.098]  They go, well, you're the president, so we'll do that.
[00:15:08.098 --> 00:15:08.539]  And I get it.
[00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:09.640]  Oh, he's so tough.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.261]  He wanted to have the miracle work.
[00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:13.082]  Well, why wasn't it hydroxychloroquine?
[00:15:13.082 --> 00:15:16.885]  Why did it have to be the drugs that Fauci's pushing that Fauci makes money off of?
[00:15:19.704 --> 00:15:42.110]  Well, we've got Dr. Francis Boyle joining us at the bottom of the hour to lay this out, and then Gavin McInnes, that the President has been talking about quite a bit, the founder of Proud Boys, that is multiracial, absolutely inclusive, but it's proud of America, it's proud of the Renaissance, and it's proud of capitalism, and so it's being demonized and lied about, and so the President's made some comments about them.
[00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.911]  We've got Gavin McInnes, always an amazing guest, joining us.
[00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:46.652]  We'll have open phones as well.
[00:15:47.512 --> 00:15:49.673]  Gerald Cilente coming up and a lot more.
[00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:51.054]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:53.656]  And you can also remember our new website is InfoWars.com.
[00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:54.536]  It's been redesigned.
[00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.137]  I'm really, really excited about it.
[00:15:56.137 --> 00:15:57.158]  I really like it.
[00:15:57.158 --> 00:15:59.619]  We're going to add some more features as well.
[00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:13.948]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them, to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park, they have to look at us, the common people.
[00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:14.388]  They have to
[00:16:14.748 --> 00:16:16.049]  Look at the proletariat.
[00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:17.169]  Look at the scum.
[00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:19.070]  That's why they love the lockdown.
[00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.330]  Putting muzzles on us.
[00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.811]  That gives them a big thrill.
[00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:23.952]  Controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[00:16:23.952 --> 00:16:25.853]  Bankrupting Main Street.
[00:16:25.853 --> 00:16:27.433]  Bankrupting small towns.
[00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:36.357]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterile vaccines day one.
[00:16:37.017 --> 00:16:39.619]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over.
[00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:41.080]  Playtime's over.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.665]  They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance, and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:47.485]  You know this.
[00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:48.226]  I know this.
[00:16:48.226 --> 00:16:49.467]  It's all out in the open.
[00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.629]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:53.350]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.211]  Identify the enemy.
[00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:55.452]  Identify the enemy.
[00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:57.453]  Identify your enemy now.
[00:16:58.502 --> 00:17:07.828]  Our partnership with My Patriot Supply to give you the lowest discounts possible on food has led to new ways to save on preparing your family for what comes next.

[00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:28.042]  While we continue to work with them to bring you new lower discounts at PrepareWithAlex.com, there's no guarantee we'll be able to get such low prices on these products again.
[00:17:28.742 --> 00:17:32.103]  Plus, each purchase goes to support the InfoWars crew.

[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:19.007]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:19.007 --> 00:18:21.067]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:22.368]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:26.169]  Alright.
[00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:27.870]  I sat there this morning, cogitating.
[00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:44.864]  Looking over all the evidence, the facts, what the globalists have been doing, and it was a command of my very genetics, of my cells, that God designed you with to resist this New World Order takeover.
[00:18:44.864 --> 00:18:51.809]  I mean, everything about it is destructive and horrible and ugly and poisonous.
[00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:57.314]  And I told my wife, I said, when she woke up, I said, we're going to have to start civil disobedience.
[00:18:59.517 --> 00:19:05.958]  They're not going to let you in grocery stores, in your job, have a driver's license, drive down the road without forced inoculations in about a year.
[00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.399]  It's already started in Asia.
[00:19:07.399 --> 00:19:09.519]  It's already started in Europe.
[00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:15.821]  I told you six months ago, they're going to have face scanners to go in stores to see if you've had your vaccine.
[00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.101]  It's not going to be an app on your phone.
[00:19:18.101 --> 00:19:19.541]  Well, now they've rolled them out.
[00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:22.382]  But at first, it's a, quote, scanner to make sure you're wearing your mask.
[00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:32.461]  This is all dog training, and the UN admits it, and I tell people that I see wearing masks that even know me, and they laugh at me.
[00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:36.384]  Because there's a spirit to these followers.
[00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:45.369]  They have submitted to the spirit of the world, and they're creatures of the devil.
[00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.570]  And you wonder why they look so stupid and act so stupid.
[00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.451]  They're in a trance.
[00:19:50.117 --> 00:20:02.365]  And more and more people are either fully awakening, you're seeing it, or they're in a trance and just can't make decisions, can't do anything, can't grasp simple things.
[00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:15.193]  But for those that aren't in the trance, it's horrifying, except for another group, those that have gone out of the trance into deeper spirit of Satan, and they are programmed.
[00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:21.687]  To actually carry out evil, not just submit to it.
[00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:25.728]  So that's the thing about this is, you're seeing everybody going to zombie mode right now.
[00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:28.008]  They're in a trance.
[00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:38.051]  And medically, it's admitted, the public's way more suggestible now, five, six times more suggestible than we were in the 50s before TV became totally mainline.
[00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:39.011]  People are in a trance.
[00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:41.811]  They're under a spell.
[00:20:41.811 --> 00:20:46.032]  A psychiatrist would call it a trance or hypnosis.
[00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:48.113]  A witch would say, I put them under a spell.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.821]  And that's what this is!
[00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.764]  The Kingdom of Earth is under Satan's spell!
[00:20:56.764 --> 00:20:59.205]  And those of us under the spell are like, what are you doing?
[00:20:59.205 --> 00:21:08.250]  And the people under it go... And they smile at you with that satisfaction that they're winners, they're doing the correct thing, and they feel satisfied.
[00:21:09.824 --> 00:21:12.485]  You can tell somebody under hypnosis, piss on yourself.
[00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:14.266]  Cut your fingers off, they'll do it.
[00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:21.989]  And the public brainstand show is right at what you'd call actually being under hypnosis in a dream state.
[00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.290]  Dreaming their way into destruction.
[00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:33.254]  So we can laugh at this all day, but they're programming them and organizing them into an army to be directed at us.
[00:21:33.254 --> 00:21:36.235]  So from here on out, things just gets more intense, but it's okay.
[00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:37.795]  It's the Great Animating Challenge.
[00:21:37.795 --> 00:21:38.736]  So you want excitement.
[00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.299]  You're going to get it now, everybody.
[00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:48.487]  The robot rise, everything, but at the heart of it is about destroying humanity, destroying innocence, and the currency is our children.
[00:21:48.487 --> 00:21:57.379]  And the Democrats in the House have blocked and had resolutions saying we will not investigate pedophilia and California's legalized pedophilia.
[00:21:57.379 --> 00:21:57.699]  Here it is.
[00:21:59.795 --> 00:22:10.558]  In a 371 to 18 vote, our elected Congress appeared to be moving towards making pedophobia a hate crime.
[00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:27.982]  They stated that President Trump has not condemned the QAnon conspiracy which revolves around the baseless theory that Trump and his allies are working to expose a cabal of Democrats, media figures, and celebrities who are running an international child trafficking ring.
[00:22:29.002 --> 00:22:33.165]  They went on to say that the First Amendment is a powerful weapon.
[00:22:33.165 --> 00:22:43.013]  Turning that weapon on those who use fantasies as a menacing grift is the responsibility of reasonable citizens, legislators, and executives.
[00:22:44.281 --> 00:23:03.320]  The same Congress who has paid out $15 million of taxpayer money to silence their own victims of sexual harassment want to weaponize the First Amendment to silence anyone who suggests that Democrats, media figures, and celebrities are involved in child trafficking.
[00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:09.045]  They say the claim is baseless, but that is an obvious lie.
[00:23:09.045 --> 00:23:11.687]  And it's not just the Democrats.
[00:23:11.687 --> 00:23:24.938]  In the 1980s, foster children from Nebraska were being auctioned off at elite parties on the East Coast and sent as prostitutes to powerful politicians, including at the White House.
[00:23:24.938 --> 00:23:31.804]  A federal grand jury got involved to rule that the explosive testimony of the victimized foster children was a hoax.
[00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:39.507]  The Vatican has been exposed for years of covering up a hidden pedo culture within the Catholic Church.
[00:23:39.507 --> 00:23:44.168]  Hillary Clinton's State Department covered for a pedophile ambassador.
[00:23:44.168 --> 00:23:52.490]  Oprah Winfrey promoted a man who was enslaving women, impregnating them, and selling their babies internationally.
[00:23:52.490 --> 00:24:00.112]  Hollywood, Nickelodeon, and Disney have all been exposed for rehiring convicted pedophiles to work with children.
[00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:05.794]  And the mainstream media tells you that this is all fantasy.
[00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:13.357]  After WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails, masses of people began investigating child sex trafficking.
[00:24:13.357 --> 00:24:15.378]  And nothing has been the same ever since.
[00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:23.432]  Following his inauguration, President Trump vowed to fight the epidemic of human trafficking.
[00:24:23.432 --> 00:24:37.280]  He signed executive orders to do so, and over 1,500 pedophiles involved in child sex trafficking operations were arrested, all within his first month as president, and the mainstream media ignored it.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:50.550]  In June of 2017, Ivanka Trump said that ending human trafficking is in our moral and strategic interests and is a top priority of the White House.
[00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:56.815]  Big arrests continued all over the globe, reported by local media only.
[00:24:56.815 --> 00:25:01.879]  Thousands of arrests, thousands of children rescued, including infants.
[00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:08.817]  Nixxiom cult leaders have been charged with child porn and sex trafficking.
[00:25:08.817 --> 00:25:12.639]  Their leader was an outspoken advocate of pedophilia.
[00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:14.421]  They ran multiple daycare centers.
[00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:35.167]  For several years, there has been talk about Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, the Lolita Express, used to ferry powerful people to his private pedophile island, including dozens of times by Bill Clinton, seen here partying with convicted pedophile and deep state witness, George Nader.
[00:25:36.207 --> 00:25:55.260]  Bill Gates, who was also associated with Jeffrey Epstein, employed a former Microsoft engineer to work on his private estate, who was arrested on the Gates property in 2014 for possessing over 6,000 images of child rape and assault, including the rape of boys and girls as young as eight years old.
[00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:59.342]  The man only did 90 days in jail.
[00:25:59.342 --> 00:26:04.804]  The same fat losers who have gotten rich off of corrupt side deals for years.
[00:26:04.804 --> 00:26:09.165]  Who have paid out $15 million to silence their own victims.
[00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:18.388]  The same worthless elected officials who have been stalling any and all investigations into the crooked establishment which they have exploited for decades.
[00:26:19.028 --> 00:26:30.274]  Now want to weaponize the First Amendment to silence anyone who suggests they or their Hollywood media cohorts might be involved in child sex trafficking.
[00:26:30.274 --> 00:26:34.676]  The crime of pedophilia is recorded in history all the way to the Bible.
[00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:46.028]  And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.
[00:26:46.028 --> 00:26:52.213]  But times have changed, and we don't need to bother with millstones any longer.
[00:26:52.213 --> 00:26:54.535]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:26:54.535 --> 00:26:55.956]  Stay with us.
[00:26:56.926 --> 00:27:02.449]  This is your last chance to get a Peck Power Stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[00:27:02.449 --> 00:27:07.611]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:09.933]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:12.534]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[00:27:12.894 --> 00:27:19.079]  Because there's 13 different formulas in 8-Pak PowerStack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:27.705]  This is the highest-end AM-PM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:28.165]  It's amazing.
[00:27:28.165 --> 00:27:36.612]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it, and that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:39.714]  So it's your last chance to get 8-Pak PowerStack at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:27:40.034 --> 00:27:43.756]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond
[00:28:08.203 --> 00:28:09.264]  What they should be.
[00:28:09.264 --> 00:28:13.869]  It's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[00:28:13.869 --> 00:28:16.132]  200 million people have died.
[00:28:16.132 --> 00:28:18.715]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:31.058]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 in reality, he went on to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage.
[00:28:31.058 --> 00:28:32.140]  It's all made up.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:32.960]  But you know where he got it?
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.124]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[00:28:36.124 --> 00:28:37.606]  They said that 4% of
[00:28:38.527 --> 00:28:41.010]  America would be dead already.
[00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:46.036]  Of course it's .0000 and then add a number because the numbers vary.
[00:28:46.036 --> 00:28:50.621]  It's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:55.647]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[00:28:56.943 --> 00:29:00.124]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:08.688]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[00:29:08.688 --> 00:29:12.269]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:24.974]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[00:29:26.154 --> 00:29:28.735]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[00:29:28.735 --> 00:29:34.856]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:38.697]  This is their stated goal.
[00:29:38.697 --> 00:29:48.260]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy can we turn this around.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.367]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[00:29:54.367 --> 00:30:00.335]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[00:30:00.335 --> 00:30:02.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:16.351 --> 00:30:17.512]  You found it.
[00:30:17.512 --> 00:30:18.713]  The tip of the spear.
[00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:21.756]  The front lines of forbidden information.
[00:30:21.756 --> 00:30:30.203]  The Pandora's box of verboten.
[00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:38.190]  Alright, on Friday we had an investigative journalist who's worked back when they were still at Credibility for some of the biggest national
[00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:52.134]  News shows, investigative journals, John Rappaport and he just said, look at this, this Rendesivir and this other nanotech drug are both super dangerous and together, God knows what they do.
[00:30:52.134 --> 00:30:57.355]  Then I went and did my own research on mainline literature and they said, someone's not supposed to take these unless they're super sick.
[00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.695]  They have all sorts of bad side effects.
[00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:00.696]  One of them makes infections get worse.
[00:31:00.696 --> 00:31:02.937]  I went, well God, why would you want that?
[00:31:02.937 --> 00:31:07.118]  And then I looked at the supposed lead doctor and he doesn't have a very good resume, but
[00:31:09.073 --> 00:31:12.395]  I thought, well, what medical doctor is getting on to talk about this, or what expert?
[00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:18.098]  Well, we have someone that's a lawyer and a professor, but an expert on the medicine itself, the guy that wrote the U.S.
[00:31:18.098 --> 00:31:31.146]  Biological Weapons Law, much of which became world law, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, who, again, is a doctor of law, magna cum laude, Ph.D.
[00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:33.807]  in political science from Harvard University, both.
[00:31:33.807 --> 00:31:36.449]  And he's got a book out on bioterrorism.
[00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:53.189]  Biowarfare and Terrorism, four and a half stars, but I was just thinking about what he said on this show, what he said on another show in January, what he said on this show a few days later in early February, and what he's said since, how it's totally proven accurate.
[00:31:53.189 --> 00:31:54.870]  The media says that I'm saying it's a hoax.
[00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.350]  I'm not saying the virus doesn't exist.
[00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.532]  It's a real virus that spreads really well.
[00:31:59.622 --> 00:32:02.105]  Clearly man-made, and there's a cover-up about it.
[00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:06.910]  They have tried to exaggerate some of the numbers, I think, in some areas to politically have a lockdown.
[00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.514]  But separately from that, they've also tried to block a lot of therapeutics and things.
[00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:20.760]  But when it comes to exposing how they were trying to develop vaccines for bird flu, and for swine flu, and for other COVIDs, that was happening at this base.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:30.687]  And now more and more experts agree with Dr. Boyle, really the consensus is they were developing a live virus vaccine, which itself is poisonous, itself very dangerous, that got out.
[00:32:31.247 --> 00:32:36.250]  I think on purpose, the way they shut down Hong Kong, the way China's used this to shut us down.
[00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.211]  Boyle says, well, probably got out on accident.
[00:32:38.211 --> 00:32:39.953]  They had very bad standards there.
[00:32:39.953 --> 00:32:41.493]  China's done this a bunch.
[00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:42.714]  They've released the swine flu.
[00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:44.595]  They've released the bird flu.
[00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:45.656]  They've released SARS.
[00:32:45.656 --> 00:32:47.197]  I mean, that's all on record.
[00:32:47.197 --> 00:32:51.820]  But what's incredible is, here we are all these years later, since they've been caught doing this, they never get in trouble.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.961]  And it's taboo in our media to talk about that.
[00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:54.902]  So there's two big issues here.
[00:32:56.223 --> 00:32:57.104]  I want to cover this first.
[00:32:57.104 --> 00:32:58.705]  That's why he wanted to come on.
[00:32:58.705 --> 00:33:04.028]  We usually beg him to come on again, but he wanted to come on about this, and I'm glad he does, because he's looked at the facts.
[00:33:04.028 --> 00:33:05.009]  What is Walter Reed doing?
[00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:07.250]  Trying to kill Trump?
[00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.751]  And why are they doing it?
[00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:20.139]  And then B, in more hindsight now, things usually in hindsight, we see people make mistakes, but in hindsight, we see Dr. Boyles, and now first analysis is like dead on, so we want to cover that with him as well.
[00:33:20.139 --> 00:33:21.500]  Thanks for coming on on short notice, Doc.
[00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.511]  Hey, Alex, thank you for having me on.
[00:33:25.511 --> 00:33:35.859]  My best to your viewing audience at this very difficult time for President Trump and our Republic.
[00:33:35.859 --> 00:33:36.960]  What do you want to tackle first?
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:43.264]  Obviously, you're alarmed as other people are about what he's being given.
[00:33:43.264 --> 00:33:45.106]  Well, Alex, let me start.
[00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:52.391]  I think we all need to start with the fatality rate under these circumstances.
[00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:59.202]  Now this is from a professor of biology in Columbia, just on SARS.
[00:33:59.202 --> 00:34:00.363]  Okay.
[00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:04.484]  And this was long before the COVID-19.
[00:34:04.484 --> 00:34:09.045]  And it says a fatality rate is 50%, 50% in people 65 years or older.
[00:34:09.045 --> 00:34:11.225]  Now this is SARS on steroids.
[00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:19.999]  Okay.
[00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:23.740]  That we're dealing with here with President Trump.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.541]  Plus, I'm not here to criticize President Trump, but you know, he's obese.
[00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:36.502]  So it's a life-threatening situation here for President Trump.
[00:34:36.502 --> 00:34:40.263]  He's 74, he eats McDonald's all day, and he is somewhat overweight.
[00:34:40.263 --> 00:34:43.823]  He's a prime candidate for this to kill him.
[00:34:43.823 --> 00:34:44.303]  Right.
[00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:46.724]  I mean, he's right in the mark, at least 50%.
[00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:49.924]  If not more.
[00:34:49.924 --> 00:34:56.766]  And yesterday, his doctor there, his alleged doctor, said, well, we might release him today.
[00:34:56.766 --> 00:35:00.567]  Well, let's look at this guy, Conley.
[00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:03.428]  He technically is not a medical doctor.
[00:35:03.428 --> 00:35:06.329]  He's nothing more than an osteopath.
[00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:07.829]  He does not have an MD.
[00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:11.310]  Now, Alex, let me compare this to me.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:19.405]  The president is four years older than I. Okay, who is my physician?
[00:35:19.405 --> 00:35:34.954]  My physician is a board-certified medical doctor specializing in internal medicine who also has a certificate in adult medicine.
[00:35:34.954 --> 00:35:37.796]  Now, that's my physician.
[00:35:37.796 --> 00:35:39.837]  Why did not the Pentagon
[00:35:40.624 --> 00:35:49.729]  Give a similar type of physician to President Trump instead of an osteopath.
[00:35:49.729 --> 00:35:51.690]  They're not medical doctors.
[00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:57.993]  No one has certified him to do anything at all except the Pentagon.
[00:35:57.993 --> 00:36:06.198]  And, you know, there's that saying by Groucho Marx that, you know, military justices to justices.
[00:36:07.102 --> 00:36:08.943]  Military music is to music.
[00:36:08.943 --> 00:36:17.385]  Well, I would say, you know, military medicine is to medicine as military music is to music.
[00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:22.707]  Well, clearly looking into his background, they could have had a lot of more better doctors in there.
[00:36:22.707 --> 00:36:23.987]  Why is this guy in there then?
[00:36:23.987 --> 00:36:24.968]  Who chose him?
[00:36:24.968 --> 00:36:28.889]  And why is he pushing Fauci's agenda?
[00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:29.689]  Right.
[00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:34.911]  We have an osteopath who's not been certified by anyone but the Pentagon.
[00:36:35.998 --> 00:36:49.801]  While giving President Trump this completely experimental treatment by Regeneron that no one else in the world has ever been given.
[00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:56.843]  Treating the President of the United States of America as if he's a guinea pig.
[00:36:56.843 --> 00:36:59.124]  That's what I said on Saturday.
[00:36:59.124 --> 00:37:03.445]  I said, I haven't seen anywhere where they've given the same person these two things together.
[00:37:03.445 --> 00:37:04.365]  This is crazy.
[00:37:05.836 --> 00:37:25.955]  Well, and now it's, you know, you've got Red Demis there, which, if you look out at the University of North Carolina, those Nazi death scientists out there who helped manufacture
[00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:28.990]  COVID-19, okay?
[00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.531]  With the Bat Queen from Wuhan BSL-4.
[00:37:32.531 --> 00:37:38.852]  When that was done, they then moved to develop Remdesivir, okay?
[00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:46.074]  Because they knew there would be no effective vaccine.
[00:37:46.074 --> 00:37:54.077]  And so they didn't waste their time on a vaccine, but they moved into developing Remdesivir.
[00:37:55.436 --> 00:38:05.881]  And then, on top of all that, Conley has given the President this steroid.
[00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:12.744]  I don't know anyone in the world who has been on all three of these at the exact same time.
[00:38:12.744 --> 00:38:13.464]  Oh, I forgot!
[00:38:13.464 --> 00:38:15.905]  They gave him an anti-inflammatory steroid on top of this.
[00:38:15.905 --> 00:38:18.607]  Who the hell knows what that'll do?
[00:38:18.607 --> 00:38:20.267]  Right, you have the interactions.
[00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:21.228]  The bottom line is,
[00:38:22.096 --> 00:38:29.441]  We need to get President Trump out of Walter Reed immediately, in my opinion.
[00:38:29.441 --> 00:38:47.172]  We do know that the George Washington Medical Complex there in Washington DC saved President Reagan's life from the jaws of death after the assassination attempt
[00:38:47.904 --> 00:38:48.044]  I don't
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:22.947]  So how can he be treating the President of the United States when I have a board-certified MD specializing in internal medicine and with a certificate?
[00:39:22.947 --> 00:39:27.850]  My personal doctor is also an internal doctor and does surgeries.
[00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.311]  I agree with you.
[00:39:28.311 --> 00:39:28.911]  We want the best.
[00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:32.673]  It's a guy that actually does surgeries and there's a doctor on top of it doing regular checkups.
[00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:35.175]  So how do you think he got this guy?
[00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:38.651]  The Pentagon gave it to him, I'm sure.
[00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:39.992]  That's what happened.
[00:39:39.992 --> 00:39:45.637]  With the same Pentagon that Trump said a month ago wants him dead because he's pulling out of these wars.
[00:39:45.637 --> 00:39:46.878]  Are we, Alex?
[00:39:46.878 --> 00:39:47.519]  We'll be right back.
[00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:50.682]  Let's talk about that with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:39:50.682 --> 00:39:51.162]  Straight ahead.
[00:39:51.162 --> 00:39:54.646]  Remember Trump said that speech at the washing machine factory.
[00:39:56.874 --> 00:40:08.462]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses, the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[00:40:08.462 --> 00:40:11.424]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[00:40:11.424 --> 00:40:22.092]  If you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3, and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3, if you have zinc and vitamin C as well.
[00:40:22.412 --> 00:40:27.578]  That's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[00:40:27.578 --> 00:40:35.506]  Now I've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[00:40:35.506 --> 00:40:41.052]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C. He should have also
[00:40:41.152 --> 00:40:43.554]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[00:40:59.761 --> 00:41:08.388]  They gave up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only gonna be a short period of time, and then the restrictions will be released.
[00:41:08.388 --> 00:41:09.969]  But they're not.
[00:41:09.969 --> 00:41:18.416]  After a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said, they will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[00:41:18.416 --> 00:41:21.018]  This is called successive approximation.
[00:41:21.858 --> 00:41:24.939]  Incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[00:41:24.939 --> 00:41:27.880]  This is the most common way that totalitarians take over.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.562]  But there then becomes a point where the public wakes up.
[00:41:31.562 --> 00:41:36.844]  Under the incrementalism, it starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clampdown.
[00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:41.966]  And you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks, or months than you saw in the previous 10 years.
[00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.768]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[00:41:45.768 --> 00:41:56.835]  A world government, Qaikom-backed, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[00:41:56.835 --> 00:42:00.198]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[00:42:00.198 --> 00:42:02.179]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:03.520]  Is your city too safe?
[00:42:05.891 --> 00:42:07.613]  Well, not anymore!
[00:42:07.613 --> 00:42:10.035]  Introducing Democrats!
[00:42:10.035 --> 00:42:19.004]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness!
[00:42:19.004 --> 00:42:24.009]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity!
[00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:26.411]  No more pesky law and order!
[00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:28.934]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe!
[00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:35.478]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground!
[00:42:35.478 --> 00:42:36.419]  But wait!
[00:42:36.419 --> 00:42:45.290]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.313]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[00:42:56.559 --> 00:43:01.101]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[00:43:01.101 --> 00:43:03.642]  This is taken under the tongue.
[00:43:03.642 --> 00:43:05.843]  It is pure turmeric.
[00:43:05.843 --> 00:43:15.047]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[00:43:15.047 --> 00:43:20.889]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:23.030]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.731]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[00:43:26.731 --> 00:43:28.572]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:30.692]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[00:43:30.692 --> 00:43:32.873]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[00:43:32.873 --> 00:43:34.233]  Some like bodies better.
[00:43:34.233 --> 00:43:38.355]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[00:43:38.355 --> 00:43:39.555]  And they fund the InfoWar.
[00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:44.137]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWarStore.com today.

[00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:12.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:14.210]  President Trump is overweight.
[00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.550]  He is 74 years old.
[00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:22.031]  Any pneumonia can kill someone like that.
[00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:24.134]  I know about a lot of family died from pneumonia.
[00:44:24.134 --> 00:44:25.315]  Folks were in great shape.
[00:44:25.315 --> 00:44:28.079]  And this is a weaponized form that they're using to take over our society.
[00:44:32.472 --> 00:44:33.513]  Dr. Frank Stavewell is our guest.
[00:44:33.513 --> 00:44:34.994]  We'll go back to him in a moment.
[00:44:34.994 --> 00:44:38.978]  Today is the last day and there won't be a sell like this for a long time.
[00:44:38.978 --> 00:44:40.960]  In fact, they've never done this.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.725]  They already have the lowest prices, the highest quality, with the full catalog of MyPatriotSupplyFluidInfoWorkstore.com.
[00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:47.906]  They're on our back end.
[00:44:47.906 --> 00:44:48.647]  We're partnered with them.
[00:44:49.704 --> 00:44:56.167]  But I came to him and I said, listen, I really want to do some specials for folks to just incentivize them to do this, realize how important it is.
[00:44:56.167 --> 00:45:07.651]  That said, $600 off on a year's supply, $300 off on a six-month, and $160 off a three-month, and it is high quality, great containers, very easy to transport and to store.
[00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:08.232]  14 hours, 11 minutes left.
[00:45:08.232 --> 00:45:08.512]  14 hours.
[00:45:12.737 --> 00:45:14.378]  at preparewithalex.com.
[00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:18.659]  That is a special on top of the specials on that one URL.
[00:45:18.659 --> 00:45:22.641]  People last week with a couple weeks ago with the other special were like, hey, there's only three months you're doing this on.
[00:45:22.641 --> 00:45:24.041]  Do a discount on the other one.
[00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:27.182]  So they did it for you, but it's got to end.
[00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:30.083]  And one big reason is MyPatriot is the biggest storable food company in the U.S.
[00:45:30.083 --> 00:45:30.203]  now.
[00:45:30.203 --> 00:45:31.384]  They've been around 14 years.
[00:45:31.384 --> 00:45:34.805]  The last four or five, they're now the biggest because of their quality and customer service.
[00:45:34.805 --> 00:45:37.146]  They've got factories all over the U.S.
[00:45:37.146 --> 00:45:38.726]  and they're Patriots.
[00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:40.607]  Obviously the name says that, but in action,
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:45.374]  There are other suppliers that don't like us having this deal, so it's got to end.
[00:45:45.374 --> 00:45:46.475]  It's over today.
[00:45:46.475 --> 00:45:48.997]  Infowarestore.com has the full catalog.
[00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:52.239]  Already great prices, but if you want the best deal ever on those...
[00:45:53.388 --> 00:45:55.770]  Specials is preparedalex.com.
[00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:04.735]  And we also have DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10, and a lot of other compounds that are known to boost your overall body's defenses, clean out your cells.
[00:46:04.735 --> 00:46:06.096]  I'm taking DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:11.459]  I'm taking Winter Sun, Vitamin D3, high quality organic, under the tongue with Vitamin K, to boost my body's defenses.
[00:46:11.459 --> 00:46:16.122]  And I'm taking the zinc in Prostagard that has a soft palm meadow in it as well.
[00:46:16.122 --> 00:46:17.623]  That's good for women, not just men.
[00:46:18.183 --> 00:46:28.666]  So, the Prostagarb with the Zinc and Salt Palmetto and other key ingredients, the Winter Sun, and all of it at InfolwerStore.com with free shipping in this big blowout sale with all that's going on.
[00:46:28.666 --> 00:46:31.647]  I'm trying to sell everything out ahead of the election because who knows what's going to happen.
[00:46:31.647 --> 00:46:32.627]  Things are so dangerous.
[00:46:32.627 --> 00:46:36.048]  We're trying to put money in the bank to be able to operate even if our store gets shut down.
[00:46:36.048 --> 00:46:38.188]  We have all the products in stock right now.
[00:46:38.188 --> 00:46:39.108]  Order them today.
[00:46:39.108 --> 00:46:40.509]  The food's ready to ship within one week.
[00:46:41.169 --> 00:46:46.074]  Get your orders in now at InfoWarsTour.com or PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:46:46.074 --> 00:46:51.059]  There's also a toll-free number on the website, PrepareWithAlex.com, if you'd like to order that way.
[00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:55.203]  Okay, back to Dr. Francis Boyle, author of the U.S.
[00:46:55.203 --> 00:46:58.166]  Biological Weapons Treaty.
[00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:02.170]  He already laid out the facts of what are they doing, or the U.S.
[00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.933]  Biological Weapons Law that later got adopted, much of it, into the treaty.
[00:47:06.886 --> 00:47:08.827]  What does this signify that Trump's doing this?
[00:47:08.827 --> 00:47:12.529]  His doctor says Trump demanded it to get back to work quicker.
[00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:17.191]  Well, but then he said we had to take him to the hospital to give him these treatments because they're dangerous.
[00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:19.432]  He said that in a Saturday press conference.
[00:47:19.432 --> 00:47:23.714]  So then he really is incompetent if they're letting Trump be his own doctor.
[00:47:23.714 --> 00:47:26.835]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:47:26.835 --> 00:47:33.938]  Well, of course, we don't know if this is true or it isn't, but this fellow Conley is completely incompetent.
[00:47:33.938 --> 00:47:35.019]  He doesn't tell the truth.
[00:47:35.709 --> 00:47:41.794]  He wouldn't level up with us on the status of President Trump's lungs.
[00:47:41.794 --> 00:47:48.980]  For all we know, COVID could be destroying the president's lungs as we speak now.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.861]  He said he would.
[00:47:49.861 --> 00:47:51.903]  Oh, yeah, if he was dying, they wouldn't tell him.
[00:47:51.903 --> 00:47:52.944]  This is a perfect deep state.
[00:47:52.944 --> 00:47:54.625]  Good.
[00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:55.486]  That's right.
[00:47:55.486 --> 00:48:00.170]  So and, you know, I don't know those other doctors at Walter Reed, but
[00:48:00.734 --> 00:48:07.277]  I certainly would not take my family to a military hospital, that's for sure.
[00:48:07.277 --> 00:48:19.163]  I'd probably take them to, you know, if I lived in a district, I'd probably take them to GW based on the great job they did there for saving President Reagan.
[00:48:19.163 --> 00:48:21.083]  And I'd get civilian doctors.
[00:48:21.083 --> 00:48:25.245]  You have to understand, military doctors can't be sued for malpractice.
[00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:35.405]  Ferris doctrine by the US Supreme Court that you know if they commit malpractice, well, that's just too bad.
[00:48:35.405 --> 00:48:43.972]  So there's there's no mechanism to weed out incompetent doctors and understand this fellow is not a doctor.
[00:48:43.972 --> 00:48:46.714]  He's an osteopath.
[00:48:46.714 --> 00:48:47.154]  Why?
[00:48:47.154 --> 00:48:53.880]  I'm not a doctor and it says you don't give somebody Rendezvir unless they're deathly ill and the same thing with this biotech
[00:48:56.131 --> 00:48:57.111]  Right.
[00:48:57.111 --> 00:49:08.538]  You know, I'm not saying they're out to kill.
[00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:12.360]  You know, there's a conspiracy here to murder President Trump.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:21.965]  But given the way things are going, he very well could be dead, especially if we're starting out, as I said, with at least a 50% mortality rate.
[00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:30.432]  In someone his age and then you add in the obesity, right?
[00:49:30.432 --> 00:49:38.235]  So we really need to get him out of the medical, the military medicine system and over there.
[00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:40.956]  I said that Saturday we need to get him out of Walter Reed.
[00:49:40.956 --> 00:49:42.337]  So where would you send him?
[00:49:42.337 --> 00:49:46.059]  What do you think the best hospital is in the country?
[00:49:46.059 --> 00:49:50.101]  Well, obviously the best in the country, you know, is the Mayo Clinic.
[00:49:50.101 --> 00:49:53.082]  I've been up there myself with my mother for
[00:49:54.051 --> 00:50:05.276]  Experimental heart surgery and, you know, I went to Harvard and I had thought that the Harvard's Mass General Complex was the best in the world.
[00:50:05.276 --> 00:50:11.539]  But when I got up there to the Mayo Clinic, I was incredibly... That's what I've always been told, the Mayo Clinic's the best.
[00:50:11.539 --> 00:50:12.799]  It's the best, right.
[00:50:12.799 --> 00:50:18.522]  And, you know, the pros from Dover, as they say, are up there in the Mayo Clinic.
[00:50:18.522 --> 00:50:23.164]  So, I guess that's where I... Not with another military, but it's known to be about the worst.
[00:50:25.114 --> 00:50:26.034]  Yeah.
[00:50:26.034 --> 00:50:26.855]  That's well known.
[00:50:26.855 --> 00:50:28.455]  Sure.
[00:50:28.455 --> 00:50:28.775]  All right.
[00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:32.416]  So let's, let's, I mean, just in general, the troops get screwed over.
[00:50:32.416 --> 00:50:34.197]  Um, there's some good doctors there too, and great people.
[00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:34.877]  We're not putting them down.
[00:50:34.877 --> 00:50:38.698]  We're just, we're just saying statistically and got a little bit better under Trump.
[00:50:38.698 --> 00:50:40.679]  Shifting gears, big picture, COVID.
[00:50:40.679 --> 00:50:45.060]  There's a huge push to not implicate China, not implicate Fauci, not implicate Gates.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.541]  I've got big articles on that today.
[00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:48.701]  You were the first to implicate these guys.
[00:50:48.701 --> 00:50:49.442]  You were the first.
[00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:50.482]  It's been a firestorm.
[00:50:50.482 --> 00:50:52.263]  Any new developments for people?
[00:50:52.263 --> 00:50:53.263]  Any other little factoids?
[00:50:54.807 --> 00:51:17.524]  Yeah, what we have to keep in mind here, Alex, is this, that you're watching Fauci and all the so-called experts and big pharma trying to assure the American people and say, oh, don't worry, we're going to have any
[00:51:20.794 --> 00:51:25.816]  Emergency use approved by the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:30.317]  That's a total joke and a fraud and it is sick.
[00:51:30.317 --> 00:51:44.862]  If you look at the project there that I've gone through with you repeatedly before, a SARS-like cluster circulating back coronaviruses show potential
[00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:56.999]  for Human Emergence that has on there University of North Carolina and the Bat Queen from the Wuhan BSL-4.
[00:51:56.999 --> 00:52:07.783]  You will see that it clearly says on there who also participated in developing COVID-19.
[00:52:09.582 --> 00:52:19.987]  The National Center for Toxicological Research, Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson, Arkansas, USA.
[00:52:19.987 --> 00:52:21.308]  It's right on there.
[00:52:21.308 --> 00:52:25.790]  The FDA is up to its eyeballs in manufacturing
[00:52:26.277 --> 00:52:27.919]  COVID-19.
[00:52:27.919 --> 00:52:42.300]  So when all these people who are also up in their eyeballs manufacturing COVID-19, like Fauci, NIH, NIAID, the rest of them, the CDC, say, oh, you can trust the
[00:52:44.262 --> 00:52:45.162]  The FDA.
[00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:47.063]  That's a joke and a fraud.
[00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:52.605]  The FDA has a long history here.
[00:52:52.605 --> 00:53:05.670]  I helped defend Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn, the highest ranking military officer, to refuse to go to Gulf War I.
[00:53:06.928 --> 00:53:18.338]  Because, in part, she did not want to give experimental medical vaccines for biological warfare weapons for anthrax and botulinum.
[00:53:18.338 --> 00:53:19.479]  Okay?
[00:53:19.479 --> 00:53:33.972]  And those experimental medical vaccines were approved on an emergency basis by the FDA that Dr. Hewitt Vaughan resisted and refused to give to our troops.
[00:53:34.713 --> 00:53:42.041]  Well, we know for a fact that with the FDA's approval, 500,000 of our troops were injected
[00:53:45.797 --> 00:53:48.099]  With those experimental vaccines.
[00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:59.889]  I want to talk about that if you can do a few more minutes, Doctor, because we have Dr. Li Mingyan, who worked at the WHO Virus Monitoring Center in Hong Kong.
[00:53:59.889 --> 00:54:02.371]  And she said exactly what you've said.
[00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:07.335]  And then she backed all up in a big paper showing all the other groups that looked at the virus and said it was man-made.
[00:54:08.075 --> 00:54:10.437]  And she said there was a cover-up and they knew they were doing it.
[00:54:10.437 --> 00:54:18.463]  I mean you have a direct whistleblower inside the UN monitoring facility saying that and then now Facebook blocks Tucker Carlson for showing it.
[00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:27.390]  So the whole other scandal is censoring scientists, censoring experts, shutting them down and not just censoring, censoring
[00:54:28.382 --> 00:54:33.892]  Banning them, persecuting doctors, people getting fired that just talk about reality.
[00:54:33.892 --> 00:54:35.294]  This is an incredible agenda.
[00:54:35.294 --> 00:54:38.399]  Who gave Fauci and Bill Gates so much power?
[00:54:38.399 --> 00:54:39.882]  Back in two minutes, we'll talk about it.
[00:54:39.882 --> 00:54:40.302]  Stay with us.
[00:54:45.737 --> 00:54:48.200]  Stand back and stand by.

[00:56:00.054 --> 00:56:02.656]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[00:56:03.016 --> 00:56:09.201]  Because there's 13 different formulas in 8-Pak PowerStack, we are unable to secure it anymore.

[00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:58.826 --> 00:57:02.869]  You kept it going till the sun fell down.
[00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:05.490]  You kept it going, listeners.
[00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.232]  You kept us on air.
[00:57:07.232 --> 00:57:10.474]  And while they're pulling all this, we're still here.
[00:57:10.474 --> 00:57:13.115]  Defiance of their loveless power grab.
[00:57:25.646 --> 00:57:27.387]  Here's the big headline from GatewayPundit.com.
[00:57:27.387 --> 00:57:29.129]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:29.129 --> 00:57:33.632]  Are the global scientific elite trying to bury the truth about the origin of COVID-19?
[00:57:33.632 --> 00:57:35.473]  Is the sky blue?
[00:57:35.473 --> 00:57:38.655]  Do salmon live in rivers?
[00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:41.858]  Do bears go potty in the woods?
[00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.459]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:46.381]  And that's why Boyle thinks it was an accident.
[00:57:47.878 --> 00:57:48.078]  I think?
[00:58:02.932 --> 00:58:07.676]  Boyle's like, well, there's no way they'd release it when they get in trouble themselves, but maybe they just don't care.
[00:58:07.676 --> 00:58:17.803]  Maybe that's their plausible deniability, but regardless, all of the big tech, all of it lined up to cover up its origins, telling me that if more stuff gets out, even more deadly, no one's gonna get in trouble, Dr. Boyle.
[00:58:17.803 --> 00:58:26.049]  I mean, how important is it that the people behind COVID-19, Obama, Fauci, Bill Gates, be punished?
[00:58:26.049 --> 00:58:29.672]  Before we get there, let me conclude my point about
[00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:48.964]  The FDA allegedly certifying COVID-19 vaccines, which is a sick joke and a demented fraud, because when they certified on an emergency basis, these experimental medical vaccines for botulinum and anthrax,
[00:58:49.716 --> 00:59:13.504]  Out of 500,000 of our troops who were inoculated with the approval of the FDA, 11,000 of them died and 100,000 of them were disabled, all with the approval of the FDA and in violation of the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation.
[00:59:13.504 --> 00:59:19.066]  The FDA committed a Nuremberg crime on our own troops.
[00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:29.529]  These are the people now, and they were involved in the COVID-19 project here with the Bat Queen and UNC.
[00:59:29.529 --> 00:59:40.773]  So, of course, Big Pharma knows this, Fauci knows it, Niaid, Redfield, they all know that this will be a fantastic fraud.
[00:59:41.213 --> 00:59:53.658]  And existentially dangerous to be perpetrated on the American people that, oh, well, now we have a COVID-19 vaccine and it's been approved by the FDA.
[00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:57.979]  Big Pharma ran a big ad there in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:59:57.979 --> 01:00:04.021]  I read every day saying to the American people, oh, don't worry about our vaccines.
[01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.442]  They'll be approved by the FDA.
[01:00:06.442 --> 01:00:08.503]  Well, this is even, you know, even worse.
[01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.705]  Then the Fox being in charge of the chicken coop.
[01:00:11.705 --> 01:00:16.187]  Sure, it's just like saying, don't worry, I'm going to shoot you with a 12-gauge shotgun slug, but it's been approved by the FDA.
[01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:17.428]  What does that even mean?
[01:00:17.428 --> 01:00:19.109]  It means it's got liability protection.
[01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:20.910]  They're saying, don't worry, we're protected.
[01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:26.193]  Like Bill Gates said, a lot of you are going to get sick, but don't worry, the FDA is going to certify it.
[01:00:26.193 --> 01:00:37.259]  Right, and so just to give your listeners, your viewers, just a ballpark figure of what's going to happen here with these vaccines, again, on the U.S.
[01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:37.579]  troops,
[01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.730]  500,000 were injected.
[01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:45.592]  11,000 were killed, if not outright murdered.
[01:00:45.592 --> 01:00:53.359]  I accused, at the defense of Captain Dr. Hewitt Vaughn, that this is a Nuremberg crime on our own troops.
[01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:57.282]  And 100,000, one-fifth, were disabled.
[01:00:57.282 --> 01:01:01.686]  So, at a minimum, this is what, and they were prepared to do this.
[01:01:01.686 --> 01:01:04.968]  They did this, the FDA did this, to our own troops.
[01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:06.970]  We're not even talking.
[01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:11.275]  They set the table for the media to cover it up, for liability protection.
[01:01:11.275 --> 01:01:14.037]  What is the larger agenda then of making us do this?
[01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:14.878]  Depopulation?
[01:01:14.878 --> 01:01:15.519]  Sterilization?
[01:01:18.277 --> 01:01:21.439]  That's the only way to see it, that I see it now, right?
[01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:27.523]  And control, and depopulation, and debilitation, right?
[01:01:27.523 --> 01:01:28.724]  That's the agenda here.
[01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:31.026]  And of course, Alex... 60-second break.
[01:01:31.026 --> 01:01:32.567]  I'm going to do one more segment with Dr. Boyle.
[01:01:32.567 --> 01:01:37.170]  I want to come back and talk about big picture and how we can prosecute Bill Gates and others.
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.511]  This is so vital.
[01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:41.032]  And then we've got other special guest, Gavin McInnes, coming up.
[01:01:41.032 --> 01:01:41.713]  And I've got...
[01:01:42.313 --> 01:01:44.054]  So many angles to hit here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:46.877]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[01:01:46.877 --> 01:01:49.619]  This is such a huge, huge point in civilization.
[01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:55.663]  Stay with us.
[01:01:55.663 --> 01:02:03.049]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:11.716]  It's establishing a form of planetary digital law, where the technocrats are above the law,
[01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:16.519]  The public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[01:02:16.519 --> 01:02:22.201]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:25.582]  That is the post-human exterminist plan.
[01:02:25.582 --> 01:02:28.603]  That is the public ideology of the globalists.
[01:02:28.603 --> 01:02:36.145]  And everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[01:02:37.956 --> 01:02:46.142]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wombs will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[01:02:46.142 --> 01:02:52.846]  This is the satanic, ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[01:02:52.846 --> 01:02:58.650]  This is the essence of evil.
[01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:03.694]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:03:03.694 --> 01:03:05.195]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:03:07.253 --> 01:03:13.138]  Okay, Gavin McInnes of the Proud Boys is joining us coming up in a few minutes and we've got all this huge news.
[01:03:13.138 --> 01:03:15.960]  President Trump in Walter Reed Medical Facility.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:22.465]  We've got the best soldiers and there's a lot of good people in the military, but the doctors will tell you it's the lowest funding.
[01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:26.968]  I know doctors in the military, there's some good doctors, but they'll tell you a lot of them don't really have real degrees.
[01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:31.372]  The Pentagon will certify people from third world countries that don't have real degrees.
[01:03:31.372 --> 01:03:32.633]  They'll cut the wrong leg off.
[01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:33.813]  I mean, you've heard of malpractice.
[01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:35.174]  It's like, it's a nightmare.
[01:03:35.174 --> 01:03:36.696]  Any veteran will tell you the VA is a nightmare.
[01:03:37.316 --> 01:03:42.141]  It's getting a little bit better under Trump, but let's just say it's still, you don't send the commander-in-chief there.
[01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:47.186]  But Trump loves the military contract, contrary to what media says, and so he wanted to go there.
[01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.779]  And then they're giving him two experimental treatments.
[01:03:49.779 --> 01:03:53.182]  We already covered that, but some stages don't carry the first five minutes.
[01:03:53.182 --> 01:03:54.803]  Dr. Francis Boyle wrote the U.S.
[01:03:54.803 --> 01:03:55.824]  Biological Weapons Law.
[01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:56.724]  That got picked up.
[01:03:56.724 --> 01:03:58.426]  Much of it made into world law.
[01:03:58.426 --> 01:04:05.551]  He was getting into the Nuremberg Code, Geneva Convention, experimental testing on our troops with anthrax, botulism, 14,000 dead.
[01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:06.652]  This is on record.
[01:04:06.652 --> 01:04:10.034]  They're calling acceptable losses that violates law.
[01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:11.495]  You can make troops take vaccines.
[01:04:11.495 --> 01:04:12.096]  Only group you can't.
[01:04:12.096 --> 01:04:13.097]  You can't make a big experimental.
[01:04:13.857 --> 01:04:16.958]  So, now the public's being given experimental vaccines.
[01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:21.600]  Gates admits they have 80% getting sick, 20% going to the hospital.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.020]  They take his weaker vaccine.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.501]  What are they getting us ready for?
[01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:28.602]  Why are all these big pharma working in concert to cover this up?
[01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:29.782]  You knocked it out of the park.
[01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:31.603]  Recap that and go into more detail.
[01:04:31.603 --> 01:04:33.943]  Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:04:33.943 --> 01:04:38.305]  Right, and Alex, I just want to point out that on the anthrax and botulin
[01:04:39.426 --> 01:04:40.647]  Vaccines.
[01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:43.868]  The Pentagon lied about it, covered it up.
[01:04:43.868 --> 01:04:47.309]  They destroyed the records of our own troops.
[01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:51.811]  And they're still lying about it and covering it up today because they're all implicated.
[01:04:51.811 --> 01:05:02.175]  These are the same people that, you know, gave President Trump an osteopath to serve as his physician there at the White House.
[01:05:02.175 --> 01:05:03.416]  It's astounding.
[01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:08.435]  So we just cannot, you know, answer the president.
[01:05:08.435 --> 01:05:11.637]  We need to get him out of Walter Reed.
[01:05:11.637 --> 01:05:13.899]  They very well might kill him.
[01:05:13.899 --> 01:05:19.804]  And either if they can, you know, evacuate him up to Mayo Clinic, that'd be great.
[01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:27.531]  Otherwise, GW there that saved President Reagan's life from the jaws of death.
[01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:34.034]  And we can't be taking these COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:05:34.034 --> 01:05:45.720]  They will be just as deadly as the anthrax botulin experimental vaccines that were experimental bio warfare vaccines.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:54.605]  COVID-19 is biological warfare and it's far more dangerous than anthrax and botulin.
[01:05:54.605 --> 01:05:55.986]  We've been through that before.
[01:05:56.930 --> 01:06:07.500]  It's SARS, which is a biological warfare agent in the first place with gain of function to make it more lethal, more infectious.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.462]  It has HIV in there.
[01:06:09.462 --> 01:06:13.126]  Of course, we don't have a vaccine for HIV.
[01:06:13.126 --> 01:06:16.349]  We've tried for the last 20 years to get a vaccine for HIV.
[01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:19.553]  There is no vaccine for HIV.
[01:06:19.553 --> 01:06:23.378]  There's not going to be a vaccine for COVID-19.
[01:06:23.378 --> 01:06:29.266]  Even this French Nobel Prize winner in medicine has said the same thing.
[01:06:29.266 --> 01:06:32.451]  So the best thing we're going to be left with here, I believe,
[01:06:33.178 --> 01:06:40.182]  Are therapeutics and drugs, diet, taking care of yourself, and stuff of that nature.
[01:06:40.182 --> 01:06:47.787]  These vaccines, well, of course, they all want to make money, too, Alex, that's for sure.
[01:06:47.787 --> 01:06:52.010]  But you are right, there's a broader agenda here.
[01:06:52.010 --> 01:07:00.455]  Going back to the Kissinger National Security Memorandum, saying that it's the
[01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:04.957]  Yes, there's a broader agenda here, and we're just going to have to resist it.
[01:07:04.957 --> 01:07:06.218]  I'm peaceful, nonviolent.
[01:07:25.146 --> 01:07:32.810]  Exercise of our First Amendment rights and then fighting back by means of law in the courts.
[01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:37.553]  Sure, we have this Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:44.397]  We have my biological weapons anti-terrorism act, life imprisonment.
[01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:48.479]  So there are legal tools to fight back here.
[01:07:48.479 --> 01:07:48.679]  Yes.
[01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:08.739]  Sorry, I can't hear anything.
[01:08:08.739 --> 01:08:16.687]  As with any illness, there are frequent ups and downs over the course, particularly when a patient is being so closely watched 24 hours a day.
[01:08:16.687 --> 01:08:28.358]  We review and debate every finding, compare it to existing science and literature, weighing the risks and benefits of every intervention, its timing, as well as any potential impacts a delay may have.
[01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:36.332]  Over the course of his illness, the President has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation.
[01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:39.174]  We debated the reasons for this and whether we'd even intervene.
[01:08:39.174 --> 01:08:46.798]  It was a determination of the team, based predominantly on the timeline from the initial diagnosis, that we initiate dexamethasone.
[01:08:46.798 --> 01:08:56.663]  I'd like to take this opportunity now, given some speculation over the course of the illness the last couple days, update you on the course of his own illness.
[01:08:58.186 --> 01:09:08.312]  Thursday night into Friday morning when I left the bedside, the President was doing well, with only mild symptoms, and his oxygen was in the high 90s.
[01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:14.215]  Late Friday morning when I returned to the bedside, the President had a high fever, and his oxygen was in the high 90s.
[01:09:14.215 --> 01:09:20.339]  We are back live here, sorry to the stations, we have 10 seconds of dead air, that happens every once in a while, that makes your alarms go off.
[01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:23.301]  Dr. Boyle, continuing here,
[01:09:24.383 --> 01:09:30.968]  With what you just laid out, Kissinger, State Department memorandum 200, depopulating people.
[01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:38.213]  Clearly, they knew last year, the UN came out and said, our vaccines are hurting people, we're covering it up, what are we going to do?
[01:09:38.213 --> 01:09:43.977]  Well, they've just made this bigger hysteria out of this as a way to really set the precedent for forced inoculation.
[01:09:43.977 --> 01:09:49.441]  But how if they didn't get away with doing it in the military, because so many people died and got sick, where they have a captive group?
[01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:55.646]  How are they going to then try to guinea pig all of us and have us submit and then try to cover that up?
[01:09:55.646 --> 01:09:58.789]  It's not going to go well, I don't think.
[01:09:58.789 --> 01:10:00.170]  They're doing the best they can.
[01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:14.842]  You've already seen them saying in this new budget supplement, they're going to put money in there to try to indoctrinate the American people first to accept the COVID vaccines.
[01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:23.264]  And then if that doesn't work, they move to coercion, that if you want to work here, you've got to have the vaccine.
[01:10:23.264 --> 01:10:27.625]  If you want to go to school, you have to have the vaccine.
[01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:33.507]  If you want to come into this grocery store, you have to have the vaccine and proof of it.
[01:10:33.507 --> 01:10:35.347]  So that's the next stage.
[01:10:35.347 --> 01:10:37.988]  If they can't indoctrinate us and brainwash us,
[01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:44.752]  Well, I like President Trump trying to end these wars, but I don't like him, oh, we're warp speeding and
[01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:07.507]  We're confident.
[01:11:07.507 --> 01:11:12.037]  And then you see him rolling the dice, taking these treatments.
[01:11:12.037 --> 01:11:16.846]  The first thing I would do as a president, I would ask a second opinion if I've been taken to Walter Reed.
[01:11:17.987 --> 01:11:22.252]  So they can give me a treatment so dangerous, I'm going to be in the hospital to take it.
[01:11:22.252 --> 01:11:25.295]  And then now he says he's going home, hopefully in the next day or two.
[01:11:25.295 --> 01:11:27.317]  But they're going to keep administering these.
[01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:32.603]  And what I've learned about experimental treatments is, you may do good the first two or three, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth.
[01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:36.387]  You never know what is going to cause that problem and kill the president.
[01:11:36.387 --> 01:11:37.468]  And then they're going to say it's COVID-19.
[01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:40.237]  Right.
[01:11:40.237 --> 01:11:42.898]  You know, I'm not criticizing President Trump here.
[01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:48.161]  You know, he spent his whole career in the New York real estate business.
[01:11:48.161 --> 01:11:49.101]  Fine.
[01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:54.143]  But my dad was a plaintiff's lawyer up in Chicago.
[01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:59.026]  He had us kids treated at the top medical specialist in Chicago.
[01:11:59.026 --> 01:12:03.628]  I was at Harvard, Mass General, top doctors there.
[01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:14.892]  I explained to you my physician here, board certified internal medicine specialty in adult medicine.
[01:12:14.892 --> 01:12:28.796]  My wife is a lawyer and she specialized in defending doctors and the biggest hospital here in Central Illinois from medical malpractice cases.
[01:12:29.423 --> 01:12:33.024]  So, you know, the president doesn't really have any experience in this.
[01:12:33.024 --> 01:12:41.565]  I guess he's mistakenly put his trust in the military to provide him this advice.
[01:12:41.565 --> 01:12:50.807]  He probably thinks he's getting the best medical care he can over there at Walter Reed, but we both agreed it's completely inferior.
[01:12:50.807 --> 01:12:51.968]  Well, let's all pray for him.
[01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:53.308]  Thank you, Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:53.668]  Amazing.
[01:12:54.088 --> 01:12:57.011]  The planets have aligned globally.
[01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:58.152]  They've aligned nationally.
[01:12:58.152 --> 01:13:02.397]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:09.864]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[01:13:09.864 --> 01:13:32.678]  So that's why Big Tech, controlled by the very dark forces that love us, is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and try to control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance.
[01:13:33.038 --> 01:13:34.780]  We're good to go.
[01:13:53.672 --> 01:14:02.998]  Our partnership with My Patriot Supply to give you the lowest discounts possible on food has led to new ways to save on preparing your family for what comes next.

[01:14:56.828 --> 01:14:59.443]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.603]  All right, I get obsessed all day over Trump and Walter Reed.
[01:15:29.603 --> 01:15:30.523]  It's all up to God.
[01:15:30.523 --> 01:15:34.827]  I don't just come up here and say something to be sensational.
[01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:41.674]  Analysts across the board say to give somebody Rendezivir and to give them this other cocktail together is insane.
[01:15:41.674 --> 01:15:44.096]  Both of them are very dangerous.
[01:15:44.096 --> 01:15:47.639]  It's exactly what Fauci would do.
[01:15:47.639 --> 01:15:50.382]  And Trump's a bull to not be more sick right now.
[01:15:51.963 --> 01:15:53.864]  I don't think Trump staged this.
[01:15:53.864 --> 01:15:54.985]  He looks like he's lost some weight.
[01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:55.885]  He looks ashen.
[01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:59.447]  His voice is sore.
[01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:01.568]  His voice is a little bit scratchy.
[01:16:01.568 --> 01:16:03.689]  But people get sick.
[01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:04.509]  They get pneumonias.
[01:16:04.509 --> 01:16:05.210]  They get colds.
[01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:13.074]  Now the idea, because they designed these tests where everybody is false positive, basically, it's this hysteria.
[01:16:14.181 --> 01:16:21.366]  And I have neighbors and stuff, man, that come over wearing their mask and I just said, I said, I've never, I tell them, I said, I can't talk to you.
[01:16:21.366 --> 01:16:26.609]  I just can't play along with the Kabuki theater.
[01:16:26.609 --> 01:16:32.353]  Anyone will die if they do not have their essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:16:32.353 --> 01:16:36.115]  When you don't have them, you get a cold or a flu and you die.
[01:16:36.115 --> 01:16:39.717]  In almost every case, you get a flu or a cold because you
[01:16:41.952 --> 01:16:48.214]  A, you don't have the vitamins and minerals, or because you're diabetic, your body can't move the nutrients around.
[01:16:48.214 --> 01:16:56.737]  So it's either you don't have the vitamins and minerals, or your blood can't get them moved around.
[01:16:56.737 --> 01:17:02.199]  So, and I know as an audience you know that, but that's really a public service announcement.
[01:17:02.199 --> 01:17:07.601]  Because going into this fall and winter, we always have most of the deaths then, and why is that?
[01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:10.502]  People are inside, they're not getting sunshine,
[01:17:12.366 --> 01:17:15.147]  And they don't have vitamin D3.
[01:17:15.147 --> 01:17:21.611]  If you're missing one vital nutrient, you die.
[01:17:21.611 --> 01:17:23.391]  They never put it on your toe tag.
[01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:24.112]  You died of that.
[01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:27.713]  This is a fact and I've told the story a hundred times.
[01:17:27.713 --> 01:17:28.454]  I've had family.
[01:17:30.191 --> 01:17:32.332]  I've had federal agents I know.
[01:17:32.332 --> 01:17:34.233]  I've had lawyers I know.
[01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:36.434]  I've had people I know.
[01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:48.279]  I mean, the other day I was with two really smart lawyers and they go, Alex, you said like eight months ago we need vitamin D3 and that we need vitamin C. How'd you know that?
[01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:55.001]  And it's like saying, how do I need 93 octane for my Dodge Charger or my F-150 pickup?
[01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:58.283]  I mean, it's like, how did you know that you needed diesel for your
[01:18:00.265 --> 01:18:00.765]  Diesel?
[01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:10.272]  Well, if you're a diesel truck, I... You know, on the side of a chainsaw, it says the type of oil to use.
[01:18:10.272 --> 01:18:13.514]  Well, in the science, it's settled!
[01:18:13.514 --> 01:18:19.238]  If you don't have vital nutrients, and you're not absorbing them, and you're not getting them into your cells, you die!
[01:18:19.238 --> 01:18:19.798]  Die!
[01:18:19.798 --> 01:18:20.318]  Die!
[01:18:20.318 --> 01:18:20.839]  Die!
[01:18:20.839 --> 01:18:21.359]  Die!
[01:18:21.359 --> 01:18:21.879]  Die!
[01:18:21.879 --> 01:18:22.240]  Die!
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:30.205]  And the public is so malnourished, and so dumbed down, and on so much fast food, and we're all guilty of it,
[01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:37.793]  Most of us are.
[01:18:37.793 --> 01:18:39.495]  That we're sitting ducks.
[01:18:39.495 --> 01:18:42.037]  And Trump at 74, eating fast food.
[01:18:42.037 --> 01:18:49.585]  You know why he eats fast food, right?
[01:18:49.585 --> 01:18:51.027]  They send the Secret Service around.
[01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.489]  I was told this before it was in the news.
[01:18:53.489 --> 01:18:54.290]  He likes it anyways.
[01:18:55.231 --> 01:19:00.694]  Because they'll go to one McDonald's this time, one Burger King this time, one Wendy's that time.
[01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.175]  Because they don't trust these places.
[01:19:02.175 --> 01:19:03.816]  They're not jacked with his food.
[01:19:03.816 --> 01:19:04.596]  Can you imagine?
[01:19:04.596 --> 01:19:06.037]  They'll just eat the White House food.
[01:19:06.037 --> 01:19:06.857]  He doesn't trust them.
[01:19:06.857 --> 01:19:14.621]  He's got spies all around him.
[01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:17.603]  It's crazy.
[01:19:17.603 --> 01:19:20.684]  You know, Sean Hannity gets his food messed with.
[01:19:20.684 --> 01:19:21.805]  I know my food's been messed with.
[01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:27.471]  They don't just take your bank accounts.
[01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:31.353]  They don't just take your credit card processing away.
[01:19:31.353 --> 01:19:37.236]  They don't just de-platforming off the internet.
[01:19:37.236 --> 01:19:44.478]  They take your food, and they put snot in it, and boogers in it, and they wipe their ass on it.
[01:19:44.478 --> 01:19:45.699]  And that's what they do.
[01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:47.640]  Because that's what the left does, is they're a bunch of cowards.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.080]  They never fight up front.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.701]  They have no chivalry.
[01:19:50.701 --> 01:19:51.821]  They have no bottom.
[01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.122]  They support pedophilia.
[01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.343]  They support Satanism.
[01:19:54.343 --> 01:19:55.203]  They support garbage.
[01:19:57.435 --> 01:20:04.140]  Gavin McInnes is going to be joining us, but I wanted to play these two clips to remind everybody of what Trump critically said in the last month.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.425]  This is back on August 7th, so a month and almost two months ago.
[01:20:09.425 --> 01:20:09.785]  Watch.
[01:20:09.785 --> 01:20:19.833]  Trump says, this may be the last time you'll see me for a while, because he was cutting out the middlemen with prescription drug makers while we have the highest prices in the world.
[01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.755]  And he went on, in another statement he made,
[01:20:23.769 --> 01:20:33.134]  Just a few days ago, last week, saying, the troops, the soldiers love me, but the top brass don't.
[01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:34.474]  I'm trying to end these wars.
[01:20:34.474 --> 01:20:36.335]  So here's both clips.
[01:20:36.335 --> 01:20:37.796]  I have a lot of enemies out there.
[01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:39.857]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[01:20:39.857 --> 01:20:45.180]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:49.162]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's going to do what I do.
[01:20:50.492 --> 01:20:59.694]  In a White House briefing, the President said he felt Pentagon seniors would not have felt the same way because of his success at preventing wars.
[01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:03.135]  I'm not saying the military is in love with me, the soldiers are.
[01:21:03.135 --> 01:21:14.177]  The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.
[01:21:15.546 --> 01:21:23.110]  The President also floated the idea of an economic decoupling from China as trade tensions intensify.
[01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:30.534]  Trump praised China's spending increase in US agricultural goods before teasing a sharp financial break.
[01:21:32.122 --> 01:21:37.507]  When you mention the word decouple, it's an interesting word.
[01:21:37.507 --> 01:21:43.692]  So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn't do business with them, we wouldn't lose billions of dollars.
[01:21:43.692 --> 01:21:46.994]  It's called decoupling, so you'll start thinking about it.
[01:21:46.994 --> 01:21:53.260]  We're at war with China, and there's all these Chinese globalist interests that sold America out and made trillions!
[01:21:54.858 --> 01:22:01.263]  So, of course, their whole operating system is about hating America and hating justice and hating it, because that's what you need to do if you're gutting a country.
[01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:02.163]  You need to have that attitude.
[01:22:02.163 --> 01:22:06.427]  You need to enjoy what you're doing and not feel guilty for it.
[01:22:06.427 --> 01:22:09.869]  We're going to go to break, but I want to direct listeners to preparewithalex.com.
[01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:21.258]  That's where you're going to find the lowest prices on high-quality, storable food anywhere, even better than infomorestore.com, because contractually, we're a distributor, so we get the same price they sell for on their site and that all the distributors sell for.
[01:22:21.258 --> 01:22:23.940]  They're the biggest storable food company in the United States, probably the world.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.920]  But, there's a loophole.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.962]  If they have a special that they can do occasionally, on their site itself, they can go an additional 5 or 10 percent.
[01:22:31.962 --> 01:22:34.382]  So, they're selling this almost at their cost.
[01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.563]  We make a little bit of money to fund their operation.
[01:22:36.563 --> 01:22:37.923]  It's a favor I asked them.
[01:22:37.923 --> 01:22:39.203]  We did it.
[01:22:39.203 --> 01:22:41.024]  It's a favor passed on to you.
[01:22:41.024 --> 01:22:42.084]  You need swearable food.
[01:22:42.084 --> 01:22:45.005]  You need to check off that box for preparedness.
[01:22:45.005 --> 01:22:49.565]  I believe, just like guns are all sold out and ammo is all sold out, food is going to be sold out again.
[01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:51.606]  They're shipping within a week now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.090]  Other storable food companies, oh, you know, we got it right away.
[01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:56.350]  They'd make you wait eight weeks.
[01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:57.250]  No.
[01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.510]  We've got all the food delivered.
[01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:01.711]  They've got it now with only a one-week wait.
[01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:02.972]  But here's the problem.
[01:23:02.972 --> 01:23:04.352]  Food prices are going up.
[01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:10.293]  The food chain, the delivery chain, the supply chain has broken down.
[01:23:10.293 --> 01:23:15.335]  And so they're going to have to raise prices upwards of 20%.
[01:23:15.335 --> 01:23:17.295]  Very, very soon.
[01:23:17.295 --> 01:23:20.556]  And so they're letting the dust settle right now, but this is the last chance to get it.
[01:23:21.744 --> 01:23:24.426]  At the super discount, preparewithalex.com.
[01:23:24.426 --> 01:23:25.847]  They have a one-year food supply.
[01:23:25.847 --> 01:23:28.448]  $600 off, their already lowest price.
[01:23:28.448 --> 01:23:30.049]  $300 off a six-month food supply.
[01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:38.334]  $160 off a three-month and a bunch of other big specials on solar charger systems that are top of the line and water filtration with big discounts.
[01:23:38.334 --> 01:23:42.117]  It's gonna end in 14 hours at preparewithalex.com or 888-411-0350.
[01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:42.417]  That's 888-411-0350.
[01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.137]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:23:53.102 --> 01:24:06.885]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:24:06.885 --> 01:24:10.726]  Infowars has been banned.
[01:24:10.726 --> 01:24:11.186]  Arrested.
[01:24:11.186 --> 01:24:17.408]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:19.088]  Because we are effective.
[01:24:20.586 --> 01:24:22.547]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:24:22.547 --> 01:24:24.849]  Go to Band.Video.
[01:24:24.849 --> 01:24:29.032]  Download the videos and share.
[01:24:29.032 --> 01:24:36.277]  Support the Information War at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:24:36.277 --> 01:24:38.439]  And never give up the fight.
[01:24:38.439 --> 01:24:49.306]  InfoWar.com
[01:24:52.381 --> 01:25:01.045]  Remember, the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people all over the world.
[01:25:01.045 --> 01:25:06.008]  The globalists have a plan for total vertical integration.
[01:25:06.008 --> 01:25:14.672]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[01:25:14.672 --> 01:25:16.894]  But that is only a means to an end.
[01:25:17.934 --> 01:25:27.359]  Once they have the electronic straitjacket in place, they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:34.663]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer.
[01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.544]  Most cancer is viral.
[01:25:36.544 --> 01:25:38.044]  That's a big secret.
[01:25:38.044 --> 01:25:40.506]  But the secret is beginning to come out.
[01:25:40.506 --> 01:25:42.267]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[01:25:43.067 --> 01:25:52.035]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[01:25:52.035 --> 01:25:55.218]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[01:25:55.218 --> 01:26:03.785]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[01:26:03.785 --> 01:26:06.488]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[01:26:07.348 --> 01:26:22.561]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:29.926]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[01:26:29.926 --> 01:26:33.769]  This is their stated goal.
[01:26:33.769 --> 01:26:42.014]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[01:26:42.014 --> 01:26:43.255]  Let me turn this around.
[01:26:43.255 --> 01:26:49.459]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[01:26:49.459 --> 01:26:51.060]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[01:26:54.082 --> 01:27:09.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:10.610]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:13.251]  We're getting Gavin McInnes on.
[01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:15.793]  He's been really demonized for founding the Proud Boys.
[01:27:15.793 --> 01:27:18.594]  We're getting him lined up right now.
[01:27:22.546 --> 01:27:38.852]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have a live 40-hour broadcast starting Wednesday at 8 a.m., running through midnight the next day.
[01:27:38.852 --> 01:27:46.475]  And we'll be covering the vice presidential debate, which will be very, very interesting.
[01:27:46.475 --> 01:27:48.396]  Hopefully, it's better than the last one.
[01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:51.097]  The presidents, Pence versus Harris.
[01:27:53.342 --> 01:27:57.385]  And so again, that will be unfolding Wednesday night, 8 a.m.
[01:27:57.385 --> 01:27:57.745]  Central.
[01:27:57.745 --> 01:28:01.848]  We kick off, and we run right through into the middle of the night the next night.
[01:28:01.848 --> 01:28:04.549]  Please be sure and join us.
[01:28:04.549 --> 01:28:08.912]  Infowars pits versus Harris.
[01:28:08.912 --> 01:28:10.653]  And remember, big tech thinks you're idiots.
[01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:13.515]  They think you habitualize to Facebook, to Twitter, to YouTube.
[01:28:13.515 --> 01:28:19.119]  And then if they shadow ban people, and we build our own website, our own satellite uplinks, our own video streaming site that, oh,
[01:28:20.492 --> 01:28:29.078]  You won't promote it, but then you do start promoting it, so YouTube and Google and Facebook and Twitter start blocking ban.videolinks.
[01:28:29.078 --> 01:28:35.201]  So we just change it to electioncenter2020.com or 2020electioncenter.com.
[01:28:35.201 --> 01:28:39.464]  That's just a clone of the site with all the same URLs, the very same videos.
[01:28:39.464 --> 01:28:41.906]  And so this is a war.
[01:28:43.123 --> 01:28:46.886]  And you have to be in the mindset of a war, not just passively dealing with that.
[01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:49.828]  So as soon as we get Gavin on, we'll go to him.
[01:28:49.828 --> 01:28:54.252]  We're not keeping him on hold.
[01:28:54.252 --> 01:28:57.434]  But something else we promised to do, and we finally got it done.
[01:28:57.434 --> 01:29:01.017]  I would give it an A-, which is really good for a site that just got launched.
[01:29:01.017 --> 01:29:02.699]  We're going to be tweaking it, adding a lot of new features.
[01:29:02.699 --> 01:29:05.981]  I want to say that the crew did a fabulous job.
[01:29:05.981 --> 01:29:07.883]  Our small IT department working overtime.
[01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.371]  Has redesigned Infowars.com.
[01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:17.652]  It was operating on a design from really about 2008 that had been updated a few years ago.
[01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:21.534]  And that was a venerable site, but it's no longer a blue background.
[01:29:21.534 --> 01:29:23.754]  It's white on black, very easy on the eyes.
[01:29:23.754 --> 01:29:25.955]  Got some of the cleanest, best fonts out there.
[01:29:25.955 --> 01:29:27.815]  And a lot of great functions are there.
[01:29:27.815 --> 01:29:29.296]  A lot of great functions are being added.
[01:29:29.296 --> 01:29:36.818]  But we're taking your feedback at showtipsatinfowars.com.
[01:29:37.864 --> 01:29:47.251]  But you can find all the news, all the articles, all the videos, all the special reports, and more at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:47.251 --> 01:29:49.693]  It is a new site designed loads.
[01:29:51.089 --> 01:29:54.152]  Something like 10 times faster, much easier to search.
[01:29:54.152 --> 01:29:59.016]  But as I said, the writers and the IT folks were working together to get this done.
[01:29:59.016 --> 01:30:02.820]  And so I want to commend Kit Daniels and I want to commend Michael Zimmerman.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:12.528]  I want to commend everybody and the whole team, Ben, everybody over there, Timothy, all the crew that got this done.
[01:30:12.528 --> 01:30:13.509]  And it's a first-rate site.
[01:30:13.509 --> 01:30:16.332]  You know, I got really jealous of Paul Watson's summit.news site.
[01:30:17.697 --> 01:30:21.638]  I mean, jealous, kind of like you get jealous of your own right hand, but you know what I mean.
[01:30:21.638 --> 01:30:26.019]  And I said, hey, can we not have something like this?
[01:30:26.019 --> 01:30:28.780]  And so we got it done, and I think it rivals Summit.News.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:32.141]  We're not in competition with Summit.News, but that's a first-rate site.
[01:30:32.141 --> 01:30:43.244]  So now we have InfoWars.com redesigned, and send your ideas, we're closely watching it, to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:30:43.244 --> 01:30:43.604]  It's not?
[01:30:44.748 --> 01:30:53.771]  It's not red like the bowels of Satan, like Joe Rogan's new studio, where you rotisserie roast different slabs of meat.
[01:30:53.771 --> 01:30:56.551]  Actually, Joe's new studio is growing on me.
[01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:59.612]  Joe's new studio is growing on me greatly.
[01:30:59.612 --> 01:31:04.034]  Tim Dillon was in town last week, and I missed the calls I got.
[01:31:04.034 --> 01:31:10.596]  I had my phone turned off, but regardless, the planets, I'm sure, will realign very, very soon.
[01:31:10.596 --> 01:31:11.876]  But, back to what I was saying.
[01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:19.433]  I one day hoped to be in the rotisserie chicken.
[01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:23.675]  You know, Joe told me about a studio before he built it.
[01:31:23.675 --> 01:31:27.798]  He told me how they were building it, what they did, and I said, well, that sounds interesting.
[01:31:27.798 --> 01:31:31.861]  I don't think Joe's talked about what he's inside yet.
[01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:36.904]  I don't think anyone knows that he's inside something.
[01:31:36.904 --> 01:31:39.645]  So when I go over there, I'm going to show you this.
[01:31:39.645 --> 01:31:40.286]  Right down the street.
[01:31:42.858 --> 01:31:46.842]  Who knew that Ganesh would be inside a whale?
[01:31:46.842 --> 01:31:49.344]  Yeah.
[01:31:49.344 --> 01:31:54.288]  Ooh, maybe they think people will search where there was a giant blue whale and figure it out.
[01:31:54.288 --> 01:31:55.249]  I don't know.
[01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:59.774]  But the inside of a whale is red!
[01:31:59.774 --> 01:32:05.058]  So it's atomically... Atomic is the wrong word.
[01:32:05.058 --> 01:32:07.160]  It's very close to atomic.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.181]  It means body parts.
[01:32:09.474 --> 01:32:10.275]  Automically?
[01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:16.098]  I'm having one of those slip moments where I can't say the word here and it's not good.
[01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:19.620]  Atomically.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.081]  Anatomically.
[01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:22.462]  Anatomically.
[01:32:22.462 --> 01:32:23.222]  Anatomically.
[01:32:23.222 --> 01:32:24.623]  Yes, thank you.
[01:32:24.623 --> 01:32:27.465]  Anatomically.
[01:32:27.465 --> 01:32:34.489]  You know, here's what happens to me more and more, to be quite frank with everybody.
[01:32:34.489 --> 01:32:36.130]  You know, I know what they're rolling out.
[01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:37.011]  I know what they're doing.
[01:32:37.011 --> 01:32:38.171]  I know what they're planning next.
[01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:43.868]  I just get to a point where I just can't do it.
[01:32:43.868 --> 01:32:46.909]  I get to a point sometimes where I know why people run and hide.
[01:32:46.909 --> 01:32:48.389]  I know why folks just say, I don't care.
[01:32:48.389 --> 01:32:54.271]  I was talking to a guy today and he's like, well-known, nice guy, business guy.
[01:32:54.271 --> 01:32:56.051]  He's like, Alex, I used to think you were crazy.
[01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:58.912]  It's all true now, everything you said.
[01:32:58.912 --> 01:33:02.933]  So I just want to find a farm or something and never be seen again.
[01:33:02.933 --> 01:33:06.073]  And I said, brother, I'm exactly the same.
[01:33:06.073 --> 01:33:07.874]  Find 50 acres, never leave it again.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.521]  You had the money, more.
[01:33:11.521 --> 01:33:18.323]  But you can't do that because the globalist system is going to collapse everything they admit to make you submit you're exactly who they want to get.
[01:33:18.323 --> 01:33:20.403]  And so you're going to have to fight this system.
[01:33:20.403 --> 01:33:24.144]  You're going to have to stand up.
[01:33:24.144 --> 01:33:25.485]  It's what you're going to have to do.
[01:33:25.485 --> 01:33:28.546]  There's not going to be any hiding from this.
[01:33:28.546 --> 01:33:34.588]  We're not going to get away from this without standing up to it.
[01:33:34.588 --> 01:33:35.408]  It's just simple.
[01:33:36.513 --> 01:33:39.814]  People stood up our ancestors, they demanded freedom and demanded justice.
[01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.975]  We built one of the freest, greatest societies ever.
[01:33:41.975 --> 01:33:45.577]  We became a bunch of wimps and now all hell has broken loose.
[01:33:45.577 --> 01:33:52.600]  Now, President Trump a few days ago had this to say about the Proud Boys.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:58.622]  So I thought we'd hear what the President had to say and then actually get the founder of the Proud Boys on, Gavin McGinnis.
[01:33:58.622 --> 01:33:59.583]  Here's what Trump had to say.
[01:34:01.051 --> 01:34:09.519]  ...that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland.
[01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:12.542]  Sure, I'm willing to do that.
[01:34:12.542 --> 01:34:17.247]  I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.
[01:34:17.247 --> 01:34:18.528]  What are you saying?
[01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:20.029]  I'm willing to do anything.
[01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:20.750]  I want to see peace.
[01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:21.511]  Then do it, sir.
[01:34:21.511 --> 01:34:22.031]  Say it.
[01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:22.412]  Do it.
[01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:22.692]  Say it.
[01:34:23.715 --> 01:34:24.916]  You want to call him?
[01:34:24.916 --> 01:34:25.697]  What do you want to call him?
[01:34:25.697 --> 01:34:26.258]  Give me a name.
[01:34:26.258 --> 01:34:27.620]  Give me a name.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.144]  White supremacist and right problem.
[01:34:31.144 --> 01:34:34.308]  Stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what.
[01:34:34.308 --> 01:34:35.389]  I'll tell you what.
[01:34:35.389 --> 01:34:40.075]  Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left.
[01:34:40.075 --> 01:34:40.596]  Wow.
[01:34:40.596 --> 01:34:42.618]  So you're a white supremacist now.
[01:34:42.618 --> 01:34:43.139]  They're saying.
[01:34:45.353 --> 01:34:49.557]  That the man up in Kenosha, Rittenhouse is a white supremacist, suits have been filed.
[01:34:49.557 --> 01:34:51.939]  Gab McGinnis, thanks for coming on.
[01:34:51.939 --> 01:34:53.000]  What's it like?
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.842]  I was the center of things four years ago, the bad guy.
[01:34:55.842 --> 01:34:58.124]  You were a side dish, but still prominent.
[01:34:58.124 --> 01:34:59.706]  But you're number one bad guy right now.
[01:35:03.093 --> 01:35:04.013]  Isn't it funny?
[01:35:04.013 --> 01:35:05.314]  Based on what?
[01:35:05.314 --> 01:35:06.355]  Based on what research?
[01:35:06.355 --> 01:35:16.142]  And what's crazy about it, too, is the radical left can burn down this country for four months straight, and they go, yeah, but these guys are the problem.
[01:35:16.142 --> 01:35:16.462]  Why?
[01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:19.704]  Because one of them might have shot someone.
[01:35:19.704 --> 01:35:23.567]  No, Kyle Rittenhouse is not a proud boy, and Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong.
[01:35:23.567 --> 01:35:24.968]  Where is this?
[01:35:24.968 --> 01:35:26.509]  Where are these white supremacists?
[01:35:28.154 --> 01:35:33.296]  Well, look, we all know they're scared of Proud Boys because it's inclusive, and men are sick of being told we're scum.
[01:35:33.296 --> 01:35:39.837]  So it's a great idea to have a group of fraternal men that are proud of the West and America, of every race, color, and creed, and even sexual persuasion.
[01:35:39.837 --> 01:35:42.438]  And they're threatened by the inclusiveness, and they're scared.
[01:35:42.438 --> 01:35:44.099]  So that's why they've demonized you.
[01:35:44.099 --> 01:35:53.602]  So that's why they've... Well, you know what's ironic about the gay thing, too, is they've put these... To fight back, you've got celebrities like George Takei saying, let's make the Proud Boys hashtag gay.
[01:35:53.602 --> 01:35:54.822]  That'll drive them nuts.
[01:35:55.855 --> 01:36:14.360]  And the irony is there's more gays in Proud Boys than they are represented in the population because every time a gay man comes out to support Trump, the gay community totally ostracizes him, vilifies him, kicks him out of clubs, he loses all his friends because they are intolerant.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.461]  So we take them in because we don't care if you're gay or Jewish or black or brown.
[01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:21.682]  As long as you're pro-West, you're in.
[01:36:22.582 --> 01:36:29.587]  And so the irony of this whole thing is that we are the tolerant ones and they're the intolerant ones.
[01:36:29.587 --> 01:36:30.848]  You're absolutely right.
[01:36:30.848 --> 01:36:35.871]  When we come back, let's get more into this and where you see this election going with 28 days left.
[01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:38.933]  I remember asking you like four years ago, what is peak SJW?
[01:36:38.933 --> 01:36:40.895]  And you said, I don't think there is a peak.
[01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:45.498]  I think that statement has been proven to be like some Einsteinian theory of relativity proven right.
[01:36:45.498 --> 01:36:47.119]  I mean, it's like there is no peak.
[01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:48.099]  There is no bottom.
[01:36:48.099 --> 01:36:49.140]  There is no end.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:49.981]  So how does it end?
[01:36:50.521 --> 01:36:54.946]  We have a new week of massive savings at preparewithalex.com.
[01:36:54.946 --> 01:37:03.235]  Our partnership with MyPatriotSupply to give you the lowest discounts possible has led to new ways to save on preparing your family for what comes next.
[01:37:03.235 --> 01:37:09.902]  For the next seven days, we work together to give you rock-bottom prices on things you'll need in case of an emergency.

[01:37:36.707 --> 01:37:40.109]  Plus, each purchase goes to support the InfoWars crew.
[01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:43.430]  But these deep discounts will only last until the end of the week.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:50.714]  Order online or call to place an order at 888-411-0350 or preparewithalex.com.
[01:37:50.714 --> 01:37:56.237]  This is your last chance to get a Peck PowerStack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[01:37:56.237 --> 01:38:01.399]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[01:38:01.399 --> 01:38:03.741]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[01:38:03.741 --> 01:38:06.322]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[01:38:06.682 --> 01:38:12.864]  Because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[01:38:12.864 --> 01:38:21.467]  This is the highest in am-pm pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[01:38:21.467 --> 01:38:21.947]  It's amazing.
[01:38:21.947 --> 01:38:26.228]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it.
[01:38:26.508 --> 01:38:26.808]  And perhaps...
[01:38:53.854 --> 01:39:11.684]  Most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications of COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have died, probably by the time I finish this talk.
[01:39:11.684 --> 01:39:17.587]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar, part of the establishment for close to 50 years.
[01:39:17.587 --> 01:39:19.308]  But now, boy, has this
[01:39:19.428 --> 01:39:28.215]  As the brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage of the world, the 2020 election.
[01:39:28.215 --> 01:39:31.357]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[01:39:31.357 --> 01:39:38.503]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, when not even one-tenth of 1% have actually died.
[01:39:38.503 --> 01:39:46.429]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain-damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[01:39:46.929 --> 01:39:49.155]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[01:39:49.155 --> 01:39:50.398]  It is beyond bizarre.
[01:39:51.733 --> 01:39:58.698]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[01:39:58.698 --> 01:40:04.141]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[01:40:04.141 --> 01:40:20.892]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well.
[01:40:21.272 --> 01:40:33.498]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[01:40:33.498 --> 01:40:38.740]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.862]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[01:40:41.862 --> 01:40:48.665]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfoWarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[01:40:48.665 --> 01:40:49.846]  InfoWarstore.com.
[01:40:55.057 --> 01:40:57.668]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:07.829 --> 01:41:14.374]  We now take you live to the most sinister, most evil guest possible.
[01:41:14.374 --> 01:41:17.316]  Called by Brian Stelter, The Baby Headlines.
[01:41:17.316 --> 01:41:21.939]  Of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:41:21.939 --> 01:41:29.785]  The most evil guest alive on planet Earth, the man known as Baby Hitler, is Gavin McInnes.
[01:41:31.203 --> 01:41:33.025]  Of course, I'm joking, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:33.025 --> 01:41:39.310]  You know, Kyle Rittenhouse's lawyer is suing the Biden campaign for calling him a white supremacist.
[01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:48.158]  The idea that you go out and you're a medic and you're an observer and you go show all this and then you get attacked, you defend yourself, but they called you a white supremacist.
[01:41:48.158 --> 01:41:50.861]  Disavow the proud boy white supremacist to the president.
[01:41:52.025 --> 01:41:55.827]  Trump's like, well, I'm not quite sure who they are, but I know he knows who you are.
[01:41:55.827 --> 01:41:58.129]  And he's just simply saying, yeah, stand down.
[01:41:58.129 --> 01:42:00.570]  It's the left burning everything, Gavin.
[01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:02.111]  So you founded Proud Boys.
[01:42:02.111 --> 01:42:04.852]  For people that don't know, tell them what it is.
[01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:09.615]  You stepped down, kind of like Moses stepping down, just because you want them to run their own organization.
[01:42:09.615 --> 01:42:10.816]  But they've never been violent.
[01:42:10.816 --> 01:42:12.237]  They've never been offensive.
[01:42:12.237 --> 01:42:13.817]  They've never been racist.
[01:42:13.817 --> 01:42:15.398]  And now it's a major campaign issue.
[01:42:15.398 --> 01:42:16.219]  Where do you see this going?
[01:42:17.972 --> 01:42:25.055]  Well, I think what Trump disavowed it because what the left likes to do is they find a group, right?
[01:42:25.055 --> 01:42:28.297]  They make you either love them or hate them.
[01:42:28.297 --> 01:42:34.400]  And then if you say love them, then they go through and they'll find something someone did once.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.460]  It was a sin.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.681]  And now that's attached to you.
[01:42:36.681 --> 01:42:40.323]  So Trump was saying, look, I'm not going to be responsible for this entire club.
[01:42:40.323 --> 01:42:41.343]  I'm not going to play your game.
[01:42:41.343 --> 01:42:43.624]  I'm going to avoid this game entirely.
[01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:46.626]  But what's amazing is that they can take a multiracial
[01:42:47.384 --> 01:42:52.278]  Men's Club with Proud Boys Israel run by a black Hispanic!
[01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:58.814]  And rife with homosexuals, and make it into a homophobic Nazi group.
[01:42:58.814 --> 01:43:02.015]  I mean, we never go to their things, they come to our things, right?
[01:43:02.015 --> 01:43:03.756]  All they've ever done is self-defense.
[01:43:03.756 --> 01:43:05.497]  Antifa have had a million events.
[01:43:05.497 --> 01:43:06.638]  Proud Boys don't go to them.
[01:43:06.638 --> 01:43:09.019]  Antifa comes to every single Proud Boy event.
[01:43:09.019 --> 01:43:11.760]  They also, by the way, go to conservative speakers.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:17.583]  If you were to do a talk at a university, Antifa would be there hurling feces, urine, batteries, attacking people.
[01:43:17.583 --> 01:43:21.105]  Let's not forget that they attacked your buddies in New York and then put them in jail.
[01:43:23.061 --> 01:43:26.423]  My friends, Max and John, Proud Boys, one of them has a black wife.
[01:43:26.423 --> 01:43:30.386]  Check her out at JusticeForLiberty.com where we do the fundraising for them.
[01:43:30.386 --> 01:43:37.591]  Still appealing, the charge, but Antifa were vandalizing the club for a week before I got there.
[01:43:37.591 --> 01:43:43.175]  Then I get there, I do my comedy set, Antifa beats reporters, steals the stuff, no charges.
[01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:47.718]  They pick a fight with Proud Boys, Proud Boys beat their ass for 17 seconds, four years in prison.
[01:43:48.299 --> 01:43:49.360]  No damage.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.963]  Those kids looked fine.
[01:43:50.963 --> 01:43:52.886]  No, four years in prison.
[01:43:52.886 --> 01:43:55.531]  It is illegal in America to stand your ground.
[01:43:55.531 --> 01:43:58.776]  The Covington Catholic School boys were a great example of that.
[01:43:58.776 --> 01:44:00.339]  Look at the McCluskeys in St.
[01:44:00.339 --> 01:44:00.680]  Louis.
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.762]  I mean, this is getting dangerous.
[01:44:03.354 --> 01:44:04.515]  No problem!
[01:44:04.515 --> 01:44:09.156]  If Antifa burns shit down and rips down statues and attacks people, that's fine.
[01:44:09.156 --> 01:44:12.178]  Magical lawyers appear like fairies and pay for their bail.
[01:44:12.178 --> 01:44:20.921]  But if you just stand on your own property, after your gate has been bent forward, twisted, and you stand there and make it clear you will not let them burn down your house,
[01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:22.282]  Oh yeah, that happened a few weeks ago.
[01:44:22.282 --> 01:44:25.266]  A guy with a shotgun there at his house saying, we're going to kill you and burn your house down.
[01:44:25.266 --> 01:44:27.588]  He just shows the shotgun through the window.
[01:44:27.588 --> 01:44:28.830]  Doesn't point it at him.
[01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:30.612]  The police ran and arrested them.
[01:44:30.612 --> 01:44:32.054]  I'm not against the police.
[01:44:32.054 --> 01:44:34.537]  But if bad government takes over, they can become authoritarian.
[01:44:35.376 --> 01:44:39.859]  But I notice police in most areas grovel to the left and are actually a problem.
[01:44:39.859 --> 01:44:41.720]  People are like, oh, the police are wonderful.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:49.064]  The police in many areas have just bowed to the left and are like running after them like, oh, we'll arrest anybody that stands up for themselves.
[01:44:49.064 --> 01:44:52.806]  We're going to prove to you Black Lives Matter and George Soros and Antifa that we're good.
[01:44:54.235 --> 01:44:56.938]  Now this is, to be clear, this is the police's boss.
[01:44:56.938 --> 01:45:05.229]  The beat cops, many beat cops or Proud Boys, or at least were, until they got threatened with being fired, but they're down here with us.
[01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:07.111]  I know tons of cops.
[01:45:07.111 --> 01:45:10.435]  If I had any power, Max and John wouldn't be in prison now.
[01:45:10.435 --> 01:45:13.019]  It's the, I always say, F the police's boss.
[01:45:13.359 --> 01:45:24.850]  And it's their bosses, the chiefs, the sergeants, the mayors that are telling them to stand down and using them as political tools and saying, go over there and get that guy because it's good PR for me.
[01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:28.414]  And they can't wait to throw these cops under the bus the second there's any kind of trouble.
[01:45:28.414 --> 01:45:32.317]  That's why we're seeing these cops retire in unprecedented numbers.
[01:45:33.098 --> 01:45:35.060]  Which is part of the plan of them bringing all the bad cops.
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:35.860]  I mean, I totally agree.
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:40.444]  I'm not against the police in general, but I mean, I watch how in L.A.
[01:45:40.444 --> 01:45:51.432]  where the car, they're attacking the car, it drives away, the little Prius, they like road warrior block it in and then the police put the guy in handcuffs who's being attacked with his windows knocked out.
[01:45:51.432 --> 01:45:52.753]  I mean, what?
[01:45:52.753 --> 01:45:55.635]  You don't arrest the BLM people that are road warring this guy?
[01:45:57.614 --> 01:46:00.455]  Well, remember that we have these progressive DAs.
[01:46:00.455 --> 01:46:03.676]  Newt Gingrich got in a lot of trouble for bringing up that Soros helps pay for them.
[01:46:03.676 --> 01:46:07.678]  That was literally verboten on Fox News.
[01:46:07.678 --> 01:46:12.460]  But when you arrest these Antifa guys, they just go in the front door and out the front door.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:14.141]  It's a revolving door for them.
[01:46:14.141 --> 01:46:17.162]  It's only patriots that seem to pay the price.
[01:46:17.762 --> 01:46:24.724]  I mean, Antifa, these thugs, BLM, gangsters that are looting, all just seem to be getting away with murder.
[01:46:24.724 --> 01:46:26.085]  Literally with murder.
[01:46:26.085 --> 01:46:27.545]  And the media is complicit.
[01:46:27.545 --> 01:46:28.786]  The media is driving it.
[01:46:28.786 --> 01:46:33.668]  Like, how about that woman with the little kid who was killed for saying, all lives matter.
[01:46:33.668 --> 01:46:34.668]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:46:34.668 --> 01:46:36.729]  Well, that guy shot her in the head for saying it.
[01:46:36.729 --> 01:46:37.849]  And the media covered it up.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:45.682]  So what the media does is it perpetrates this, and perpetuates it, sorry.
[01:46:45.682 --> 01:47:00.628]  So when you have a guy, like I was just at the walk away rally in DC, and this black guy is going through the crowd going, fuck Trump, fuck Trump, excuse my language, f-Trump, because the media has taught him that Trump supporters are Nazis, so he's being brave in a sense.
[01:47:01.596 --> 01:47:04.458]  After being brainwashed by standing up to these Nazis.
[01:47:04.458 --> 01:47:06.180]  So some guy goes, F Trump, F you!
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.982]  And then he just immediately starts swinging, punches him in the head, gets arrested for it.
[01:47:09.982 --> 01:47:12.244]  He'll be released probably an hour later.
[01:47:12.244 --> 01:47:17.168]  And so, in a sense, both of those people in that fight are victims.
[01:47:17.168 --> 01:47:22.772]  The black guy was a victim to this brainwashing going on by the media that tells them there's Nazis everywhere.
[01:47:22.772 --> 01:47:29.237]  And then, of course, the guy who got punched in the face was also a victim of this thug who thinks that Trump supporters are Nazis and
[01:47:29.884 --> 01:47:30.565]  Need to be beaten up.
[01:47:30.565 --> 01:47:34.207]  So the media is complicit in both of those cases.
[01:47:34.207 --> 01:47:37.189]  Both of the people in that attack.
[01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.889]  I totally agree.
[01:47:37.889 --> 01:47:41.031]  So the question I asked you four years ago on the eve of the election, I ask again.
[01:47:41.031 --> 01:47:43.173]  What is peak SJW insanity?
[01:47:45.157 --> 01:47:47.139]  We've only just begun.
[01:47:47.139 --> 01:47:52.883]  When Trump wins in a landslide, they are going to leave the cities because they're done.
[01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:58.667]  You know, drive around New York, drive around D.C., drive around Austin, you see plywood everywhere.
[01:47:58.667 --> 01:47:59.348]  In D.C.
[01:47:59.348 --> 01:48:00.809]  right now, the Nat Geo building
[01:48:01.454 --> 01:48:08.998]  They've rented the space of the building across from them and it's like a 10 story high Black Lives Matter giant mural.
[01:48:08.998 --> 01:48:14.240]  And then you look at Nat Geo and their entire office headquarters is covered in plywood.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.380]  So they've already taken the cities.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:16.181]  The cities are ruined.
[01:48:16.181 --> 01:48:17.081]  New York's over.
[01:48:17.081 --> 01:48:18.722]  So now it's time to go into the suburbs.
[01:48:18.722 --> 01:48:23.484]  They're going to start burning homes, destroying homes, attacking people.
[01:48:23.484 --> 01:48:26.966]  The carnage is going to spread out and include everywhere.
[01:48:28.223 --> 01:48:31.384]  That's what the Bolsheviks did in 1917, 1918 Russia.
[01:48:31.384 --> 01:48:33.164]  It took them several years to get the cities.
[01:48:33.164 --> 01:48:36.805]  Then they fanned out like locusts.
[01:48:36.805 --> 01:48:39.325]  The Bolsheviks is the perfect analogy.
[01:48:39.325 --> 01:48:43.566]  And the thing I love about that analogy is the Bolsheviks, all they care about is winning.
[01:48:43.566 --> 01:48:44.706]  They don't care about murder.
[01:48:44.706 --> 01:48:45.906]  They don't care about genocide.
[01:48:45.906 --> 01:48:47.287]  They don't care who dies.
[01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:54.948]  And you see this with Jewish Americans who are happy to just throw Israel under the bus and go, yeah, if that, if Trump is Israel, then I hate Israel.
[01:48:55.803 --> 01:49:00.145]  And you just sacrificed your own people for a win.
[01:49:00.145 --> 01:49:01.145]  For a gain.
[01:49:01.145 --> 01:49:02.586]  And that's what we saw with Bolsheviks.
[01:49:02.586 --> 01:49:06.407]  They didn't care what position they took as long as they were winning.
[01:49:06.407 --> 01:49:10.549]  And if that means burning down their own communities, no problem.
[01:49:10.549 --> 01:49:10.969]  Exactly.
[01:49:10.969 --> 01:49:13.770]  They didn't care about how to feed people, how to clothe them, what was going to happen.
[01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:14.791]  They just cared about power.
[01:49:16.069 --> 01:49:16.850]  We're good to go.
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:43.832]  And we're sick of, I mean it's a perfect name, we're sick of being told we're bad, and then they literally lie about you knowing they're doing it, and the whole media in unison just does it.
[01:49:43.832 --> 01:49:48.679]  Because I get to experience that about, with myself as well, but, I mean, with you guys, it's another level.
[01:49:50.549 --> 01:49:52.250]  It is reverse propaganda.
[01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:57.773]  It's just, it's Orwellian, just like they say, war is peace, good is bad, free speech is censorship.
[01:49:57.773 --> 01:50:06.978]  You know, when John and Zenoa were on trial for that Antifa fight, she's a black woman, long dreads, very black, and every time she would go to the bathroom,
[01:50:08.299 --> 01:50:10.900]  Daily News and the New York Post, by the way.
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:13.542]  Allegedly right-wing news sources are just as bad.
[01:50:13.542 --> 01:50:15.643]  Taking pictures of them, of John, sorry.
[01:50:15.643 --> 01:50:20.146]  They even got him once where he was going getaway, and it looks like a Z Kyle if you go really low.
[01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:22.528]  And then when she would come back, cameras down.
[01:50:22.528 --> 01:50:24.549]  Even right now, they want to talk about Proud Boys?
[01:50:24.549 --> 01:50:25.970]  Talk to the black Hispanic leader.
[01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:27.211]  I'm not even in it anymore.
[01:50:27.211 --> 01:50:29.412]  No, we'd rather get the white male.
[01:50:29.412 --> 01:50:35.056]  They always are very selective about what pictures they take, what angle they take, and they end up saying the opposite.
[01:50:35.476 --> 01:50:40.238]  They end up creating this roaming gang of Nazis, and that's how the judge summed up his opinion.
[01:50:48.911 --> 01:50:55.435]  I am scintillating and charming, and that's really my biggest sin here, is that I make supporting Trump look fun.
[01:50:55.435 --> 01:50:59.237]  And that can't happen, because that leads to Dems walking away.
[01:50:59.237 --> 01:51:02.279]  That's exactly why they de-platformed me, was the memes and the fun.
[01:51:02.279 --> 01:51:08.182]  And as soon as they figured out that I like being made fun of, they go, oh my god, we gotta ban this person immediately, because they have no humor!
[01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:14.025]  They're totally devoid of humor, and that's the foundation of the Proud Boys.
[01:51:14.025 --> 01:51:19.307]  It started as a joke, and humor and sarcasm and memes are still the backbone of the movement.
[01:51:19.307 --> 01:51:21.848]  It's still about Budweiser and Animal House.
[01:51:21.848 --> 01:51:23.889]  How many major movements have you founded?
[01:51:23.889 --> 01:51:24.909]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[01:51:24.909 --> 01:51:29.311]  We'll look at the election, we'll handicap it, what he thinks is going to happen when Trump wins, the whole COVID thing.
[01:51:29.311 --> 01:51:33.473]  Two more seconds with Gavin McGinnis, then I'm going to open the phones up for your calls after he leaves us.
[01:51:33.473 --> 01:51:35.514]  And I'm going to ask him, what's the next big trend?
[01:51:35.514 --> 01:51:37.034]  Because he's definitely a trendsetter.
[01:51:37.034 --> 01:51:37.755]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:37.755 --> 01:51:38.175]  Stay with us.
[01:51:40.498 --> 01:51:42.960]  Stand back and stand by.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.845]  During our emergency election sale, we have all your favorite products up to 60% off plus free shipping.
[01:51:48.845 --> 01:51:54.730]  In order to help maximize our coverage of this historic election, we need your support during this crucial time.
[01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:58.333]  We have our vitamin D supplement Winter Sun Plus at 25% off.
[01:51:58.333 --> 01:52:04.138]  Winter Sun Plus works as a defense against attacks on your immune system, which will be great during the coming winter
[01:52:04.138 --> 01:52:04.858]  I think so.
[01:52:21.266 --> 01:52:27.911]  All shirts in our apparel collection are currently set at the answers to $19.84, which is $17.76.
[01:52:27.911 --> 01:52:31.154]  We also have Prostagard and Ultimate Fish Oil back in stock.
[01:52:31.154 --> 01:52:39.380]  So whether you're looking to stock up or thinking of adding something new to your daily routine, be sure to check out these deep discounts and more at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:52:42.895 --> 01:52:56.353]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet Magazine documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day.
[01:52:56.353 --> 01:52:57.855]  Communist Chinese working
[01:52:58.035 --> 01:53:11.484]  In tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like Day of the Dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:17.268]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[01:53:17.868 --> 01:53:21.230]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:28.515]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate psyop.
[01:53:28.515 --> 01:53:31.937]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:31.937 --> 01:53:35.159]  Myself, Alex Jones, David Ayno, and Troy are covering this heavily.
[01:53:35.159 --> 01:53:37.120]  This is the way to bring down the globalists.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:40.482]  It's exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[01:53:44.483 --> 01:53:48.565]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:48.565 --> 01:54:07.794]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at this critical time.
[01:54:07.794 --> 01:54:08.914]  Gavin McInnes is our guest.
[01:54:08.914 --> 01:54:11.395]  I want to ask him about a lot of topics in the next few segments.
[01:54:11.395 --> 01:54:12.876]  I'll open the phones up after he leaves us.
[01:54:14.116 --> 01:54:18.838]  He's at censored.tv doing his own platform like we are and doing a wonderful job.
[01:54:18.838 --> 01:54:21.618]  Gavin, what's the next big trends to come?
[01:54:21.618 --> 01:54:31.341]  I mean, you started Vice Magazine, you started the hipster movement, you've started the Proud Boys, you're an integral part of getting Trump elected.
[01:54:31.341 --> 01:54:33.262]  You're a smart guy, you're a fun guy.
[01:54:33.262 --> 01:54:35.603]  What do you see in the future?
[01:54:35.603 --> 01:54:36.083]  A new right.
[01:54:38.099 --> 01:54:43.961]  It's Proud Boys, but it's also this Gen Z. They've had enough of all these rules, and they don't like it.
[01:54:43.961 --> 01:54:50.903]  Because when you look at what these Bolsheviks are doing, they're saying, you know, Alex Jones said that the frogs, you're making frogs gay.
[01:54:50.903 --> 01:54:52.244]  And you go, well, that's actually true if you look it up.
[01:54:52.244 --> 01:54:53.584]  He just said it in a colorful way.
[01:54:53.584 --> 01:54:54.604]  And they go, well, I don't like that.
[01:54:54.604 --> 01:54:55.645]  He should have said it just literal.
[01:54:55.645 --> 01:54:58.025]  And they go, okay, so you're against color.
[01:54:58.025 --> 01:54:59.366]  You're against hyperbole.
[01:54:59.366 --> 01:55:00.246]  You're against humor.
[01:55:00.706 --> 01:55:03.629]  And they end up with this platform of just grey.
[01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:05.431]  Don't say anything that could be misinterpreted.
[01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:06.692]  Don't say anything that isn't literal.
[01:55:06.692 --> 01:55:08.274]  Talk like Walter Cronkite.
[01:55:08.274 --> 01:55:09.996]  Talk like an encyclopedia.
[01:55:09.996 --> 01:55:12.218]  And young people see that and they go, I like colour.
[01:55:12.218 --> 01:55:12.899]  I like humour.
[01:55:12.899 --> 01:55:13.459]  I like fun.
[01:55:13.459 --> 01:55:14.160]  I like danger.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.541]  I like fighting.
[01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:16.262]  I like laughing.
[01:55:16.262 --> 01:55:18.645]  I like insensitive jokes.
[01:55:19.385 --> 01:55:27.731]  And so what the left has accidentally done is make themselves look like the church lady from SNL and made being new right fun.
[01:55:27.731 --> 01:55:33.635]  Maybe Satan, maybe pro-boys.
[01:55:33.635 --> 01:55:41.601]  We're seeing a new kind of conservative who doesn't really care about if you smoke a joint or if you're gay and any of that sort of social conservative stuff.
[01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:45.184]  They tend to be socially liberal, but they get that the government sucks.
[01:55:45.184 --> 01:55:46.725]  Well, they don't hate America.
[01:55:48.097 --> 01:55:48.677]  Pardon me?
[01:55:48.677 --> 01:55:51.278]  They don't hate America.
[01:55:51.278 --> 01:55:52.338]  They don't hate America.
[01:55:52.338 --> 01:56:04.963]  They've been around and, you know, they see their big sister unemployed with some dumb SJW degree and they go, maybe what they're pushing, what these academics are pushing is bad for me.
[01:56:04.963 --> 01:56:06.684]  Maybe it was bad for my sister.
[01:56:06.684 --> 01:56:08.164]  I'm not following that route.
[01:56:08.164 --> 01:56:13.146]  I think it's the most conservative 18 to 25's America's had since Reagan.
[01:56:13.146 --> 01:56:14.926]  And that's because the left can't mean.
[01:56:14.926 --> 01:56:15.887]  Well, that's the next thing.
[01:56:16.767 --> 01:56:27.416]  The left gets two or three of these world's degrees and they get more desperate believing if they can just take over they'll finally have a job when they're Chai Com idiots who the Chai Coms hate and they'll never get a job.
[01:56:27.416 --> 01:56:31.880]  They're destroying their own future but thinking they're vitriolically almost there.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.682]  They're the biggest chumps I've ever seen.
[01:56:35.182 --> 01:56:38.445]  Well, you see this in comedy, with stand-up comedy.
[01:56:38.445 --> 01:56:44.809]  It's very hard to do stand-up, it's very hard to do sketch comedy at an improv place like UCB.
[01:56:44.809 --> 01:56:53.456]  So what these ugly fat trannies and lesbians and just losers who pretend that they're multi-gender, what they did is they started imposing all these rules.
[01:56:53.456 --> 01:56:57.900]  And they thought, I can't get it through meritocracy, I'll get it through this left-wing fascism.
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.501]  And then they get on stage, and they suck.
[01:56:59.941 --> 01:57:11.334]  And they ruin the comedy, they ruin SNL, they ruin movies, and comedy has had its color usurped via leftist fascism, and then they get out there, and they try it, and you go, no, you suck.
[01:57:11.334 --> 01:57:12.615]  You're not funny.
[01:57:12.615 --> 01:57:14.077]  You've just ruined comedy.
[01:57:14.691 --> 01:57:16.112]  So, Americans see that.
[01:57:16.112 --> 01:57:27.277]  They see all these great American pastimes getting ruined, and they think, maybe if when you forcibly replaced the people who were there with meritocracy, and you did a good job, we'd see your point.
[01:57:27.277 --> 01:57:28.257]  But you're not.
[01:57:28.257 --> 01:57:28.798]  You suck.
[01:57:28.798 --> 01:57:30.478]  And you just ruined our fun thing.
[01:57:30.478 --> 01:57:31.539]  So, screw you.
[01:57:31.539 --> 01:57:33.020]  We're taking it back.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:35.501]  I totally agree with you.
[01:57:35.501 --> 01:57:37.662]  But I keep asking the question, what's their peak?
[01:57:37.662 --> 01:57:41.924]  Because if they're never going to stop, and they're such losers, where does this all end?
[01:57:44.082 --> 01:57:46.864]  They get beaten back down.
[01:57:46.864 --> 01:57:58.990]  I mean, I can't tell you how many people I've spoken to recently, dads and young people, who have no experience in politics besides reading the paper and arguing in bars, and they're saying, I'm getting active.
[01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:08.536]  I'm working with this guy in this district, and I'm going to move down to Florida, and I'm going to work with this guy under this guy, and I've never done it before, but I'm going to volunteer for this congressperson.
[01:58:08.536 --> 01:58:09.717]  Like, people are getting up.
[01:58:09.717 --> 01:58:10.497]  People are getting engaged.
[01:58:10.497 --> 01:58:11.978]  The sleeping giant just got off the bench.
[01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:16.009]  That's exactly what is happening in America.
[01:58:16.009 --> 01:58:18.071]  And that's what America is, right?
[01:58:18.071 --> 01:58:24.639]  You bully us, we ignore you, we take it, we take it, we take it, and then you go one step too far and we say, alright, that's it!
[01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:29.885]  Put down the toys, everyone's going to bed, party's over, you're grounded, no screens for a week, America!
[01:58:31.286 --> 01:58:31.946]  Absolutely.
[01:58:31.946 --> 01:58:33.847]  I mean, it just gets more shrill, more desperate.
[01:58:33.847 --> 01:58:40.631]  Back in 60 seconds, I want to look at the election, look at COVID-19, look at the lockdowns with the one and only Gavin McInnes of Censored.TV.
[01:58:40.631 --> 01:58:45.434]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and the new, redesigned InfoWars.com.
[01:58:45.434 --> 01:58:50.337]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.337 --> 01:58:57.741]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[01:58:59.042 --> 01:59:11.231]  That's establishing a form of planetary digital law, where the technocrats are above the law, and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[01:59:11.231 --> 01:59:16.895]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[01:59:16.895 --> 01:59:20.277]  That is the post-human exterminist plan.
[01:59:20.277 --> 01:59:22.219]  That is the public ideology of the globalists.
[01:59:23.271 --> 01:59:32.656]  And everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[01:59:32.656 --> 01:59:40.800]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:47.823]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[01:59:47.823 --> 01:59:48.944]  This is the essence of evil.
[02:00:02.486 --> 02:00:02.787]  I'm good.
[02:00:22.389 --> 02:00:24.870]  Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, is our guest.
[02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:27.311]  You know, I made a joke with him a few years ago.
[02:00:27.311 --> 02:00:28.551]  He was out of the Proud Boys.
[02:00:28.551 --> 02:00:30.472]  It became a political distraction for him.
[02:00:30.472 --> 02:00:32.973]  He got demonized because of it.
[02:00:32.973 --> 02:00:36.974]  And he made a strategic decision to say, hey, it's its own deal, but I can't command it.
[02:00:36.974 --> 02:00:38.155]  I can't run it.
[02:00:38.155 --> 02:00:38.895]  It was a joke.
[02:00:38.895 --> 02:00:43.797]  It was just something fun to piss off liberals and troll them, kind of like Peppet the Frog was.
[02:00:43.797 --> 02:00:44.517]  Great people in it.
[02:00:44.517 --> 02:00:45.897]  Gavin supports them.
[02:00:45.897 --> 02:00:48.118]  And they wouldn't let him get away from it.
[02:00:48.118 --> 02:00:49.639]  And so I said, well, you know,
[02:00:50.484 --> 02:00:51.084]  Initiate me.
[02:00:51.084 --> 02:00:52.545]  He goes, well it's not official but I'll do it.
[02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:55.908]  And I even said on the video, it's a joke and I'm not scared to be in the Proud Boys.
[02:00:55.908 --> 02:01:00.971]  I guess I should be because I've already been banned and shadow banned and all the same stuff they've gone through.
[02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:08.536]  So he initiated me, you know, did the initiation and the media literally goes, hey Jones is a white supremacist too.
[02:01:08.536 --> 02:01:10.357]  Deplatform him more.
[02:01:10.357 --> 02:01:13.720]  And so in a case where we lost a bank account, I never told Gavin this,
[02:01:15.361 --> 02:01:21.804]  But a few months ago they told us, well it's your affiliation with the white supremacist prom boys and we may file a lawsuit because this is just outrageous.
[02:01:21.804 --> 02:01:23.205]  You're not a white supremacist, I'm not.
[02:01:23.205 --> 02:01:25.706]  But even if we were, what we can't have a bank account?
[02:01:25.706 --> 02:01:35.572]  I mean this just shows how they're externalizing the whole takeover system of what goes on in college campuses and that tyranny is now to go nationwide.
[02:01:35.572 --> 02:01:38.674]  Well we can't put up with this, can we Gavin?
[02:01:38.674 --> 02:01:39.254]  No, and it's...
[02:01:39.998 --> 02:01:50.726]  It's crazy, like that initiation, it comes from high school, where if you farted or burped, and you don't say safety, then everyone gets to beat you up until you can name five breakfast cereals.
[02:01:50.726 --> 02:01:55.889]  We played it my entire adolescence, it's called Safety Slug, and it's a stupid, funny game.
[02:01:55.889 --> 02:02:00.232]  And the media tries to make that into some sinister MS-13 initiation.
[02:02:02.894 --> 02:02:06.855]  They keep running, so they tell you a lie, and then you're stuck with that lie forever.
[02:02:06.855 --> 02:02:10.576]  And by the way, I didn't quit the Proud Boys because it was a political distraction.
[02:02:10.576 --> 02:02:23.099]  I quit them because in the courtroom with Max and John, Max Hare and John Kinsman, the prosecution kept bringing in all of these quotes from my comedy show that was on Anthony Cumia's network.
[02:02:23.519 --> 02:02:24.599]  Comedy show.
[02:02:24.599 --> 02:02:29.001]  But they were taking the jokes out of context and showing the rude words to make them look bad.
[02:02:29.001 --> 02:02:31.042]  And that's what they were just trying to do to Trump.
[02:02:31.042 --> 02:02:37.444]  If he can say, the Proud Boys are alright, then they'll find some quote from one of my comedy sets and say Trump endorses that.
[02:02:37.444 --> 02:02:39.025]  That's the way it works.
[02:02:39.025 --> 02:02:42.926]  You say you like one Motley Crue song, and all of a sudden you're a Satanist.
[02:02:44.326 --> 02:02:45.207]  Exactly.
[02:02:45.207 --> 02:02:48.650]  So, well sorry I misrepresented that.
[02:02:48.650 --> 02:02:49.872]  I was trying to oversimplify.
[02:02:49.872 --> 02:02:50.392]  But I get it.
[02:02:50.392 --> 02:02:55.037]  You didn't want to hurt the organization or hurt Trump by them extrapolating your comedy into it.
[02:02:55.037 --> 02:02:59.121]  But at a certain point, they've taken over control of all language.
[02:02:59.121 --> 02:02:59.902]  I mean, where does this end?
[02:03:01.815 --> 02:03:04.256]  Yeah, and it's so un-American.
[02:03:04.256 --> 02:03:12.501]  I've done a ton of interviews since the speech, and every time they get put up on YouTube, that guy loses his account, or at the very least, they say it violates their conditions.
[02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:16.303]  So not only am I banned from YouTube, but you can't speak to me.
[02:03:16.303 --> 02:03:20.685]  And that goes under the auspices of giving whatever fascists a platform.
[02:03:20.685 --> 02:03:23.527]  Oh, remember what they said about you and I last year and Paul Watson?
[02:03:24.187 --> 02:03:33.272]  That they're allowed to do violence to us, people are allowed to promote violence against us, and they went on to say you may not mention them in a positive light, only in a negative.
[02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.192]  Talk about a cult!
[02:03:34.192 --> 02:03:37.234]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:03:37.234 --> 02:03:40.696]  It's sort of like when you leave Scientology, and what do they call it again?
[02:03:40.696 --> 02:03:41.656]  A squirrel?
[02:03:41.656 --> 02:03:50.261]  A squirrel is someone who tries to defame Scientology, and then they go and harass these people almost to death and call it squirrel busting.
[02:03:50.919 --> 02:03:52.642]  And that's what the media is like now.
[02:03:52.642 --> 02:03:55.806]  They're squirrel busters who are trying to protect Scientology.
[02:03:55.806 --> 02:03:56.006]  Exactly.
[02:03:56.006 --> 02:04:00.633]  The left is bullying people at a billion times the level Scientology ever was accused of.
[02:04:02.133 --> 02:04:06.314]  Yeah, and it's changing not just the conversation, but the country.
[02:04:06.314 --> 02:04:10.816]  We've never had moms not speaking to their sons, brothers not speaking to their sisters.
[02:04:10.816 --> 02:04:12.116]  None of us liked Obama.
[02:04:12.116 --> 02:04:12.997]  We were sick of him.
[02:04:12.997 --> 02:04:25.101]  We saw him as a community organizer who believed all this leftist propaganda and was making it into law, like Prop 9 that ruined all the colleges by making everything a feminist action in sports.
[02:04:25.101 --> 02:04:28.442]  So that pissed us off, but we didn't X our family members.
[02:04:30.163 --> 02:04:35.625]  Smash people with bike locks or jump in front of traffic.
[02:04:35.625 --> 02:04:37.286]  It's derangement.
[02:04:37.286 --> 02:04:38.467]  It's satanic.
[02:04:38.467 --> 02:04:44.250]  You always said it was satanic, and it sounded hyperbolic, but it's right out of the Bible at this point.
[02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:45.751]  I mean, up is down, down is up.
[02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:47.772]  That's Satan's number one trick.
[02:04:49.005 --> 02:04:49.305]  I agree.
[02:04:49.305 --> 02:04:50.226]  We've got five minutes left.
[02:04:50.226 --> 02:04:56.649]  Hopefully you'll join us during our 40-hour special broadcast that kicks off this Thursday and live coverage of the VP debates.
[02:04:56.649 --> 02:05:06.895]  Your take on COVID-19 lockdowns, your take on Trump and Walter Reed and just all the craziness, the election, other big things that are front burner right now for Gavin McInnes at Censored.TV.
[02:05:09.304 --> 02:05:20.342]  Well this this again the left lies about our position and they say oh they they think the right thinks that that COVID doesn't exist and no one's ever died from it and it's all a lie.
[02:05:20.342 --> 02:05:24.208]  No we think that you've upped the numbers because you think it's bad for Trump
[02:05:24.748 --> 02:05:26.469]  And it means more funding.
[02:05:26.469 --> 02:05:27.669]  So you say 200.
[02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:29.830]  I personally think it's more like 100.
[02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:31.491]  That's a very bad flu season.
[02:05:31.491 --> 02:05:38.574]  I'm not denying that this is a crazy virus that is the most infectious thing we've ever seen before.
[02:05:38.574 --> 02:05:38.854]  Times 100.
[02:05:38.854 --> 02:05:40.555]  It's definitely infectious.
[02:05:40.555 --> 02:05:41.255]  You're right.
[02:05:41.255 --> 02:05:43.036]  And they're using it as a power grab.
[02:05:43.036 --> 02:05:45.077]  And then they go, oh, you say not one person died.
[02:05:45.077 --> 02:05:45.737]  You're a discredit.
[02:05:45.737 --> 02:05:46.738]  Everyone's dying.
[02:05:46.738 --> 02:05:48.398]  We know exactly.
[02:05:48.398 --> 02:05:49.379]  They misrepresent everything.
[02:05:50.506 --> 02:05:53.189]  The mortality rate is not bad.
[02:05:53.189 --> 02:06:01.259]  Now, if China ever combines something like Wuhan or something with a bad mortality rate with something of this contagious, they could end America.
[02:06:01.259 --> 02:06:01.520]  Exactly.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.202]  And I don't think they would hesitate to do it.
[02:06:03.202 --> 02:06:04.163]  They don't care about us.
[02:06:04.163 --> 02:06:07.067]  They don't care about... They're not Christian by any means.
[02:06:07.067 --> 02:06:07.908]  In fact, it's illegal.
[02:06:08.288 --> 02:06:10.149]  To be Christian or religious in China.
[02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:11.269]  So that could happen.
[02:06:11.269 --> 02:06:16.730]  But as far as right now goes, we're dealing with a very, very contagious thing that does not have a high mortality rate.
[02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:19.731]  Especially if you're not old and fat or have pre-existing conditions.
[02:06:19.731 --> 02:06:25.893]  So why are we ruining America for something that has a... What is it if you're young?
[02:06:25.893 --> 02:06:26.493]  99.98?
[02:06:26.493 --> 02:06:28.253]  Like, how about motorcycles?
[02:06:28.253 --> 02:06:30.774]  Every time I get on my bike, what am I at?
[02:06:30.774 --> 02:06:31.454]  99%?
[02:06:31.454 --> 02:06:32.855]  That's an old number.
[02:06:32.855 --> 02:06:33.315]  I mean, now...
[02:06:35.009 --> 02:06:37.731]  77 people have died that didn't have co-morbidity in Australia.
[02:06:37.731 --> 02:06:43.776]  A couple thousand died total, but 77 didn't already have cancer or heart attack, diabetes, overweight.
[02:06:43.776 --> 02:06:47.460]  Now Trump, at 74, overweight, you know, I mean, it could kill him.
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.962]  But again, if he has zinc and things, it won't.
[02:06:51.964 --> 02:06:56.107]  And isn't it strange, too, that there's a global pandemic.
[02:06:56.107 --> 02:06:57.087]  Italy was screwed.
[02:06:57.087 --> 02:06:58.348]  France was screwed.
[02:06:58.348 --> 02:07:02.790]  When it hit us, while dealing with it, they were trying to impeach the president.
[02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:05.392]  They were in Chinatown saying, it's groovy down here.
[02:07:05.392 --> 02:07:06.673]  Come on down.
[02:07:06.673 --> 02:07:08.594]  And then it blows up and they go, look what Trump did.
[02:07:09.034 --> 02:07:10.295]  Look at all these dead people being killed.
[02:07:10.295 --> 02:07:10.655]  I totally agree.
[02:07:10.655 --> 02:07:12.076]  What do you think happens in the election?
[02:07:12.076 --> 02:07:14.298]  Now the Democrats want to extend it out with ballots.
[02:07:14.298 --> 02:07:15.459]  How do you see that battle going?
[02:07:15.459 --> 02:07:19.142]  Because I'm guaranteeing you, this election isn't over in 28 days.
[02:07:19.142 --> 02:07:23.965]  I call it the 70 plus, 79 days to hell after that, before the inauguration.
[02:07:23.965 --> 02:07:25.867]  I think inauguration is when we get the champagne out.
[02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:28.220]  Exactly.
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:35.763]  The only question here is how long the left will fight and how much the Supreme Court will have to do to make them agree that he won.
[02:07:35.763 --> 02:07:37.724]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[02:07:37.724 --> 02:07:39.205]  The left is going to completely deny it.
[02:07:39.205 --> 02:07:41.806]  They're not even going to be mad on the night of the election.
[02:07:41.806 --> 02:07:44.467]  They'll go, yeah, yeah, sure, wait till you see the mail-ins.
[02:07:44.467 --> 02:07:48.169]  The mail-ins are going to come in and it's not going to get quite to the level they want it to be.
[02:07:48.169 --> 02:07:49.830]  They want it to reverse the outcome.
[02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:50.670]  It's not.
[02:07:50.670 --> 02:07:53.992]  So they're going to keep saying, oh, we're still counting, oh, and they're going to delay and delay and delay.
[02:07:54.572 --> 02:07:55.953]  This is the only question.
[02:07:55.953 --> 02:07:56.893]  Till when?
[02:07:56.893 --> 02:07:58.855]  I say February.
[02:07:58.855 --> 02:08:01.456]  I say February 10th.
[02:08:01.456 --> 02:08:03.237]  They finally go, alright, fine, he won.
[02:08:03.237 --> 02:08:05.898]  And he's like, good, can I get to work now, please?
[02:08:05.898 --> 02:08:16.604]  I agree with you, because they said until, but you notice under the 20th Amendment, January 20th, if the President isn't seated, the House votes on the new President.
[02:08:16.604 --> 02:08:20.747]  It's going to come to that.
[02:08:20.747 --> 02:08:23.048]  Well, that's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, isn't it?
[02:08:24.616 --> 02:08:26.036]  It really is.
[02:08:26.036 --> 02:08:33.338]  And I guarantee you that no matter what happens, for the rest of time, the left will deny that Trump won this election.
[02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.439]  No matter how much he wins it.
[02:08:35.439 --> 02:08:39.280]  And all you need to do to verify that is check 2016.
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.240]  It's been four years.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:42.301]  They still have not accepted it.
[02:08:42.301 --> 02:08:43.841]  What did we do when Obama won?
[02:08:43.841 --> 02:08:45.702]  Because you and I felt the same way.
[02:08:45.702 --> 02:08:47.822]  And we both went, oh well, you guys screwed up.
[02:08:47.822 --> 02:08:50.443]  He's not the messiah, but let's get to work.
[02:08:50.443 --> 02:08:51.403]  They are still in 2016.
[02:08:51.403 --> 02:08:53.884]  They're still locked in that zone.
[02:08:55.282 --> 02:09:13.817]  You're absolutely right, and they did the whole Russia thing, knowingly, we now know, to say it was illegitimate, and they did the Ukraine thing to do that, and so they're just gonna, even more than ever, say it's illegitimate, and Podesta's talking about having states secede, so we're back to a Republican Yankee having to invade the rest of the country when it tries to divide.
[02:09:13.817 --> 02:09:15.559]  History keeps repeating itself.
[02:09:16.877 --> 02:09:19.159]  And this goes back to the satanic thing.
[02:09:19.159 --> 02:09:20.320]  Everything is the opposite.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:22.202]  Whatever they say we're doing, they're doing.
[02:09:22.202 --> 02:09:26.226]  They said Trump colluded with Russia while Hillary was colluding with Russia.
[02:09:26.226 --> 02:09:30.310]  They say we're spying while Obama was spying.
[02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:34.094]  If you want to know what the left is up to, just check what they're accusing you of.
[02:09:34.094 --> 02:09:35.636]  And that's their form of a confession.
[02:09:35.976 --> 02:09:36.437]  Powerful!
[02:09:36.437 --> 02:09:38.942]  He hosts daily, Get Off My Lawn at censored.tv.
[02:09:38.942 --> 02:09:39.884]  Gavin McGinnis, thanks for the time.
[02:09:39.884 --> 02:09:41.027]  We'll say bye to you during the break.
[02:09:41.027 --> 02:09:43.251]  When we come back, cover a lot of news, give out the number.
[02:09:43.251 --> 02:09:43.792]  Stay with us.
[02:09:43.792 --> 02:09:45.616]  Infowars.com is redesigned.
[02:09:45.616 --> 02:09:46.097]  Check it out.
[02:09:46.097 --> 02:09:46.658]  Tell us what you think.
[02:09:46.658 --> 02:09:47.039]  Stay with us.
[02:09:47.972 --> 02:09:51.173]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[02:09:51.173 --> 02:09:59.736]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[02:09:59.736 --> 02:10:03.297]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[02:10:03.297 --> 02:10:16.021]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[02:10:17.201 --> 02:10:19.784]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[02:10:19.784 --> 02:10:25.909]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[02:10:25.909 --> 02:10:29.732]  This is their stated goal.
[02:10:29.732 --> 02:10:38.000]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.281]  Let me turn this around.
[02:10:40.001 --> 02:10:45.405]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[02:10:45.405 --> 02:10:47.507]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[02:10:47.507 --> 02:10:54.653]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown, and it's horrible, and it's killing millions of people via starvation.
[02:10:54.653 --> 02:10:58.275]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well.
[02:10:59.016 --> 02:11:02.857]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates.
[02:11:02.857 --> 02:11:05.618]  He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[02:11:05.618 --> 02:11:07.259]  People know he's not a doctor.
[02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:09.219]  People know he's a eugenicist.
[02:11:09.219 --> 02:11:16.521]  The population knows that his vaccines, that he pushes, have been filled with cancer viruses, polio, steroids, and more.
[02:11:16.521 --> 02:11:18.562]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[02:11:18.562 --> 02:11:24.924]  So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government
[02:11:25.464 --> 02:11:33.565]  And that these top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[02:11:33.565 --> 02:11:42.687]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[02:11:42.687 --> 02:11:45.728]  They are the enemies of humanity.
[02:11:45.728 --> 02:11:50.568]  They want you dead.
[02:11:50.568 --> 02:11:53.189]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:12.272]  What did Trump tell you a month ago?
[02:12:12.272 --> 02:12:13.773]  He said, I may not be around too long.
[02:12:13.773 --> 02:12:21.179]  They want to take me out because I'm exposing how these middlemen jack up the price three times what it should be.
[02:12:21.179 --> 02:12:24.401]  When Trump found out China doesn't even make a lot of money off the pharmaceuticals.
[02:12:24.401 --> 02:12:25.622]  It's the middlemen.
[02:12:25.622 --> 02:12:26.623]  That's why we get ripped off.
[02:12:26.623 --> 02:12:28.885]  We pay more than anybody in the world.
[02:12:28.885 --> 02:12:31.427]  Three times the world average.
[02:12:31.427 --> 02:12:32.888]  Double what people pay in Europe.
[02:12:34.421 --> 02:12:36.143]  And Trump is cutting out the middlemen.
[02:12:36.143 --> 02:12:37.845]  He says, you're not doing that.
[02:12:37.845 --> 02:12:41.991]  See, all these Heritage Foundation people always talk about free market.
[02:12:41.991 --> 02:12:42.792]  What's a free market?
[02:12:42.792 --> 02:12:49.980]  But it's not a free market when insiders rig deals with an authoritarian super state to leverage out competition.
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:50.661]  No, Trump's right.
[02:12:50.661 --> 02:12:52.523]  We're bringing the drug manufacturers back here.
[02:12:53.578 --> 02:12:59.801]  And it's all just simple things like that, but he said they might take me out.
[02:12:59.801 --> 02:13:02.702]  He said, you know, the military industrial complex doesn't like me.
[02:13:02.702 --> 02:13:04.063]  The troops like me.
[02:13:04.063 --> 02:13:07.664]  I never said the generals like me when these generals come out and talk crap about Trump.
[02:13:07.664 --> 02:13:10.406]  Trump's very pragmatic.
[02:13:10.406 --> 02:13:16.168]  They always say he's a liar, he's a BSer, but notice he actually carries out what he says he'll do, or he tries.
[02:13:16.168 --> 02:13:18.769]  Even though I disagree with some of what he does, at least I know.
[02:13:18.769 --> 02:13:21.811]  How do you think he gets deals with the Muslims?
[02:13:21.811 --> 02:13:22.371]  Or North Korea?
[02:13:24.687 --> 02:13:28.250]  Because they know he means what he's saying.
[02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:31.512]  That's so refreshing.
[02:13:31.512 --> 02:13:35.235]  With the Clintons and the Bushes, they're all a bunch of backstabbers.
[02:13:35.235 --> 02:13:36.816]  Look at Obama.
[02:13:36.816 --> 02:13:42.240]  He was starstruck, Gaddafi was, of Obama.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:53.369]  And invested all his money with Western companies, and gave up his weapons, and gave up his WMDs, and said, I want to be part of Europe, I want to be with you, I want to... And they killed his ass.
[02:13:55.290 --> 02:14:00.112]  And put Al Qaeda in charge to literally murder everybody.
[02:14:00.112 --> 02:14:11.195]  If you know about Al Qaeda, they call black people raisin heads, and they have other racist terms for them in Arabic, because the Arabs used to run the black slave trade.
[02:14:11.195 --> 02:14:15.397]  And they went in there and killed upwards of 100,000 black Libyans.
[02:14:17.978 --> 02:14:19.499]  Oh, you're black, you own a nice house?
[02:14:19.499 --> 02:14:20.279]  You're dead.
[02:14:20.279 --> 02:14:21.939]  You're black, you own a motorcycle shop?
[02:14:21.939 --> 02:14:22.619]  You're dead.
[02:14:22.619 --> 02:14:24.180]  You're black, you own a restaurant?
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:25.320]  Electronic shop?
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.481]  You're a black doctor?
[02:14:26.481 --> 02:14:29.302]  Your ass is dead!
[02:14:29.302 --> 02:14:31.802]  You're not supposed to be up here where the Arabs are, boy!
[02:14:31.802 --> 02:14:33.343]  You're dead!
[02:14:33.343 --> 02:14:35.763]  And it's not about me virtue-singling the black people.
[02:14:35.763 --> 02:14:36.884]  It's about reality.
[02:14:36.884 --> 02:14:41.165]  China's got three million Muslims in death camps that are good Muslims and don't deserve it.
[02:14:41.165 --> 02:14:44.106]  They got a million Christians that are good people and Buddhists that are good people.
[02:14:44.106 --> 02:14:45.406]  And that's a fact!
[02:14:45.406 --> 02:14:46.847]  I was on a big podcast
[02:14:48.274 --> 02:14:50.735]  I was taping it yesterday, it's going to air Wednesday.
[02:14:50.735 --> 02:14:53.317]  The Drink and Buzz broadcast, they're good guys.
[02:14:53.317 --> 02:14:57.719]  Black Rival Coffee Company, all those guys.
[02:14:57.719 --> 02:15:06.624]  And I was talking about how they're selling their organs and the guy was search-engineering it and pulling it up in mainstream news.
[02:15:06.624 --> 02:15:09.126]  They're not even hiding it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:09.126 --> 02:15:16.090]  Do you think you're safe when Hillary goes with Obama and kills Qaddafi and they rape him?
[02:15:17.526 --> 02:15:19.127]  And then they blow up the economy?
[02:15:19.127 --> 02:15:23.911]  And it's like, well, it's alright, Barack Obama's black.
[02:15:23.911 --> 02:15:25.712]  Makes me sick.
[02:15:25.712 --> 02:15:29.275]  Makes me sick.
[02:15:29.275 --> 02:15:38.563]  I look at what Obama did with his policies, and it was to destroy Africa and shut Africa down, but then he walks around in an African dress.
[02:15:38.563 --> 02:15:41.685]  I'm not gonna walk around in an African dress and kiss your ass.
[02:15:41.685 --> 02:15:42.526]  You're African.
[02:15:42.526 --> 02:15:44.927]  I believe you have a right to live, though.
[02:15:44.927 --> 02:15:46.689]  If you treat me with respect, I'll treat you with respect.
[02:15:49.195 --> 02:15:50.996]  Same thing with the Somali community, everybody else.
[02:15:50.996 --> 02:15:58.441]  I'll treat you with respect, you treat me with respect, but I'm not going to sit here and stand by while the new world order kills your ass.
[02:15:58.441 --> 02:16:01.243]  And I'll say this again, because I know I'm next.
[02:16:01.243 --> 02:16:03.325]  You better get up off your ass, Black America.
[02:16:04.218 --> 02:16:05.459]  And Africa as well.
[02:16:05.459 --> 02:16:10.142]  And the truth is, when I say that, you're off your ass more than most people.
[02:16:10.142 --> 02:16:16.047]  The most viral videos I run into on YouTube are out of Nigeria and Sudan and all over Africa.
[02:16:16.047 --> 02:16:17.928]  They know what's going on.
[02:16:17.928 --> 02:16:22.531]  They've got documentaries showing all the Bill Gates stuff, all the documents, all the doctors, all the proof.
[02:16:22.531 --> 02:16:24.092]  So, good job!
[02:16:24.092 --> 02:16:24.773]  But you know why?
[02:16:24.773 --> 02:16:28.856]  Because they've got the gun to their head, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:32.142 --> 02:16:33.042]  All right, I'm ranting.
[02:16:33.042 --> 02:16:33.823]  I want to give the number out.
[02:16:33.823 --> 02:16:36.044]  I want to take your calls.
[02:16:36.044 --> 02:16:40.766]  We'll just take eight calls because I don't want to have to hold to the next hour and then push Salente back.
[02:16:40.766 --> 02:16:42.687]  I want to just come back, take eight calls.
[02:16:42.687 --> 02:16:46.469]  I get to four calls per segment on what do you make of this Walter Reed thing?
[02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:47.549]  What do you make of the election?
[02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:50.731]  What do you make of the Democrats saying they're going to hold up the election?
[02:16:50.731 --> 02:16:53.512]  What do you make of just all the insanity and all the craziness going on?
[02:16:53.512 --> 02:16:53.572]  877-789-2539.
[02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:54.173]  877-789-Alex. 877.
[02:17:02.036 --> 02:17:06.138]  789-2539 or country code 512-646-1776.
[02:17:06.138 --> 02:17:07.999]  Long-time callers, first-time callers.
[02:17:07.999 --> 02:17:09.980]  You agree, you disagree, go to the head of the line.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:18.845]  You disagree, we'll get you one.
[02:17:18.845 --> 02:17:29.271]  The magnitude of what we're facing is so horrible that I have trouble, you have to understand, I don't relish telling you all this stuff.
[02:17:32.688 --> 02:17:37.652]  That's why I do a sick laugh and all that, because that's a coping mechanism.
[02:17:37.652 --> 02:17:45.639]  I need your prayers, because I'm getting to where I just can't look at these people.
[02:17:45.639 --> 02:17:48.442]  I'm not as strong as President Trump.
[02:17:48.442 --> 02:17:57.570]  And here's the thing, my soul cannot be a party to this Satanism.
[02:18:00.063 --> 02:18:01.123]  And I figured it out.
[02:18:01.123 --> 02:18:02.204]  I figured out the whole thing.
[02:18:02.204 --> 02:18:04.785]  I mean, I, I know what they're gonna do before they do it.
[02:18:04.785 --> 02:18:08.646]  And it's just, I just, it's so sad.
[02:18:08.646 --> 02:18:12.107]  I can hardly even talk at this point.
[02:18:12.107 --> 02:18:28.513]  Like as soon as I take this information into my cerebral cortex and actually try to talk about it now, it's just, it's so horrible.
[02:18:28.513 --> 02:18:29.473]  Here's the really bad part.
[02:18:31.585 --> 02:18:56.064]  I know they're setting up a system where for me to survive, and for my family to survive physically, there's coming a point, sooner rather than later, where I will have to join with the New World Order, which is exactly what they want, just to save my family, and I'll have to take part in promoting the bioweapon release and the extermination of almost everybody on Earth.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:59.042]  And obviously I'm going to say no.
[02:18:59.042 --> 02:19:01.704]  I'm not going to join them because they're so evil and bad.
[02:19:01.704 --> 02:19:06.447]  And because when I even think about it, I feel God's presence being removed and that's worse than death.
[02:19:06.447 --> 02:19:08.829]  But everybody's going to die, folks.
[02:19:08.829 --> 02:19:09.750]  And I'm not just saying it.
[02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:11.311]  They admit all of this.
[02:19:11.311 --> 02:19:12.732]  They're setting up a kill grid.
[02:19:12.732 --> 02:19:14.974]  They're making us obsolete.
[02:19:14.974 --> 02:19:16.995]  And then I run into people that laugh at me on the street.
[02:19:16.995 --> 02:19:17.916]  They think it's funny.
[02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:21.379]  It's not funny.
[02:19:21.379 --> 02:19:22.820]  Bill Gates.
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:23.120]  Okay.
[02:19:26.417 --> 02:19:29.259]  I cut a one-minute piece that I don't even know if I sent it to you guys.
[02:19:29.259 --> 02:19:31.741]  I don't know if I aired it.
[02:19:31.741 --> 02:19:34.123]  I cut a one-minute piece this morning.
[02:19:34.123 --> 02:19:35.124]  It's not even an ad.
[02:19:35.124 --> 02:19:41.029]  We just run these informational pieces where I laid it out, and this says it all pretty much right here.
[02:19:41.029 --> 02:19:53.039]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has... ...control of Western...
[02:20:06.305 --> 02:20:14.191]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III.
[02:20:14.191 --> 02:20:16.413]  His father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:20:16.413 --> 02:20:24.440]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:26.181]  Bill Gates is in control.
[02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:31.866]  They have spent a hundred-plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens
[02:20:34.382 --> 02:20:41.747]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[02:20:41.747 --> 02:20:43.468]  And all of that's true and it's much worse than that.
[02:20:46.294 --> 02:20:50.697]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[02:20:50.697 --> 02:20:59.422]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[02:20:59.422 --> 02:21:02.244]  They want total corporate power.
[02:21:02.244 --> 02:21:10.008]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Caan, and it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[02:21:11.509 --> 02:21:18.091]  And in the book, you have megacorporations that control the planet, and there are no longer nation-states.
[02:21:18.091 --> 02:21:22.573]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[02:21:22.573 --> 02:21:30.156]  But if you actually read what the Davos Group and the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, say in the year 2020, that is their endgame.
[02:21:30.156 --> 02:21:30.836]  That is their goal.
[02:21:31.656 --> 02:21:39.068]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people who see us as chattel.
[02:21:39.068 --> 02:21:43.535]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[02:21:43.535 --> 02:21:44.576]  We must reject it now.
[02:21:45.694 --> 02:22:03.027]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years, and I've overseen, well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things, and I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[02:22:03.027 --> 02:22:05.949]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls.
[02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:08.171]  Everything you do.
[02:22:08.171 --> 02:22:11.834]  And he now says, you're going to take the shots.
[02:22:11.834 --> 02:22:15.758]  And of course, in England they are now saying what I told you.
[02:22:15.758 --> 02:22:17.520]  You will not be allowed to travel.
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:21.704]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[02:22:21.704 --> 02:22:23.045]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill.
[02:22:23.846 --> 02:22:30.768]  Gates, your owner, your master, says you ought to take four to five COVID shots a year.
[02:22:30.768 --> 02:22:36.930]  For adult, two for baby, and baby much more manageable.
[02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:40.352]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[02:22:40.352 --> 02:22:44.333]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[02:22:45.928 --> 02:23:00.222]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them, to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park, they have to look at us, the common people.
[02:23:00.222 --> 02:23:02.124]  They have to look at the proletariat.
[02:23:02.124 --> 02:23:02.945]  They have to look at the scum.
[02:23:03.485 --> 02:23:05.407]  That's why they love the lockdown.
[02:23:05.407 --> 02:23:06.649]  Putting muzzles on us.
[02:23:06.649 --> 02:23:08.131]  That gives them a big thrill.
[02:23:08.131 --> 02:23:10.273]  Controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[02:23:10.273 --> 02:23:12.175]  Bankrupting Main Street.
[02:23:12.175 --> 02:23:13.757]  Bankrupting small towns.
[02:23:13.757 --> 02:23:22.687]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:25.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over.
[02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:27.411]  Playtime's over.
[02:23:27.411 --> 02:23:30.474]  They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance.
[02:23:30.474 --> 02:23:32.976]  And now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[02:23:32.976 --> 02:23:33.796]  You know this.
[02:23:33.796 --> 02:23:34.537]  I know this.
[02:23:34.537 --> 02:23:35.778]  It's all out in the open.
[02:23:35.778 --> 02:23:37.939]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[02:23:37.939 --> 02:23:39.661]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[02:23:39.661 --> 02:23:40.742]  Identify the enemy.
[02:23:40.742 --> 02:23:41.762]  Identify the enemy.
[02:23:41.762 --> 02:23:48.568]  Identify your enemy now.
[02:23:48.568 --> 02:23:51.170]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:00.043 --> 02:24:01.184]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[02:24:01.184 --> 02:24:03.845]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:24:03.845 --> 02:24:09.227]  I've gotten myself together and I'm able to talk about this now just briefly.
[02:24:09.227 --> 02:24:16.011]  I, at one level, feel guilty saying these things on air.
[02:24:16.011 --> 02:24:21.033]  And then I go back over it and look at it and it's worse than I'm saying and it really freaks me out.
[02:24:21.033 --> 02:24:26.096]  And it also freaks me out because, I'll just say it, my cells that God designed
[02:24:27.250 --> 02:24:28.911]  Pick up God's commands.
[02:24:28.911 --> 02:24:29.991]  That's how it works.
[02:24:29.991 --> 02:24:31.132]  It's how we all are.
[02:24:31.132 --> 02:24:34.253]  It's how the birds know how to fly down magnetic lines 3,000 miles.
[02:24:34.253 --> 02:24:38.014]  It's how, you know, butterflies... I mean, we're all connected to the universe that God created.
[02:24:38.014 --> 02:24:39.415]  It's electrical charge.
[02:24:39.415 --> 02:24:40.836]  It's spiritual.
[02:24:40.836 --> 02:24:49.479]  They now have that proven and with different spectrometers picked up this dark matter that's there that's five times more powerful at one level than our dimension.
[02:24:49.479 --> 02:24:52.120]  We are held in this place.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:53.801]  And as a man,
[02:24:56.903 --> 02:25:04.467]  My brain is now shifting out of talk into action.
[02:25:04.467 --> 02:25:06.808]  I know yours is as well.
[02:25:06.808 --> 02:25:10.110]  We're under assault.
[02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:17.893]  And they give us all these reasons to kill each other over what color we are.
[02:25:17.893 --> 02:25:21.775]  And if some white crazy person's trying to kill you because you're black, that's a real thing.
[02:25:21.775 --> 02:25:24.497]  Or you're white, some crazy black person's trying to kill you, that's real.
[02:25:25.282 --> 02:25:28.944]  But at the end of the day, it's been manufactured.
[02:25:28.944 --> 02:25:30.265]  It's been force-fed.
[02:25:30.265 --> 02:25:32.326]  It's been generated.
[02:25:32.326 --> 02:25:34.647]  This has been done by design.
[02:25:34.647 --> 02:25:40.230]  The flames have been more than fed, they've been lit.
[02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:43.671]  They're not just fanning something, they started this.
[02:25:43.671 --> 02:25:50.515]  And they are so threatened by the Christian ethos that unifies us together,
[02:25:51.567 --> 02:26:05.992]  That's why they're killing Christianity, because it's an operating system, whether you believe in Christ or not, it's an operating system that's diametrically opposed to their satanic order.
[02:26:05.992 --> 02:26:16.516]  And so, let me just say this and I'll go to your calls.
[02:26:16.516 --> 02:26:19.677]  We are facing a scientific revolution.
[02:26:21.837 --> 02:26:28.302]  Now, when the globalists say, trust science, they don't own science, they don't control science, they're trying to control it.
[02:26:28.302 --> 02:26:30.684]  Most of what they say is a lie, scientifically.
[02:26:30.684 --> 02:26:36.368]  They're saying, we're the technocrats, we're the high priests, you do what we say.
[02:26:36.368 --> 02:26:44.554]  And what they're building is a system that makes you live shorter lives, or painful lives, and finally phases you out.
[02:26:44.554 --> 02:26:46.236]  Because they know not to take on humans.
[02:26:47.867 --> 02:26:51.030]  In a big upfront attack, we'll get together and we'll kick some ass.
[02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:53.792]  So they do it with this softening up, everything they do.
[02:26:53.792 --> 02:27:00.838]  And that's why as a strategist, as a historian, as a researcher, I've never seen flying saucers.
[02:27:00.838 --> 02:27:03.921]  I've never seen a lizard man.
[02:27:03.921 --> 02:27:05.362]  All I do is two plus two.
[02:27:05.362 --> 02:27:09.265]  And the only equation that makes sense is, man, this ain't human.
[02:27:09.265 --> 02:27:11.367]  This is bad.
[02:27:11.367 --> 02:27:13.249]  This doesn't even help the so-called ruling class.
[02:27:14.369 --> 02:27:19.331]  And the ruling class says, oh, we're about to give our bodies up and merge with a frickin' toaster.
[02:27:19.331 --> 02:27:23.792]  They've been deceived.
[02:27:23.792 --> 02:27:27.973]  And so, I don't know what it is, okay?
[02:27:27.973 --> 02:27:31.674]  I just know the Bible most accurately describes it.
[02:27:31.674 --> 02:27:32.775]  And it's bad, man.
[02:27:32.775 --> 02:27:33.235]  It's bad.
[02:27:33.235 --> 02:27:34.715]  And it's an alien.
[02:27:34.715 --> 02:27:37.876]  And it's running the show on this planet.
[02:27:37.876 --> 02:27:39.617]  Because we've got free will, we've rejected God.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.862]  And God is sending a transmission to us that'll get us out of it.
[02:27:44.862 --> 02:27:46.282]  People are like, Jones!
[02:27:46.282 --> 02:27:54.185]  I'm on these shows, they go, I used to think you were crazy, but I heard you 20 years ago say they'll be face scanning you to go into shops and that they'll use a bio-weapon to do it.
[02:27:54.185 --> 02:27:55.426]  How'd you know?
[02:27:55.426 --> 02:27:58.227]  Hell, the Bible said it 2,000 years ago!
[02:27:58.227 --> 02:28:02.369]  Stop giving me credit!
[02:28:02.369 --> 02:28:06.550]  And then I see everybody that doesn't think long-term.
[02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:08.011]  And they only look one step at a time.
[02:28:10.981 --> 02:28:15.985]  They're so selfish, they just want to get in the store, they let themselves be face scanned to see if they're wearing a mask.
[02:28:15.985 --> 02:28:20.668]  It's really just training you to be face scanned to be able to buy and sell, period.
[02:28:20.668 --> 02:28:22.710]  And all the tyranny that comes with that.
[02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:31.156]  And I sit there and I try to explain this to people that I've been good to, that I've taken care of, and they have no respect for me.
[02:28:31.156 --> 02:28:32.517]  But you know why?
[02:28:32.517 --> 02:28:37.181]  Because they have no respect for themselves.
[02:28:41.397 --> 02:28:51.979]  And because as mammals, we've been communally working together at the village, at the farm level, or at the fisher level.
[02:28:51.979 --> 02:28:55.720]  And so all our genetic memory is, on average, getting along with everybody.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:29:04.982]  And only if the big general gets up, or the tribal chief, and says, hey, we got a war, the enemy's coming, and he's the chief because he doesn't lie to us, and we know he's got good ideas, and he knows things before we know them.
[02:29:07.227 --> 02:29:08.908]  But what when you're led by a bad chief?
[02:29:08.908 --> 02:29:09.768]  What does that mean?
[02:29:09.768 --> 02:29:12.309]  And we're led by bad people.
[02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:14.870]  And so our compliance is death.
[02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:22.393]  And I want to explain to the police officers, and the bureaucrats, and the intelligence agencies, and the corporate people, and all of you.
[02:29:22.393 --> 02:29:27.035]  You're not part of the establishment.
[02:29:27.035 --> 02:29:29.777]  You're not part of the winning team serving the New World Order.
[02:29:29.777 --> 02:29:30.337]  You are
[02:29:31.977 --> 02:29:38.743]  Selling out your own family and friends to live a day longer yourself, when we're going to lose everything because of that attitude.
[02:29:38.743 --> 02:29:43.347]  What did Winston Churchill say?
[02:29:43.347 --> 02:29:54.736]  He said, appeasement is feeding the alligator your friends and family, hoping it eats you last.
[02:29:54.736 --> 02:29:58.039]  Instead of, when the alligator comes climbing up, we're tough.
[02:29:59.414 --> 02:30:01.516]  We've got clubs, we've got sticks.
[02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:03.557]  You think the alligator climbs out to eat you?
[02:30:03.557 --> 02:30:06.920]  Or the crocodile?
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.341]  When he sees you're aggressive?
[02:30:08.341 --> 02:30:10.623]  No, he knows, oh, those people are unified.
[02:30:10.623 --> 02:30:15.666]  But if an alligator or crocodile saw five or six humans looking scared, running from it, he'll attack!
[02:30:15.666 --> 02:30:18.028]  Because he knows you're cowards!
[02:30:18.028 --> 02:30:21.050]  And all these people think, running.
[02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:23.212]  I mean, I can tell you how many grown men I know.
[02:30:23.212 --> 02:30:28.116]  There it is, impeachment is feeding the crocodile, hoping he will eat you fast.
[02:30:33.752 --> 02:30:47.626]  How many grown men I know, that when a dog on a hike and bike trail comes up to be dominant to them, I don't care if it's a German Shepherd, a Pit Bull, whatever it is, and they end up going the other side of the deal, and they end up acting like they're scared the dog wants to get them.
[02:30:47.626 --> 02:30:55.954]  When somebody's got their Pit Bull or something and it comes at me, I start walking towards it, and the dog does a thing, I'll say, I'll beat your ass, you don't get your damn dog out of the way.
[02:30:55.954 --> 02:30:57.996]  A couple times I've had to kick that dog upside the head.
[02:30:59.346 --> 02:31:02.888]  But see, that's not about acting tough, it's about having my instincts honed and ready.
[02:31:02.888 --> 02:31:04.088]  But those dogs know!
[02:31:04.088 --> 02:31:08.830]  Now those dogs, they go to the other side when I'm... And I'm not bowing up down the hiking bike trail!
[02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:13.433]  But they assess you spiritually, they look at you and they say, how's that person acting?
[02:31:13.433 --> 02:31:15.914]  And I just ever so slightly start going towards that dog.
[02:31:17.111 --> 02:31:20.372]  Ever so slightly, and they go away, instead of them coming up to me.
[02:31:20.372 --> 02:31:24.994]  It's not about, I'm the big man, and the pit bull's scared of me, or the German shepherd's scared of me.
[02:31:24.994 --> 02:31:26.455]  My instincts are lined up.
[02:31:26.455 --> 02:31:29.996]  And somebody's got an attack dog there, I'm not gonna act like prey!
[02:31:29.996 --> 02:31:31.117]  I'm not the prey!
[02:31:31.117 --> 02:31:32.517]  I'm the gorilla!
[02:31:32.517 --> 02:31:40.401]  I'll kill you!
[02:31:40.401 --> 02:31:40.841]  Understand?
[02:31:43.757 --> 02:31:45.658]  And it's good that I'll kill you.
[02:31:45.658 --> 02:31:47.500]  It's not because I'm looking for trouble.
[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:49.061]  It's because I'm not getting pushed around.
[02:31:49.061 --> 02:32:02.130]  And all these men I know that act big and powerful and tough, they don't do anything for their communities, anything for their societies, and they've rolled over to evil, and we're now all in grave danger because of it!
[02:32:02.130 --> 02:32:05.252]  Well, I pledge to you, more action.
[02:32:05.252 --> 02:32:09.015]  A little less talk, a little more action, to quote Elvis.
[02:32:09.015 --> 02:32:10.436]  Because that's the season we're going into.
[02:32:10.436 --> 02:32:12.117]  Nothing offensive, nothing violent at this point.
[02:32:13.766 --> 02:32:18.590]  But I'll tell you, they're coming to your house with forced inoculation soon.
[02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:20.111]  They're coming with their mark of the beast.
[02:32:20.111 --> 02:32:21.492]  They're coming with their nanotech.
[02:32:21.492 --> 02:32:23.674]  They've said they are.
[02:32:23.674 --> 02:32:31.580]  And so I'd be a liar if I didn't tell you to start getting ready.
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:33.101]  We're not going to run and get out of this.
[02:32:33.101 --> 02:32:33.762]  We're going to have to fight.
[02:32:35.794 --> 02:32:38.516]  They're putting in their 5G for their robot cars.
[02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.837]  Amazon's taking over awesome with Google.
[02:32:40.837 --> 02:32:46.520]  By next year, they're going to have drones flying in the skies and robot cars up and down the streets, they've announced.
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:47.981]  We're being made obsolete.
[02:32:47.981 --> 02:32:52.664]  And all you got to do is say, I don't buy products from something that wasn't driven by a human.
[02:32:52.664 --> 02:32:56.186]  I don't go to restaurants where robots serve me.
[02:32:56.186 --> 02:32:59.028]  Oh, but see, when you go to those, you're going to get social credits.
[02:32:59.028 --> 02:33:01.810]  They're already saying they're going to pay you to go to robot shops.
[02:33:01.810 --> 02:33:03.551]  They're going to pay you to buy robot goods.
[02:33:05.236 --> 02:33:06.096]  And you know what?
[02:33:06.096 --> 02:33:07.657]  If we sit there and do that, we deserve it.
[02:33:07.657 --> 02:33:08.437]  But here's the thing.
[02:33:08.437 --> 02:33:10.678]  The sheeple are followers for a reason.
[02:33:10.678 --> 02:33:12.999]  It's up to us, the true leaders.
[02:33:12.999 --> 02:33:16.380]  Not guys posing like they're alpha males.
[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:24.364]  But it's up to us that are alpha males to not just lead, not just fight, but die, if need be, with pleasure to defeat this.
[02:33:24.364 --> 02:33:26.585]  And so I'm just telling you, we've gone to a whole new level.
[02:33:26.585 --> 02:33:28.545]  You think I'm excited I've been proven right?
[02:33:28.545 --> 02:33:32.647]  I'm physically ill!
[02:33:32.647 --> 02:33:34.608]  Don't you know how much I want to be robbed?
[02:33:36.095 --> 02:33:37.843]  We weren't wrong!
[02:33:37.843 --> 02:33:39.510]  We were right!
[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:40.875]  And now we've got a fight!
[02:33:44.474 --> 02:33:53.800]  Our partnership with My Patriot Supply to give you the lowest discounts possible on food has led to new ways to save on preparing your family for what comes next.

[02:34:45.365 --> 02:35:02.701]  Remember, the global lockdowns you're witnessing, the Black Lives Matter, Antifa riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires, led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[02:35:03.602 --> 02:35:11.532]  They've set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and their hundreds of billions of dollars individually.
[02:35:11.532 --> 02:35:18.080]  Leveraging that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[02:35:18.881 --> 02:35:29.871]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game, trying to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe, so these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[02:35:29.871 --> 02:35:38.379]  That's why I'm so angry at these globalists, because when you're looking at them, they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us.
[02:35:38.379 --> 02:35:41.562]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[02:35:41.562 --> 02:35:43.204]  It's us or them, period.
[02:35:46.428 --> 02:35:52.333]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with everybody.
[02:35:52.333 --> 02:35:58.398]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, communist Chinese, have come out and said they're going to contest the election.
[02:35:58.398 --> 02:36:00.780]  They know that Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:06.645]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[02:36:06.645 --> 02:36:13.730]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election, the Democrats have said they're going to break away
[02:36:14.851 --> 02:36:23.318]  politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext to sabotage the Republic even more.
[02:36:23.318 --> 02:36:35.848]  So, until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed, it's just going to continue to happen.
[02:36:35.848 --> 02:36:42.854]  And so that's the big problem here, is that we have systemic, dug-in corruption by people that hate the country's very existence.
[02:36:45.493 --> 02:36:48.674]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[02:36:48.674 --> 02:36:57.238]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[02:36:57.238 --> 02:37:00.799]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[02:37:00.799 --> 02:37:13.504]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[02:37:14.827 --> 02:37:15.427]  We're good.
[02:37:48.037 --> 02:37:50.666]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:04.301]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:38:04.301 --> 02:38:06.442]  Run on for a long time.
[02:38:06.442 --> 02:38:08.643]  Sooner or later, they're gonna cut you down.
[02:38:08.643 --> 02:38:12.304]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:38:12.304 --> 02:38:15.245]  Run on for a long time.
[02:38:15.245 --> 02:38:18.186]  Run on for a long time.
[02:38:18.186 --> 02:38:21.087]  Sooner or later, they're gonna cut you down.
[02:38:21.087 --> 02:38:23.528]  Sooner or later, they're gonna cut you down.
[02:38:25.735 --> 02:38:30.978]  We gotta make sure we keep our powder dry.
[02:38:30.978 --> 02:38:32.619]  We gotta make sure we cut them down.
[02:38:32.619 --> 02:38:35.040]  We cut down the big rats.
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.722]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[02:38:38.722 --> 02:38:43.205]  Something bigger than you, Bill Gates, in this universe.
[02:38:43.205 --> 02:38:43.765]  You know it.
[02:38:43.765 --> 02:38:44.346]  You're not God.
[02:38:45.626 --> 02:38:53.711]  All right, we're going to go to Alex in Sweden, Michael in Australia, and many others.
[02:38:53.711 --> 02:38:56.873]  But since I mentioned it, here's the article, InfoWars.com.
[02:38:56.873 --> 02:38:58.214]  Everybody can see this coming.
[02:38:58.214 --> 02:39:02.077]  New technology refuses entrance to shops if you're not wearing a mask.
[02:39:02.077 --> 02:39:04.978]  All over the world, it scans to make sure there's a mask.
[02:39:04.978 --> 02:39:08.961]  It's really getting you ready for the facial identification, for the global social credit score.
[02:39:08.961 --> 02:39:11.583]  And the companies selling it admit that!
[02:39:11.583 --> 02:39:14.885]  Again, this is all a pre-design rollout on record.
[02:39:17.523 --> 02:39:22.629]  And now they're saying forced inoculations coming as early as Christmas.
[02:39:22.629 --> 02:39:25.733]  Santy Claus ain't coming with presents.
[02:39:25.733 --> 02:39:26.654]  He's coming with coal.
[02:39:26.654 --> 02:39:29.917]  Go ahead and play it with audio.
[02:39:29.917 --> 02:39:33.361]  It's both in Taiwanese and in English.
[02:39:33.361 --> 02:39:33.662]  Here it is.
[02:39:46.142 --> 02:39:47.483]  Authenticated.
[02:39:47.483 --> 02:39:49.363]  Authenticated.
[02:39:49.363 --> 02:39:52.605]  I mean, you talk about dystopic.
[02:39:52.605 --> 02:39:56.406]  And this is training everyone and the children and just in a total cult.
[02:39:56.406 --> 02:39:58.807]  And now it's going to be, do you have your shots to travel?
[02:39:58.807 --> 02:40:00.047]  They now admit it.
[02:40:00.047 --> 02:40:01.288]  We told you that eight months ago.
[02:40:01.288 --> 02:40:08.971]  Now it's all admitted because they already said it in the Rockefeller plan and the damn Bill Gates plan.
[02:40:08.971 --> 02:40:14.213]  But I sit there and I talk to people I know, bankers and lawyers and people that are successful folks.
[02:40:15.458 --> 02:40:16.698]  And they look at you like you're dumb.
[02:40:16.698 --> 02:40:20.800]  They go, you don't know that type of stuff, Alex.
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.420]  These people know I'm successful.
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:26.641]  The thing is, they don't even, they don't respect themselves.
[02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:29.662]  They think it's funny that something dystopic is happening.
[02:40:29.662 --> 02:40:32.223]  And I describe them as the dodo bird.
[02:40:32.223 --> 02:40:35.804]  Galapagos Island, these big, fat, juicy birds, big beaks.
[02:40:35.804 --> 02:40:37.525]  They look, their bodies are like turkeys.
[02:40:37.525 --> 02:40:38.985]  They have big heads.
[02:40:38.985 --> 02:40:41.346]  And they said one of them could feed ten soldiers.
[02:40:41.346 --> 02:40:43.647]  They described it as a Christmas turkey.
[02:40:43.647 --> 02:40:45.007]  But they'd never been around
[02:40:46.991 --> 02:40:47.411]  Killers.
[02:40:47.411 --> 02:40:51.474]  They've never been around coyotes or wolves or anything else.
[02:40:51.474 --> 02:41:03.763]  And so you'd walk over and club one in the head and the others will just sit there.
[02:41:03.763 --> 02:41:06.525]  Because they had no ancestral memory.
[02:41:06.525 --> 02:41:08.906]  You know, instincts are ancestral.
[02:41:08.906 --> 02:41:12.329]  And so I asked myself, why does the public not have ancestral memories?
[02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:16.452]  I mean, I see stuff going on and literally my instincts are like, whoa.
[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:22.244]  I mean, nobody ever had to tell me when I was a little kid not to run from a dog.
[02:41:22.244 --> 02:41:24.546]  They'd be like, dogs jump out of it, it'll come running up.
[02:41:24.546 --> 02:41:26.468]  Other kids would run, the dogs would chase them, bite them.
[02:41:26.468 --> 02:41:30.292]  Everybody would say, hey little kid, you didn't run from the dogs, they ran right around you.
[02:41:30.292 --> 02:41:31.613]  Well, I knew you didn't run from dogs.
[02:41:31.613 --> 02:41:32.694]  Nobody had to tell me that.
[02:41:32.694 --> 02:41:35.477]  I mean, why don't people have the download, man?
[02:41:35.477 --> 02:41:36.798]  I want you to have the download.
[02:41:36.798 --> 02:41:38.780]  I know our audience has the download.
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:41.382]  But I'm saying, the public's missing it.
[02:41:41.382 --> 02:41:42.584]  And it's dangerous, folks.
[02:41:45.145 --> 02:41:48.066]  All right, the good news is I have really good news and I'll go to your calls.
[02:41:48.066 --> 02:41:50.268]  Really good news to announce here.
[02:41:50.268 --> 02:41:53.769]  I'll be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6.30 p.m.
[02:41:53.769 --> 02:41:54.870]  feeling really good.
[02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:56.071]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[02:41:56.071 --> 02:41:58.032]  Don't let it dominate your life.
[02:41:58.032 --> 02:42:01.633]  We have developed under the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge.
[02:42:01.633 --> 02:42:04.115]  I feel better than I did 20 years ago.
[02:42:04.115 --> 02:42:06.676]  So, he probably got a regular cold, a regular flu.
[02:42:06.676 --> 02:42:08.257]  Maybe it is the real COVID.
[02:42:08.257 --> 02:42:09.998]  Nine out of ten times the tests are fake.
[02:42:09.998 --> 02:42:13.760]  The one he was administered, we now know it's the worst, most false positive there is out there.
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:15.281]  Hi, Alex?
[02:42:15.281 --> 02:42:15.801]  Hi, how are you?
[02:42:45.154 --> 02:42:46.174]  I'm pretty freaked out, brother.
[02:42:46.174 --> 02:42:47.055]  I know it's the middle of the night.
[02:42:47.055 --> 02:42:50.176]  How are you over there in beautiful Australia?
[02:42:50.176 --> 02:42:51.916]  Oh, pretty good.
[02:42:51.916 --> 02:42:59.839]  Right next to Victoria here, though, where it's just a nightmare what's going on over there.
[02:42:59.839 --> 02:43:01.439]  You are the model of U.N.
[02:43:01.439 --> 02:43:07.541]  martial law with your communist, what, mayors and governor, yeah?
[02:43:07.541 --> 02:43:13.643]  It's, you know, they sold out to China, the state of Victoria, the last few years.
[02:43:14.395 --> 02:43:18.518]  All the infrastructure is now owned by China over there.
[02:43:18.518 --> 02:43:24.022]  Obviously they're taking their orders directly from the Communist Party.
[02:43:24.022 --> 02:43:24.983]  It's a nightmare.
[02:43:24.983 --> 02:43:26.344]  It really is.
[02:43:26.344 --> 02:43:32.769]  And people don't understand how important people like you are and Donald Trump.
[02:43:32.769 --> 02:43:34.090]  Brother, people like you.
[02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:36.272]  You're up at four in the morning or whatever it is where you're at.
[02:43:36.272 --> 02:43:38.433]  And you've got four time zones.
[02:43:38.433 --> 02:43:38.994]  You care?
[02:43:38.994 --> 02:43:40.015]  It's normal!
[02:43:40.015 --> 02:43:42.957]  What happened to the instinct of not letting this happen?
[02:43:45.831 --> 02:43:51.154]  I don't know, but look, I've got a theory here about Trump and his COVID.
[02:43:51.154 --> 02:44:02.382]  I saw that tweet, it's great that he's out of hospital, but everyone was saying that Joe Biden was going to get a COVID diagnosis and dodge the first debate.
[02:44:02.382 --> 02:44:06.444]  That didn't happen, but what's happened now?
[02:44:06.444 --> 02:44:11.908]  Trump beat him to the punch and if Biden comes out and says, I've got COVID now, he
[02:44:12.705 --> 02:44:13.766]  It just looks stupid.
[02:44:13.766 --> 02:44:24.110]  So it's another, whatever happened, but Donald Trump does it again, I think.
[02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:27.592]  I just can't understand how people can't see what he's trying to do.
[02:44:32.396 --> 02:44:34.337]  Thank God for people like you, Alex.
[02:44:34.337 --> 02:44:35.698]  Brother, thank God for you.
[02:44:35.698 --> 02:44:37.758]  We're like on the same lifeboat together.
[02:44:37.758 --> 02:44:40.579]  Look, I like Trump, but he is a wild man.
[02:44:40.579 --> 02:44:44.821]  And I believe that, doctor, when he said Trump demanded all the experimental treatments.
[02:44:44.821 --> 02:44:47.822]  See, Trump's, he's good, but that's just crazy.
[02:44:47.822 --> 02:44:53.284]  And I just hope, because they're still going to give it to him another five days, that it doesn't hurt him, you know?
[02:44:53.284 --> 02:44:55.325]  Well, I mean, look, who knows?
[02:44:58.573 --> 02:45:01.997]  Right here, right now in Australia, people just...
[02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:08.483]  The people that support what's going on in Victoria.
[02:45:08.483 --> 02:45:18.707]  I have family that comes to my house in a damn mask and I show them statistics that it's not as bad as even the flu and that most the numbers are and they won't listen.
[02:45:18.707 --> 02:45:20.328]  They just are in a damn trance.
[02:45:20.328 --> 02:45:23.230]  Then I explain the lockdown is already killing the third world.
[02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:23.990]  They don't care.
[02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:26.951]  And it's like these used to be smart people.
[02:45:26.951 --> 02:45:28.252]  How do we break them out of the trance?
[02:45:30.262 --> 02:45:31.183]  I don't think so.
[02:45:51.562 --> 02:45:52.102]  Exactly.
[02:45:52.102 --> 02:45:55.163]  Men are told they're bad, and they're no different, you know, this and that, than women.
[02:45:55.163 --> 02:45:57.843]  And so men grow beards because that's something we can do.
[02:45:57.843 --> 02:46:01.144]  And people are feeling disempowered, so they feel like, hell, I'll go ahead and Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:46:01.144 --> 02:46:02.024]  You're very smart.
[02:46:02.024 --> 02:46:02.524]  Smarter than I am.
[02:46:02.524 --> 02:46:03.064]  That's it.
[02:46:03.064 --> 02:46:08.786]  They wear the mask because at least that makes them think they're doing something good, which is how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:46:08.786 --> 02:46:11.326]  I don't know who first said that, but it's damn true.
[02:46:11.326 --> 02:46:11.746]  Thank you, sir.
[02:46:11.746 --> 02:46:15.767]  Because they get good people to do bad things in the name of something good.
[02:46:16.843 --> 02:46:20.206]  And it's just, the average Nazi thought they were good.
[02:46:20.206 --> 02:46:21.587]  They didn't know they were evil.
[02:46:21.587 --> 02:46:23.469]  The average communist believes in it.
[02:46:23.469 --> 02:46:27.132]  Alex in Sweden, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:46:27.132 --> 02:46:28.493]  Hello, can you hear me?
[02:46:28.493 --> 02:46:30.775]  Yes sir, welcome and thank you.
[02:46:30.775 --> 02:46:36.740]  Yeah, I want to start, because I don't know if I'm ever going to go through you again.
[02:46:36.740 --> 02:46:39.682]  You actually started the Truth Movement in Sweden in 2004.
[02:46:39.682 --> 02:46:45.227]  There was a guy called Mikael Kronqvist who saw your movie, 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:47.451]  I was aware of the movement.
[02:46:47.451 --> 02:46:49.774]  Did it create some babies of its own though, right?
[02:47:04.068 --> 02:47:08.250]  Yeah, yeah, it's like now it's springing up again.
[02:47:08.250 --> 02:47:13.072]  Before the coronavirus even came up, people started getting together and doing something again.
[02:47:13.072 --> 02:47:15.253]  So I guess people were feeling that something was going on.
[02:47:15.253 --> 02:47:19.034]  I'm going to hold you over, but it's not about me getting the attention.
[02:47:19.034 --> 02:47:22.416]  It's about the audience that supported it, all the guests, and as a family.
[02:47:22.416 --> 02:47:27.998]  I've had Bolsonaro's son, who's a member of Congress there, and they've invited me down to meet with the President.
[02:47:27.998 --> 02:47:28.838]  I just haven't been able to go.
[02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:32.040]  I want to go, but they've got me detained here, basically, out of the fight.
[02:47:33.086 --> 02:47:37.249]  They said, no, you were the grassroots matrix that launched Bolsonaro.
[02:47:37.249 --> 02:47:40.251]  And I've had, at least Bolsonaro is nice to me.
[02:47:40.251 --> 02:47:41.632]  You know, people like Nigel Farage.
[02:47:41.632 --> 02:47:42.633]  I like Nigel.
[02:47:42.633 --> 02:47:44.754]  He's come on probably 50 times.
[02:47:44.754 --> 02:47:45.735]  He called me last year.
[02:47:45.735 --> 02:47:47.796]  Last time I talked to him, he wanted to talk about something off record.
[02:47:47.796 --> 02:47:58.403]  But Nigel Farage, he's embarrassed to come on my show, even though he admitted years ago that their movement didn't take off in England until InfoWars.
[02:47:58.403 --> 02:48:00.245]  And so we have the audience there.
[02:48:01.277 --> 02:48:03.279]  And it happened, and so, but it's not about me.
[02:48:03.279 --> 02:48:08.624]  It's not about, oh, Nigel Farage is scared to come on my show, because Media Matters criticizes him.
[02:48:08.624 --> 02:48:10.126]  I don't need him on my show.
[02:48:10.126 --> 02:48:11.127]  The point is, is that...
[02:48:12.318 --> 02:48:14.119]  You literally are a comrade with somebody.
[02:48:14.119 --> 02:48:18.281]  You help them, you fight with them, and then they care what media matter says.
[02:48:18.281 --> 02:48:20.141]  I don't care about him coming on the show.
[02:48:20.141 --> 02:48:24.303]  I just care that he cares that he'll be criticized coming on.
[02:48:24.303 --> 02:48:26.344]  My God, it's the criticism you want.
[02:48:26.344 --> 02:48:27.084]  The people see that.
[02:48:27.084 --> 02:48:28.645]  I'm gonna come right back to you, Alex.
[02:48:28.645 --> 02:48:31.606]  But yeah, no, Infowars launched 1776 worldwide.
[02:48:31.606 --> 02:48:33.167]  This audience, you did it all, folks.
[02:48:35.609 --> 02:48:48.240]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses, the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:50.162]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[02:48:50.162 --> 02:49:00.852]  If you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3, and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3, if you have zinc and vitamin C as well.
[02:49:01.132 --> 02:49:06.314]  That's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter, because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[02:49:06.314 --> 02:49:14.236]  Now, I've pointed this out, and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[02:49:14.236 --> 02:49:20.418]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C. He should have also added zinc.
[02:49:20.658 --> 02:49:23.902]  Because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[02:49:23.902 --> 02:49:33.414]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[02:49:35.506 --> 02:49:41.031]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[02:49:41.031 --> 02:49:46.176]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[02:49:46.176 --> 02:49:48.518]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[02:49:48.518 --> 02:49:51.120]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:57.664]  Because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[02:49:57.664 --> 02:50:06.270]  This is the highest in AMPM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[02:50:06.270 --> 02:50:06.730]  It's amazing.
[02:50:06.730 --> 02:50:12.994]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it, and that's why it's having such a great effect.
[02:50:13.194 --> 02:50:15.176]  Because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[02:50:15.176 --> 02:50:18.598]  So it's your last chance to get 8-pack PowerStack at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:18.598 --> 02:50:20.460]  It's 60% off and free shipping.
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:21.600]  That is at cost.

[02:50:39.094 --> 02:50:41.716]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:50.418 --> 02:50:56.420]  I didn't go into that whole litany about InfoWars influential activities to puff up what I've done.
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:50:57.781]  I'm already a big enemy of the globalists.
[02:50:57.781 --> 02:50:58.561]  They know what we've done.
[02:50:58.561 --> 02:51:00.222]  I don't want you to understand.
[02:51:00.222 --> 02:51:05.804]  Literally, you the audience of activists, our guests and everyone else is the InfoWars.
[02:51:05.804 --> 02:51:11.806]  And about people fighting back against the globalists and you look at how they got all the trillions of dollars and all the power.
[02:51:12.810 --> 02:51:16.212]  They've got to try to censor you and shut you up.
[02:51:16.212 --> 02:51:26.916]  But so many people that come up through the anti-globalist movement, as soon as they get into power, they then become ashamed of the very roots that took them there when it's being attacked.
[02:51:26.916 --> 02:51:31.658]  I mean, I've had major institutions and groups go, you better not have Gavin McInnes on.
[02:51:31.658 --> 02:51:33.859]  You'll get banned even more.
[02:51:33.859 --> 02:51:34.900]  The guy's a sweetheart.
[02:51:34.900 --> 02:51:35.420]  He's funny.
[02:51:35.420 --> 02:51:36.100]  He's good.
[02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:37.181]  They're lying about him.
[02:51:37.181 --> 02:51:38.221]  He's my brother in arms.
[02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:39.262]  Of course I'm going to have him on.
[02:51:41.189 --> 02:51:42.170]  He's going to have me on.
[02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:45.232]  I mean, that's the spirit that got us where we are.
[02:51:45.232 --> 02:51:45.952]  Freedom.
[02:51:45.952 --> 02:51:50.615]  The spirit that's taking all the freedom away is the spirit of, well, you better not talk to that person.
[02:51:50.615 --> 02:51:51.335]  You'll get censored.
[02:51:51.335 --> 02:51:52.996]  And pretty soon, it's everything.
[02:51:52.996 --> 02:51:54.857]  The guy on one of the top U.S.
[02:51:54.857 --> 02:52:01.181]  cycle teams, the left went down the website of the team and said, you better denounce Trump.
[02:52:01.181 --> 02:52:04.183]  And he said, no, I like Trump.
[02:52:04.183 --> 02:52:04.604]  Banned.
[02:52:04.604 --> 02:52:05.204]  Kicked off the team.
[02:52:07.108 --> 02:52:09.029]  Everybody's like, ooh, we better watch out.
[02:52:09.029 --> 02:52:10.330]  Better watch out?
[02:52:10.330 --> 02:52:15.154]  That's criminal!
[02:52:15.154 --> 02:52:16.675]  Oh, well, we're conservative, see?
[02:52:16.675 --> 02:52:18.136]  We're tough, we can take it.
[02:52:18.136 --> 02:52:25.281]  It's like boys, with their transgender, you know, giving five-year-olds drugs to make their testicles never, you know, grow, and shrivel them up.
[02:52:25.281 --> 02:52:32.086]  Like, you're abusing a kid with a chemical weapon, you confuse them to comply with you and do it, and then you go, oh, he's a boy, he's tough, he can handle it.
[02:52:33.933 --> 02:52:36.515]  But notice they don't start chemically castrating girls.
[02:52:36.515 --> 02:52:39.336]  They don't start frying their ovaries till like 12.
[02:52:39.336 --> 02:52:42.318]  But little boys, they can take it!
[02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:43.178]  Be a big boy!
[02:52:43.178 --> 02:52:44.139]  Be a man!
[02:52:44.139 --> 02:52:45.980]  Let us chop your balls off!
[02:52:45.980 --> 02:52:50.323]  George Soros gets like a scalp when he gets that.
[02:52:50.323 --> 02:52:56.987]  Think about it, George Soros spent a billion bucks on a movement that says we want to break up black families and cut black men's balls off.
[02:52:56.987 --> 02:52:58.367]  Oh, they represent black people.
[02:52:58.367 --> 02:52:59.368]  I mean, what a joke!
[02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:00.889]  Hey, I'm here to chop your balls off!
[02:53:03.715 --> 02:53:07.138]  I represent you!
[02:53:07.138 --> 02:53:08.999]  What's he say in The Last of the Mohegans?
[02:53:08.999 --> 02:53:11.741]  Based on Daniel Boone and true stories that happened.
[02:53:11.741 --> 02:53:14.523]  That's all a composite of true stuff that happened.
[02:53:14.523 --> 02:53:18.447]  But you get sued back then like you will now if you told a story so that they changed the names.
[02:53:18.447 --> 02:53:20.888]  The Last of the Mohegans is a true story.
[02:53:20.888 --> 02:53:23.751]  And when the one group's about to kill The Last of the Mohegans, what's he say?
[02:53:23.751 --> 02:53:26.333]  He pulls out and he goes, I'm gonna take your seed forever.
[02:53:26.333 --> 02:53:28.094]  When I kill you, your tribe's dead.
[02:53:28.094 --> 02:53:31.717]  That's what real evil is, folks, is exterminating a group of people.
[02:53:34.946 --> 02:53:36.087]  And Russell Means played the character.
[02:53:36.087 --> 02:53:37.127]  He's dead now.
[02:53:37.127 --> 02:53:38.728]  He was a good guy overall.
[02:53:38.728 --> 02:53:39.508]  Anyways, I'm going to shut up.
[02:53:39.508 --> 02:53:40.929]  Let's go back to Sweden.
[02:53:40.929 --> 02:53:44.671]  Alex, make your point, brother, about COVID, Trump, election, what's happening.
[02:53:44.671 --> 02:53:45.971]  Go ahead.
[02:53:45.971 --> 02:53:46.411]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:46.411 --> 02:53:48.613]  Quickly about COVID and Trump.
[02:53:48.613 --> 02:53:53.455]  I mean, I know an alternative doctor in Sweden and he's been researching this from the beginning.
[02:53:53.455 --> 02:54:00.418]  And as most people know, the most effective way to beat COVID is to have a high vitamin D level in the blood.
[02:54:00.418 --> 02:54:04.080]  You can take a blood test and you could even get intravenous vitamin D. So maybe
[02:54:05.009 --> 02:54:06.650]  It's a good way to get information out.
[02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:09.613]  You could reply to Trump's tweet.
[02:54:09.613 --> 02:54:11.374]  I think he probably looks on that.
[02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:14.437]  Because that's the most effective way to beat COVID.
[02:54:14.437 --> 02:54:15.938]  It's just vitamin D. You don't need anything else.
[02:54:15.938 --> 02:54:16.279]  That's right.
[02:54:16.279 --> 02:54:18.420]  And Fauci wouldn't say that for eight months.
[02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:19.241]  Now he's forced to.
[02:54:19.241 --> 02:54:22.844]  What do you think?
[02:54:22.844 --> 02:54:23.244]  I don't know.
[02:54:23.244 --> 02:54:24.285]  Maybe he got a conscience.
[02:54:24.285 --> 02:54:25.867]  There was too much pressure.
[02:54:25.867 --> 02:54:28.389]  I don't know how these globalists really work.
[02:54:29.370 --> 02:54:29.831]  Well, that's right.
[02:54:29.831 --> 02:54:37.539]  You basically cannot get COVID if you have high D3, zinc and C. But you're right, D3 is the most important.
[02:54:37.539 --> 02:54:40.742]  And the problem is some people have bad gut syndrome.
[02:54:40.742 --> 02:54:41.683]  They can't absorb it.
[02:54:41.683 --> 02:54:43.005]  Like you said, they need intravenous.
[02:54:43.005 --> 02:54:45.347]  It looks like you've done your research, Alex.
[02:54:45.347 --> 02:54:47.549]  Yeah, a quick comment on what happened in Sweden.
[02:54:47.549 --> 02:54:50.372]  Like a summary of what might be known in the U.S.
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:55:02.315]  We got a lot of criticism from WHO for not following the total lockdown and they're putting pressure to saying that Swedes cannot leave the country.
[02:55:02.315 --> 02:55:06.361]  It's going to put this economic pressure on us somehow.
[02:55:07.541 --> 02:55:13.582]  We got rid of that by donating 420 million crowns via CETA.
[02:55:13.582 --> 02:55:15.503]  The money is supposed to go to like Starbucks.
[02:55:15.503 --> 02:55:16.203]  Hold on!
[02:55:16.203 --> 02:55:18.363]  I swear I'm going right back to you in 60 seconds.
[02:55:18.363 --> 02:55:22.484]  Because I forgot, you're in Sweden where they didn't do the lockdown and had the lowest death rate in Europe.
[02:55:22.484 --> 02:55:24.165]  And so what did you do to change that?
[02:55:24.165 --> 02:55:27.105]  Wow, that's a great example for everybody.
[02:55:27.105 --> 02:55:29.946]  We'll come back in 60 seconds first with Alex, then we'll go to Jeff.
[02:55:30.726 --> 02:55:35.836]  Mike, Mike, Patrick, and Chris, and then Gerald Salente, the Trends Forecaster, takes over.
[02:55:35.836 --> 02:55:38.701]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:55:38.701 --> 02:55:40.244]  Check out the new design of InfoWars.com.
[02:55:44.068 --> 02:55:57.638]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[02:55:57.638 --> 02:55:59.639]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[02:55:59.639 --> 02:56:08.106]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups, like IBM, to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[02:56:08.806 --> 02:56:16.731]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III.
[02:56:16.731 --> 02:56:18.952]  His father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:56:18.952 --> 02:56:26.956]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[02:56:26.956 --> 02:56:29.038]  Bill Gates is in control.
[02:56:29.038 --> 02:56:29.538]  They have spent
[02:56:29.918 --> 02:56:36.941]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[02:56:36.941 --> 02:56:51.868]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[02:56:51.868 --> 02:56:53.129]  Sweden.
[02:56:53.129 --> 02:56:56.690]  Didn't do the lockdowns, didn't wear the little diaper mask, didn't do any of it.
[02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:57.951]  Had the lowest death rate in Europe.
[02:56:59.824 --> 02:57:00.845]  Why did that happen?
[02:57:00.845 --> 02:57:01.966]  Well, they knew there was herd immunity.
[02:57:01.966 --> 02:57:07.270]  They also knew that they were putting the numbers of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[02:57:07.270 --> 02:57:13.115]  But why is Sweden so social, so liberal, but part of the EU, do they not follow the EU system?
[02:57:13.115 --> 02:57:16.638]  Well, they're self-respecting and they're in control of their own country.
[02:57:16.638 --> 02:57:18.659]  Alex and Sweden can give us the rest of the story.
[02:57:18.659 --> 02:57:25.485]  Why did Sweden lead us out of the darkness as an example, not just of real science, but also the people refusing to comply?
[02:57:26.658 --> 02:57:28.079]  I think we were very lucky.
[02:57:28.079 --> 02:57:32.664]  We had the head of the Swedish correspondence to CDC.
[02:57:32.664 --> 02:57:38.349]  He's very stubborn, so he probably knew that it was just a hoax.
[02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:41.112]  And he didn't tell it straight out.
[02:57:41.112 --> 02:57:46.537]  And he had an advisor who was like a pension advisor, but gave him very good advice.
[02:57:46.537 --> 02:57:48.599]  And that advisor, Gizek, he was even out on
[02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.950]  I don't think so.
[02:58:09.136 --> 02:58:10.537]  I'm not saying they're perfect people.
[02:58:10.537 --> 02:58:13.858]  They still push vaccines previous years and so on.
[02:58:13.858 --> 02:58:16.059]  But the experts said that we don't need a lockdown.
[02:58:16.059 --> 02:58:17.120]  It's not going to help.
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:17.820]  And that's it.
[02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:20.101]  It was a simple explanation.
[02:58:20.101 --> 02:58:21.402]  I guess we were lucky.
[02:58:21.402 --> 02:58:22.983]  I didn't have to wear a mask or anything.
[02:58:22.983 --> 02:58:25.624]  It's been pretty much like normal here.
[02:58:25.624 --> 02:58:26.685]  Because it is normal.
[02:58:26.685 --> 02:58:29.766]  But every time there's a death, they celebrate it.
[02:58:29.766 --> 02:58:32.427]  Everybody I know that's into it, they go, well, I know someone died.
[02:58:32.427 --> 02:58:34.728]  And I said, were they 85 with cancer?
[02:58:34.728 --> 02:58:35.349]  How did you know?
[02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:37.630]  I go, because it's an average.
[02:58:39.506 --> 02:58:42.129]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:58:42.129 --> 02:58:45.413]  Before I get to my main point about the election fraud, I just wanted to say
[02:59:01.775 --> 02:59:10.348]  I think it's really dangerous for Trump to be taking experimental stuff because he can get the Coke Mentos Syndrome happening if they just mix something else in later.
[02:59:10.348 --> 02:59:14.374]  It seems like a really bad move.
[02:59:14.374 --> 02:59:15.756]  It's a terrible move by Trump!
[02:59:16.570 --> 02:59:22.074]  He like, heroically, I'll take all the experimental stuff and then give some perfect cover to kill him and say COVID did it.
[02:59:22.074 --> 02:59:25.216]  Yeah, it's, I think Trump's in incredible danger right now.
[02:59:25.216 --> 02:59:29.179]  He'll still be at the White House with this same moron doctor giving him all this stuff.
[02:59:29.179 --> 02:59:34.563]  And I've talked to medical doctors, couple of them, they're scared to come on the show, but they agree that what's been going on is insane.
[02:59:35.936 --> 02:59:40.578]  Yeah, he needs his family advising him with that, but I'll leave that and get to my point.
[02:59:40.578 --> 02:59:49.703]  One good thing I think that Trump could do... Hey, you remember, Alex, when they had the statue issue where everybody on the left wanted every statue pushed over in America?
[02:59:49.703 --> 02:59:52.044]  Do you remember that?
[02:59:52.044 --> 02:59:53.485]  Yes, sir.
[02:59:53.485 --> 02:59:54.866]  And what did Trump do?
[02:59:54.866 --> 03:00:00.789]  He said he came out with an executive order that said 10 years in jail if you push over a statue.
[03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:04.251]  And magically, the last statue fell.
[03:00:05.158 --> 03:00:06.518]  Right before he said that.
[03:00:06.518 --> 03:00:27.084]  So I think what he can do to stop the voter fraud, I think this is a real judo move, is he can say, five years in jail, if you're caught doing voter fraud this election, and throw in a whistleblower clause that says, if you admit what happened, your vote won't count, but you're not going to go to jail.
[03:00:27.084 --> 03:00:30.565]  And then just go up the line and just reel all the fish in.
[03:00:31.155 --> 03:00:33.476]  It will throw a cluster bomb into the media.
[03:00:33.476 --> 03:00:33.876]  No, I agree.
[03:00:33.876 --> 03:00:42.438]  That's why they don't want him to pardon or get released, Assange, because it sends a message to real whistleblowers that they can come out and expose the deep state.
[03:00:42.438 --> 03:00:46.039]  Another huge Trump failing is not getting Julian Assange released.
[03:00:46.039 --> 03:00:47.660]  Thank you so much, Jeff.
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:49.240]  Mike in Texas.
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:51.301]  Thank you, sir.
[03:00:51.301 --> 03:00:53.141]  Hello, Alex.
[03:00:53.141 --> 03:01:00.023]  Whatever Trump has, I don't think it's an ordinary head cold that wouldn't be expected to drop his No 2 set.
[03:01:01.365 --> 03:01:02.786]  Significantly.
[03:01:02.786 --> 03:01:05.847]  So I think he's got the real deal.
[03:01:05.847 --> 03:01:15.491]  I mean, I agree with you that we've all got a good eye and he's lost a lot of weight and his voice is raspy and he's very, very white.
[03:01:15.491 --> 03:01:18.473]  He does look like he's sick.
[03:01:18.473 --> 03:01:20.574]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:01:20.574 --> 03:01:26.876]  I don't understand why they picked two basically experimental or unproven treatments to use on him.
[03:01:29.382 --> 03:01:35.123]  I hope we don't get to a point where that needs to be reviewed, but for now he seems to be doing well.
[03:01:35.123 --> 03:01:39.924]  I wanted to ask you about the 20th Amendment, if we get to that point.
[03:01:39.924 --> 03:01:43.465]  My read is in Section 3 of the Amendment.
[03:01:43.465 --> 03:01:54.787]  Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President.
[03:01:54.787 --> 03:01:58.048]  Congress means House and Senate combined.
[03:01:59.312 --> 03:02:03.713]  It doesn't say the House shall select the replacement president for the temporary president.
[03:02:03.713 --> 03:02:04.633]  No, you're right.
[03:02:04.633 --> 03:02:05.213]  You're right.
[03:02:05.213 --> 03:02:06.834]  And I've been asking lawyers about it.
[03:02:06.834 --> 03:02:08.654]  We should get Bob Barr.
[03:02:08.654 --> 03:02:09.815]  Yeah, Bob Barr, not Bill Barr.
[03:02:09.815 --> 03:02:10.835]  We should get Bill Barr on.
[03:02:10.835 --> 03:02:11.535]  Bob Barr.
[03:02:11.535 --> 03:02:12.275]  Not the Attorney General.
[03:02:12.275 --> 03:02:14.216]  Bob Barr, the former congressman.
[03:02:14.216 --> 03:02:18.617]  Because he's a lawyer and a former congressman that led impeachment processes.
[03:02:18.617 --> 03:02:20.877]  He could give us the right scoop on that.
[03:02:20.877 --> 03:02:26.138]  Pelosi says her interpretation is the House will elect the president if that's the case.
[03:02:26.138 --> 03:02:27.459]  But, I mean, you're probably right.
[03:02:27.459 --> 03:02:28.159]  She's probably full of crap.
[03:02:30.098 --> 03:02:41.540]  Yeah, but in fairness, I mean, Section 4 does seem to contradict my read on it, so it looks to me like you've got two sections of the 20th Amendment that clash with each other.
[03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:44.861]  That would be something for the courts to settle.
[03:02:44.861 --> 03:02:58.463]  As far as the question of what Trump should be doing at this point, I think if I were him, I would pull General Flynn out of wherever he is.
[03:02:59.296 --> 03:03:00.597]  I agree.
[03:03:00.597 --> 03:03:06.702]  He should shove it in their face, pardon him, and put him back in the White House.
[03:03:06.702 --> 03:03:11.285]  He should stop groveling and be afraid of them.
[03:03:11.285 --> 03:03:25.857]  Yeah, and one good note here, if we manage to turn the House and turn it Republican, the Senate and the House conclude their terms on January 3rd.
[03:03:26.943 --> 03:03:33.846]  So a couple weeks before the president has to turn in his whatever.
[03:03:33.846 --> 03:03:34.167]  I agree.
[03:03:34.167 --> 03:03:37.228]  It'd be great to have the trifecta so they wouldn't be able to do that.
[03:03:37.228 --> 03:03:40.130]  And then they'd suddenly have to install in the election results.
[03:03:40.130 --> 03:03:41.030]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:42.271]  What we know is... Good to hear from Mike.
[03:03:42.271 --> 03:03:43.591]  That guy's been calling like 20 years.
[03:03:43.591 --> 03:03:44.772]  Love you, Mike.
[03:03:44.772 --> 03:03:45.772]  Real quick, another Mike.
[03:03:45.772 --> 03:03:47.473]  Mike in Florida.
[03:03:47.473 --> 03:03:48.034]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:03:48.034 --> 03:03:49.314]  Thanks for calling.
[03:03:49.314 --> 03:03:50.155]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:03:50.155 --> 03:03:50.915]  First time caller.
[03:03:51.871 --> 03:03:55.593]  A lot of stuff going on, but I'll try to get to it real quickly.
[03:03:55.593 --> 03:04:03.656]  You know, President Trump had the perfect opportunity to use HCQ and show everybody in the world that this stuff works like crazy.
[03:04:03.656 --> 03:04:06.217]  And why he didn't do it, I don't know.
[03:04:06.217 --> 03:04:14.700]  But this experimental stuff is something that you may not see right away, but down the road may create the cytokine storm.
[03:04:15.887 --> 03:04:17.889]  That's what it says.
[03:04:17.889 --> 03:04:19.010]  It says it can make it worse.
[03:04:19.010 --> 03:04:19.170]  I know.
[03:04:19.170 --> 03:04:19.470]  I'm no doctor.
[03:04:19.470 --> 03:04:20.111]  I read what it said.
[03:04:20.111 --> 03:04:21.992]  Well, nobody knows better than a malpractice lawyer in medical.
[03:04:21.992 --> 03:04:22.352]  So, yeah.
[03:04:22.352 --> 03:04:24.414]  Your wife's a doctor.
[03:04:24.414 --> 03:04:26.656]  You're a malpractice.
[03:04:26.656 --> 03:04:28.137]  What does this look like to you?
[03:04:28.137 --> 03:04:29.578]  It looks like craziness to me.
[03:04:44.067 --> 03:04:48.130]  Well, everywhere you look, it's craziness, okay?
[03:04:48.130 --> 03:04:53.534]  I mean, you talk about them cutting black kids' balls off.
[03:04:53.534 --> 03:04:56.397]  Well, you know, you take a bullet, what do you do?
[03:04:56.397 --> 03:04:58.478]  You cut his balls off, and what do you get?
[03:04:58.478 --> 03:04:59.599]  You get an axe, right?
[03:04:59.599 --> 03:05:00.800]  That's right.
[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:06.385]  All they're doing is making beast of burden out of these black people, and they don't understand that.
[03:05:06.385 --> 03:05:07.966]  They need to wake up.
[03:05:07.966 --> 03:05:11.429]  You know, another point, the Jesuits are really in charge of this world, and you've
[03:05:12.079 --> 03:05:15.001]  We got 10% of Congress is made up of Jesuits.
[03:05:15.001 --> 03:05:16.041]  You know, I agree with you.
[03:05:16.041 --> 03:05:17.082]  I used to hear that.
[03:05:17.082 --> 03:05:22.204]  You know, the Jesuits are suing me out of Georgetown with the whole Charlottesville thing and making stuff up.
[03:05:22.204 --> 03:05:24.105]  And it's literally Jesuits doing it.
[03:05:24.105 --> 03:05:27.727]  I'm like, the Jesuits are taking over the Catholic Church.
[03:05:27.727 --> 03:05:30.609]  The Pope came out and said capitalism's bad.
[03:05:30.609 --> 03:05:34.090]  I mean, he's not the Pope.
[03:05:34.090 --> 03:05:39.753]  Well, the first time, look, the first time that we ended up with a Jesuit Pope, I said, we're really going to have trouble.
[03:05:39.753 --> 03:05:41.074]  Now, my background is
[03:05:41.758 --> 03:05:43.381]  Yeah, you were right in the middle of it.
[03:05:54.833 --> 03:05:56.233]  They put it quite bluntly.
[03:05:56.233 --> 03:05:57.814]  Hey, I'm going to get your name and number, Mike.
[03:05:57.814 --> 03:05:59.054]  I'm going to get you on as a guest.
[03:05:59.054 --> 03:06:00.155]  And we're getting better at this.
[03:06:00.155 --> 03:06:02.055]  Get Patrick's number in Kansas.
[03:06:02.055 --> 03:06:03.236]  I'm coming back on tomorrow.
[03:06:03.236 --> 03:06:05.656]  Mike, if you're there, I'll have you on for 10 minutes as a guest.
[03:06:05.656 --> 03:06:05.917]  All right.
[03:06:05.917 --> 03:06:08.157]  Gerald Cilente is about to take over.
[03:06:08.157 --> 03:06:09.017]  Really appreciate him.
[03:06:09.017 --> 03:06:11.338]  Trends Forecaster does an amazing job.
[03:06:11.338 --> 03:06:13.039]  Talk about all this craziness in the war room.
[03:06:13.039 --> 03:06:14.259]  Owen Schroer coming up.
[03:06:14.259 --> 03:06:19.361]  And then, of course, we have election countdown seven to nine weeknights with so much to cover.
[03:06:19.361 --> 03:06:22.882]  So much going on with DeAnna Lorraine, myself, Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith.
[03:06:23.422 --> 03:06:24.783]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[03:06:24.783 --> 03:06:26.084]  This is taken under the tongue.
[03:06:26.084 --> 03:06:27.306]  It is pure turmeric.
[03:06:50.982 --> 03:07:00.186]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[03:07:00.186 --> 03:07:06.029]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[03:07:06.029 --> 03:07:08.190]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[03:07:08.650 --> 03:07:11.873]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[03:07:11.873 --> 03:07:13.715]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[03:07:13.715 --> 03:07:15.836]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[03:07:15.836 --> 03:07:18.018]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[03:07:18.018 --> 03:07:19.379]  Some like bodies better.
[03:07:19.379 --> 03:07:23.523]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[03:07:23.523 --> 03:07:24.704]  And they fund the InfoWar.

[03:09:06.358 --> 03:09:18.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:09:18.421 --> 03:09:22.682]  Hello, hello.
[03:09:22.682 --> 03:09:31.744]  Just like that cover of the Trends Journal says, residential reality show 2020 masks versus no masks.
[03:09:31.744 --> 03:09:33.344]  So when Trump
[03:09:34.005 --> 03:09:36.106]  Was taken to the hospital.
[03:09:36.106 --> 03:09:37.266]  What's going to happen?
[03:09:37.266 --> 03:09:39.227]  What's going to be the play of it?
[03:09:39.227 --> 03:09:43.308]  This is all coming down to masks versus no masks.
[03:09:43.308 --> 03:09:50.531]  And that's what the election is because here's the headline from CNBC.
[03:09:50.531 --> 03:09:56.213]  Trump says he will leave Walter Reed Hospital on Monday.
[03:09:56.213 --> 03:09:57.993]  Quote.
[03:09:57.993 --> 03:10:01.915]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[03:10:01.915 --> 03:10:02.275]  All right.
[03:10:03.305 --> 03:10:05.546]  Just play the Trump card.
[03:10:05.546 --> 03:10:08.288]  Masks versus no masks.
[03:10:08.288 --> 03:10:12.310]  Lockdowns versus no lockdowns.
[03:10:12.310 --> 03:10:21.375]  Stocks jumped to session high after Trump says it will be discharged later today.
[03:10:21.375 --> 03:10:27.338]  Dow's up now as we speak about 440 points.
[03:10:27.338 --> 03:10:31.060]  On the news that Trump's getting out of the hospital.
[03:10:31.060 --> 03:10:31.560]  So now,
[03:10:32.401 --> 03:10:39.606]  As we know, Trump did a lousy job, as again, the motto of the Trends Journal is think for yourself.
[03:10:39.606 --> 03:10:44.328]  Trump did a lousy job with that debate last week.
[03:10:44.328 --> 03:10:49.272]  So, that's not the news anymore.
[03:10:49.272 --> 03:10:53.214]  The news was he went to the hospital for COVID.
[03:10:53.214 --> 03:10:55.375]  So now what's going on?
[03:10:55.375 --> 03:10:58.457]  Now the markets are going up because they say he's out, but, but,
[03:11:01.047 --> 03:11:14.291]  Again, to me, playing the Trump card, he goes on to say, don't be afraid of COVID.
[03:11:14.291 --> 03:11:18.532]  And that's what this is all about.
[03:11:18.532 --> 03:11:26.034]  You go back to one of our other Trends Journal covers, and it was scaredy cat world.
[03:11:26.034 --> 03:11:27.875]  People having masks on themselves.
[03:11:31.724 --> 03:11:35.725]  Trump is going to play this card.
[03:11:35.725 --> 03:11:38.866]  It's the only card that he has to play.
[03:11:38.866 --> 03:11:42.608]  So let's look at the swing states.
[03:11:42.608 --> 03:11:44.588]  Ah, a place called Michigan.
[03:11:44.588 --> 03:11:46.629]  Oh, they locked it down even more, didn't they?
[03:11:46.629 --> 03:11:49.050]  Oh, and what happened?
[03:11:49.050 --> 03:11:55.052]  The state court, Supreme Court, ruled against Witless, or is it Witmir, or?
[03:11:55.052 --> 03:11:56.672]  Yeah, I think it's Witless-Witmir.
[03:11:56.672 --> 03:11:58.913]  There you go, scaredy cat planet.
[03:12:00.296 --> 03:12:01.977]  Oh, by the way, keep that up there a minute.
[03:12:01.977 --> 03:12:03.959]  You see that mask?
[03:12:03.959 --> 03:12:10.203]  That's the mask when you see the peasants in China wearing all over the place.
[03:12:10.203 --> 03:12:14.306]  And they wear those masks because of the filthy air pollution.
[03:12:14.306 --> 03:12:23.032]  And when you saw President Xi of China when the COVID war broke out, he was wearing that kind of mask too.
[03:12:23.032 --> 03:12:28.556]  But then you come to America, the land of the cowards.
[03:12:29.378 --> 03:12:31.960]  What kind of masks are they wearing?
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:34.682]  Well, we'll wear fashion masks.
[03:12:34.682 --> 03:12:37.044]  Yes, we've been emasculated.
[03:12:37.044 --> 03:12:46.771]  So we'll have all these masks on that say things and that will make me look like, oh, I'm beautiful.
[03:12:46.771 --> 03:12:48.733]  I'm handsome.
[03:12:48.733 --> 03:12:50.214]  I'm so strong.
[03:12:50.214 --> 03:12:52.696]  I'm a believer.
[03:12:52.696 --> 03:12:55.418]  Now all these clown masks they wear.
[03:12:57.213 --> 03:13:00.374]  They're not just common masks anymore.
[03:13:00.374 --> 03:13:05.216]  They're just low-life masks that low-lives wear.
[03:13:05.216 --> 03:13:06.956]  Look at them.
[03:13:06.956 --> 03:13:10.017]  What self-respecting human being would do this?
[03:13:10.017 --> 03:13:14.739]  Well, the country is full of people without that self-respect.
[03:13:14.739 --> 03:13:17.219]  Look at them all.
[03:13:17.219 --> 03:13:22.901]  Oh, the actors and the actresses and all the people playing their parts.
[03:13:22.901 --> 03:13:25.442]  They all wear these stupid masks.
[03:13:26.325 --> 03:13:28.326]  That are worthless.
[03:13:28.326 --> 03:13:31.147]  And again, we've been writing the data in the Trends Journal.
[03:13:31.147 --> 03:13:33.347]  We're not making it up.
[03:13:33.347 --> 03:13:38.929]  You go back to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[03:13:38.929 --> 03:13:43.451]  You go back to the New England Journal of Medicine and that fake Fauci.
[03:13:43.451 --> 03:13:44.151]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:13:44.151 --> 03:13:44.991]  How beautiful.
[03:13:44.991 --> 03:13:48.313]  Oh, how lovely and glamorous you look.
[03:13:48.313 --> 03:13:48.733]  Oh, yeah.
[03:13:48.733 --> 03:13:54.054]  You take off the glasses in that thing, model what was behind them.
[03:13:54.054 --> 03:13:55.275]  Good thing you had that on.
[03:13:56.377 --> 03:13:57.157]  You fool me?
[03:13:57.157 --> 03:14:07.523]  So the masks are, again, they all said that the masks didn't do, they weren't helping against stopping this.
[03:14:07.523 --> 03:14:13.346]  And the only people that should be wearing them are people that are very ill and they should be home.
[03:14:13.346 --> 03:14:20.050]  So going back to the presidential reality show, Trump played the card.
[03:14:20.050 --> 03:14:24.753]  The Trump card that we said he was going to play.
[03:14:24.753 --> 03:14:25.013]  Don't.
[03:14:25.592 --> 03:14:28.975]  Be afraid of COVID.
[03:14:28.975 --> 03:14:30.557]  Cannot be clearer.
[03:14:30.557 --> 03:14:32.719]  Who else is saying that?
[03:14:32.719 --> 03:14:33.960]  You gotta watch out!
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:35.361]  Be afraid!
[03:14:35.361 --> 03:14:39.004]  Look how they're destroying little kids.
[03:14:39.004 --> 03:14:51.436]  You see them getting online to go into kindergarten with masks on and some jerk with a shield and a mask playing Power Trip, taking their temperature.
[03:14:52.662 --> 03:15:02.285]  And again, as Alex and you've been pointing out, everybody on InfoWars, these temperature checks mean nothing.
[03:15:02.285 --> 03:15:06.986]  You can have a cold and they'll show you that you got, you know, means nothing.
[03:15:06.986 --> 03:15:11.727]  The tests, the COVID tests, useless.
[03:15:11.727 --> 03:15:17.429]  But they're locking down more of the global economy.
[03:15:17.429 --> 03:15:20.730]  Hey, Florida opened up.
[03:15:20.730 --> 03:15:22.070]  Well, that's and
[03:15:22.779 --> 03:15:24.901]  What's the caseload in Florida?
[03:15:24.901 --> 03:15:26.482]  How many people died in Florida?
[03:15:26.482 --> 03:15:28.083]  I'm going to guess, all right?
[03:15:28.083 --> 03:15:32.346]  I don't know offhand, but I'm going to guess around 15,000.
[03:15:32.346 --> 03:15:34.268]  But they're totally opened up now.
[03:15:34.268 --> 03:15:35.469]  Yeah, look at that.
[03:15:35.469 --> 03:15:35.789]  Look at that.
[03:15:35.789 --> 03:15:36.550]  Look at these people.
[03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:40.613]  Look at what they're doing to these kids.
[03:15:40.613 --> 03:15:48.939]  The new abnormal, no hugging, no kissing, no dancing, no singing.
[03:15:48.939 --> 03:15:49.560]  So there you go.
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:51.101]  They got what?
[03:15:51.101 --> 03:15:52.582]  14,000 something deaths, right?
[03:15:54.424 --> 03:15:56.866]  25.5 million people.
[03:15:56.866 --> 03:15:59.428]  Excuse me, 21.5 million.
[03:15:59.428 --> 03:16:02.630]  March, April, May, June, July, August, September.
[03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:04.512]  And now we're into October.
[03:16:04.512 --> 03:16:11.637]  New York locked down, and they hated that guy DeSantis, the governor there, because he wouldn't go along with this stuff.
[03:16:11.637 --> 03:16:13.839]  And all the media went after him.
[03:16:13.839 --> 03:16:16.541]  With the cases rising, cases rising.
[03:16:16.541 --> 03:16:19.623]  How many died in New York State?
[03:16:19.623 --> 03:16:19.963]  It's over 33,000.
[03:16:22.941 --> 03:16:33.029]  So double the amount died in New York State, and New York State has $19.5 million, and we're still locked down for all intents and purposes.
[03:16:33.029 --> 03:16:35.271]  And now they're going to lock down more.
[03:16:35.271 --> 03:16:36.672]  That's right.
[03:16:36.672 --> 03:16:38.713]  That's right.
[03:16:38.713 --> 03:16:42.456]  New York City is dead town.
[03:16:42.456 --> 03:16:46.559]  New York City is no town.
[03:16:46.559 --> 03:16:48.541]  Homeless town.
[03:16:48.541 --> 03:16:49.642]  Yeah.
[03:16:49.642 --> 03:16:51.043]  And they're going to lock it down more.
[03:16:52.094 --> 03:16:55.536]  We are going into the greatest depression.
[03:16:55.536 --> 03:16:59.819]  This is a time to prepare to prevail.
[03:16:59.819 --> 03:17:07.744]  And what they sell on InfoWars are very important products for you.
[03:17:07.744 --> 03:17:13.368]  As well as the Trends Journal to help you prepare for what's coming up.
[03:17:13.368 --> 03:17:15.809]  It's a time to unite.
[03:17:15.809 --> 03:17:21.333]  Because if we don't unite and fight for our freedom, we're gonna die
[03:17:22.622 --> 03:17:27.145]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[03:17:44.025 --> 03:17:52.652]  They're giggling about freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short period of time, and then the restrictions will be released.
[03:17:52.652 --> 03:17:54.233]  But they're not.
[03:17:54.233 --> 03:18:03.119]  After a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said, they will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[03:18:03.119 --> 03:18:09.204]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism, or the inchworm effect.
[03:18:09.204 --> 03:18:11.646]  This is the most common way that totalitarians take over.
[03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:26.958]  But there then becomes a point where the public wakes up, but under the incrementalism, it starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge and a clampdown, and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks, or months than you saw in the previous 10 years.
[03:18:26.958 --> 03:18:30.021]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[03:18:30.021 --> 03:18:38.588]  A world government, Qaikom-backed, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[03:18:39.969 --> 03:18:43.330]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[03:18:43.330 --> 03:18:45.310]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[03:18:45.310 --> 03:18:47.991]  Is your city too safe?
[03:18:47.991 --> 03:18:50.792]  Well, not anymore!
[03:18:50.792 --> 03:18:53.193]  Introducing... Democrats!
[03:18:53.193 --> 03:18:57.394]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots!
[03:18:57.394 --> 03:18:57.774]  Looting!
[03:18:58.897 --> 03:19:02.138]  Rampant violence and even homelessness.
[03:19:02.138 --> 03:19:07.140]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[03:19:07.140 --> 03:19:09.541]  No more pesky law and order.
[03:19:09.541 --> 03:19:12.042]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[03:19:13.266 --> 03:19:18.612]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground!
[03:19:18.612 --> 03:19:19.553]  But wait!
[03:19:19.553 --> 03:19:28.422]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[03:19:28.422 --> 03:19:31.466]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[03:19:39.830 --> 03:19:42.752]  The planets have aligned globally.
[03:19:42.752 --> 03:19:43.973]  They've aligned nationally.
[03:19:43.973 --> 03:19:48.156]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[03:19:48.954 --> 03:19:55.737]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[03:19:55.737 --> 03:20:11.144]  So that's why Big Tech, controlled by the very dark forces that love us, is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and traffic control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward.
[03:20:11.544 --> 03:20:20.468]  Because they do not want us to take our birthright, not as of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[03:20:20.468 --> 03:20:32.574]  They are trying to create a new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[03:20:32.574 --> 03:20:34.555]  This is their plan.
[03:20:34.555 --> 03:20:38.917]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say, no, we must embrace God.
[03:20:42.785 --> 03:21:01.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:01.730 --> 03:21:05.171]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:05.171 --> 03:21:08.812]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:21:11.861 --> 03:21:12.622]  Great being on, guys.
[03:21:12.622 --> 03:21:14.282]  Thanks a lot.
[03:21:14.282 --> 03:21:18.104]  Thank you for having me.
[03:21:18.104 --> 03:21:19.145]  Thank you.
[03:21:19.145 --> 03:21:21.386]  Thank you, people.
[03:21:21.386 --> 03:21:25.007]  It's a true honor to be here.
[03:21:25.007 --> 03:21:27.629]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:21:27.629 --> 03:21:29.970]  We're in a fight for our lives here.
[03:21:29.970 --> 03:21:32.011]  This is unprecedented in world history.
[03:21:32.011 --> 03:21:35.773]  I mean, freedom has been robbed from us.
[03:21:35.773 --> 03:21:40.475]  And remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority
[03:21:41.243 --> 03:21:46.605]  Keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams.
[03:21:46.605 --> 03:21:51.167]  And, most people don't want to fight.
[03:21:51.167 --> 03:21:55.128]  One of our, the Trends Journal's a weekly, it goes out tomorrow.
[03:21:55.128 --> 03:21:57.089]  Doing some editing now.
[03:21:57.089 --> 03:22:01.931]  And one of the stories is, give me liberty, or give me mass.
[03:22:01.931 --> 03:22:04.812]  And this is from the Washington Post.
[03:22:04.812 --> 03:22:07.593]  And they did this census.
[03:22:07.593 --> 03:22:09.874]  And, um, it comes down to,
[03:22:10.942 --> 03:22:21.607]  Over 70% of Americans are fine with giving up significant freedoms in order to fight the coronavirus.
[03:22:21.607 --> 03:22:25.628]  70% are willing to give up their freedom.
[03:22:25.628 --> 03:22:30.911]  And you read this thing, it's one after another.
[03:22:30.911 --> 03:22:33.592]  This is unprecedented.
[03:22:33.592 --> 03:22:36.293]  Look what they're doing.
[03:22:36.293 --> 03:22:40.355]  They lock you down and it doesn't work.
[03:22:43.393 --> 03:22:45.254]  Country after country, they're locked down.
[03:22:45.254 --> 03:22:49.255]  Now they're getting a second wave of cases.
[03:22:49.255 --> 03:22:54.937]  They're getting a second wave of cases because they're doing more testing.
[03:22:54.937 --> 03:23:05.861]  But what they never write about, and it was in Yahoo this past week, they had the worst 10 states in America.
[03:23:05.861 --> 03:23:11.102]  And they had cases, cases, cases for each one.
[03:23:11.102 --> 03:23:12.963]  But they never
[03:23:13.649 --> 03:23:17.330]  Had the amount of new deaths.
[03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:21.471]  And when you go and look up the new deaths, they were nothing.
[03:23:21.471 --> 03:23:24.412]  In terms of, who's really dying?
[03:23:24.412 --> 03:23:25.852]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:23:25.852 --> 03:23:32.774]  Go scroll down to that, and you'll see down the bottom, they have all the cases, place after place, state after state.
[03:23:32.774 --> 03:23:34.715]  Yeah, Alabama.
[03:23:34.715 --> 03:23:35.655]  All right, keep going down.
[03:23:35.655 --> 03:23:38.816]  Keep going, keep it going.
[03:23:39.426 --> 03:23:40.346]  All right, now stop there.
[03:23:40.346 --> 03:23:42.767]  I can't read this far, but what do they say there?
[03:23:42.767 --> 03:23:43.587]  How many cases?
[03:23:43.587 --> 03:23:45.388]  Go back up.
[03:23:45.388 --> 03:23:48.248]  What do they got?
[03:23:48.248 --> 03:23:54.690]  94 infection rate, positive tests rate, 12.6%.
[03:23:54.690 --> 03:23:59.251]  New cases on the top per thousand, 25 residents.
[03:23:59.251 --> 03:24:01.812]  But how many people died?
[03:24:01.812 --> 03:24:02.932]  And it's one after another.
[03:24:04.522 --> 03:24:10.185]  And then you go look up and see how many people died in Alabama, Nebraska, and these other places.
[03:24:10.185 --> 03:24:11.666]  It's zero.
[03:24:11.666 --> 03:24:14.487]  It's at the highest three.
[03:24:14.487 --> 03:24:17.289]  Oklahoma, one after another.
[03:24:17.289 --> 03:24:23.112]  So all they do is they talking about cases, but they're not talking about deaths.
[03:24:23.112 --> 03:24:26.193]  So they got everybody freaked out about cases.
[03:24:26.193 --> 03:24:29.175]  We tested have been proven to be inaccurate.
[03:24:29.175 --> 03:24:31.176]  And as Trump said,
[03:24:33.817 --> 03:24:37.419]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[03:24:37.419 --> 03:24:39.080]  There you go.
[03:24:39.080 --> 03:24:44.484]  Here, this is from today's Financial Times.
[03:24:44.484 --> 03:24:45.104]  Where are you?
[03:24:45.104 --> 03:24:45.604]  Where are you?
[03:24:45.604 --> 03:24:46.305]  I just had you.
[03:24:46.305 --> 03:24:48.887]  Is that you over here?
[03:24:48.887 --> 03:24:50.247]  No, it's not there.
[03:24:50.247 --> 03:24:51.128]  Is it over here?
[03:24:51.128 --> 03:24:53.409]  Yep, here it is.
[03:24:53.409 --> 03:24:53.810]  Here we go.
[03:24:53.810 --> 03:24:59.113]  Look at that scary headline.
[03:24:59.113 --> 03:25:02.275]  Second wave jolts Central Europe.
[03:25:04.957 --> 03:25:09.360]  Three months on, the picture looks far darker.
[03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:26.010]  On Friday, the 10.7 million strong Central European nation, the Czech Republic, recorded 3,792 new cases, the highest daily figure.
[03:25:26.010 --> 03:25:34.675]  More than two-thirds of the 80,605 Czechs confirmed to have caught the virus have done so in the past month alone.
[03:25:35.911 --> 03:25:41.333]  Last Wednesday, the government reintroduced a state of emergency.
[03:25:41.333 --> 03:25:45.474]  It doesn't say how many died.
[03:25:45.474 --> 03:25:49.515]  And then you go down to read the article more.
[03:25:49.515 --> 03:26:04.420]  The second wave looks more threatening, like the Czechs, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania have in the past four days all reported their highest caseloads since the start of the pandemic.
[03:26:05.868 --> 03:26:19.399]  Well, they're reporting their highest caseload since the start of the pandemic because now they're doing the testing, particularly with guys and young people, men and women, going back to school.
[03:26:19.399 --> 03:26:22.822]  So now, keep reading this.
[03:26:22.822 --> 03:26:34.012]  Higher rates of testing mean the number of cases reported now is not directly comparable to the first wave.
[03:26:34.012 --> 03:26:34.092]  Oh!
[03:26:35.297 --> 03:26:41.501]  Well, why don't you tell me that and then the next line right after that?
[03:26:41.501 --> 03:26:43.623]  Not comparable to the first one.
[03:26:43.623 --> 03:26:48.847]  Debts have also remained low.
[03:26:48.847 --> 03:26:53.530]  Debts have also remained low.
[03:26:53.530 --> 03:26:54.731]  Got it?
[03:26:54.731 --> 03:26:55.551]  No.
[03:26:55.551 --> 03:26:56.572]  We're not going to get it.
[03:26:57.412 --> 03:26:59.753]  We're just a bunch of jerks.
[03:26:59.753 --> 03:27:03.373]  We march to the orders of whoever leads us.
[03:27:03.373 --> 03:27:06.554]  All the facts are right there.
[03:27:06.554 --> 03:27:08.555]  This is not a pandemic.
[03:27:08.555 --> 03:27:15.596]  They changed that definition to keep selling fear.
[03:27:15.596 --> 03:27:19.117]  Again, look who's dying.
[03:27:19.117 --> 03:27:23.938]  Elderly people that are, you know, I don't want to scare anybody.
[03:27:24.707 --> 03:27:30.269]  But when you get into your 80s, you know, your chances of living longer are short.
[03:27:30.269 --> 03:27:32.290]  What's the average death rate in America?
[03:27:32.290 --> 03:27:33.710]  About 78 years old?
[03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:36.291]  Look at that clown.
[03:27:36.291 --> 03:27:37.512]  Look at that jerk.
[03:27:37.512 --> 03:27:37.912]  Arrogant.
[03:27:37.912 --> 03:27:40.033]  Yeah, bye-bye.
[03:27:40.033 --> 03:27:41.773]  Yeah.
[03:27:41.773 --> 03:27:50.997]  Anyway, this is the guy that took Cuomo, took the people out of hospitals that were elderly and put them into nursing homes.
[03:27:50.997 --> 03:27:51.777]  This is a fact.
[03:27:54.056 --> 03:27:56.277]  And they're the ones that die the most.
[03:27:56.277 --> 03:27:57.757]  Elderly people in nursing homes.
[03:27:57.757 --> 03:28:01.839]  You go back to when they started selling the COVID war.
[03:28:01.839 --> 03:28:03.979]  Where did it happen?
[03:28:03.979 --> 03:28:05.700]  State of Washington.
[03:28:05.700 --> 03:28:06.700]  Yeah, where?
[03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:08.361]  Kirkland, Washington.
[03:28:08.361 --> 03:28:11.162]  What was going on in Kirkland?
[03:28:11.162 --> 03:28:15.703]  People from nursing homes were dying.
[03:28:15.703 --> 03:28:21.765]  All over the world, it's elderly people, people in nursing homes,
[03:28:22.287 --> 03:28:33.030]  And as the CDC numbers show, people with 2.6 pre-existing chronic conditions.
[03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:35.111]  But yet they're locking down everything.
[03:28:35.111 --> 03:28:40.653]  Now I'm going back to where I started before with the markets.
[03:28:40.653 --> 03:28:45.354]  Just before we came on the air, the markets were up in the United States almost 470 points.
[03:28:45.354 --> 03:28:46.094]  470 points as the global economy
[03:28:52.850 --> 03:29:00.415]  It's crashing in front of our eyes and they're locking down more places.
[03:29:00.415 --> 03:29:03.838]  It doesn't come back.
[03:29:03.838 --> 03:29:10.463]  All those small businesses, most of the restaurants in New York City are owned by small businesses.
[03:29:10.463 --> 03:29:12.444]  They're not coming back.
[03:29:12.444 --> 03:29:15.646]  They're gone.
[03:29:15.646 --> 03:29:17.668]  They're gone.
[03:29:17.668 --> 03:29:19.009]  And you know what else this is going to do?
[03:29:20.515 --> 03:29:22.476]  The bigs are gonna get bigger.
[03:29:22.476 --> 03:29:26.157]  Look what these slimy low-life politicians did.
[03:29:26.157 --> 03:29:29.237]  There you go.
[03:29:29.237 --> 03:29:31.318]  60% of businesses closures.
[03:29:31.318 --> 03:29:32.658]  Won't come back.
[03:29:32.658 --> 03:29:40.520]  So now the bigs are gonna get bigger, and these slimy low-life politicians, all you little businesses, all you... No, you can't open.
[03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:42.501]  But Target, you can open.
[03:29:42.501 --> 03:29:43.921]  Walmart, you can open.
[03:29:43.921 --> 03:29:46.462]  Hey, how about Home Depot?
[03:29:46.462 --> 03:29:48.083]  You can open too.
[03:29:48.083 --> 03:29:49.703]  So the billionaires get richer,
[03:29:50.737 --> 03:30:00.446]  The bigs get bigger, and all we do is become plantation workers on the global plantation of Slavelandia.
[03:30:00.446 --> 03:30:03.348]  OK for Amazon to stay open.
[03:30:03.348 --> 03:30:06.131]  Get back in there and pack those boxes.
[03:30:06.131 --> 03:30:08.733]  You want to become a warehouse worker.
[03:30:08.733 --> 03:30:12.756]  Matter of fact, you could go to college and get a degree in it.
[03:30:12.756 --> 03:30:15.679]  And for the rest of your life, you'll have to pay it off.
[03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:24.032]  Oh, you thank Joe Biden for not paying off your... Yeah, he made it impossible, almost, to get the fault on a loan.
[03:30:24.032 --> 03:30:25.853]  Eh, but that's forgotten.
[03:30:25.853 --> 03:30:28.153]  And so is a lot of other things forgotten.
[03:30:28.153 --> 03:30:30.134]  But we're going to be bringing them back.
[03:30:30.134 --> 03:30:33.175]  But you remember, you have to care for the future.
[03:30:33.175 --> 03:30:33.335]  Right.

[03:31:00.669 --> 03:31:08.973]  While we continue to work with them to bring you new lower discounts at preparewithalex.com, there's no guarantee we'll be able to get such low prices on these products again.

[03:31:42.709 --> 03:31:44.410]  And I'm really bummed out about that.
[03:31:44.410 --> 03:31:49.575]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[03:31:49.575 --> 03:31:51.917]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[03:31:51.917 --> 03:31:57.963]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack.
[03:31:58.343 --> 03:32:01.045]  We are unable to secure it anymore.
[03:32:01.045 --> 03:32:09.652]  This is the highest in AM, PM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[03:32:09.652 --> 03:32:10.133]  It's amazing.
[03:32:10.133 --> 03:32:18.439]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it, and that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[03:32:18.439 --> 03:32:22.002]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:32:23.864 --> 03:32:25.005]  That is at cost.
[03:32:25.005 --> 03:32:26.526]  For all of you that already support InfoWars,

[03:32:33.810 --> 03:32:40.774]  8-pack PowerStack, 60% off, and free shipping.
[03:32:40.774 --> 03:32:48.159]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[03:32:48.159 --> 03:32:53.582]  It's establishing a form of planetary digital law.
[03:32:54.889 --> 03:33:01.673]  Where the technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[03:33:01.673 --> 03:33:07.336]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[03:33:07.336 --> 03:33:10.718]  That is the post-human extremist plan.
[03:33:10.718 --> 03:33:13.740]  That is the public ideology of the globalists.
[03:33:13.740 --> 03:33:21.264]  And everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:31.256]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[03:33:31.256 --> 03:33:38.261]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[03:33:38.261 --> 03:33:39.342]  This is the essence of evil.
[03:33:40.481 --> 03:33:43.662]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[03:33:43.662 --> 03:33:52.226]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[03:33:52.226 --> 03:33:55.807]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[03:33:55.807 --> 03:34:08.512]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[03:34:09.692 --> 03:34:12.254]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[03:34:12.254 --> 03:34:18.399]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[03:34:18.399 --> 03:34:22.222]  This is their stated goal.
[03:34:22.222 --> 03:34:30.489]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[03:34:30.489 --> 03:34:31.790]  Can we turn this around?
[03:34:32.490 --> 03:34:37.915]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[03:34:37.915 --> 03:34:42.818]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[03:34:42.818 --> 03:34:45.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:59.449 --> 03:35:01.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:35:01.831 --> 03:35:04.552]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:35:04.552 --> 03:35:07.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:07.834 --> 03:35:17.160]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show and everybody, remember you have to do all you can to support InfoWars.
[03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:27.226]  They have great products and this is a time really where you have to put your money where your heart and mind are because they're going to be robbing us of our freedom like
[03:35:28.206 --> 03:35:29.007]  You can't imagine.
[03:35:29.007 --> 03:35:30.528]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:35:30.528 --> 03:35:34.331]  I could never imagine a freak show like they've created with this one.
[03:35:34.331 --> 03:35:36.953]  And it's global, as we were talking about.
[03:35:36.953 --> 03:35:42.898]  So InfoWars has some emergency elections sale, and it's a total blowout.
[03:35:42.898 --> 03:35:48.202]  Everything must go 30 to 60 percent off, plus free shipping.
[03:35:48.202 --> 03:35:50.344]  And they're all here.
[03:35:52.294 --> 03:36:00.439]  In this crucial moment, with the election coming up, we need your support to maximize our coverage.
[03:36:00.439 --> 03:36:02.980]  Because if you don't, we're gone.
[03:36:02.980 --> 03:36:07.262]  And to help with that, InfoWars has added new ways to save.

[03:37:08.617 --> 03:37:16.019]  So, really, you have to do what you have to do to stay healthy in mind, body, and spirit.
[03:37:16.019 --> 03:37:17.360]  And one of the ways to do that
[03:37:18.038 --> 03:37:20.480]  Is to support InfoWars.
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:26.964]  These products are great for you and the information you're getting is hard to find anywhere else.
[03:37:26.964 --> 03:37:31.147]  And of course, we have the Trends Journal at TrendsJournal.com.
[03:37:31.147 --> 03:37:33.709]  So support those who fight for freedom.
[03:37:33.709 --> 03:37:37.532]  Because if we don't fight for freedom, we're going to die in the COVID war.
[03:37:37.532 --> 03:37:41.375]  And it's not going to be a very happy future.
[03:37:41.375 --> 03:37:47.699]  I'm gonna go back to that story about the second wave jolts Central Europe.
[03:37:48.490 --> 03:37:53.253]  In the Financial Times, because then you go on and you keep reading.
[03:37:53.253 --> 03:37:59.617]  And they go on to say, it's also about a heavy economic toll.
[03:37:59.617 --> 03:38:05.340]  In the second quarter, economic output fell 14.5% in Hungary, 12.3% in Romania, 8.9% in Poland, 8.4% in the Czech Republic, 8.3% in Slovakia.
[03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:06.041]  Quote,
[03:38:17.759 --> 03:38:23.041]  We have a huge deficit, the biggest in our history.
[03:38:23.041 --> 03:38:43.427]  And it seems that the government deficit next year will be roughly the same, said Danus Nerudova, who is part of an economic task force advising the Czech government on coping with COVID.
[03:38:43.427 --> 03:38:47.508]  Quote, we warn the government a complete lockdown
[03:38:48.393 --> 03:38:54.478]  Would really destabilize the public finances.
[03:38:54.478 --> 03:38:59.863]  And that's maybe the reason that they were reluctant to close the economy.
[03:38:59.863 --> 03:39:02.625]  Well, they did close the economy partially.
[03:39:02.625 --> 03:39:08.750]  But, I read to you those numbers.
[03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:12.714]  And how bad they are.
[03:39:12.714 --> 03:39:15.096]  And how they're going to be as bad next year.
[03:39:16.576 --> 03:39:20.617]  We are in the greatest depression.
[03:39:20.617 --> 03:39:25.979]  This is what... They keep blaming it on the pandemic.
[03:39:25.979 --> 03:39:28.580]  It's not the pandemic.
[03:39:28.580 --> 03:39:32.642]  It's the pathological liars.
[03:39:32.642 --> 03:39:36.443]  It's the parasites.
[03:39:36.443 --> 03:39:44.546]  It's the sociopaths and psychopaths that closed down the global economy that did this.
[03:39:45.743 --> 03:39:50.926]  Where is the money going to come from for these deficits?
[03:39:50.926 --> 03:39:54.087]  And again, this all ties back together.
[03:39:54.087 --> 03:39:58.870]  Goes back to the equity markets.
[03:39:58.870 --> 03:40:03.392]  They're printing all of this cheap money to keep this thing going.
[03:40:03.392 --> 03:40:09.675]  Digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[03:40:09.675 --> 03:40:11.256]  One country after another.
[03:40:11.256 --> 03:40:14.538]  What is the other reason why the markets are going up today?
[03:40:15.421 --> 03:40:17.322]  In the United States?
[03:40:17.322 --> 03:40:21.743]  Well, looks like a stimulus bill might be passed.
[03:40:21.743 --> 03:40:24.705]  Oh, a stimulus bill.
[03:40:24.705 --> 03:40:26.325]  Great.
[03:40:26.325 --> 03:40:28.426]  Great.
[03:40:28.426 --> 03:40:30.587]  More cheap money.
[03:40:30.587 --> 03:40:35.589]  Printed on nothing, and backed by nothing.
[03:40:35.589 --> 03:40:41.231]  Now, at the same time, as you well know, besides shortages of toilet paper,
[03:40:42.622 --> 03:40:44.923]  Which shows you what crap heads the people are.
[03:40:44.923 --> 03:40:48.426]  That's the first thing they did when the COVID war began.
[03:40:48.426 --> 03:40:50.327]  We need that paper.
[03:40:50.327 --> 03:40:53.148]  We need that paper because we're crap heads.
[03:40:53.148 --> 03:41:00.713]  Besides the shortage of that, treated lumber, screws, parts, you name it.
[03:41:00.713 --> 03:41:02.054]  Shortages.
[03:41:02.054 --> 03:41:05.236]  It's all ties together.
[03:41:05.236 --> 03:41:11.820]  Well, when you have a shortage of supply and demand, the price of the thing goes up.
[03:41:11.820 --> 03:41:12.240]  And now,
[03:41:13.390 --> 03:41:24.775]  With demand for those goods going up, and the value of the currency going down, you have inflation.
[03:41:24.775 --> 03:41:27.956]  Gold and silver prices.
[03:41:27.956 --> 03:41:31.518]  I still forecast gold well over $2,000 an ounce.
[03:41:31.518 --> 03:41:33.498]  It hit over $2,000 this year already.
[03:41:33.498 --> 03:41:35.959]  I see it going to $3,000 and $4,000.
[03:41:35.959 --> 03:41:40.481]  And silver well over $100 an ounce.
[03:41:40.481 --> 03:41:41.942]  And I don't give financial advice.
[03:41:43.353 --> 03:41:44.694]  But I'm giving you the reasons why.
[03:41:44.694 --> 03:41:49.796]  We're going to see why Marie public inflation.
[03:41:49.796 --> 03:41:57.820]  As all these nations, that's why I read you this article from the Financial Times.
[03:41:57.820 --> 03:41:59.841]  And by the way, this is what I do every day.
[03:41:59.841 --> 03:42:02.922]  You can see the underlying red in there.
[03:42:02.922 --> 03:42:12.887]  So I read articles from all over the world and I pick out the salient points to highlight on to see where this is going.
[03:42:13.911 --> 03:42:16.954]  Now we're going to take it one step further.
[03:42:16.954 --> 03:42:22.458]  Where are they going to get the money for these deficits besides printing cheap money?
[03:42:22.458 --> 03:42:29.844]  And of course, to boost the economies falsely with this digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[03:42:29.844 --> 03:42:33.187]  You ready?
[03:42:33.187 --> 03:42:40.773]  This is from... This is the only story that was of any value for me yesterday
[03:42:41.715 --> 03:42:45.576]  From Sunday's toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[03:42:45.576 --> 03:42:50.937]  There's a story down the bottom.
[03:42:50.937 --> 03:42:55.118]  And this is on page 18.
[03:42:55.118 --> 03:42:59.159]  Down the bottom.
[03:42:59.159 --> 03:43:07.281]  Gas tax spikes in New Jersey to compensate for slowdown.
[03:43:09.663 --> 03:43:12.384]  Isn't that nice?
[03:43:12.384 --> 03:43:16.046]  Oh, look what they do because of pandemic's impact.
[03:43:16.046 --> 03:43:30.113]  Not because of pandemic's impact, because of the impact by low-life scum politicians like the governor they got over there, Murphy, and the rest of them.
[03:43:30.113 --> 03:43:36.356]  Drivers in New Jersey purchased nearly 40% less gas between March and May
[03:43:37.003 --> 03:43:44.068]  As businesses and schools closed down and more people began working from home.
[03:43:44.068 --> 03:43:49.211]  That led to a drop in tax revenue that chewed into funds.
[03:43:49.211 --> 03:43:56.616]  The state was required by law to set aside to pay for improvements in rails and roads and bridges.
[03:43:56.616 --> 03:44:02.560]  And in turn mandated a 9.3% tax increase, state officials said.
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:05.182]  The new rate took effect on Thursday.
[03:44:07.174 --> 03:44:10.096]  Isn't that great?
[03:44:10.096 --> 03:44:18.102]  Tax we, the little people, as the billionaires get... Don't raise the taxes on the big ones!
[03:44:18.102 --> 03:44:28.309]  Don't give the Buffetts and the Bezos and the Gates and the Musks and the Cubans and all the rest of the multi-billionaires.
[03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:32.112]  Don't take any more from any from them.
[03:44:32.112 --> 03:44:34.394]  Raise the gas taxes.
[03:44:34.394 --> 03:44:35.915]  Raise the gas taxes.
[03:44:36.772 --> 03:44:39.113]  Get the little people.
[03:44:39.113 --> 03:44:42.174]  The COVID war's begun.
[03:44:42.174 --> 03:44:48.995]  It's we the people against the murderous people that are destroying our lives in so many different ways.
[03:44:48.995 --> 03:44:52.837]  Liberty, love, joy and beauty, freedom.
[03:44:52.837 --> 03:44:58.558]  As they get more money from us, and they destroy our economy.
[03:44:58.558 --> 03:45:01.959]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:45:01.959 --> 03:45:03.920]  Buy those products.
