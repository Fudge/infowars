[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  it's Monday it's Monday 28 days out from the election there were rules and there
[00:09.720 --> 00:13.320]  was no there was no freedom of choice I would they broke the rule I was there I
[00:13.320 --> 00:16.640]  was there like you were and they were distanced why those chairs were not
[00:16.640 --> 00:20.040]  close together Chris the way you're starting to harangue me now actually
[00:20.040 --> 00:23.120]  reminds me what you did to the president during that debate on Tuesday night when
[00:23.120 --> 00:28.040]  yeah not just Joe 10 no and then he had to he had to debate not just Joe Biden
[00:28.040 --> 00:31.580]  but you as well you are not a neutral moderator then I don't mind tough
[00:31.580 --> 00:34.280]  questions I welcome you know how much reasonable me talk questions but what I
[00:34.280 --> 00:37.520]  don't think is okay is for you to become the effective opposition to the
[00:37.520 --> 00:41.280]  president okay and those everyone there is tested in the crowd they were
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.000]  distanced from each other people can make reasonable decisions for themselves
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.760]  state no they actually they can't keep on praying for our president and our
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.000]  first lady America we aren't out of the woods yet I have to be back because we
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.760]  still have to make America great again we've done an awfully good job of that
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.440]  if you look at the therapeutics which I'm taking right now some of them and
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.360]  others are coming out soon that are looking like frankly they're miracles if
[01:10.360 --> 01:13.640]  you want to know the truth they're miracles people criticize me when I say
[01:13.640 --> 01:17.920]  that but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.400]  from God so I just want to tell you that I'm starting to feel good this is
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.200]  America this is the United States this is the greatest country in the world this
[01:28.200 --> 01:31.280]  is the most powerful country in the world I can't be locked up in a room
[01:31.280 --> 01:38.320]  upstairs and totally safe and just say hey whatever happens happens I can't do
[01:38.320 --> 01:42.960]  that we have to confront problems as a leader you have to confront problems
[01:42.960 --> 01:48.040]  there's never been a great leader that would have done that I'm doing well I
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.760]  want to thank everybody our first lady is doing very well and Melania asked me
[01:53.760 --> 01:59.240]  to say something as to the respect that she has for our country the love that
[01:59.240 --> 02:06.120]  she has for our country and we're both doing well Melania is really handling
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.240]  it very nicely President Trump has been treated with the experimental antiviral
[02:12.240 --> 02:17.160]  remdesivir and a single eight gram dose of an antibody cocktail developed by
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.280]  Regeneron pharmaceuticals which is a combination of mouse pus and human
[02:22.280 --> 02:26.720]  neutralizing synthetic antibodies against the virus a treatment that is
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.040]  still in clinical trials and the mixture of the two is anybody's guess
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.800]  depending on how the president reacts to it President Trump is also taking zinc
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.760]  melatonin vitamin D aspirin and the heartburn brand pepsid which researchers
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.080]  are studying as a possible treatment for coronavirus so rather than allow the
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.720]  virus to take its course President Trump has laid the gauntlet down in order to
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.680]  return back to the country that desperately needs his guidance and
[02:55.680 --> 03:01.040]  presence to steer us from a head-on collision into Marx's fueled tyranny
[03:01.040 --> 03:04.720]  the photos the White House has been releasing the videos we have to show
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.680]  them because they're the only evidence we have of the president's condition but
[03:07.680 --> 03:11.040]  they are propagandistic that's unfortunately the situation we're in
[03:11.040 --> 03:14.560]  and out of the White House Correspondence Association is calling out the
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.040]  White House right now this is the press the press corps the press pool that is
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.600]  supposed to travel the president at all times they were not informed about this
[03:21.600 --> 03:25.800]  photo op they were not with him when this happened that is a grievous breach of
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.600]  protocol and the association is saying quote it is outrageous for the
[03:29.600 --> 03:33.080]  president to have left the hospital even briefly amid a health crisis without a
[03:33.080 --> 03:36.360]  protective pool present to ensure the American people know where their
[03:36.360 --> 03:39.760]  president is and how he is doing now more than ever the American public
[03:39.760 --> 03:42.960]  deserves independent coverage of the president so they can be reliably
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.440]  informed about his health that is absolutely correct and by the way
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.280]  Anna the president was feeling so well why didn't he walk outside in the fresh
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.160]  air rather than get cooped up in that car I mean that's not a comfortable place
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.720]  for anybody to be in when there's a cope in positive patient he could have walked
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.960]  out on the lawn and waved to the public shelter such a rat
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.800]  and we finally have a president who backs that up
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.360]  Trump has been buying us pizzas all freaking day drunk that is from Trump
[04:14.360 --> 04:20.520]  he has bought over 250 pieces that keep coming in and you know it's from Trump
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.440]  because this is gluten-free all right this meat on the trumps in alpha that's
[04:25.440 --> 04:32.040]  why there's so much of it and no CNN we're not getting paid and while Joe Biden
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.920]  calls another lid on his lethargic whack-a-mole basement campaign if you
[04:36.920 --> 04:39.800]  elect me I'm not gonna have you your taxes are gonna be raised not cut
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.200]  president Trump in the throes of an incredibly dangerous coronavirus
[04:44.200 --> 04:50.800]  treatment continues to present himself to the people John bound reporting
[04:50.800 --> 04:57.800]  hi folks get locked get loaded because you're about to explode
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.720]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election but I need to
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.160]  be honest with everybody the Democrats and their deep-state controllers comments
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.520]  Chinese have come out and said they're gonna contest the election they know
[05:13.520 --> 05:17.320]  that Trump's gonna win a landslide and the destabilization that that's gonna
[05:17.320 --> 05:22.040]  cause is going to further destroy the markets in the economy and going into
[05:22.040 --> 05:25.840]  the future even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election the
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.120]  Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.480]  into the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext
[05:35.480 --> 05:42.040]  sabotage the republic even more so until this cancer is rooted out until
[05:42.040 --> 05:45.520]  these criminals that work with foreign governments they're trying to basically
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.440]  destroy the country are punished and removed it's just gonna continue to
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.600]  happen and so that's the big problem here that is that we have systemic dug-in
[05:54.600 --> 06:11.120]  corruption by people that hate the country's very existence
[06:11.120 --> 06:26.000]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones it's Monday October 5th year is 2020 we
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.640]  are 28 days out from the election 107 out from the inauguration and this is
[06:32.640 --> 06:39.080]  one hell of a time to be alive ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones
[06:39.080 --> 06:43.400]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours on this transmission that
[06:43.400 --> 06:47.120]  I want to show you with the war room and on top of that you've got John Lorraine
[06:47.120 --> 06:54.200]  coming up with election countdown we're gonna do a 40-hour live broadcast
[06:54.200 --> 06:57.600]  kicking off Wednesday morning at 8 a.m. with David Knight and yes it's gonna be
[06:57.600 --> 07:03.760]  a 2020 election extravaganza and fundraiser for info wars to keep this
[07:03.760 --> 07:08.960]  operation on air in the face of the New World Order 2020 election center
[07:08.960 --> 07:17.720]  dot com okay let me just say this to everybody when I talk about the issues I
[07:17.720 --> 07:23.320]  break down on the show I want you to know that we're not exaggerating we're
[07:23.320 --> 07:32.640]  not making things up and that this is the reality and that 95 to 98% of
[07:32.640 --> 07:39.560]  everything I cover is open source information that's not even being
[07:39.560 --> 07:48.280]  denied and I had a major brainstorm this morning I woke up at 430 and I was
[07:48.280 --> 07:54.400]  doing work and research hours before the family woke up and I stared out across
[07:54.400 --> 08:05.480]  the hills as the Sun came up at 645 and just like I saw what would unfold knowing
[08:05.480 --> 08:11.280]  the pieces of the globalist operation 20 years ago I sat there for probably 30
[08:11.280 --> 08:19.000]  minutes without even moving other than blinking my eyes and saw the future and
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.400]  I didn't see it through a worm all in time and space I didn't see it through a
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.640]  crystal ball I saw it from all the gathered data and information I have
[08:26.640 --> 08:36.600]  and what the globalist promise they're gonna do and you can run and hide from
[08:36.600 --> 08:42.720]  this for a little while and buy yourself a little bit of time but in the end we're
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.080]  gonna lose everything if we don't confront it up front well so let me tell
[08:48.080 --> 08:55.320]  you the news we've got let me tell you what's coming up I want to see the good
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.200]  narrative here Trump goes in for a couple days comes out like a bull
[09:00.640 --> 09:06.320]  therapeutics saving supposedly so that gives people hope and you can see that
[09:06.320 --> 09:09.960]  narrative being played out now markets rally on optimism Trump may be
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.840]  discharged as soon as today it's an article at info wars.com from zero
[09:14.840 --> 09:28.560]  hedge.com but when I see what the lead medical doctor did at Walter Reed and the
[09:28.560 --> 09:38.720]  incompetence they had before at a similar facility was Reagan taking a
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.360]  Walter Reader Bethesda look it up I can't remember in 81 we got shot I know
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.400]  they gave him cold blood that caused serious brain damage it messed Reagan
[09:47.400 --> 09:54.400]  up bad in cold blood that hits your brain it's it's not good especially when
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.040]  you're old but I didn't just at first I wasn't that concerned and then I saw
[10:00.040 --> 10:07.200]  Rindesivir that's experimental and this other artificial nanotech where they
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.560]  grow artificial antibodies human antibodies and mix it with mouse
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.000]  antibodies and I looked up the study and it said most the time this makes the
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.440]  infection worse I'm like excuse me you gotta be on death's doorstep for a
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.480]  doctor to be allowed to do that so then I was getting upset at the doctors and
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.520]  then they came out of a press conference and I'm sure it was true because
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.680]  Trump's watching it they go oh Trump demanded Rindesivir and this artificial
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.000]  antibody cocktail well since when is he a doctor I don't care if he's the
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.200]  president that's crazy and so I reached out to a lot of medical doctors I went
[10:46.200 --> 10:53.760]  and did research and sure enough they're all saying this is kaka kaka crazy town
[10:53.760 --> 11:10.440]  so he's lucky that he's alive when they're mixing those things together but
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.080]  notice it's Fauci that runs all these federal agencies been there for 40
[11:15.080 --> 11:23.080]  something years 45 years 46 years it's Fauci that pushed Rindesivir over zinc
[11:23.080 --> 11:30.120]  and vitamin D and all that when Rindesivir only help people you look it up
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.920]  Rindesivir only helped 8% of seriously ill patients and then it caused all
[11:35.920 --> 11:38.800]  these other big problems on the other side I shot a whole report on it
[11:38.800 --> 11:46.680]  Saturday is Walter Reed killing President Trump with experimental
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.040]  treatments that's the headline it's got like 300,000 views you should go look at
[11:50.040 --> 11:52.920]  it I show all the articles all the documents all the medical files all
[11:52.920 --> 11:57.560]  the medical studies I mean this is a no-brainer like don't give a two-year-old
[11:57.560 --> 12:00.840]  aspirin because sometimes it can give them a disorder that kills them you know
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.080]  stuff like that I mean everybody knows you don't mix like painkillers with Jack
[12:05.080 --> 12:10.440]  Daniels I'm no doctor I'm no pharmacist you just don't do that says the bottle
[12:10.440 --> 12:18.520]  don't operate with heavy machinery you know no so a those daughters are so out
[12:18.520 --> 12:24.640]  of control they did what Trump told him to do like he's a doctor or they're lying
[12:24.640 --> 12:32.200]  I don't know but let's pull up for TV viewers the video page of 2020 election
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.920]  center.com that's a mirror side of band.video but band.video is banned on
[12:36.920 --> 12:39.840]  Twitter you can't share those links you gotta go 2020electionscenter.com and then
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.080]  share from there and you can see that video I did also John Rappaport
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.200]  investigative journalists did one on these very dangerous experimental drugs
[12:46.200 --> 12:58.560]  I just go back to that question why on earth are they doing that right pull it
[12:58.560 --> 13:04.360]  up on my phone no big deal go to 2020electioncenter.com you click on
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.040]  the Alex Jones show page right there on the left hand side and then you scroll
[13:10.040 --> 13:16.400]  down and you'll be able to see the report right there is Walter Reed killing
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.880]  President Trump the experimental treatments 351,000 views there it is
[13:21.880 --> 13:27.600]  that's how you navigate the site for TV viewers and I just hope to God you share
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.400]  that because I want to believe he's about to get out they're gonna give him
[13:31.400 --> 13:37.040]  this antibody treatment at least five more times they're saying and they're
[13:37.040 --> 13:43.840]  gonna give him their endesivir five more times and that's crazy so I get it
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.960]  okay they say positive coronavirus he's got a cold it's a huge hysteria now
[13:48.960 --> 13:54.520]  people are out in public wearing bubble mask and face shields and husbands are
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.480]  coming home at night and wearing and wives face mask inside the home it's
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.280]  just all virtue signaling that's collapsing the economy creating a world
[14:02.280 --> 14:05.840]  depression and mass death and you tell people hey you know the shutdowns
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.080]  already killed two million people in Africa they admit that started they're
[14:09.080 --> 14:13.760]  dead not coronavirus but starving to death people just don't care because they
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.840]  want a virtue signal it feels too good to them to be ignorance well the economy
[14:18.840 --> 14:24.240]  is falling apart now so get ready for that because it's gonna hurt us here and
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.040]  the consolidation of power is just unbelievable but we got a call from Dr.
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.480]  Francis Boyle the guy that wrote the US biological weapons tree that became the
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.080]  world treaty much of it and he has come out into the exact same thing that it is
[14:37.080 --> 14:51.160]  insane absolutely insane in the membrane what these doctors did and again
[14:51.160 --> 14:57.000]  it's illegal if someone is not deathly ill to even do those treatments he
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.560]  certainly don't just do it because the patient says oh doc I think I want to
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.000]  take not one but two experimental treatments they go well you're the
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.320]  president so we'll do that and I get it oh he's so tough he wanted to have the
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.040]  miracle work well why wasn't hydroxychloroquine why it have to be the
[15:14.040 --> 15:20.280]  drugs that Fauci's pushing that Fauci makes money off of well we got Dr.
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.800]  Francis Boyle joining us at the bottom of the hour to lay this out and then
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.240]  Gavin McInnes that the president has been talking about quite a bit the
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.560]  founder of Proud Boys that is multiracial absolutely inclusive but it's
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.000]  proud of America it's proud of the Renaissance and it's proud of capitalism
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.360]  and so it's being demonized and lied about and so the president's made some
[15:41.360 --> 15:44.840]  comments about then we've got Gavin McInnes always an amazing guest joining
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.740]  us we'll have open phones as well Gerald Salente coming up and a lot more on
[15:49.740 --> 15:53.880]  Alex Jones and you can also remember our new website is info wars calm it's
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.760]  been redesigned really really excited about it I really like it add some more
[15:57.760 --> 16:02.120]  features as well if you look at the top tech billionaires in the big banks that
[16:02.120 --> 16:06.480]  finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.880]  people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a
[16:09.880 --> 16:14.080]  mountain top or an national park they have to look at us the common people they
[16:14.080 --> 16:18.520]  have to look at the proletariat that look at the scum that's why they love the
[16:18.520 --> 16:22.520]  lockdown putting muzzles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.680]  can go what we can do bankrupting Main Street bankrupting small towns all of
[16:27.680 --> 16:31.920]  it is a vertical integration consolidation so they can then dictate the
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.200]  terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant vaccines day one
[16:36.200 --> 16:41.640]  ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all the
[16:41.640 --> 16:45.480]  entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in
[16:45.480 --> 16:50.000]  for the kill you know this I know this it's all out in the open the question is
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.200]  what are we gonna do about it well the first thing is identify the enemy

[17:58.640 --> 18:18.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:18.440 --> 18:26.760]  waging war on corruption and alex jones your host all right I sat there this
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.960]  morning cogitating looking over all the evidence the facts what the globalists
[18:30.960 --> 18:36.120]  have been through doing and it was a command of my very genetics of my
[18:36.120 --> 18:43.200]  cells that God designed that the God designed you with to resist this new
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.520]  order takeover I mean everything about it is destructive and horrible and
[18:47.520 --> 18:55.920]  ugly and poisonous and I told my wife I said when she woke up I said we're gonna
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.320]  have to start civil disobedience they're not gonna let you in grocery stores in
[19:01.320 --> 19:04.600]  your job have a driver's license drive down the road without forced
[19:04.600 --> 19:07.680]  inoculations in about a year it's already started in Asia it's already
[19:07.680 --> 19:11.040]  starting in Europe I told just six months ago they're gonna have face
[19:11.040 --> 19:16.760]  scanners to go in stores to see if you've had your vaccine it's not going to
[19:16.760 --> 19:20.560]  be an app on your phone well now they've rolled them out but at first it's a
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.280]  quote scanner to make sure you're wearing your mask this is all dog training
[19:25.280 --> 19:28.920]  and the UN admits it and I tell people that I see wearing masks that even know
[19:28.920 --> 19:36.640]  me and they laugh at me because there's a spirit to these followers they have
[19:36.640 --> 19:45.560]  submitted to the spirit of the world and they're creatures of the devil and you
[19:45.560 --> 19:50.440]  wonder why they look so stupid not so stupid they're in a trance and more
[19:50.440 --> 19:54.120]  more people are either fully awakened and you're seeing it or they're in a
[19:54.120 --> 19:59.360]  trance and just can't make decisions can't do anything can't grasp simple
[19:59.360 --> 20:07.280]  things but for those that aren't in the trance it's horrifying except for
[20:07.280 --> 20:11.720]  another group those that have gone out of the trance into deeper spirit of
[20:11.720 --> 20:21.800]  Satan and they are programmed to actually carry out it not just submit to so
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.880]  that's the thing about this is you're seeing everybody going to zombie mode
[20:24.880 --> 20:29.000]  right now they're there they're they're in a trance and medically it's admitted
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.640]  the public's way more suggestible now five six times more suggestible than we
[20:32.640 --> 20:39.000]  were in the 50s before TV became totally main line people are in a trance
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.400]  they're under a spell a psychiatrist would call it a trance or hypnosis a
[20:45.400 --> 20:52.360]  witch would say I've put them under a spell and that's what this is the kingdom
[20:52.360 --> 20:58.320]  of earth is under Satan's spell and those of us under the spell are like what
[20:58.320 --> 21:02.840]  are you doing and the people under it go and they smile at you with that
[21:02.840 --> 21:07.520]  satisfaction that their winners they're doing the correct thing and they feel
[21:07.520 --> 21:12.760]  satisfied you can tell somebody under hypnosis piss on yourself cut your
[21:12.760 --> 21:17.980]  fingers off they'll do it and the public brainstand show is right at what you
[21:17.980 --> 21:23.200]  call actually being under hypnosis in a dream state dreaming their way into
[21:23.200 --> 21:27.240]  destruction so we can laugh at this all day but they're programming them and
[21:27.240 --> 21:34.000]  organizing them into an army to be directed at us so from here on out
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.480]  things just gets more intense but it's okay it's the great animatic challenge
[21:37.480 --> 21:43.080]  so you want excitement you're gonna get it now everybody the robot rise
[21:43.080 --> 21:46.240]  everything but the heart of it is about destroying humanity destroying
[21:46.240 --> 21:49.880]  innocence and the currency is our children and the Democrats in the house
[21:49.880 --> 21:54.680]  have blocked and that reges resolution saying we will not investigate
[21:54.680 --> 22:02.360]  pedophilia and California's legalized pedophilia here it is in a 371 to 18
[22:02.360 --> 22:08.720]  vote our elected Congress appeared to be moving towards making pedophilia a
[22:08.720 --> 22:14.480]  hate crime they stated that President Trump has not condemned the QAnon
[22:14.480 --> 22:18.680]  conspiracy which revolves around the baseless theory that Trump and his
[22:18.680 --> 22:24.720]  allies are working to expose a cabal of Democrats media figures and celebrities
[22:24.720 --> 22:29.840]  not running an international child trafficking ring they went on to say
[22:29.840 --> 22:34.640]  that the First Amendment is a powerful weapon turning that weapon on those who
[22:34.640 --> 22:39.480]  use fantasies as a menacing grift is the responsibility of reasonable
[22:39.480 --> 22:46.880]  citizens legislators and executives the same Congress who has paid out 15
[22:46.880 --> 22:51.600]  million dollars of taxpayer money to silence their own victims of sexual
[22:51.600 --> 22:56.560]  harassment want to weaponize the First Amendment to silence anyone who
[22:56.560 --> 23:02.640]  suggests that Democrats media figures and celebrities are involved in child
[23:02.640 --> 23:08.400]  trafficking they say the claim is baseless but that is an obvious lie and
[23:08.400 --> 23:15.160]  it's not just the Democrats in the 1980s foster children from Nebraska were
[23:15.160 --> 23:20.560]  being auctioned off at elite parties on the East Coast and sent as prostitutes
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.240]  to powerful politicians including at the White House a federal grand jury got
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.520]  involved to rule that the explosive testimony of the victimized foster
[23:30.520 --> 23:36.000]  children was a hoax the Vatican has been exposed for years of covering up a
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.120]  hidden pedoculture within the Catholic Church Hillary Clinton State Department
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.280]  covered for a pedophile ambassador Oprah Winfrey promoted a man who was
[23:46.280 --> 23:51.840]  enslaving women impregnating them and selling their babies internationally
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.080]  Hollywood Nickelodeon and Disney have all been exposed for rehiring convicted
[23:58.080 --> 24:03.840]  pedophiles to work with children and the mainstream media tells you that this is
[24:03.840 --> 24:10.480]  all fantasy after WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails masses of people began
[24:10.480 --> 24:16.200]  investigating child sex trafficking and nothing has been the same ever since
[24:16.200 --> 24:21.960]  following his inauguration president Trump vowed to fight the epidemic of human
[24:21.960 --> 24:28.360]  trafficking he signed executive orders to do so and over 1500 pedophiles
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.400]  involved in child sex trafficking operations were arrested all within his
[24:33.400 --> 24:38.720]  first month as president and the mainstream media ignored it in June of
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.440]  2017 Ivanka Trump said that ending human trafficking is in our moral and
[24:44.440 --> 24:51.240]  strategic interests and is a top priority of the White House big arrests
[24:51.240 --> 24:58.000]  continued all over the globe reported by local media only thousands of arrests
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.280]  thousands of children rescued including infants Nixxiom cult leaders have been
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.600]  charged with child porn and sex trafficking their leader was an
[25:09.600 --> 25:16.160]  outspoken advocate of pedophilia they ran multiple daycare centers for several
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.960]  years there has been talk about Jeffrey Epstein's private jet the Lolita Express
[25:20.960 --> 25:27.360]  used to ferry powerful people to his private pedophile island including
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.720]  dozens of times by Bill Clinton seen here partying with convicted pedophile
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.480]  and deep state witness George Nader Bill Gates who was also associated with
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.920]  Jeffrey Epstein employed a former Microsoft engineer to work on his
[25:42.920 --> 25:48.480]  private estate who was arrested on the Gates property in 2014 for possessing
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.400]  over 6,000 images of child rape and assault including the rape of boys and
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.680]  girls as young as eight years old the man only did 90 days in jail the same
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.000]  fat losers who have gotten rich off of corrupt side deals for years who have
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.160]  paid out 15 million dollars to silence their own victims the same worthless
[26:10.160 --> 26:15.080]  elected officials who have been stalling any and all investigations into
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.640]  the crooked establishment which they have exploited for decades now want to
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.760]  weaponize the First Amendment to silence anyone who suggests they or their
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.320]  Hollywood media cohorts might be involved in child sex trafficking the
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.480]  crime of pedophilia is recorded in history all the way to the Bible and
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.400]  whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.000]  better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.080]  cast into the sea but times have changed and we don't need to bother with
[26:49.080 --> 26:57.360]  millstones any longer for info wars calm this is Greg Reese stay with us this is

[27:09.520 --> 27:13.760]  sellers but because of the COVID supply chain breakdown because there's 13
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.600]  different formulas in a pack power stack we are unable to secure it anymore
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.280]  this is the highest in a npm pack system you're gonna find where you take half

[27:27.320 --> 27:30.440]  it's amazing I don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this
[27:30.440 --> 27:34.120]  gets people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.040]  effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing what's your last

[27:57.040 --> 28:03.200]  perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications from
[28:03.200 --> 28:11.440]  COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.960]  million people have died 200 million people have died probably by the time
[28:16.960 --> 28:22.040]  I finish this talk right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than
[28:22.040 --> 28:27.400]  60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality he
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.600]  would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made
[28:31.600 --> 28:34.960]  up but you know we got it the mainstream media that continues to actually say
[28:34.960 --> 28:41.280]  things like that they said that 4% of America would be dead already of course
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.600]  it's point zero zero zero zero and then add a number because the numbers vary
[28:45.600 --> 28:51.400]  it's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real but to
[28:51.400 --> 28:56.040]  shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind-control
[28:56.040 --> 29:03.360]  the future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving
[29:03.360 --> 29:08.200]  your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable
[29:08.200 --> 29:13.440]  asset in fact it's going to be your only asset the world being built by the
[29:13.440 --> 29:19.880]  technocrats the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.200]  the beginning of the process of taking us past investigation into total and
[29:26.200 --> 29:32.360]  complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out in an
[29:32.360 --> 29:39.200]  original biological way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to
[29:39.200 --> 29:43.680]  have to report horrifying things like this to you but only by facing the horror
[29:43.680 --> 29:49.280]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must
[29:49.280 --> 29:53.600]  study their own writings he must face the facts and you must come to grips with
[29:53.600 --> 29:57.880]  it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[29:57.880 --> 30:15.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:15.440 --> 30:35.200]  you found it all right on Friday we had investigative journalist who's worked
[30:35.200 --> 30:39.960]  back when they were still a credibility for some of the biggest national news
[30:39.960 --> 30:44.800]  shows investigative journals John Rappaport and he just said look at this
[30:44.800 --> 30:49.240]  this this Randesivir and this other nanotech drug are both super dangerous
[30:49.240 --> 30:53.800]  and together God knows what they do then I went and did my own research on main
[30:53.800 --> 30:56.160]  line literature and they said someone's not supposed to take these those are
[30:56.160 --> 30:59.680]  super sick they have all sorts of bad side effects one of them makes infections
[30:59.680 --> 31:03.640]  get worse I'm like well God why would you want that and then I looked at the
[31:03.640 --> 31:09.440]  supposed lead doctor and he doesn't have a very good resume but I thought well
[31:09.440 --> 31:12.760]  what medical doctor gonna go to talk about this or what expert well we have
[31:12.760 --> 31:16.360]  someone that's a lawyer and a professor but but an expert on the medicine
[31:16.360 --> 31:19.640]  itself the guy that wrote the u.s. biological weapons law much of which
[31:19.640 --> 31:28.160]  became world law dr. Francis a Boyle now who again is a doctor of law
[31:28.160 --> 31:34.160]  Magna cum laude PhD in political science from Harvard University both and he's
[31:34.160 --> 31:40.400]  got a book out on bio terrorism bio warfare and terrorism five four and a
[31:40.400 --> 31:46.040]  half stars but but I was just thinking about what he said on this show in what
[31:46.040 --> 31:49.640]  he said another show in January we said on this show a few days later in early
[31:49.640 --> 31:53.760]  February and what he said since how it's totally proven accurate the media says
[31:53.760 --> 31:56.960]  that I'm saying it's a hoax I'm not saying the virus doesn't exist it's a real
[31:56.960 --> 32:01.520]  virus that spreads really well and it's clearly man-made and there's a cover up
[32:01.520 --> 32:04.680]  about it they have tried to exaggerate some of the numbers I think in some
[32:04.680 --> 32:08.760]  areas that is that the politically have a lockdown but separately from that they've
[32:08.760 --> 32:12.440]  also tried to block a lot of therapeutics and things but when it comes to
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.160]  exposing how they were trying to develop vaccines for bird flu and for
[32:16.160 --> 32:21.440]  swine flu and for other covid's that was happening at this base and now more
[32:21.440 --> 32:24.560]  and more experts agree with dr. Boyle really the consensus is they were
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.840]  developing a live virus vaccine which itself is poisonous itself very dangerous
[32:29.840 --> 32:34.720]  that got out I think on purpose where they shut down Hong Kong the way China's
[32:34.720 --> 32:38.400]  used this to shut us down Boyle says well probably got out on accident they had
[32:38.400 --> 32:42.320]  very bad standards there China's done this a bunch they've released the swine
[32:42.320 --> 32:46.280]  flu they've released the bird flu they've released SARS I mean that's all on
[32:46.280 --> 32:50.080]  record but what's incredible is here we are all these years later since they've
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.320]  been caught doing this they never get in trouble and it's taboo in our media to
[32:53.320 --> 32:57.000]  talk about that so there's two big issues here I want to cover this first
[32:57.000 --> 33:00.240]  that's why he wanted to come on we usually beg him to come on again but he
[33:00.240 --> 33:03.360]  wanted to come on about this and I'm glad he does because he's looked at the facts
[33:03.360 --> 33:08.840]  what is Walter Reed doing trying to kill Trump and and why are they doing it and
[33:08.840 --> 33:13.680]  then be in more hindsight now things usually in hindsight we see people make
[33:13.680 --> 33:17.680]  mistakes but in hindsight we see dr. Boyle's and now first analysis is like
[33:17.680 --> 33:21.080]  dead on so we want to cover that with him as well thanks for coming on a short
[33:21.080 --> 33:28.120]  notice doc hey Alex thank you for having me on my best to your viewing audience
[33:28.120 --> 33:36.120]  at this very difficult time for President Trump and our Republic what do you
[33:36.120 --> 33:40.080]  want to tackle first obviously you're alarmed as other people are about what
[33:40.080 --> 33:48.200]  he's being given well Alex let me start I think we all need to start with the
[33:48.200 --> 33:56.200]  fatality rate under these circumstances now this is from a professor biology in
[33:56.200 --> 34:05.480]  Columbia just on SARS okay and this was long before the COVID-19 and it says
[34:05.480 --> 34:17.280]  fatality rate is 50% 50% in people 65 years or older now this is stars on
[34:17.280 --> 34:24.720]  steroids okay that we're dealing with here with President Trump plus I'm not
[34:24.720 --> 34:33.120]  here to criticize President Trump but you know he's obese so it's a threatening
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.800]  a life-threatening situation here for president Trump he's 74 he's McDonald's
[34:37.800 --> 34:41.800]  all day and he is somewhat overweight he's a prime candidate for this to kill
[34:41.800 --> 34:50.640]  it right I mean he's right in the mark at least 50% if not more and yesterday
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.560]  his his doctor there is alleged doctor said well we might release him today
[34:56.560 --> 35:03.480]  well let's look at this guy Conley he technically is not a medical doctor he's
[35:03.480 --> 35:10.200]  nothing more than an osteopath he does not have an MD now Alex let me compare
[35:10.200 --> 35:19.480]  this to me the president is four years older than I okay who is my physician my
[35:19.480 --> 35:28.960]  physician is a board certified medical doctor specializing in internal medicine
[35:28.960 --> 35:36.640]  who also has a certificate in adult medicine now I hit that's that's my
[35:36.640 --> 35:44.880]  physician why did not the Pentagon give a similar type of physician to
[35:44.880 --> 35:52.240]  President Trump instead of an osteopath they're not medical doctors no one has
[35:52.240 --> 35:58.800]  certified him to do anything at all except the Pentagon and you know there's
[35:58.800 --> 36:06.360]  that saying by Groucho Marx that you know military justices to justices
[36:06.360 --> 36:12.080]  military music is to music well I would say you know military medicine is to
[36:12.080 --> 36:19.040]  medicine as military music is to music well clearly looking into his background
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.800]  they got a lot of more and better doctors in there why is this guy in there
[36:23.800 --> 36:30.160]  then who chose him and why is he pushing Fauci's agenda right what we have an
[36:30.160 --> 36:37.640]  osteopath who's not been certified by anyone but the Pentagon while giving
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.680]  President Trump this completely experimental treatment by a Regeneron
[36:44.680 --> 36:50.920]  that no one else in the world has ever been given treating the president of the
[36:50.920 --> 36:58.480]  United States of America as if he's he's a guinea pig you know I said I said
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.000]  on Saturday I said I haven't seen anywhere where they've given the same
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.440]  person these two things together this is crazy well and and now it's you know
[37:08.440 --> 37:17.240]  you've got red demos there which if you look out at the University of North
[37:17.240 --> 37:26.200]  Carolina those are Nazi death scientists out there who helped manufacture
[37:26.200 --> 37:34.440]  COVID-19 okay with the Bat Queen from Wuhan BSL for when that was done they
[37:34.440 --> 37:42.640]  then moved to develop remdesivir okay because they knew there would be no
[37:42.640 --> 37:49.720]  effective vaccine and so they didn't waste their time on a vaccine but they
[37:49.720 --> 37:59.480]  moved into developing remdesivir and then on top of all that Conley has
[37:59.480 --> 38:08.120]  given the president the this steroid I don't know anyone in the world who has
[38:08.120 --> 38:13.920]  been on all three of these at the exact same time for God they gave him an
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.920]  anti-inflammatory steroid on top of this who the hell knows what that'll do
[38:17.920 --> 38:23.600]  right you have the interactions the bottom line is we need to get President
[38:23.600 --> 38:33.000]  Trump out of Walter Reed immediately in my opinion we do know that the George
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.920]  Washington medical complex there in Washington DC saved President Reagan's
[38:40.920 --> 38:49.400]  life from the jaws of death after the assassination attempt against him and I
[38:49.400 --> 38:55.200]  really think you know we have to get the president usually doctors don't want to
[38:55.200 --> 38:58.480]  be in the military nothing is our military daughters there's some good
[38:58.480 --> 39:03.800]  people there but on average it's not the highest grade in the military hospitals
[39:03.800 --> 39:09.240]  of course not and this guy is not even a board certified specialist he's an
[39:09.240 --> 39:14.120]  osteopath so how can he be treating the allies the president of the United
[39:14.120 --> 39:21.840]  States when I have a board certified MD specializing in internal medicine and
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.400]  with a certain my personal doctor is also an internal doctor and does
[39:26.400 --> 39:29.600]  surgeries and I agree with you we want the best it's got that actually does
[39:29.600 --> 39:33.240]  surgeries there's a doctor on top of it doing regular checkups so so this is a
[39:33.240 --> 39:38.240]  heat well but how do you think he got this guy the Pentagon gave it to him I'm
[39:38.240 --> 39:41.800]  sure that that's what happens with the same Pentagon that Trump said a month
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.240]  ago once he's dead because he's pulling all these wars army Alex we'll be right
[39:47.240 --> 39:51.600]  back let's talk about that with Dr. Francis Boyle straight ahead remember
[39:51.600 --> 39:57.840]  Trump said that speech at the washing machine factory you notice that over and
[39:57.840 --> 40:01.800]  over again the United Nations are supposed controllers and bosses the
[40:01.800 --> 40:04.800]  great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out
[40:04.800 --> 40:10.520]  and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19 ladies and gentlemen that's a
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.720]  total lie and you get a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of
[40:14.720 --> 40:18.800]  vitamin D3 and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're
[40:18.800 --> 40:22.720]  getting plenty of vitamin D3 if you have zinc and vitamin C as well that's why
[40:22.720 --> 40:26.480]  people get the flu's and these colds in the Leonard because that's a vitamin D
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.840]  levels plunge now I pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for
[40:31.840 --> 40:34.760]  saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.000]  minerals well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.160]  D3 and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.800]  without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the
[40:47.800 --> 40:51.680]  reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have
[40:51.680 --> 40:54.280]  been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.360]  vitamins the way the psychological warfare operation works is very very
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.680]  simple they give you about freedoms by increments always promising it's only
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.480]  a short period of time and then the restrictions will be released but
[41:08.480 --> 41:12.640]  they're not ever significant amount of time always four or five times longer
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.880]  than what they said they will then slightly release it a little bit only
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.160]  tighten it down even more later this is called successive approximation
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.240]  incrementalism or the inchworm effect this is the most common way the
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.200]  salitarians take over but there then becomes a point where the public wakes
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.400]  up under the incrementalism he starts resisting and then there's usually a
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.200]  giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.120]  few days weeks or months than you saw in the previous ten years and that's the
[41:43.120 --> 41:48.880]  period we're in globally right now a world government shy combat globalist
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.280]  corporate takeover of the planet that wants you for an absolutely sick under

[46:53.640 --> 46:59.320]  author of the US biological weapons treaty he already laid out the facts of
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.280]  what are they doing or the US biological weapons law that later got adopted much
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.920]  of it into the treaty what does this signify that Trump's doing this his
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.840]  doctor says Trump demanded it to get back to work quicker well but then he
[47:13.840 --> 47:16.320]  said we had to take him to the hospital to give him these treatments because
[47:16.320 --> 47:20.520]  they're dangerous he set that the Saturday press conference so that he
[47:20.520 --> 47:23.920]  really isn't competent if they're letting Trump be his own doctor I mean
[47:23.920 --> 47:30.400]  that's crazy well of course we don't know if this is true or it isn't but this
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.960]  this fellow Conley is completely incompetent he doesn't tell the truth
[47:34.960 --> 47:42.040]  he wouldn't level up with us on the status of President Trump's lungs for all
[47:42.040 --> 47:49.040]  we know COVID could be destroying the President's lungs as we speak now he
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.520]  said he would oh yeah he was dying they wouldn't tell him this is a perfect
[47:52.520 --> 47:59.000]  deep state good that's right so and you know I don't know those other doctors
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.920]  at Walter Reed but I certainly would not take my family to a military hospital
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.720]  that's for sure I I'd probably taken it you know if I lived in the district I'd
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.880]  probably taken the GW based on the great job they did there for a saving
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.960]  president Reagan and I'd get civilian doctors you have to understand
[48:21.960 --> 48:28.400]  military doctors can't be sued for malpractice it's the Ferris doctrine by
[48:28.400 --> 48:34.040]  the US Supreme Court that you know if they commit malpractice well that's
[48:34.040 --> 48:39.600]  just too bad so there's there's no mechanism to weed out incompetent
[48:39.600 --> 48:46.840]  doctors and understand this fellow is not a doctor he's an osteopath it why
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.040]  I'm not a doctor and it says you don't give somebody rendezvous of air unless
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.920]  they're deathly ill and the same thing with this biotech situation this other
[48:55.920 --> 49:01.320]  drug it says in most cases increases infection why the hell would you give
[49:01.320 --> 49:08.720]  somebody that right he I'm you know I'm not saying they're out to kill you know
[49:08.720 --> 49:13.800]  there's a conspiracy here to murder President Trump but given the way things
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.960]  are going he very well could be dead especially if we're starting out as I
[49:18.960 --> 49:28.080]  said with at least a 50% mortality rate in someone his age and then you add in
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.640]  the obesity right so we you know we really need to get him out of the
[49:33.640 --> 49:39.440]  medical the military medicine system and over there I said that Saturday we need
[49:39.440 --> 49:42.920]  to get him out of Walter Reed so where would you send him we think the best
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.880]  hospital is the country well obviously the best in the country you know it's
[49:48.880 --> 49:54.680]  the Mayo Clinic I've been up there myself with my mother for experimental
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.880]  heart surgery and you know I went to Harvard and I had thought that the
[49:59.880 --> 50:06.040]  Harvard's mass general complex was the best in the world but when I got up
[50:06.040 --> 50:10.200]  there to the Mayo Clinic I was incredibly told the Mayo Clinic's the
[50:10.200 --> 50:16.800]  best it's the best right and you know the pros from Dover as they say are up
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.440]  there in the Mayo Clinic so I guess another military but it's known to be
[50:22.440 --> 50:30.120]  about the worst yeah that's well no sure all right so let's let's I'm just in
[50:30.120 --> 50:33.880]  general the troops get screwed over there's some good doctors there too and
[50:33.880 --> 50:36.240]  great people when I put them down we're just we're just saying statistically and
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.840]  got a little bit better under Trump shifting gears big picture COVID there's
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.120]  a huge push to not implicate China not implicate Fauci not implicate Gates I've
[50:45.120 --> 50:48.800]  got big articles on that today you were the first to implicate these guys you
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.400]  were the first it's been a firestorm any new developments for people any
[50:52.400 --> 50:58.920]  other little factoids yeah what what we have to keep in mind here Alex is this
[50:58.920 --> 51:09.440]  that you're watching Fauci and all the so-called experts and big pharma trying
[51:09.440 --> 51:19.480]  to assure the American people and say oh don't worry we're going to have any
[51:19.480 --> 51:26.200]  emergency use approved by the FDA the Food and Drug Administration that's a
[51:26.200 --> 51:37.080]  total joke and a fraud and it is sick if you look at the project there that I've
[51:37.080 --> 51:42.880]  gone through with you repeatedly before a SARS-like cluster circulating back
[51:42.880 --> 51:51.040]  coronaviruses show potential for human emergence that has on there University
[51:51.040 --> 51:59.000]  of North Carolina and the Bat Queen from the Wuhan BSL4 you will see that it
[51:59.000 --> 52:09.680]  clearly says on there who also participated in developing COVID-19 the
[52:09.680 --> 52:16.160]  National Center for Toxicological Research Food and Drug Administration
[52:16.160 --> 52:24.560]  Jefferson Arkansas USA it's right on there the FDA is up to its eyeballs in
[52:24.560 --> 52:32.000]  manufacturing COVID-19 so when all these people who are also up in their eyeballs
[52:32.000 --> 52:41.440]  manufacturing COVID-19 like Fauci NIH NIA the rest of them is CDC they say oh you
[52:41.440 --> 52:49.520]  can trust the the FDA that's a joke and a fraud indeed FDA has a you know a long
[52:49.520 --> 52:59.480]  history here I helped defend Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn the highest ranking
[52:59.480 --> 53:09.440]  military officer to refuse to go to go for one because in part she did not want
[53:09.440 --> 53:16.080]  to give experimental medical vaccines for biological warfare weapons for
[53:16.080 --> 53:24.160]  anthrax and botulin okay and those experimental medical vaccines were
[53:24.160 --> 53:31.840]  approved on an emergency basis by the FDA that that Dr. Hewitt Vaughn resisted
[53:31.840 --> 53:38.520]  and refused to give to our troops well we know for a fact that with the FDA's
[53:38.520 --> 53:47.160]  approval 500,000 of our troops were injected with those experimental
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.440]  vaccines I want to talk about that if you can do a few more minutes doctor
[53:50.440 --> 53:57.680]  because yeah we have we have Dr. Lee Ming Yan who worked at the WHO virus
[53:57.680 --> 54:02.560]  monitoring center in Hong Kong and she said exactly what you've said and then
[54:02.560 --> 54:06.120]  she backed all up in a big paper showing all the other groups that looked at the
[54:06.120 --> 54:09.880]  virus and said it was man-made and she said there was a cover-up and they knew
[54:09.880 --> 54:13.400]  they were doing it I mean you have a direct whistleblower inside the UN
[54:13.400 --> 54:17.720]  monitoring facility saying that and then now Facebook blocks Tucker Carlson for
[54:17.720 --> 54:22.880]  showing it so the whole other scandal is censoring scientists censoring
[54:22.880 --> 54:28.960]  experts shutting them down and not just censoring censoring banning them
[54:28.960 --> 54:34.200]  persecuting doctors people getting fired that just talk about reality this is
[54:34.200 --> 54:38.880]  the incredible agenda who gave Fauci and Bill Gates so much power back in two

[57:18.160 --> 57:23.600]  kept us on air while they're pulling all this you're still here defiance of
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.480]  their globalist power grab there's the big headline from getwithbunna.com it's
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.320]  also on info wars.com are the global scientific elite trying to bear the
[57:31.320 --> 57:38.720]  truth about the origin of COVID-19 is the sky blue do salmon live in rivers do
[57:38.720 --> 57:45.480]  bears go potty in the woods I mean it's ridiculous and that's why Boyle thinks
[57:45.480 --> 57:49.440]  it was an accident and that they would we knew they were studying all this
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.720]  including COVID-19 that came out in a world bank document 2018 that COVID-19
[57:54.720 --> 57:58.600]  and the very groups at the UN studying and we know that they even called it
[57:58.600 --> 58:04.080]  COVID-19 so they're hiding in plain view Boyle's like well there's no way they'd
[58:04.080 --> 58:06.720]  release it when they get in trouble themselves but maybe they just don't
[58:06.720 --> 58:10.400]  care maybe that's their plausible deniability but regardless all of the
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.520]  big tech all of it lined up to cover up its origins telling me that if more
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.920]  stuff gets out even more deadly no one's gonna get in trouble dr. Boyle I mean
[58:17.920 --> 58:23.120]  how important is it that the people behind COVID-19 Obama Fauci Bill Gates be
[58:23.120 --> 58:31.400]  punished before we get there let let me conclude my point about the FDA
[58:31.400 --> 58:36.400]  allegedly certifying COVID-19 vaccines which is a sick joke and a
[58:36.400 --> 58:43.280]  demented fraud because when they certified on an emergency basis these
[58:43.280 --> 58:51.400]  experimental medical vaccines for a botulin and anthrax out of 500,000 of
[58:51.400 --> 58:59.680]  our troops who are inoculated with the approval of the FDA 11,000 of them died
[58:59.680 --> 59:08.520]  wow and 100,000 of them were disabled all with the approval of the FDA and in
[59:08.520 --> 59:15.480]  violation of the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation the FDA committed a
[59:15.480 --> 59:22.120]  Nuremberg crime on our own troops these are the people now and they were
[59:22.120 --> 59:30.400]  involved in the COVID-19 project here with the back Queen and UNC so of course
[59:30.400 --> 59:38.520]  Big Pharma knows this Fauci knows it Nye Redfield they all know that this will
[59:38.520 --> 59:45.280]  be a fantastic fraud and existentially dangerous to be perpetrated on the
[59:45.280 --> 59:51.760]  American people that oh well now we have a COVID-19 vaccine and it's been
[59:51.760 --> 59:57.240]  approved by the FDA Big Pharma ran a big ad there in the New York Times the Wall
[59:57.240 --> 1:00:01.960]  Street Journal I read every day saying to the American people oh don't worry
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:07.440]  about our vaccines they'll be approved by the FDA well this is even you know
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:12.200]  even worse than the Fox being in charge of the chicken coop sure it's just like
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:15.280]  saying don't worry I'm gonna shoot with a 12-gauge shotgun slug but it's been
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:18.520]  approved by the FDA what does that even mean it means it's got liability
[1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:22.200]  protection and saying don't worry we're protected like Bill Gates said a lot of
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:26.800]  you're gonna get sick but don't worry the FDA is gonna certify it right and so
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:33.040]  just to give your listeners your viewers and just a ballpark figure of what's
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:39.400]  going to happen here with these vaccines again on the US troops 500,000
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:47.280]  were injected 11,000 were killed if not outright murdered I accuse at the
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:52.320]  defensive captain dr. Hewitt Vaughn that this is a Nuremberg crime on our own
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:59.240]  troops and a hundred thousand one-fifth were disabled so at a minimum this is
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:04.200]  what and they were prepared to do this they did this the FDA did this to our
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:09.720]  own troops we're not even talking at the table for the media to cover it up for
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:13.920]  liability protection what is the larger agenda then of making us do this a
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:20.880]  depopulation sterilization that's the only way to see it that I see it now
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:27.960]  right and control and depopulation and debilitation right that's that's the
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:31.760]  agenda here and and of course Alan 60 second break I'm gonna do one more
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:34.400]  segment with dr. Boyle I'm gonna come back and talk about big picture and how
[1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:38.960]  we can prosecute Bill Gates and others this is so vital and then we've got
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:42.920]  other special guest Gavin McGinnis coming up and I've got so many angles
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:46.760]  to hear ladies and gentlemen these are the times that try men and women souls
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:52.000]  this is such a huge huge point in civilization stay with us
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:02:00.000]  the Renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:08.080]  replaced by scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:14.360]  law where the technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:19.560]  be as valuable as a cow in fact humans are seen as garbage it's going to be
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:25.880]  taken out and removed that is the post-human extremist plan that is the
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:30.040]  public ideology of the globalist and everything they've built with this high
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:35.560]  tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:39.920]  killed and any future generations that happen to
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:44.480]  straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:51.000]  once were this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  God's creation humanity this is the essence of evil
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:05.480]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:11.080]  okay Gavin McInnes of the Proud Boys is joining us coming up in a few minutes
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:15.080]  and we've got all this huge news President Trump in Walter Reed medical
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:18.880]  facility we got the best soldiers and there's a lot of good people in
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:23.040]  military but the doctors will tell you it's the lowest funding I know doctors
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.160]  in the military there's some good doctors but they'll tell you a lot of
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:29.240]  don't even really have real degrees the Pentagon will certify people from
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:32.200]  third-world countries that don't have real degrees they'll cut the wrong leg
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:35.560]  off I mean you've heard of malpractice it's like it's a nightmare any veteran
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:38.440]  will tell you the VA's a nightmare it's getting a little bit better under Trump
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:42.200]  and let's just say it's still you don't send the commander-in-chief there but
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:46.440]  Trump loves the military contract contrary to what media says and so he
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:49.840]  wanted to go there and then they're giving him two experimental treatments we
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:53.440]  already covered that but some stations don't carry the first five minutes Dr.
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:57.000]  Francis Boyle wrote the US biological weapons law that got picked up much of
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.840]  named the world law he was getting into the Nuremberg Code Geneva Convention
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:05.880]  experimental testing on our troops with anthrax botulism 14,000 dead this is on
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.680]  record they're calling acceptable losses that violates law you can make troops
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:14.800]  take vaccines only group you can't you can't make a big experimental so now the
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:19.480]  public's being given experimental vaccines Gates admits they have 80% getting
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.400]  sick 20% going to the hospital that take his weaker vaccine what are they
[1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:27.920]  getting us ready for why are all these big pharma working in concert to cover
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:31.840]  this up you knocked it out of the park recap that and go into more detail Dr.
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:37.720]  Francis Boyle right and Alex I just want to point out then on the anthrax and
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:44.800]  botulin vaccines the Pentagon lied about it covered it up they destroyed the
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:49.640]  records of our own troops and they're still lying about it and covering it up
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:53.640]  today because they're all implicated these are the same people that you know
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:05:01.000]  it gave President Trump an osteopath to to services a physician there at the
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:07.480]  White House it's it's it's stunted so we we just cannot you know answer the
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:12.920]  president we need to get him out of Walter Reed they very well might kill
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:18.760]  him and and either if they can you know evacuate him up to Mayo Clinic that it
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:26.240]  be great otherwise GW there that saved the president Reagan's life from the
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:34.200]  jaws of death as for and we can't be taking these COVID-19 vaccines they they
[1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:42.040]  will be just as deadly as the anthrax botulin experimental vaccines that were
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:49.760]  experimental via bio warfare vaccines COVID-19 is biological warfare and it's
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:56.000]  far more dangerous than anthrax and botulin we've been through that before
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:03.320]  it's SARS which is a biological warfare agent in the first place with gain of
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:09.880]  function to make it more lethal more infectious it has HIV in there of course
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:15.080]  we don't have a vaccine for HIV we've tried for the last 20 years to get a
[1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:20.960]  vaccine for HIV there is no vaccine for HIV there's not going to be a vaccine
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:28.200]  for COVID-19 even this French Nobel Prize winner in medicine has said the
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:33.640]  same thing so the best thing we're going to be left with here I believe are
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:39.640]  therapeutics and drugs diet taking care of yourself and stuff of that nature
[1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:46.640]  these vaccines well but of course they all want to make money to Alex that's
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:53.080]  for sure but you are right there's a broader agenda here going back to the
[1:06:53.080 --> 1:07:02.040]  Kissinger national security memorandum calling saying that it's the national
[1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:07.400]  security interests of the United States government for to have population
[1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:12.320]  reduction population control I've never read that that has been reversed or
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:18.440]  evoked or anything at all of that nature so yes there's a broader agenda here
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:24.520]  and we're just going to have to resist it I'm not you know I'm peaceful nonviolent
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:31.360]  exercise of our first amendment rights and then fighting back by means of law in
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:37.880]  the courts sure we have this Nuremberg code on medical experimentation we have
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:45.440]  my biological weapons anti-terrorism act life imprisonment so that there are
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:08:06.720]  legal tools to fight back here yes sorry I can't hear anything president has
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:11.040]  continued to improve as with any illness there are frequent ups and downs
[1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:15.160]  over the course particularly when a patient is being so closely watched 24
[1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:20.040]  hours a day we review and debate every finding compared to existing science and
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:23.360]  literature weighing the risks and benefits of every intervention it's
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:30.560]  timing as any as well as any potential impacts a delay may have over the course
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.560]  of his illness the president has experienced two episodes of transient
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:38.520]  drops in his oxygen saturation we debated the reasons for this and whether we'd
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:42.200]  even intervene is a determination of the team based predominantly on the
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:47.200]  timeline from the initial diagnosis that we initiate dexamethasone I'd like to
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:50.520]  take this opportunity now given some speculation over the course of the
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:56.320]  illness now the last couple days update you in the course of his his own
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:01.060]  illness Thursday night into Friday morning when I left the bedside the
[1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:05.800]  president was doing well with only mild symptoms and his oxygen was in the high
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:16.720]  90s okay okay we are back live here sorry the stations we had 10 seconds of
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:19.560]  dead air that happens every once in a while now that makes your alarms go off
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:26.680]  dr. Boyle continuing here with what you just laid out Kissinger State
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:33.640]  Department of Random 200 depopulating people clearly they knew last year the
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:36.760]  UN came out and said our vaccines are hurting people we're covering it up
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:40.600]  what are we gonna do well they've just made this bigger hysteria out of this
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:44.680]  as a way to really set the precedent for forced inoculation but how if they
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:47.480]  didn't get away with doing it in the military because so many people died and
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:52.360]  got sick where they have a captive group how are they going to then try to get
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:55.960]  a pig all of us and have us submit and then try to cover that up it's not gonna
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:01.400]  go well I don't think they're doing the best they can you've already seen them
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:08.280]  saying in this new budget supplement they're gonna put money in there to try
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:15.040]  to indoctrinate the American people first to accept the COVID vaccines and
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:20.240]  then if that doesn't work they move to coercion that you know if you want to
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:24.960]  work here you've got to have the vaccine if you want to go to school you have to
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:30.640]  have the vaccine if you want to come into this grocery store you have to have
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:36.680]  the vaccine and prove of it so that's the next stage if if they can indoctrinate
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:43.600]  us and brainwash us into accepting COVID vaccines that will be definitely more
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:49.000]  dangerous than useless then they will coerce us yes that that's already being
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  planned right now if you just look at the agenda here what what's already on the
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.080]  books they're they're moving in that direction well I like president Trump
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.480]  trying to end these wars but I don't like him oh we're warp speeding and we're
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:12.080]  confident and then you see him rolling the dice taking these treatments the
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:14.760]  first thing I'm gonna do is as a president when I would ask a second
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.360]  opinion of if I've been taken to Walter Reed so they can give me a treatment so
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:23.080]  dangerous I'm gonna be in the hospital to take it and then now he says he's
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:26.680]  going home hopefully in the next day or two but they're gonna keep administering
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:30.000]  these and what I've learned about experimental treatments is you may do
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.120]  good the first two or three of the fourth the fifth the sixth you never know
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:36.800]  what it's gonna cause that problem and and kill the president and then they're
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:42.880]  gonna say it's covered 19 but you know I'm not criticizing president Trump here
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.320]  you know he spent his whole career in the New York real estate business fine
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:55.120]  but you know my dad was a plaintiff's lawyer up in Chicago he had us kids
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:01.920]  treated at the top medical specialist in Chicago I was at Harvard Mass General
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:09.040]  top doctors there I explained to you my physician here board certified internal
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:20.520]  medicine specialty in adult medicine my wife is a lawyer and she specialized in
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:26.600]  defending doctors and the biggest hospital here in Central Illinois from
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.640]  medical malpractice cases so you know the president doesn't really have any
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.520]  experience in this I guess he's mistakenly put his trust in the
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:44.360]  military to provide him this this advice he probably thinks he's getting the
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:49.560]  best medical care he can over there at Walter Reed but we both agreed it's
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:53.160]  completely inferior well let's all pray for him thank you Dr. Francis Boyle
[1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:58.360]  amazing the planets have aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:04.560]  aligned financially culturally the most importantly spiritually we are living at
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:09.960]  point in human development that decide the entire future destiny of our species
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:14.960]  that's why big tech control with the very dark forces the globalist is trying
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:20.360]  to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone and traffic
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:24.040]  control every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:27.680]  stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birth
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:34.920]  right not just of Americana but of true Christmastime and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment they are
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:38.720]  trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:43.640]  life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:49.240]  carbon credits and through a social credit score this is their plan we must
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:53.120]  come together and awaken out of our trance and say no we must embrace God

[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:30.120]  all right I get obsessed all day over Trump and Walter Reed it's all up to
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:35.160]  God I don't just come up here and say something to be sensational analyst
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:39.640]  across the board say to give somebody a rendezvous of ear and to give them this
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:44.440]  other cocktail together is insane both of them are very dangerous it's exactly
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:52.360]  what Fauci would do and Trump's a bull to not be more sick right now I don't think
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:56.560]  Trump stage this he looks like he's lost some weight he looks ashen as his voice
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:03.920]  the sore his voice is a little bit scratchy but people get sick they get
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:08.040]  pneumonia as they get colds now the idea because they design these tests where
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:14.840]  everybody is false positive basically it's this hysteria and I have neighbors
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:17.880]  and stuff man that come over wearing their mask and I just said I said I've
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:22.560]  never I tell them I said I can't talk to you I just can't play along with the
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:30.240]  kabuki theater anyone will die if they do not have their essential vitamins and
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:36.440]  minerals when you don't have them you get a cold or a flu and you die in almost
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:42.840]  every case you get a flu or a cold because you a don't have the vitamins
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:46.080]  and minerals or because you're diabetic your body can't move the nutrients
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:51.400]  around so it's either you don't have the vitamins and minerals or your blood
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:58.600]  can't get them moved around so and I know as an audience you know that but
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:02.960]  you know that's really a public service announcement because going into this
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:08.120]  fall and winter we always have most the deaths then and why is that people are
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:15.360]  inside they're not getting sunshine and they don't have vitamin D3 if you're
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:23.720]  missing one vital nutrient you die they never put it on your toe tag you died
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:27.960]  of that this is a fact and then I've told the story hundred times I've had
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:35.800]  family I've had federal agents I know I've had lawyers I know I've had people I
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:40.320]  know I mean the other day I was with two really smart lawyers and they go Alex
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:46.800]  you said like eight months ago we need vitamin D3 and that we need vitamin C
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:51.560]  how'd you know that and it's like saying how do I need 93 octane for my dodge
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:57.440]  charger or my f-150 pickup I mean it's like how did you know that you needed
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:04.320]  diesel for your diesel quad if you're diesel truck I
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:11.200]  you know on the side of a chainsaw it says the type of oil to use well in the
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:16.680]  science it's settled if you don't have vital nutrients and you're not absorbing
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:21.480]  them and you're not getting them into your cells you die die die die die die
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:27.840]  die and the public is so malnourished and so dumb down and on so much fast food
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:39.080]  and we're all guilty of it most of us are that we're sitting ducks and and
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:49.960]  trumpet 74 eating fast food you know why he eats fast food right they said the
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.480]  secret service around I was told his fours in the news he likes it anyways but
[1:18:54.480 --> 1:18:58.320]  because they go to look at a one McDonald's this time one Burger King this
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:02.400]  time one Wendy's that time he's because they don't trust these places are not
[1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.120]  Jack was food can you imagine you know we'll just eat the White House food he
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:10.800]  doesn't trust them you got spies all around him
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:21.440]  it's crazy you know I Sean handy it's his food messed with I know my food's been
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:29.480]  messed with they don't just take your bank accounts they don't just take your
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:33.760]  credit card processing away they don't just
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:41.600]  deplatforming off the internet they take your food and they put snot in it and
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:45.880]  boogers in it and they wiped their ass on it and that's what they do because
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:48.400]  that's what the left does is they're a bunch of cowards they never fight up
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.200]  front they have no chivalry they have no bottom they support pedophilia they
[1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:58.920]  support Satanism they support garbage yeah McGinnis is gonna be joining us but
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:02.440]  I wanted to play these two clips to remind everybody of what Trump critically
[1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:07.920]  said in the last month this is back on August 7th so a month and almost two
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.480]  months ago watch Trump says this may be the last time you'll see me for a while
[1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:16.200]  because he was cutting out the middlemen with prescription drug makers while we
[1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:22.720]  have the highest prices in the world and he went on in another statement he made
[1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:32.280]  just a few days ago last week saying the troops the soldiers love me but the
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:36.840]  top brass don'ts I'm trying to end these wars so here's both clips I have a lot
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:40.880]  of enemies out there this may be the last time you'll see me for a while a lot
[1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:45.520]  of very very rich enemies but they are not happy with what I'm doing but I
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:49.200]  figure we have one chance to do it and no other president's gonna do what I do
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:54.640]  in a White House briefing the president said he felt Pentagon seniors would not
[1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:59.920]  have felt the same way because of his success at preventing wars I'm not
[1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:04.120]  saying the military is in love with me the soldiers are the top people in the
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:08.400]  Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:12.520]  that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:17.520]  and make everything else stay happy the president also floated the idea of an
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:22.920]  economic decoupling decoupling from China as trade tensions intensify
[1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:29.120]  Trump praised China's spending increase in US agricultural goods before teasing
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:35.720]  a sharp financial break when you mentioned the word decouple it's an
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:40.640]  interesting word so we lose billions of dollars and if we didn't do business with
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:45.120]  them we would lose billions of dollars it's called decoupling so you'll start
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:49.880]  thinking about it we're at war with China and there's all these Chinese
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:55.320]  globalist interests that sold America out and made trillions so of course
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:58.400]  their whole operating system is about a hating America and hating justice and
[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:01.400]  hating it because that's what you need to do if you're gutting a country you need
[1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:04.920]  to have that attitude you need to enjoy what you're doing and not feel guilty for
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:09.520]  it we're gonna go to break but I want to direct listeners to prepare with Alex
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:13.120]  calm that's we're gonna find the lowest prices and high-quality swarble food
[1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:17.320]  anywhere even better than info or store.com because contractually we're
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:20.520]  distributors we get the same price they sell for on their site and that all the
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.400]  distributors sell for the biggest swarble food company in the United States
[1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:27.360]  probably the world but there's a loophole if they have a special that they can do
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:31.600]  occasionally on their side itself they can go an additional five or ten percent
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:35.480]  so they're selling this almost at their cost we make a little bit of money
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:40.240]  it's under operation it's a favor I asked them we did it it's a favor passed on to
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:44.720]  you you need swarble food you need to check off that box for preparedness I
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:48.360]  believe just like guns are all sold out and ammo's all sold out food's gonna be
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:52.640]  sold out again they're shipping within a week now ladies and gentlemen other
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:55.680]  swarble food companies oh you know we got it right away they'd make you wait
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:59.600]  eight weeks no we've got all the food delivered they've got it now with only a
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:05.240]  one week wait but here's the problem food prices are going up the food chain
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:10.760]  the delivery chain the the supply chain has broken down and so they're gonna have
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:18.080]  to raise prices upwards of 20 percent very very soon and so they're letting the
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:22.160]  dust settle right now but this is the last chance to get it at the super
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:26.600]  discount prepare the Alex calm they have a one-year food supply $600 off
[1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:31.480]  they're the lowest price $300 off a six-month food supply 160 off a three
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:35.220]  month and a bunch of other big specials on solar charger systems that are
[1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:39.560]  top of the line and water filtration with big discounts it's gonna end in 14
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:48.720]  hours at preparewithalix.com or triple 8 4 1 1 0 3 5 0 that's 8 8 8 4 1 1 0 3 5 0
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:24:06.440]  preparewithalix.com the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:18.420]  Infowars has been banned arrested attacked and threatened because we are
[1:24:18.420 --> 1:24:26.180]  effective the great awakening is here go to banned.video download the videos and
[1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:37.660]  share support the information war at InfowarsStore.com and never give up the
[1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:57.120]  fight remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:03.400]  independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:09.480]  vertical integration absolute authoritarianism to where you are a
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:17.280]  captive of their devices of their control but that is only a means to an end
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:21.480]  once they have the electronic straightjacket in place they are on
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:25.480]  record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:30.280]  family and worse many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:36.160]  actually give people polio and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.200]  that's a big secret but the secret is beginning to come out it's even in the
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:47.560]  associated press remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned on
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:53.320]  video but only you can share them and save humanity the future isn't coming

[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:23.320]  process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:28.560]  human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:34.880]  way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:39.840]  horrifying things like this to you but only by facing the horror and not
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:44.320]  projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:48.720]  study their own writings he must face the facts and he must come to grips with
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:55.760]  it you're all being incrementally destroyed you're listening to the Alex
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:58.600]  Jones show
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:12.760]  welcome back I'm Alex Jones your house we're getting Gavin McInnis
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:30.760]  now ladies and gentlemen we're going to have a live 40 hour broadcast starting
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:41.920]  Wednesday at 8 a.m. running through midnight the next day and we'll be
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:46.720]  covering the vice presidential debate which be very very interesting hopefully
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:53.560]  it's better than the last one the president's Pence versus Harris and so
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:59.240]  again that will be unfolding Wednesday night 8 a.m. central we kick off we run
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.480]  right through into the middle of the night the next night please be sure and
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:10.320]  join us info wars Pence versus Harris and remember big tech thinks you're
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:13.960]  idiots they think you have virtualized the Facebook to Twitter to YouTube then
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:17.040]  if they shadow band people and we build our own website or on satellite uplinks
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:22.000]  our own video streaming site that oh you won't promote it but then you do start
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:28.240]  promoting it so you tube and Google and Facebook and Twitter start blocking band
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:33.360]  on video links we just changed it to election center 2020.com or 2020
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.840]  election center.com that's just a clone of the site all the same URLs very same
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:44.960]  videos and so this is a a war and you have to be in the mindset of a war not
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:49.360]  just passively dealing with that so as soon as we get Gavin on we'll go to him
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:55.840]  we're not keeping him on hold but something else we promised to do we
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:59.800]  finally got it done I would give it an a-minus which is really good for a site
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:02.640]  that just got launched we're gonna be tweaking it adding a lot of new features
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:07.360]  I want to say the crew did a fabulous job our small IT department working
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:14.280]  overtime has redesigned info wars.com it was operating on a design from really
[1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:19.360]  about 2008 that had been updated a few years ago and it was a venerable site
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:23.160]  but it's no longer a blue background it's white on black very easy on the eyes
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:27.120]  that's some of the cleanest best fonts out there and a lot of great functions
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:30.440]  are there a lot of great functions are being added but we're taking your
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:39.760]  feedback at show tips at info wars.com but you can find all the news all the
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:47.520]  articles all the videos all the special reports and more at info wars.com it is
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:54.280]  a new site design loads something like 10 times faster much easier to search but
[1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:59.200]  as I said the writers and the IT folks working together to get this done and so
[1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:03.040]  I want to commend Kit Daniels and I want to commend Michael Zimmerman I want to
[1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:08.920]  commend everybody and the whole team Ben everybody over there Timothy all the
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:14.080]  crew that got this done and it's a first-rate site you know I got really
[1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:19.600]  jealous of Paul Watson summit.new site I mean jealous kind of you get jealous of
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:23.440]  your own right hand but you know what I mean and I said hey can we not have
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:28.680]  something like this and so we got it done and I think it rivals summit.news
[1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:32.440]  we're not competition with summit.news but that's a first-rate site so now we
[1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:38.640]  have info wars.com redesigned and send your ideas we're closely watching it to
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:47.600]  show tips at info wars.com it's not it's not read like the bowels of Satan like
[1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:51.600]  Joe Rogan's new studio where you rotisserie roast different slabs of
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:55.880]  meat actually Joseph this studio is growing on me
[1:30:55.880 --> 1:31:00.880]  Joseph Joseph's studio is growing on me greatly Tim Dillon was in town last week
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:07.560]  and I missed the calls I got I had my phone turned off but regardless the
[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:14.120]  planets I'm sure will realign very very soon but back to what I was saying I one
[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:20.840]  day hoped to be in the rotisserie chicken you know Joe told me about a studio
[1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:25.320]  before he built it he told me how they were building and what they did and I
[1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:29.160]  said well that sounds interesting I don't think Joe's talked about what he's
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:37.280]  inside yet I don't think anyone knows that he's inside something so when I go
[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:43.200]  over there I'm gonna show you this right down the street who knows that
[1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:51.600]  Ganesh would be inside a whale yeah oh maybe they think people will search where
[1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:56.800]  there was a giant blue whale and figure it out I don't know but who that the
[1:31:56.800 --> 1:32:05.120]  inside of a whale is red so it's atomically atomic is a wrong word it's
[1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:10.840]  very close to atomic means body parts automatically I'm having one of those
[1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:15.680]  slip moments where I can't say the word here and it's it's not good
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:24.040]  atomically and atomically and atomically and atomically yes thank you
[1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:30.880]  anatomically you know here's what happens to me more and more to be quite
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:36.560]  frankly everybody you know I know what they're rolling out I know what they're
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:41.280]  doing I know what they're planning next and I just get to a point where I just
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:47.120]  can't do it I get to a point sometimes why I know why people run and hide I know
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:50.720]  why folks just say I don't care I was talking to a guy today and he's like
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:55.640]  well-known nice guy business guy he's like Alex I used to think you were
[1:32:55.640 --> 1:33:00.760]  crazy it's all true now everything you said so I just want to find a farm or
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:06.280]  something and never be seen again and I said brother I'm exactly the same find
[1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:12.480]  50 acres never leave it again you had the money more but you can't do that
[1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:16.080]  because the globalist system is gonna collapse everything they admit to make
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:19.720]  you submit you're exactly who they want to get and so you're gonna have to fight
[1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:25.160]  this system you're gonna have to stand up it's what you're gonna have to do
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:31.480]  there's not gonna be any hiding from this we're not going to get away from
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:37.280]  this without standing up to it it's it's just simple people stood up our
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:40.480]  ancestors they demanded freedom and demanded justice we built one of the
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:44.040]  freest greatest societies ever we've got a bunch of wimps and now all hell has
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:51.000]  broken loose now president Trump a few days ago had this to say about the
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.480]  proud boys so I thought we hear what the president had to say and then actually
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.360]  get the founder of the proud boys on Gavin McGinnis here's what Trump had to
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.680]  say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence and a number of
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:12.960]  these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland I would say
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.040]  almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right so what do
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:20.480]  you what are you saying I'm willing to do anything I want to see
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:32.080]  it sir do it say it do you want to call them what do you want to call them give me a name give me a name white supremacist stand back and
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:36.560]  stand by but I'll tell you what I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:44.800]  about Antifa and the left Wow so you're a white supremacist now they're saying
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:49.160]  that the man up in Kenosha written houses a white supremacist suits have been
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:53.760]  filed gab McGinnis thanks for coming on what's it like I was the center of
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:58.200]  things four years ago the bad guy you were a side dish but still prominent but
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:05.680]  you're number one bad guy right now isn't it funny based on what based on
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:09.760]  what research and what's crazy about it too is the radical left can burn down
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:15.160]  this country for four months straight and they go yeah but these guys are the
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:20.840]  problem why cuz one of them might have shot someone no Kyle written house is
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:25.280]  not a problem and Kyle written house did nothing wrong where is this where are
[1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:30.080]  these white supremacists well look we all know they're scared of proud boys
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:33.760]  possessing inclusive and men are sick of being told we're scum so it's a great
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:37.080]  idea to have a group fraternal men that are proud of the West and America of
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:40.880]  every race color creed and even sexual persuasion and they they're threatened by
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:44.200]  the inclusiveness and they're scared so that's why they've demonized you so
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:47.440]  that's why they've well you know what's ironic about the gay thing too is they
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:50.640]  put these to fight back you got celebrities like George to K saying
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:56.080]  let's make the proud boys hashtag gay that'll drive them nuts and and the
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:59.680]  irony is there's more gays and proud boys than they are represented in the
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:05.560]  population because every time a gay man comes out to support Trump the gay
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:10.800]  community totally ostracizes him vilifies him kicks him out of clubs he
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:16.000]  loses all his friends because they are intolerant so we take them in because we
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.400]  don't care if you're gay or Jewish or black or brown as long as you're pro
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:25.600]  West you're in and so the irony of this whole thing is that we are the
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:31.080]  tolerant ones and they're the intolerant ones you're absolutely right when we
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:34.440]  come back let's get more into this and where you see this election going with
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:39.120]  28 days left I remember asking you like four years ago what is peak SJW and you
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.240]  said I don't think there is a peak I think that statement has been proven to
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:45.800]  me like some Einsteinian theory of relativity proven right I mean it's
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:50.600]  like there is no peak there is no bottom there is no end so how does it end we
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.760]  have a new week of massive savings at preparewithalex.com our partnership with

[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:04.160]  reordering it they spread the word and became one of our best sellers but
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:07.960]  because of the COVID supply chain breakdown because there's 13 different
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:13.520]  formulas in a pack power stack we are unable to secure it anymore this is the

[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:04.440]  complications of COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:10.760]  estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.760]  talk Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar part of the establishment
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:22.640]  for close to 50 years but now boy his brain degenerates we are seeing walking
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:28.200]  public dementia on the biggest stage in the world the 2020 election there are
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:33.040]  370 million people in the United States if 200 million died from COVID that'd be
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:37.400]  more than half of the population when not even one tenth of one percent have
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:42.360]  actually died but him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:46.400]  damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:52.280]  how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre it was in the
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:57.240]  telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:02.360]  location I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:07.200]  that was on American now the media admits that almost every app and every
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:11.960]  company that are on Apple and on droids don't just track your location but your
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:16.920]  surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:20.760]  share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:26.240]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:31.240]  Alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:35.360]  those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:39.200]  are generating secret surveillance scores based on information this is the
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:43.480]  global Chinese communist social credit score get your protection privacy
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:48.200]  pockets at info or short on and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:52.000]  info or store.com
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:59.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:14.680]  we now take you live to the most sinister most evil gas possible called by
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:21.960]  Brian Stelter the baby headlines of the information war it's Alex Jones the
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:29.360]  most evil guest alive on planet Earth the man known as baby Hitler is Gavin
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:34.440]  McGinnis of course I'm joking ladies and gentlemen you know Kyle Rittenhouse's
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:39.640]  lawyer is suing the Biden campaign for calling him a white supremacist the idea
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:43.680]  that you go out you're a medic and you're an observer and you go show all this and
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:47.800]  then you get attacked you defend yourself but they called you a white
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:52.240]  supremacist disavow the proud boy white supremacist to the president Trump's
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.760]  like well I'm not quite sure who they are but I know he knows who you are and
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:00.000]  he's just simply saying yeah stand down it's the left burning everything Gavin
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.640]  so you founded proud boys for people that don't know tell them what it is you
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.480]  you step down kind of like Moses stepping down you know just because you want
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:10.920]  them to run their own organization but they've never been violent they've
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:15.080]  never been offensive they've never been racist and now it's a major campaign
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:20.880]  issue where do you see this going well I think what Trump disavowed it because
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:26.280]  what the left likes to do is they they find a group right they they make you
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:30.600]  either love them or hate them and then if you say love them then they go
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.720]  through and they'll find something someone did once it was a sin and now
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:38.160]  that's attached to you so Trump was saying look I'm not going to be
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:41.600]  responsible for this entire club I'm not going to play your game I'm going to
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:45.640]  avoid this game entirely but what's amazing is that they can take a
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:53.840]  multiracial men's club with proud boys Israel run by a black Hispanic and
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:59.760]  rife with homosexuals and make it into a homophobic Nazi group I mean they we
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:02.400]  never go to their things they come to our things right they all they've ever
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:06.240]  done is self-defense and Tifa had a million events proud boys don't go to
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:09.840]  them and Tifa comes to every single single problem event they also by the
[1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:13.600]  way go to conservative speakers if you were to do a talk at a university and
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:18.080]  Tifa would be there hurling feces urine batteries attacking let's not forget
[1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:23.120]  that they attacked your buddies in New York and then put them in jail my
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.960]  friends Max and John proud boys one of them has a black wife check her out at
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:31.120]  justiceforliberty.com where we do the fundraising for them still appealing
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:36.480]  the charge but and Tifa worth we're vandalizing the club for a week before
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:41.360]  I got there then I get there I do my comedy set and Tifa beats reporter
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:44.960]  steals the stuff no charges they pick a fight with proud boys proud boys beat
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:50.280]  their ass for 17 seconds four years in prison no damage those kids looked fine
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:55.600]  no four years in prison it is illegal in America to stand your ground the
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:00.240]  Coventine Catholic school boys were a great look at the McCluskey's in St.
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:06.240]  Louis I mean this is getting dangerous no problem if Antifa burns shit down and
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:08.960]  rips down statues and attacks people that's fine
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:12.560]  magical lawyers appear like fairies and pay for their bail but if you just
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:18.000]  stand on your own property after your gate has been bent forward twisted and
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.040]  you stand there and make it clear you will not let them burn down your house
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:23.760]  oh yeah that happened a few weeks ago a guy with a shotgun there at his house
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:26.720]  saying we're gonna kill you and burn your house down he just shows the shotgun
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:30.480]  through the window doesn't point it at him the police ran and arrested them
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:33.920]  I'm not against the police but if bad government takes over they can become
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:38.240]  authoritarian but I noticed police in most areas grovel to the left and are
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:41.040]  actually a problem people are like oh the police are
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:44.480]  wonderful the police in many areas have just bowed to the left and are like
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.400]  running after them like oh will or will will arrest anybody that you know stands
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:51.360]  up for themselves we we're gonna prove to you black lives matter and George
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:56.000]  Soros and Antifa that we're good now this is to be clear this is the police's
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.800]  boss the beat cops many beat cops are proud boys or at least work till they
[1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:05.520]  got threatened with being fired but they're down here with us if I had I
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:10.240]  know tons of cops if I had any power Max and John wouldn't be in prison now
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:15.040]  it's the I always say if the police's boss and it's their bosses the chiefs
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:19.760]  the sergeants the the mayors that are telling them to stand down and using
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:23.360]  them as political tools and saying go over there and get that guy because it's
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:26.880]  good PR for me and they can't wait to throw these cops under the bus the
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:29.440]  second there's any kind of trouble that's why we're seeing these cops
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.080]  fire retire in unprecedented numbers which is part of the plan of them
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:36.720]  bringing all the bad cops I mean I totally agree I'm not against the police in
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:41.920]  general but I mean I watch out in LA where the car they're attacking the car
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:47.200]  it drives away the little Prius they like road warrior block it in and then the
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:50.720]  police put the guy in handcuffs who's being attacked with his windows knocked
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:57.440]  out I mean what you don't arrest the BLM people that are road-worrying this guy
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:00.240]  well remember that we have these progressive DAs
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:03.440]  Newt Gengrich got a lot of trouble for bringing up that Soros helps pay for
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.280]  them that was literally verboten on Fox News but when you arrest these Antifa
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:13.280]  guys they just go in the front door and out the front door it's it's a revolving
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.520]  door for them it's only patriots that seem to to pay the price
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:23.360]  I mean Antifa these thugs BLM gangsters that are looting all just seem to be
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:27.520]  getting away with murder literally with murder and the media is complicit the
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:31.120]  media is driving it like how about that woman with the little kid who was
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:35.520]  killed for saying all lives matter isn't that incredible I got shot her in the
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:39.440]  head for saying it and the media covered it up
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:43.120]  so what what the media does is it perpetrates this
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:48.000]  so and perpetuates it sorry so when you have a guy like I was just at the walk
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.520]  away rally in DC and this black guy is going through the car going
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:56.640]  fuck Trump fuck Trump excuse my language f Trump because the media has
[1:46:56.640 --> 1:47:01.440]  taught him that Trump supporters are Nazis so he's being brave in a sense
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:04.320]  after being brainwashed by standing up to these Nazis
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:07.600]  so some guy goes f Trump f you and then he just immediately starts swinging
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:11.360]  punches him in the head gets arrested for it he'll be released probably
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:16.960]  an hour later and so in a sense both of those people in that fight are victims
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:20.720]  the black guy was a victim to this brainwashing going on by the media
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:24.000]  that tells them there's Nazis everywhere and then of course the guy who got
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.080]  punched in the face was also a victim of this thug who thinks that Trump
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.520]  supporters are Nazis and need to be beaten up so the media is
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:36.960]  complicit in both of those cases both of the people in that attack
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:39.520]  I totally agree so the question I asked you four years ago on the give the
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:45.040]  election I asked again what is peak sjw insanity
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:50.000]  we've only just begun when trump wins in a landslide
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.280]  they are going to leave the cities because they're done
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:57.200]  you know drive around new york drive around dc drive around austin you see
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.360]  plywood everywhere in dc right now the nat geo building
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:05.120]  they've rented the space of the building across from them and and it's like a
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:10.880]  ten story high black lives matter giant mural and then you look at nat geo
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:14.080]  and their entire office headquarters is covered in plywood
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:17.120]  so they've already taken the cities the cities are ruined new york's over so
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:20.640]  now it's time to go into the suburbs they're going to start burning homes
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:25.120]  destroying homes attacking people the the the carnage is going to spread out
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:29.520]  and include everywhere that's what the bolsheviks did in
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.400]  1917 1918 russia it took them several years to get the
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.560]  cities then they fanned out like locust
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:40.400]  bol the bolsheviks is the perfect analogy and the thing i love about that
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:43.440]  analogy is the bolsheviks all they care about is winning
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:46.560]  they don't care about murder they don't care about genocide they don't care who
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:50.160]  dies and you see this with jewish americans who are happy to just throw
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:54.240]  israel under the bus and go yeah if that if trump is israel then i
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:57.920]  hate israel and you've just you've just sacrificed your
[1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:02.000]  own people to for a win for a game and that's what we saw with
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:05.600]  bolsheviks they didn't care what position they took as long as they were
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.400]  winning and if that means burning down their own communities no problem
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:13.280]  exactly they didn't care about how to feed people how to clothe them what was
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:17.840]  going to happen they just cared about power power these people are drunk with
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:21.200]  power and most of the footage you see are ponds
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:24.320]  they're not getting the the bottom rung people don't get paid
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:28.800]  they're just self-indulgent brainwashed marxist vandals who have no idea
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:32.880]  but then meanwhile what's it like with a peaceful group multiracial you found it
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:37.040]  about men being proud of themselves and we're sick of i mean it's a perfect
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:40.720]  name we're sick of being told we're bad and then they literally lie about you
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:43.840]  knowing they're doing it and the whole media and unison just doesn't
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:47.280]  because i get to experience that about you with myself as well but i mean with
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:52.560]  you guys it's another level it is reverse propaganda it's just
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:56.240]  it's our willy and just like they say war is peace good is bad
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:00.240]  respeaches censorship you know when john and zenoa were on trial for that
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:04.560]  antifa fight she's a black woman long dreads very black
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:09.600]  and every time she would go to the bathroom daily news and the new york
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:13.440]  post by the way allegedly right-wing news sources are just as bad
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:17.120]  taking pictures of them of john sorry they even got him once where he was
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.000]  going get away and it looks like a z kyle if you go really low
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:23.440]  and then when she would come back cameras down even right now they want to
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:26.560]  talk about prowl boys talk to the black hispanic leader i'm not even in it
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:29.520]  anymore no we'd rather get the white male they
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:32.880]  always are very selective about what pictures they take what angle they take
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:37.440]  and they end up saying the opposite they end up creating this roaming gang of
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:40.240]  nazis and that's how the judge summed up his opinion
[1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:43.360]  well we have an array on all the time but and but we do like to have a little
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:46.240]  gab mcganus i mean yeah he's a good interview too but you know
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:50.880]  you are quite witty my friend i am scintillating and charming and that's
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:55.360]  really my biggest sin here is that i make supporting trump look fun
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:58.000]  and that can't happen because that leads to
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.640]  dems walking away that's exactly why they platform me was the memes of the fun
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:05.360]  and as soon as they figured out that i like being made fun of they go my god
[1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:09.920]  we gotta ban this person immediately because they because they have no humor
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:13.920]  they're totally devoid of humor and that's the foundation of the proud boys
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:18.160]  it started as a joke and humor and sarcasm and memes are still the backbone
[1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:21.760]  of the movement it's still about budweiser and animal house
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:25.200]  how many major movements have you found it gab mcganus is our guest we'll look at
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:27.600]  the election will handicap it what he thinks is going to happen when trump
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:30.640]  wins uh the whole coban thing two more seconds with gab mcganus then i'm
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:33.680]  going to open the phones up for your calls after he leaves us and i'm going

[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:58.720]  as plain as day communist chinese working in tandem
[1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:02.160]  with the united nations and the democratic party in the united states
[1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:06.240]  as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:09.280]  to make it look like day of the dead into the world
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:13.440]  in china earlier this year then the un put out standardized rules
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:17.760]  designed to keep the west locked down when china reopened within three months
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:22.160]  this is the greatest strategic poo ever this is

[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:22.880]  job gavin what's the next big trends to come i mean you started vice magazine
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:27.200]  you started the hipster movement you've started
[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:31.200]  the proud boys you know you you're an integral part of getting trump elected
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:35.440]  you're a smart guy you're a fun guy what do you see in the future
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:39.120]  the new right it's it's it's proud boys but it's
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:42.960]  also this gen z they've had enough of all these rules
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:46.640]  and they don't like it because when you look at what these bolsheviks are doing
[1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:50.000]  they're saying you know alex jones said that the the frogs
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.320]  making frogs gay and you go well that's actually true if you look it up he just
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:54.800]  said it in a colorful way and they go well i don't like that he should have
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:57.840]  said it just literally go okay so you're against color
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:01.760]  you're against hyperbole you're against humor and they end up with this
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:04.480]  platform of just gray don't say anything that could be
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.560]  misinterpreted don't say anything that isn't little
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:10.880]  talk like walter kronkite talk like an encyclopedia and young people see that
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:14.320]  and they go i like color i like humor i like fun i like danger
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.120]  i like fighting i like laughing i like insensitive jokes
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:23.200]  and so what the left has accidentally done is make themselves look like the
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:29.120]  church lady from snl and made being new right fun maybe satan
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:34.960]  maybe prom boys we're seeing we're seeing a new kind of
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:38.640]  conservative who doesn't really care about if you smoke a joint or if you're
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:42.000]  gay and any of that sort of social conservative stuff they tend to be
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.840]  socially liberal but they get that the government sucks and they get they don't
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:51.120]  hate america pardon me they don't hate america
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:54.320]  they don't hate america they they they've been around and you know they see
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:58.160]  their their their big sister unemployed with some dumb sjw
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:02.000]  degree and they go maybe that they're what they're pushing what
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.560]  these academics are pushing is bad for me maybe it's it was bad for my sister
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:09.920]  i'm not following that route i think that's the most conservative
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:14.960]  18 and 25s america's had since reagan and that's because the left can't mean well
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:18.000]  that's the next thing the left gets two or three of these worthless
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.520]  degrees and they get more desperate believing if they can just take over
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:26.000]  they'll finally have a job when they're chai-com idiots who the chai-coms hate
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.360]  and they'll never get a job they're destroying their own future
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:32.640]  but thinking they're vitriolically almost there they're the biggest
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:36.560]  chumps i've ever seen well you see this in comedy
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:41.200]  with stand-up comedy it's very hard to do stand-up it's very hard to do
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:46.080]  sketch comedy at an improv place like ucb so what these ugly fat
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:49.680]  trannies and lesbians and just losers who pretend that they're
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:53.280]  multi-gender what they did is they started imposing all these rules
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:56.560]  and they thought i can't get it through meritocracy i'll get it through this
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:59.840]  left-wing fascism and then they get on stage and they suck
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:03.360]  and they ruin the comedy they ruin snl they ruin movies
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:08.240]  and comedy has had its color usurped via leftist fascism and then they get out
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:11.200]  there and they tried and you go no you suck
[1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:14.960]  you're not funny you've just ruined comedy so
[1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:19.280]  americans see that they see all these great american pastimes getting ruined
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.200]  and they think maybe if when you forcibly replaced
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:26.400]  the people who were there with meritocracy and you did a good job we'd
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:30.320]  see your point but you're not you suck and you just ruined our fun thing
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:35.040]  so screw you we're taking it back i totally agree with you
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:38.080]  but but but i keep asking the question what's their peak because if they're
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:40.960]  never going to stop and there's such losers
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:46.720]  where does this all end they get they get beaten back down
[1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:51.920]  i mean i i can't tell you how many people have spoken to recently dads and
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:56.320]  young people who have no experience in politics besides reading the paper and
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:59.760]  arguing in bars and they're saying i'm getting active i'm working with this
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:03.280]  guy in this district and i'm gonna move down to florida and i'm gonna work with
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:06.480]  this guy under this guy and i've i've never done it before but i'm gonna
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.240]  volunteer for this congressperson like people are getting up people are getting
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.920]  the giant just got off the bench that's exactly what is happening in america
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:20.160]  and that's what america is right you bully us we ignore you we take it we
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:23.200]  take it we take it and then you go one step too far and we say
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:26.640]  all right that's it put down the toys everyone's going to bed
[1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:31.120]  parties over you're grounded no screens for a week america
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:34.560]  absolutely i mean it just gets more shrill more desperate back in 60 seconds
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:36.640]  want to look at the election look at covet 19
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:40.400]  look at the lockdowns with the one the only gab mcginnis of censor dot tv
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:43.280]  i'm alan shones with info wars dot com and the new
[1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:49.280]  redesigned info wars dot com stay with us
[1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:54.640]  the renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:58.880]  replaced by scientific tyranny
[1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:04.240]  that's establishing a form of planetary digital law
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:09.680]  where the technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to be
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:14.640]  as valuable as a cow in fact humans are seen as garbage it's going to be
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:20.080]  taken out and removed that is the post human extremist plan
[1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:23.120]  that is the public ideology of the globalists
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:26.080]  and everything they've built with this high-tech grid
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:29.600]  is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds
[1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:34.160]  as we're slowly killed and any future generations that
[1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:37.040]  happen to strangle out of their mother's wounds
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:40.720]  will be a mere shadow of what humans once were
[1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:44.800]  this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass
[1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:54.800]  vandalism against god's creation humanity this is the essence of evil
[2:00:14.800 --> 2:00:26.160]  yeah mcginnis the proud boys founder is our guest you know i i made a joke with
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:29.120]  him a few years ago he was out of the proud boys became a political
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:32.800]  distraction for him he got demonized because of it
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:36.240]  and he made a strategic decision to say hey it's its own deal but i can't
[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:39.120]  command it i can't run it it was a joke it was just
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:42.320]  something fun to piss off liberals and troll them kind of like pepper the
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:45.760]  frog was great people in it gabin supports them
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:49.280]  and they wouldn't let him get away from it and so i said well
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:52.960]  it you know initiate me as well it's not official but i'll do it and i even
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:55.760]  say on the video it's a joke and i'm not scared to be in the proud boys
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:59.440]  i guess i should be because i i've already been banned and shadow banned all
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:03.440]  the same stuff they've gone through so he initiated me you know did the
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:06.960]  initiation and the media literally goes hey
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:10.160]  jones is a white supremacist too do you platform him more
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:14.320]  and so in a case where we lost a bank account i never told gabin this
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:18.160]  uh but but a few months ago they told us well it's your affiliation with the
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:20.560]  white supremacist proud boys and we may follow the lawsuit
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:23.200]  because this is just outrageous you're not a white supremacist i'm not but
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:25.440]  even if we were what we can't have a bank account
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:29.280]  i mean this just shows how they're externalizing the whole takeover system
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:34.240]  of what goes on um in college campuses and that tyranny
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:38.560]  is now to go nationwide well we can't put up with this can we gabin
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:42.320]  now and it's it's it's crazy like that initiation
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:45.360]  it comes from a high school where if you farted
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:49.280]  or burp and you don't say safety then everyone gets to beat you up until you
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:52.400]  can name five breakfast cereals we played it my entire adolescence it's
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:55.760]  called safety slug and it's a stupid funny game
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:59.600]  and the the media tries to make that into some sinister
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:04.880]  ms-13 initiation and and they keep running so they tell you a lie
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:08.160]  and then you're stuck with that lie forever and by the way i didn't quit the
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:10.400]  proud boys because it was a political distraction
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:14.720]  i quit them because in the courtroom with max and john max hair and john kinsman
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:19.840]  the prosecution kept bringing in all of these quotes from my comedy show
[2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:23.440]  that was on uh opionante's infidels kumia's network
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:26.880]  comedy show but they were taking the jokes out of context and showing the rude
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:30.320]  words to make them look bad and that's what they were just trying to do to
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.280]  trump if if he can say oh the proud boys are all right
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:36.880]  then they'll find some quote from one of my comedy sets and say trump endorses
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.000]  that that's the way it works you say you like one
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:44.240]  a motley cruise song and all of a sudden you're a satanist
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:48.320]  exactly so well sorry i misrepresented that that was
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:51.120]  i was trying to oversimplify but i get it you didn't want to hurt the
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:54.880]  organization or hurt trump by them extrapolating your comedy into it
[2:02:54.880 --> 2:02:59.280]  but at a certain point they've taken over control of all language i mean where
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:03.840]  does this end yeah and it's it's so unamerican
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:07.520]  i've i've done a ton of interviews since the speech and every time they get put
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:10.960]  up on youtube that guy loses his account or at the very least they say it
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.040]  violates their conditions so not only am i banned from youtube but you can't
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:18.560]  speak to me and that goes under the auspices of giving
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:22.480]  whatever fascists a platform oh remember what they said about you and i
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:26.880]  last year in paul watson that we're that they're allowed to do violence to us
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:30.160]  people are allowed to promote violence against us and they went on to say you
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:33.680]  may not mention them in a positive light only in a negative talk about a
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.040]  cult and this is crazy
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.560]  it's sort of like when you leave Scientology and what do they call it again
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:43.280]  a squirrel a squirrel is someone who tries to hit
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:48.320]  to you know defame Scientology and then they go and harass these people almost
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:52.480]  to death and call it squirrel busting and that's what the media is like now
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:56.720]  they're squirrel busters who are trying to protect exactly the left of bullying
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:02.000]  people at a billion times the level Scientology ever was accused of
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:06.160]  yeah and it's it's changing the the not just the conversation but the country
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.000]  we've never had moms not speaking to their sons brothers not speaking their
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.760]  sisters none of us liked obama we were sick of him we thought some as a
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:17.600]  community organizer who believed all this leftist propaganda and was making it
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:21.200]  into law like um all the was it prop nine that
[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:24.960]  ruined all the colleges by making everything a feminist action in sports
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.000]  so that pissed us off but we didn't ex our family members we didn't
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:35.120]  smash people with bike locks or or jump in front of traffic
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:40.080]  it's it's it's derangement it's it's satanic you always said it was satanic
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  and it sounded hyperbolic but it's right out of the bible at this point
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.800]  i mean up is down down is up that's satan's number one trick
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:52.000]  i agree we got five minutes left hopefully you'll join us during our 40 hour
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:55.280]  special broadcast kicks off this thursday and live coverage of the vp
[2:04:55.280 --> 2:05:00.160]  debates your take on coven 19 lockdowns your take on trump
[2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:03.360]  and walter reid and just all the craziness the election other big
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:09.200]  things that are front burner right now for gavin mcginnis at censor dot tv
[2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:14.560]  well this this again the left lies about our position and they say oh they
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:18.720]  they think the right thinks that that covet doesn't exist and no one's ever
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:22.640]  died from it and it's all a lie no we think that you've upped the numbers
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:26.320]  because you think it's bad for trump and it means more funding
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:29.680]  so you say 200 i personally think it's more like 100
[2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:35.120]  that's a very bad flu season i'm not denying that this is a crazy virus that
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:39.360]  is the most infectious thing we've ever seen before times 100
[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:42.400]  it's definitely infectious you're right and and they're using it as a power
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:44.960]  grab and then they go oh you say not one person died
[2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:49.040]  you're discrediting everyone's dying we we know exactly they misrepresent
[2:05:49.040 --> 2:05:53.120]  everything the mortality rate is not bad
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:56.880]  now if china ever combines something like wuhan or something with a bad
[2:05:56.880 --> 2:05:59.520]  mortality rate with something of this contagious
[2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:03.120]  they could end america exactly and i don't think they would hesitate to do it
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:05.280]  they don't care about us they don't care about
[2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:08.160]  they're not christian by any means in fact it's illegal
[2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:11.920]  to be christian or religious in china so that could happen but as far as right
[2:06:11.920 --> 2:06:14.640]  now goes we're dealing with a very very contagious thing
[2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:18.240]  that does not have a high mortality rate especially if you're not old and fat or
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:21.920]  have pre-existing conditions so why are we ruining america
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:26.400]  for something that has a what is it if you're young 99.98
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:29.600]  like how about motorcycles every time i get on my bike
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:34.560]  what am i at 99 percent yeah that's an old number i mean now
[2:06:34.560 --> 2:06:37.920]  77 people have died that didn't have co-morbidity in australia
[2:06:37.920 --> 2:06:42.480]  a couple thousand died total but 77 didn't already have cancer heart attack
[2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:45.760]  diabetes overweight now trumpets 74 overweight
[2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:49.680]  you know i mean it could kill him but but again if he has zinc and things it
[2:06:49.680 --> 2:06:53.920]  won't it and isn't it strange too that there's
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:57.520]  a global pandemic italy was screwed france was
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:01.120]  screwed when it hit us while dealing with it they were
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:04.560]  trying to impeach the president they were in chinatown saying it's groovy
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:08.000]  down here come on down and then it blows up and they go look
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:11.600]  what trumpeted look at all these dead i totally agree what do you think happens
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:14.160]  election now the democrats want to extend it out with balance
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:17.200]  how do you see that battle going because i'm i'm i'm guaranteeing you
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:20.880]  this election didn't over in 28 days i call it the 70 you know plus
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:24.800]  79 days of hell after that before the inauguration i think inaugurations
[2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:29.600]  when we get the champagne out the exactly the only question here is
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:33.280]  how long the left will fight and how much the supreme court will have to do
[2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:37.600]  to make them agree that he won he's going to win in the landslide
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.880]  the left is going to completely deny it they're not even going to be mad
[2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:43.680]  on the night of the election they'll go yeah yeah sure where do you see
[2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:46.880]  the mailings the mailings are going to come in and it's not going to get quite
[2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:50.480]  to the level they want it to be they want it to reverse the outcome it's not
[2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:52.960]  so they're going to keep saying oh we're still counting oh and they're going to
[2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:57.600]  delay and delay and delay this is the only question till when i say
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:04.160]  february i say february 10th they finally go all right fine he won
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:07.600]  he's like good can i get to work now i agree with you that because they said
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.080]  until but you notice under the 20th amendment
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:16.480]  january 20th if the president isn't seated the house votes on the new president
[2:08:16.480 --> 2:08:19.680]  it's going to come to that
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:24.560]  well that's like watching a train wreck in slow motion isn't it
[2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:29.040]  it really is and i guarantee you that no matter what happens
[2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:33.200]  for the rest of time the left will deny that trump won this election
[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:38.080]  no matter how much he wins it and all you need to do to verify that is check
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.160]  out 2016 it's been four years they still have not accepted it
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:46.000]  what did we do when obama won because you and i felt the same way and we both
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.120]  went oh well you guys screwed up he's not the messiah but
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:55.120]  let's get to work they are still in 2016 they're still locked in that zone
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:59.680]  you're absolutely right and they they did the whole rush of thing knowingly we
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:02.960]  now know to say it was illegitimate and they did the ukraine thing to do that
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:06.480]  and so they're just kind of even more than ever say it's illegitimate
[2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:10.400]  and podesta is talking about having states secede so we're back to a republican
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:14.240]  yankee having to invade the rest of the country when it tries to divide this is
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:18.960]  history keeps repeating itself and this goes back to the satanic thing
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:22.400]  everything is the opposite whatever they say we're doing they're doing they said
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:26.080]  trump colluded with russia while hillary was colluding with russia
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.520]  they say we're spying while obama was spying
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:32.960]  everything if you want to know what the left is up to just check what they're
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:35.840]  accusing you of and that's their form of a confession
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:38.720]  powerful he helps daily get off my lawn at censor dot tv
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:40.800]  you haven't gotten his thanks for the time we say bye to you during the break

[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.600]  your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:04.400]  in fact it's going to be your only asset the world being built by the
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:07.840]  technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:12.640]  COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:19.600]  of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:23.040]  human life will be impossible to be carried out
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:27.200]  in an original biological way by the year 2050
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:32.000]  this is their stated goal i'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:35.840]  this to you but only by facing the horror and not
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:39.840]  projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:43.440]  you must study their own writings you must face the facts
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:47.360]  and you must come to grips with it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:50.800]  we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:54.480]  and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:58.880]  but the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:03.440]  the general public all over the planet hate bill gates he's the most
[2:11:03.440 --> 2:11:07.200]  unpopular person on earth people know he's not a doctor
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:10.720]  people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:14.480]  his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  polio sterilence and more it's even the associated press
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:22.880]  so now they are beginning to understand that we the people know
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:26.400]  that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:30.960]  billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:34.800]  and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember that
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:38.960]  and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:42.560]  and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:48.640]  they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:55.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:13.760]  what did trump tell you a month ago he said i may not be around too long they
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:17.600]  want to take me out because i'm exposing how these middlemen
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:21.040]  jack up the price three times what it should be
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:24.320]  when trump found out china doesn't even make a lot of money off the pharmaceuticals
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:27.280]  it's the middleman that's why we get ripped off we pay more than anybody in
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:31.280]  the world three times the world average
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:36.160]  double what people pay in europe and trump is cutting out the middleman he
[2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:40.240]  says you're not doing that see all these heritage foundation people always
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:43.280]  talk about free market let the free market but it's not a free
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:47.920]  market when insiders rig deals with an authoritarian superstar
[2:12:47.920 --> 2:12:51.360]  to leverage out competition oh trump's right we're bringing the drug
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:55.040]  manufacturers back here and it's all just simple
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:13:00.560]  things like that but he said they might take me out he he said
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:03.840]  you know the military industrial complex doesn't like me the troops like me
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:06.800]  i never said the generals like me when these generals come out and talk crap
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:12.080]  about trump trump's very pragmatic they always say he's a liar he's a bser
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:15.920]  but notice he actually carries out what he says he'll do or he tries
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:19.040]  even though i disagree with someone what he does at least i know
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:24.480]  how do you think he gets deals with the muslims or with north korea
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:31.280]  because they know he means what he's saying that's so refreshing
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:35.040]  with the clintons and the bushes they're all a bunch of backstabbers
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:41.680]  look at obama he was star struck kadafi was of obama
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:45.760]  and and invested all his money with western companies and gave up his weapons
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:51.200]  and gave up his his his wmds and and said i want to be part of europe i want to
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:55.040]  be with you i want to and they killed his ass
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:59.840]  and put al qaeda in charge to literally murder everybody
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:03.520]  if you know about al qaeda they call black people
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:08.240]  raising heads and they have other racist terms for him in arabic because the
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:13.200]  Arabs used to run the black slave trade and
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:17.680]  they went in there and killed upwards of a hundred thousand black libyans
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:20.960]  oh you're black you want a nice house you're dead you're black you want a
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:24.000]  motorcycle shop you're dead you're black you want a restaurant
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:29.120]  electronic shop you're a black doctor your ass is dead
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:33.120]  you're not supposed to be up here where the Arabs are boy you're dead
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:36.720]  and it's not about me virtue signaling the black people it's about reality
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:39.920]  china's got three million muslims in death camps that are good muslims that
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:42.880]  don't deserve it they got a million christians that are good people and
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:45.200]  buddhas that are good people and that's a fact
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.760]  i was on a big podcast while i was taping it yesterday it's gonna air
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:53.120]  wednesday uh the drinking bus protest are good guys
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:57.520]  black radical black black rival rival coffee company all those guys
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:14:59.840]  and
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:04.240]  i was talking about how they're selling their organs and the guy was search
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:07.680]  engineering and pulling it up in mainstream news they're not even hiding
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:11.520]  it ladies and gentlemen do you think you're safe
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.200]  when hillary goes with obama and kills qaddafi
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:21.360]  and they rape him and then they blow up the economy
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:25.520]  and it's like well it's all right barack obama's black makes me sick
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:28.320]  makes me sick
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:32.800]  i look at what obama did with his policies and it was to
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:38.320]  destroy africa and shut africa down but then he walks around an african dress
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:41.520]  i'm not gonna walk around an african dress and kiss your ass
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:45.280]  you're african i believe you have a right to live though if you treat me with

[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:04.080]  because i know i'm next you better get up off your ass black america
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:08.000]  and africa as well and the truth is you when i say that

[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:15.680]  but
[2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:22.720]  the magnitude of what we're facing
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:28.320]  is so horrible that i i have trouble you have to understand i don't relish
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:31.200]  telling you all the stuff
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:35.920]  that's why i do a sick laugh and all that because that's a coping mechanism
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:42.560]  i i am i i need your prayers because um
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.240]  i'm getting to where i just can't look at these people i'm not as strong as
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:50.480]  president trump and
[2:17:52.160 --> 2:17:56.560]  here's the thing my soul cannot be a party
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:03.280]  to this satanism and i figured it out i figured out the whole thing i mean i
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:06.880]  i know what they're gonna do before they do it and it's just i just
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:11.920]  it's so sad i can hardly even talk at this point
[2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:16.080]  like as soon as i take this information into my cerebral cortex
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:20.400]  and actually try to talk about it now it's just
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:25.280]  it's so horrible
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:33.680]  here's the really bad part i know they're setting up a system where
[2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:37.120]  to for me to survive
[2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:41.680]  and for my family to survive physically there's coming a point sooner rather
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:45.360]  than later where i will have to join with the new
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:48.640]  world order which is exactly what they want
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:51.840]  just to save my family and i'll have to take part
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:55.760]  in promoting the bio weapon release and the extermination of almost everybody
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:59.520]  on earth and i'm obviously i'm gonna say no
[2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:03.200]  i'm not gonna join them because they're so evil and bad and because when i even
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:06.400]  think about it i feel god's presence being removed that's worse than death
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:09.280]  but everybody's gonna die folks and i'm not just
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:12.800]  saying it they admit all of this they're setting up a kill grid they're
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:15.840]  making us obsolete and then i run into people
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:21.280]  that laugh at me on the street they think it's funny it's not funny
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:25.040]  bill gates okay
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:29.200]  i cut a one-minute piece that i don't even know i've i sent it to you guys i
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.520]  don't know if i aired it i cut a one-minute piece
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:36.960]  this morning it's not even an ad we just run these informational pieces
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:40.880]  where i laid it out and and this says it all pretty much right here
[2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:46.240]  for more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:56.240]  control of western medicine now they had a bad name
[2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:59.840]  by the 1920s they started converting over and funding
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:03.760]  other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:08.320]  with their eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:12.320]  handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:16.240]  to bill gates the third his father of course being at a planned parenthood
[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:19.840]  and now he's been able to position himself over almost every
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:23.600]  health department in the world every national health
[2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:27.280]  system bill gates is in control they have spent
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:31.360]  a hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control
[2:20:31.360 --> 2:20:34.320]  what happens to your body and what goes in your body
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:38.000]  this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:42.880]  putting a new type of DNA in your body and all of that's true and it's much
[2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:45.440]  worse than that
[2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:49.600]  the globalists are very very honest about their planetary
[2:20:49.600 --> 2:20:53.840]  goals they want private corporate governance
[2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:58.000]  above nation states above religious institutions
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:02.080]  above the family they want total corporate power
[2:21:02.080 --> 2:21:04.880]  there was a great film back in the early 1970s called
[2:21:04.880 --> 2:21:09.040]  rollerball with james kahn and it's based on a novel
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:14.640]  set in the year 2020 and in the book you have mega corporations that control the
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:18.960]  planet and there are no longer nation states there are only
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:22.880]  cities that are the capitals of the corporations
[2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:27.360]  if you actually read what the most group of the cfr deliral commission say
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:31.520]  in the year 2020 that is their in game that is their goal
[2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:35.040]  so we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here
[2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:38.960]  run by very very very ruthless people to see us as shadow
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:43.360]  they're using covid-19 as their takeover strategy communist china as their model
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:50.320]  we must reject it now hello my name is dr falchi and i've been at the n i
[2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:54.880]  h and cdc for 45 years and i've overseen well
[2:21:54.880 --> 2:21:58.640]  you know the age pandemic and so many other things and
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:03.520]  i take my orders from bill gate doctor bill gates i mean
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:08.000]  he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:11.680]  and he now says you're going to take the shots
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:15.600]  and of course in england they are now saying what i told you
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.600]  you will not be allowed to travel leave your home until you take
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:26.880]  all the shots doctor gates i mean bill gates your owner your master
[2:22:26.880 --> 2:22:30.640]  says you will have to take four to five covid shots a year
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:36.800]  for adult two for baby here baby make much more manageable
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:40.080]  just like bill gates give you polio and vexie
[2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:45.760]  i'm dr falchi reminding you that we owe you
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:48.880]  if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:52.240]  control them to a man and to a woman they believe
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:55.600]  there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they
[2:22:55.600 --> 2:22:59.040]  want to go to a mountaintop or a national park they have to look at us
[2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:02.560]  the common people they have to look at the proletariat they have to look at the
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:05.680]  scum that's why they love the lockdown putting
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:09.280]  mussels on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:13.120]  we can do bankrupting main street bankrupting small
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:15.520]  towns all of it is a vertical integration
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:20.000]  consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.200]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one
[2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:27.200]  ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:30.320]  they used all the entertainment garbage to put us into a trance
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:34.400]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill you know this i know this
[2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:37.760]  it's all out in the open the question is what are we going to do about it
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:41.200]  well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify the
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:45.840]  enemy identify your enemy now
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:53.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:03.440]  all right i'm gonna go to your phone calls i was shown here back live but i
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:06.160]  i've i've gotten myself together and i'm able to talk about this now just
[2:24:06.160 --> 2:24:08.480]  briefly
[2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.880]  i
[2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:15.840]  at one level feel guilty saying these things on air
[2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:18.960]  and then i go back over it and look at it and it's worse than i'm saying and it
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:23.680]  really freaks me out and it also freaks me out because i'll just say it
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:29.840]  my cells that god designed pick up god's command so that that's how it works
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:33.520]  it's how we all are it's how the birds know how to fly down magnetic lines
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:36.960]  3 000 miles it's how you know butterflies i mean we're all connected to the
[2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:40.640]  universe that god created it's electrical charge is spiritual
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:45.040]  they now mathematically proven and with different spectrometers picked up this
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:47.840]  dark matter that's there that's five times more powerful
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:51.920]  at one level than our dimension we are held in this place
[2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:55.680]  and as a man
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.160]  my brain is now
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:06.720]  shifting out of talk into action i know yours is as well
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:09.440]  we're under assault
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:12.160]  and
[2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:18.080]  they give us all these reasons to kill each other over what color we are and if
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:20.800]  some white crazy person's trying to kill you because you're black
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:24.000]  that's a real thing or you're white some crazy black person's trying to kill you
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.800]  that's real but at the end of the day it's been manufactured
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:34.560]  it's been force-fed it's been generated this has been done by design the
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:40.080]  the flames have been more than fed they've been lit
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:43.440]  they're not just fanning something they started this
[2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:45.760]  and
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:51.360]  they are so threatened by the christian ethos that unifies us together
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:54.240]  that's why they're killing christianity because it's an operating system
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:59.600]  whether you believe in christ or not it's an operating system is
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:05.760]  diametrically opposed to their satanic order
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:08.320]  and so
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:16.400]  let me just say this and i'll go to your calls
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:21.680]  we are facing a scientific revolution
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.440]  now in the globalist say trust science they don't own science they don't
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:28.160]  control science they're trying to control it
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:31.360]  most of what they say is a lie scientifically they're saying we're
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:36.160]  the technocrats we're the high priest you do what we say
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:40.400]  and what they're building is a system that makes you live shorter lives
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:45.760]  or painful lives and finally phases you out because they know not to take on
[2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:49.200]  humans in a big upfront attack we'll get
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:52.880]  together and we'll kick some ass so they do it with this softening up
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:57.040]  everything they do and that's why as a strategist as a historian as a
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:00.720]  researcher i've never seen flying saucers
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:05.840]  i've never seen a lizard man all i do is two plus two and the only
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:09.120]  equation that makes sense is man this ain't human
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:14.160]  this isn't for this is bad this doesn't even help the so-called ruling class
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:17.200]  and the ruling class says oh we're about to give our bodies up
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:22.320]  and merge with a freaking toaster they've been deceived
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:29.360]  and so i don't know what it is okay i just know the bible most
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:34.960]  accurately describes it and it's bad man it's bad and it's an alien and it's
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:40.560]  running the show on this planet because we've got free will we rejected god
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:44.720]  and god is sending a transmission to us that'll get us out of it
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:48.320]  people like jones i'm on these shows they go i just think you were crazy but
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:52.080]  i heard you 20 years ago say they'll be face scanning you to go into shops
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:55.360]  and that they'll use a bio weapon to do it how'd you know
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:01.200]  hell the bible said it 2000 years ago stop giving me credit
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:06.400]  and then i see everybody that doesn't think long term
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:09.920]  and they only look one step at a time
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:14.160]  they're so selfish they just want to get to store they let themselves be face
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:16.960]  scanned to see if they're wearing a mask it's really just training you to be
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:20.480]  face scan to be able to buy and sell period
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:23.840]  and all the tyranny that comes with that and i sit there and i try to explain
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:27.840]  this to people that i've been good to that i've taken care of
[2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:32.400]  and they have no respect for me but you know why
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:39.120]  because they have no respect for themselves
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.440]  and because it's mammals we've been communially
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:51.840]  working together at the village at the farm level or at the fisher level
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:55.520]  and so all our genetic memory is on average getting along with everybody
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:28:58.720]  and only if the big general gets up or the tribal chief and says hey we got a
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:02.080]  war the enemy's coming and he's the chief because he doesn't lie to us and
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:07.040]  we know he's got good ideas and he knows things before we know him
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:10.720]  but what when you're led by a bad chief what does that mean and we're led by bad
[2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:14.720]  people and so our compliance is death
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:17.840]  and i want to explain to the police officers and the bureaucrats
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:22.320]  and the intelligence and agencies and the corporate people and all of you
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:26.160]  you're not part of the establishment
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:31.920]  you're not part of the winning team serving the new order you are
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:36.000]  selling out your own family and friends to live a day longer yourself
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:38.640]  when you're we're going to lose everything because of that attitude
[2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:46.400]  what did Winston Churchill say he said appeasement is
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:54.560]  feeding the alligator your friends and family hoping it eats you last
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:57.440]  instead of when the alligator comes climbing up
[2:29:57.440 --> 2:30:01.360]  we're tough we've got clubs we've got sticks
[2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:06.080]  you think the alligator climbs out to eat you or the crocodile
[2:30:06.080 --> 2:30:10.800]  when he sees you're aggressive no he knows oh those people are unified but if
[2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:14.400]  an alligator or crocodile saw five or six humans look at scared running from
[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:20.480]  it he'll attack because he knows your cowards and all these people think
[2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:24.080]  running i mean i can tell you how many grown men i know there it is appeasement
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:30.160]  is feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you fast
[2:30:30.160 --> 2:30:39.120]  how many grown men i know that when a dog on a hiking bike trail comes up to be
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:42.640]  dominant to them i don't care if it's a german shepherd a pit bull what it is
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:45.840]  and they end up going the other side of the deal and they end up acting like
[2:30:45.840 --> 2:30:48.880]  they're scared the dog wants to get them when somebody's got their pit bull or
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:51.520]  something and comes at me i start walking towards it
[2:30:51.520 --> 2:30:54.640]  and the dog does the thing i'll say i'll beat your ass you don't get your damn
[2:30:54.640 --> 2:30:57.280]  dog out of the way a couple times of it i've kicked that dog
[2:30:57.280 --> 2:31:01.440]  upside the head but see that's not about acting tough it's what having my
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:05.040]  instincts honed and ready but those dogs know now those dogs they go to the
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:08.720]  other side when i'm and i'm not bowing up down the hiking bike trail
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:12.000]  but they they assess you spiritually they look at you and they say
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:15.600]  how's that person acting and i just ever so slightly start going towards that
[2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:19.360]  dog ever so slightly and they go away instead of
[2:31:19.360 --> 2:31:22.960]  them coming up to me it's not about i'm the big man and the pit bull scared of
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:26.880]  me or the german shepherd scared of me my instincts are lined up and somebody's
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:29.920]  got an attack dog there i'm not gonna act like prey
[2:31:29.920 --> 2:31:35.280]  i'm not the prey i'm the gorilla i'll kill you
[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:42.800]  understand
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:47.360]  and it's good that i'll kill you it's not because i'm looking for trouble
[2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:50.720]  it's because i'm not getting pushed around and all these men i know that
[2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:53.920]  act big and powerful and tough they don't do anything for their
[2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:57.440]  communities anything for their societies and they've rolled over to evil
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:02.000]  and we're now all in grave danger because of it
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:06.240]  well i pledge to you more action
[2:32:06.240 --> 2:32:09.920]  let's talk a little more action to quote elvis because that's the season we're
[2:32:09.920 --> 2:32:13.600]  going into nothing offensive nothing final at this point
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:18.480]  but i'll tell you they're coming to your house with force inoculation soon
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:21.200]  they're coming with their mark of the beast they're coming with their nano
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:25.680]  tech they've said they are and so i'd be a liar
[2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:30.960]  if i didn't tell you to start getting ready
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:35.600]  we're not gonna run and get out of this we're gonna have to fight
[2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:39.680]  they're putting in their 5g for their robot cars amazon's taking over awesome
[2:32:39.680 --> 2:32:43.120]  with google with by next year they're gonna have drones flying in the skies
[2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:46.400]  in robot cars up and down the streets they've announced
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:50.320]  we're being made obsolete and all you gotta do is say i don't buy products from
[2:32:50.320 --> 2:32:53.920]  something wasn't driven by a human i don't go to restaurants where
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:32:57.280]  robots serve me oh but see when you when you go to
[2:32:57.280 --> 2:33:00.160]  those you're gonna get social credits they're already saying they're gonna pay
[2:33:00.160 --> 2:33:05.040]  you to go to robot shops they're gonna pay you to buy robot goods
[2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:08.320]  and you know what if we sit there and do that we deserve it but here's the thing
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:12.880]  the sheeple are followers for a reason it's up to us the true leaders
[2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:17.760]  not guys posing like they're alpha males but it's up to us that are alpha males
[2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:24.160]  to not just lead not just fight but die if need be with pleasure to defeat this
[2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:27.360]  and so i'm just telling you we've gone to a whole new level you think i'm excited
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:31.200]  i've been proven right i'm physically ill

[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:49.600]  remember the global lock down for witnessing the black lives matter
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:54.160]  anti-for-riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:59.680]  directed by a handful of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:05.440]  Jeff Bezos of course Tim Cook and others they set up there with their
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:09.360]  trillions of dollars they control in their company so they're hundreds of
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:14.160]  billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:18.720]  to create an artificial revolution against local government and police
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:22.720]  and the mayors are again they're playing their political game try to trigger
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:25.840]  the complete breakdown of the united states in western europe
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:29.680]  show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:32.880]  that's why i'm so angry at these globalists because when you're looking
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:35.600]  at them they're the ones that sit in their councils
[2:35:35.600 --> 2:35:38.240]  and have decided to run these plans against us
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:42.080]  they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's us
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:45.120]  or them period
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:50.720]  i don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election but i need to
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:53.360]  be honest with everybody the democrats and their
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:57.360]  deep state controllers communist chinese have come out and said they're
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:00.320]  going to contest the election they know that trumps gonna win a landslide
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:03.040]  and the destabilization that that's going to cause
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:06.480]  is going to further destroy the markets and the economy
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:09.840]  and going into the future even if trump is able to prove that he's won the
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:12.960]  election the democrats have said they're going to
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:18.320]  break away politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:22.000]  and basically use that as a pretext to sabotage
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:26.720]  the republic even more so until this cancer is rooted out
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:30.240]  until these criminals that work with foreign governments they're trying to
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:33.920]  basically destroy the country are punished and removed it's just going to
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:37.680]  continue to happen and so that's the big problem here
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:41.680]  that is that we have systemic dug in corruption by people that hate the
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:44.720]  country's very existence
[2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:49.600]  the future isn't coming it's here and in the future
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:55.520]  keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity your very essence is
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:36:59.120]  going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:03.280]  only asset the world being built by the technocrats
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:08.240]  and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:12.880]  is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:19.360]  into total and complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:23.120]  carried out in an original biological way by the
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:27.680]  year 2050 this is their stated goal i'm sorry to
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:31.040]  have to report horrifying things like this to you but only
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:35.840]  by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:39.360]  we turn this around you must study their own writings
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:42.720]  you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:46.560]  you're all being incrementally destroyed
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:57.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:06.480]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.400]  sooner or later gonna cut you down you can run on
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:15.440]  for a long time run on for a long time
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:19.120]  run on for a long time sooner or later
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:25.520]  gonna cut you down sooner or later gonna cut you down
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  We gotta make sure we keep our powder dry.
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:32.520]  Make sure we cut them down, we cut down the big lens.
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:37.520]  That powder, tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  Something bigger than you Bill Gates in this universe.
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:44.520]  You know it, you're not God.
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:53.520]  Alright, we're gonna go to Alex, and Sweden, Michael, and Australia, many others.
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:56.520]  But since I mentioned it, here's the article, infowars.com.
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  Everybody can see this coming.
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:01.520]  New technology refuses entrance to shops if you're not wearing a mask.
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  All over the world, it scans to make sure there's a mask.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:08.520]  It's really getting you ready for the facial identification for the Global Social Credit Score,
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:11.520]  and the company's selling it, admit that.
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:15.520]  Again, there's just all a pre-design rollout on record.
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:22.520]  And now they're saying forced inoculations coming as early as Christmas.
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  Sandy Claus ain't coming with presents.
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  He's coming with coal.
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:34.520]  Go ahead and play it with audio, it's both in Taiwanese and in English, here it is.
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:41.520]  I mean, you talk about dystopic.
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:45.520]  And this is training everyone and the children in just, in a total cult,
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:48.520]  and now it's gonna be, do you have your shots to travel?
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:49.520]  They now admit it.
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:51.520]  We told you that eight months ago, now it's all admitted,
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:54.520]  because they already set it in the rock of fire.
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:58.520]  And now it's gonna be, do you have your shots to travel?
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:39:59.520]  They now admit it.
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:04.520]  We told you that eight months ago, now it's all admitted, because they already set it in the Rockefeller plan,
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:08.520]  and the damn Bill Gates plan.
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  But I sit there and I talk to people I know, bankers and lawyers and people that are successful folks,
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:16.520]  and they look at you like you're dumb.
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:20.520]  They go, you don't know that type of stuff, Alex.
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:22.520]  And these people know I'm successful.
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  The thing is they don't even, they don't respect themselves.
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:29.520]  They think it's funny that something dystopics happening.
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:31.520]  And I describe them as the dodo bird.
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:35.520]  Galapagos Island, these big fat juicy birds, big beaks.
[2:40:35.520 --> 2:40:37.520]  They look, their bodies are like turkeys.
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  They had big heads.
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:41.520]  And they said one of them could feed 10 soldiers.
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:43.520]  They described it as a Christmas turkey.
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:47.520]  But they'd never been around killers.
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:51.520]  They'd never been around coyotes or wolves or anything else.
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:41:03.520]  And so you'd walk over and club one in the head and the others would just sit there.
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:06.520]  Because they had no ancestral memory.
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:08.520]  You know instincts are ancestral.
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:12.520]  And so I asked myself, why does the public not have ancestral memories?
[2:41:12.520 --> 2:41:17.520]  I mean, I see stuff going on and literally my instincts are like, whoa.
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:21.520]  I mean, nobody ever had to tell me when I was a little kid not to run from a dog.
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:24.520]  They'd be like dogs jump out of the hill, come running up.
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:25.520]  Other kids would run.
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  The dogs would chase them, bite them.
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  Everybody would say, hey, little kid, you didn't run from the dogs.
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:29.520]  They ran right around you.
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:31.520]  Well, I knew you didn't run from dogs.
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:32.520]  Somebody had to tell me that.
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:35.520]  I mean, why don't people have the download, man?
[2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:36.520]  I want you to have the download.
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:38.520]  I know our audience has the download.
[2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:40.520]  But I'm saying the public's missing it.
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  And it's dangerous, folks.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:47.520]  All right, the good news is I have really good news and I'll go to your calls.
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:49.520]  Really good news to announce here.
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:53.520]  I'll be leaving the Great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6.30 p.m.
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  Feeling really good.
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:55.520]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:57.520]  Don't let it dominate your life.
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  We have developed on the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge.
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:03.520]  I feel better than I did 20 years ago.
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  So he probably got a regular cold, a regular flu.
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:09.520]  Maybe it is the real COVID nine out of 10 times the test or fake,
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:10.520]  the one he was the manager.
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:13.520]  We now know it's the worst, most false positive there is out there.
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:19.520]  And I would show her said it, you know, Friday and he said it on the weekend shows.
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:23.520]  He said, rightfully, if Trump goes this route, he'll teach us not to be scared.
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  And this is shows.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  He's a good guy and he's doing it.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:28.520]  Trump comes through again.
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  Yeah, baby.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:32.520]  All right, I'm going to shut up now.
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:35.520]  All right, let's go to Michael in Australia, then Alex and sweet Michael.
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:37.520]  Thanks for holding 17 minutes.
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:39.520]  Welcome to your waves, my friend.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:40.520]  Hi, Alex.
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:42.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:44.520]  Hi, how are you?
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:45.520]  I'm pretty freaked out, brother.
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:46.520]  I know it's the middle of the night.
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:49.520]  How are you over there in beautiful Australia?
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:51.520]  Oh, pretty good.
[2:42:51.520 --> 2:42:56.520]  Right next to Victoria here, though, where it's just a nightmare.
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:59.520]  What's going on over there?
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:05.520]  You are the model of UN martial law with your communist, what, the mayor's and governor.
[2:43:05.520 --> 2:43:07.520]  Yeah.
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:14.520]  It's, you know, that they sold out to China, the state of Victoria last few years.
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:18.520]  All the infrastructure is now owned by China over there.
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:23.520]  Obviously, they're taking their orders directly from the Communist Party.
[2:43:23.520 --> 2:43:25.520]  It's a nightmare.
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:26.520]  It really is.
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:32.520]  And people don't understand how important people like you are and Donald Trump is.
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:36.520]  Brother, people like you, you're up at four in the morning or whatever it is where you're at.
[2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:38.520]  And you got four time zones.
[2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:39.520]  You care.
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:40.520]  It's normal.
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:44.520]  What happened to the instinct of not letting this happen?
[2:43:44.520 --> 2:43:46.520]  Well, look, I don't know.
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:50.520]  But look, I've got a theory here about Trump and his COVID.
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:52.520]  I saw that tweet.
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:54.520]  Great that he's at a hospital.
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:44:02.520]  But everyone was saying that Joe Biden was going to get a COVID diagnosis and dodge the first debate.
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:06.520]  That didn't happen, but what happened now?
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:08.520]  Trump beat him to the punch.
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:13.520]  And if Biden comes out and says, I've got COVID now, he will just look stupid.
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:19.520]  So it's another, whatever happened, but Donald Trump does it again, I think.
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:31.520]  And people just can't understand how people can't see what he's trying to do.
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:34.520]  Thank God for people like you.
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:35.520]  Brother, thank God for you.
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:37.520]  We're like on the same lifeboat together.
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:40.520]  Look, I like Trump, but he is a wild man.
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:44.520]  And I believe that doctor when he said Trump demanded all the experimental treatments.
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:47.520]  See, Trump's, he's good, but that's just crazy.
[2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  And I just hope because they're still going to give it to another five days that doesn't hurt him, you know.
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:45:07.520]  Well, I mean, who knows, but right here right now in Australia, people just, the people that support what's going on in Victoria.
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:12.520]  I have family that comes to my house in a damn mask.
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:18.520]  And I show them statistics that it's not as bad as even the flu and that most of the numbers are, and they won't listen.
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:20.520]  They just are in a damn trance.
[2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:23.520]  And I explain the lockdown is already killing the third world.
[2:45:23.520 --> 2:45:24.520]  They don't care.
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:26.520]  And it's like, these used to be smart people.
[2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:30.520]  How do we break them out of the trance?
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:32.520]  It's a virtual thing.
[2:45:32.520 --> 2:45:35.520]  It's narcissistic.
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:37.520]  We're in this consumer sort of.
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.520]  Exactly.
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:44.520]  They love wearing it because they're the heroes.
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:51.520]  And it's all they've got, I mean, because we're so disempowered that the only power that we've got is.
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:52.520]  Exactly.
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:55.520]  Men are told they're bad and they're no different, you know, this and that than women.
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:45:57.520]  And so men grow beards because that's something we can do.
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:45:59.520]  And people are feeling disempowered.
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:01.520]  So they feel like, hell, I'll go ahead and Stockholm syndrome.
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:02.520]  You're very smart, smarter than I am.
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:03.520]  That's it.
[2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:09.520]  They wear the mask because at least that makes them think they're doing something good, which is how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:11.520]  I don't know who first said that, but it's damn true.
[2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:12.520]  Thank you, sir.
[2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:14.520]  Because they get good people to do bad things.
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:16.520]  The name of something good.
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:19.520]  And it's just the average Nazi thought they were good.
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:21.520]  They didn't know they were evil.
[2:46:21.520 --> 2:46:23.520]  The average communist believes in it.
[2:46:23.520 --> 2:46:24.520]  Alex in Sweden.
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:26.520]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:27.520]  Hello.
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:28.520]  Can you hear me?
[2:46:28.520 --> 2:46:29.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:30.520]  Welcome and thank you.
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:31.520]  Yeah.
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:36.520]  I want to start because I don't know if I'm ever going to go through you again.
[2:46:36.520 --> 2:46:40.520]  You actually started the truth movement in Sweden 2004.
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:46.520]  There was a guy called Michael Kung Fu who saw your movie 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:49.520]  And he created a website who became a big movement.
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:54.520]  And it was, we had a whole establishment after us, the media and everything.
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:59.520]  And it took them like nine years to crush it like after a long battle, you know.
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:01.520]  And let me guess, I was aware of the movement.
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:04.520]  Did it create some babies of its own though, right?
[2:47:04.520 --> 2:47:05.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:07.520]  It's like now it's springing up again.
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:12.520]  Before the coronavirus even came up, people started getting together and doing something
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:13.520]  again.
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:15.520]  So I guess people were feeling or something was going on.
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:18.520]  I'm going to hold you over, but it's not about me getting the attention.
[2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:22.520]  It's about the audience that supported all the guests and as a family.
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:27.520]  I've had Bolsonaro's son who's a member of Congress there and they've invited me down
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:28.520]  to meet with the president.
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:29.520]  I just haven't been able to go.
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:30.520]  I want to go.
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:32.520]  They've got me detained here basically over the fight.
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:36.520]  They said, no, you were the grassroots matrix that launched Bolsonaro.
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:39.520]  And I've had at least Bolsonaro is nice to me.
[2:47:39.520 --> 2:47:41.520]  You know, people like Nigel Farage.
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:42.520]  I like Nigel.
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:44.520]  He's come on probably 50 times.
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:45.520]  He called me last year.
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:49.520]  Last time I talked to him, he wanted to talk about something off record, but Nigel Farage
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:51.520]  is embarrassed to come on my show.
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.520]  Even though he admitted years ago that their movement didn't take off in England until
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:47:58.520]  Info Wars.
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.520]  And so we, we had the audience there and it happened.
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  And so, but it's not about me.
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  It's not about, oh, oh, Nigel Farage is scared to come on my show.
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:07.520]  This media matters.
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:08.520]  Criticizes him.
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:09.520]  I don't need him on my show.
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:13.520]  The point is, is that you literally are a comrade with somebody.
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:17.520]  You help them, you fight with them and then they care what media matters says.
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:19.520]  I don't care about him coming on the show.
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  I just care that he cares that he'll be criticized coming on.
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:25.520]  My God is the criticism you want.
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  The people see that.
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:28.520]  I'm going to come right back to you, Alex.
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:31.520]  But yeah, no, Info Wars launched 1776 worldwide.
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:35.520]  This audience, you did it all, folks.
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:39.520]  You noticed that over and over again, the United Nations are supposed controllers
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:43.520]  and bosses, the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:47.520]  out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:49.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:51.520]  You get a lot of sunlight.
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:56.520]  It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost impossible to get viral
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:48:58.520]  infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:03.520]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the blues and these colds in
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:06.520]  the winter because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  Now, I pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:14.520]  hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C.
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:23.520]  He should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:27.520]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:31.520]  and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  warning the public to get their vitamins.
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:27.520]  Thank you.
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  Last chance to get it, infowarstore.com.

[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:09.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:17.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:43.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:50.520]  And that's what the election is because here's the headline from CNBC.
[3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:56.520]  Trump says he will leave Walter Reed Hospital on Monday.
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:15.520]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:27.520]  Trump says he will be discharged later today.
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:31.520]  On the news that Trump's getting out of the hospital.
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:46.520]  Now as we know, Trump did a lousy job with that debate last week.
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:49.520]  So that's not the news anymore.
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:53.520]  The news was he went to the hospital for COVID.
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  So now it's going on.
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:58.520]  Now the markets are going up because they say he's out.
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:09.520]  But again, to me, playing the Trump card, he goes on to say,
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:13.520]  don't be afraid of COVID.
[3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:17.520]  And that's what this is all about.
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:22.520]  You go back to one of our other trends journal covers
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:31.520]  and it was Scaredy Cat World, people having masks on themselves.
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:35.520]  Trump is going to play this card.
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:38.520]  It's the only card that he has to play.
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:42.520]  So let's look at the swing states.
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:44.520]  A place called Michigan.
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:46.520]  Oh, they locked it down even more, didn't they?
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  Oh, and what happened?
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:52.520]  The state court, Supreme Court ruled against witless?
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:54.520]  Or is it witmere?
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:56.520]  Yeah, I think it's witless witmere.
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:59.520]  There you go, Scaredy Cat Planet.
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  Oh, by the way, keep that up there a minute.
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:03.520]  You see that mask?
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:09.520]  That's the mask when you see the peasants in China wearing all over the place.
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:13.520]  And they wear those masks because of the filthy air pollution.
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:18.520]  And when you saw President Xi of China when the COVID war broke out,
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:22.520]  he was wearing that kind of mask too.
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:28.520]  But then you come to America, the land of the cowards.
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:31.520]  What kind of masks are they wearing?
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:34.520]  Well, we wear fashion masks.
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  Yes, we've been emasculated.
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:41.520]  So we'll have all these masks on that say things.
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:46.520]  And that will make me look like, oh, I'm beautiful.
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:48.520]  I'm handsome.
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:50.520]  I'm so strong.
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:52.520]  I'm a believer.
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  Now all these clown masks they wear.
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:12:59.520]  They're not just common masks anymore.
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:04.520]  They're just low-life masks that low-lives wear.
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:06.520]  Look at it.
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:09.520]  What self-respecting human being would do this?
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:14.520]  Well, the country is full of people without that self-respect.
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:16.520]  Look at them all.
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:22.520]  Oh, the actors and the actresses and all the people playing their pots.
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  They all wear these stupid masks that are worthless.
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:30.520]  And again, we've been writing the data in the Trends Journal.
[3:13:30.520 --> 3:13:32.520]  We're not making it up.
[3:13:32.520 --> 3:13:39.520]  You go back to the World Health Organization, Sentence of Disease Control and Prevention.
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:43.520]  You go back to the New England Journal of Medicine and that fake Fauci.
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  Yeah, there you go. How beautiful.
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:48.520]  Oh, how lovely and glamorous you look.
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:51.520]  Oh, yeah, you take off them glasses and that thing.
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  Model of what was behind them.
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:56.520]  Well, good thing you had that on.
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:13:58.520]  You fooled me.
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:04.520]  So the masks are, again, they all said that the masks didn't do.
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  They weren't helping against stopping this.
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:13.520]  And the only people that should be wearing them are people that are very ill and they should be home.
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:17.520]  So going back to the presidential reality show,
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  Trump played the card, the Trump card that we said he was going to play.
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:28.520]  Don't be afraid of COVID.
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:30.520]  Cannot be clearer.
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:32.520]  Who else is saying that?
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:33.520]  You got to watch out.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  Be afraid.
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:38.520]  Look how they're destroying little kids.
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:49.520]  You see them getting online to go into kindergarten with masks on and some jerk with a shield and a mask playing power trip.
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:52.520]  Taking their temperature.
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:58.520]  And again, as Alex and you've been pointing out everybody on on on.
[3:14:58.520 --> 3:15:02.520]  Info wars, this temperature checks mean nothing.
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:07.520]  You can have a cold and they'll show you that you got, you know, means nothing.
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  The tests, the COVID tests useless.
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  But they're locking down more of the global economy.
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:20.520]  Hey, Florida opened up.
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:24.520]  That's and what's the case load in Florida?
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:26.520]  How many how many people died in Florida?
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  I'm going to guess.
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:28.520]  All right.
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:32.520]  I don't know offhand, but I'm going to guess around 15,000.
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:34.520]  But they're totally opened up now.
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:35.520]  Look at that.
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:36.520]  Look at that.
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  Look at these people.
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:40.520]  Look what they're doing to these kids.
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:41.520]  New abnormal.
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:43.520]  No hugging.
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  No kissing.
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:46.520]  No dancing.
[3:15:46.520 --> 3:15:48.520]  No singing.
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:50.520]  So there you go.
[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:52.520]  They got 14,000 something deaths.
[3:15:52.520 --> 3:15:53.520]  Right.
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:56.520]  25.5 million people.
[3:15:56.520 --> 3:15:57.520]  Excuse me.
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:15:59.520]  21.5 million.
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:02.520]  March, April, May, June, July, August, September.
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:04.520]  And now we're in October.
[3:16:04.520 --> 3:16:07.520]  New York locked down and they hated that guy.
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:11.520]  The governor there because he wouldn't go along with this stuff.
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:16.520]  And all the media went after him with the cases rising, cases rising.
[3:16:16.520 --> 3:16:19.520]  How many died in New York state?
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:22.520]  It's over 33,000.
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:25.520]  So double the amount died in New York state.
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:28.520]  And New York state has 19 and a half million.
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:32.520]  And we're still locked down for all intents and purposes.
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:35.520]  And now they're going to lock down more.
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:36.520]  That's right.
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:38.520]  That's right.
[3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:42.520]  New York City is dead town.
[3:16:42.520 --> 3:16:45.520]  New York City is no town.
[3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:47.520]  Homeless town.
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:48.520]  Yeah.
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:51.520]  And they're going to lock it down more.
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:54.520]  We are going into the greatest depression.
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  This is a time to prepare, to prevail.
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:06.520]  And what they sell on info was a very important products for you.
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:12.520]  As well as the trends journal to help you prepare for what's coming up.
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:15.520]  It's a time to unite.
[3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:26.520]  Because if we don't unite and fight for our freedom, we're going to die in the COVID war that they launched.
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:30.520]  So people fight people from a disease.
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:31.520]  Who's it killing?
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:33.520]  You know who.
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:35.520]  We're going to be back in a few.
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:39.520]  Stay tuned.
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:43.520]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:46.520]  They give you about freedoms by increments.
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:49.520]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time.
[3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:52.520]  And then the restrictions will be released.
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.520]  But they're not.
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:57.520]  That for significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[3:17:57.520 --> 3:18:00.520]  They will then slightly release it a little bit.
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:02.520]  Only tighten it down even more later.
[3:18:02.520 --> 3:18:08.520]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:11.520]  This is the most common way that the Salatarians take over.
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:14.520]  But there then becomes a point where the public wakes up.
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:20.520]  Under the incrementalism, it starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down.
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:26.520]  And you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months that you saw in the previous ten years.
[3:18:26.520 --> 3:18:29.520]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:34.520]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:38.520]  that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:06.520]  And good old fashioned stupidity.
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:09.520]  No more pesky law and order.
[3:19:09.520 --> 3:19:12.520]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:18.520]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:22.520]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bail include rolling blackouts,
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:39.520]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:19:39.520 --> 3:19:42.520]  The planets have aligned globally.
[3:19:42.520 --> 3:19:43.520]  They've aligned nationally.
[3:19:43.520 --> 3:19:48.520]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly spiritually.
[3:19:48.520 --> 3:19:55.520]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[3:19:55.520 --> 3:20:01.520]  So that's why big tech control by the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down,
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:07.520]  isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone and try to control every aspect of our lives,
[3:20:07.520 --> 3:20:13.520]  literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[3:20:13.520 --> 3:20:19.520]  not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:25.520]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:32.520]  and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:34.520]  This is their plan.
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:50.520]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[3:21:04.520 --> 3:21:11.520]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:21:11.520 --> 3:21:24.520]  Great to be here.
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:27.520]  And again, do what you can to support Infoways.
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  We're going to fight for our lives here.
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:32.520]  This is unprecedented in world history.
[3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:35.520]  I mean, freedom has been robbed from us.
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.520]  And remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate tireless minority.
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:46.520]  Kenan's setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men's and Samuel Adams.
[3:21:46.520 --> 3:21:50.520]  And most people don't want to fight.
[3:21:50.520 --> 3:21:54.520]  One of our trends journals a weekly, it goes out tomorrow.
[3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:56.520]  Doing some editing now.
[3:21:56.520 --> 3:22:01.520]  And one of the stories is give me liberty or give me mass.
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  And this is from the Washington Post.
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:07.520]  And they did this census.
[3:22:07.520 --> 3:22:20.520]  And it comes down to over 70% of Americans are fine with giving up significant freedoms in order to fight the coronavirus.
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  70% are willing to give up their freedom.
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:30.520]  And you read this thing, it's one after another.
[3:22:30.520 --> 3:22:33.520]  And this is unprecedented.
[3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:36.520]  Look what they're doing.
[3:22:36.520 --> 3:22:39.520]  They lock you down.
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:43.520]  And it doesn't work.
[3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:45.520]  Country after country, they're locked down.
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:49.520]  Now they're getting second wave of cases.
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:54.520]  They're getting a second wave of cases because they're doing more testing.
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:23:05.520]  But what they never write about, and it was in Yahoo this past week, they had the worst 10 states in America.
[3:23:05.520 --> 3:23:10.520]  And they had cases, cases, cases for each one.
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:16.520]  But they never had the amount of new deaths.
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:24.520]  And when you go and look up the new death state, there are nothing in terms of who's really dying.
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:25.520]  That's it.
[3:23:25.520 --> 3:23:28.520]  Go scroll down to that and you'll see down the bottom.
[3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:34.520]  They have all the cases, place after place, state after state, in Alabama.
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:36.520]  All right, keep going down.
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  Keep going, keep it going.
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:40.520]  All right, now stop there.
[3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:42.520]  I can't read this far, but what do they say there?
[3:23:42.520 --> 3:23:43.520]  How many cases?
[3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:44.520]  Go back up.
[3:23:44.520 --> 3:23:47.520]  What do they got?
[3:23:47.520 --> 3:23:54.520]  94 infection rate, positive tests rate, 12.6%.
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:58.520]  New cases on the top, 1,025 residents.
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:01.520]  But how many people died?
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:04.520]  And it's one after another.
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:09.520]  And then you go look up and see how many people died in Alabama and Nebraska and these other places.
[3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  It's zero.
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:16.520]  It's at the highest three, Oklahoma, one after another.
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:22.520]  So all they do is they're talking about cases, but they're not talking about deaths.
[3:24:22.520 --> 3:24:28.520]  So they got everybody freaked out about cases with tests that have been proven to be inaccurate.
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:36.520]  And as Trump said, don't be afraid of COVID.
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:38.520]  There you go.
[3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:44.520]  Here, this is from today's financial times.
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  Where are you?
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:46.520]  Where are you?
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:47.520]  I just had you.
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:48.520]  Is that you over here?
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:49.520]  No, it's not there.
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:51.520]  Is it over here?
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:53.520]  Yep, here it is.
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:54.520]  Here we go.
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:58.520]  Look at that scary headline.
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:04.520]  Second wave jolts Central Europe.
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:09.520]  Three months on the picture looks far darker.
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  On Friday, the 10.7 million strong Central European nation, the Czech Republic, recorded 3,792 new cases.
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:25.520]  The highest daily figure.
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:35.520]  More than two thirds of the 80,605 Czechs confirmed to have caught the virus have done so in the past month alone.
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:40.520]  Last Wednesday, the government reintroduced a state of emergency.
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:44.520]  It doesn't say how many died.
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:49.520]  And then you go down to read the article more.
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:26:05.520]  The second wave looks more threatening, like the Czechs, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania have in the past four days all reported their highest case loads since the start of the pandemic.
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:19.520]  Well, they're reporting their highest case loads since the start of the pandemic, because now they're doing the testing, particularly with guys and young people, men and women going back to school.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:22.520]  So now keep reading this.
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  Higher rates of testing mean the number of cases reported now is not directly comparable to the first wave.
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:35.520]  No.
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:37.520]  Why don't you tell me that?
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:41.520]  And then the next line right after that.
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  Not comparable to the first wave.
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:48.520]  Deaths have also remained low.
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:53.520]  Deaths have also remained low.
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  Got it?
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:55.520]  No.
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:57.520]  We're not going to get it.
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:03.520]  We're just a bunch of jerks, we march to the orders of whoever leads us.
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:06.520]  All the facts are right there.
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:08.520]  This is not a pandemic.
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:15.520]  They changed that definition to keep selling fear.
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:18.520]  Again, look who's dying.
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:24.520]  Elderly people that, you know, I don't want to scare anybody.
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:30.520]  But when you get into your 80s, you know, your chance to live in longer is short.
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:35.520]  What's the average death rate in America about 78 years old?
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:36.520]  Look at that clown.
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:37.520]  Look at that jerk.
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:38.520]  That arrogant.
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:39.520]  Yeah, bye-bye.
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  Yeah.
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:50.520]  Anyway, this is the guy that took Cuomo, took the people out of hospitals that were elderly and put them into nursing homes.
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:53.520]  This is a fact.
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:27:55.520]  And they're the ones that die the most.
[3:27:55.520 --> 3:27:57.520]  Elderly people in nursing homes.
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:01.520]  You go back to when they started selling the COVID war.
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  Where did it happen?
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  State of Washington.
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:06.520]  Yeah, where?
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:07.520]  Kirkland, Washington.
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:10.520]  What was going on in Kirkland?
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:14.520]  People from nursing homes were dying.
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:21.520]  All over the world, it's elderly people, people in nursing homes.
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:32.520]  And as the CDC numbers show, people with 2.6 preexisting chronic conditions.
[3:28:32.520 --> 3:28:34.520]  But yet they're locking down everything.
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:40.520]  Now going back to where I started before with the markets.
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:47.520]  Just before we came on the air, the markets are up in the United States almost 470 points.
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:29:00.520]  470 points as the global economy is crashing in front of our eyes and they're locking down more places.
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:03.520]  It doesn't come back.
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:10.520]  All those small businesses, most of the restaurants in New York City are owned by small businesses.
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:12.520]  They're not coming back.
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:15.520]  They're gone.
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:18.520]  And you know what else this is going to do?
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:21.520]  The bigs are going to get bigger.
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  Look what these slimy low life politicians did.
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:27.520]  There you go.
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:31.520]  60% of businesses closures won't come back.
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:37.520]  So now the bigs are going to get bigger and these slimy low life politicians, all your little businesses,
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:39.520]  no, you can't open.
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:41.520]  But Target, you can open.
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:43.520]  Walmart, you can open.
[3:29:43.520 --> 3:29:45.520]  Hey, how about Home Depot?
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:47.520]  You can open too.
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:49.520]  So the billionaires get richer.
[3:29:49.520 --> 3:29:51.520]  The bigs get bigger.
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:29:59.520]  And all we do is become plantation workers on the global plantation of slave landia.
[3:29:59.520 --> 3:30:02.520]  OK for Amazon to stay open.
[3:30:02.520 --> 3:30:05.520]  Get back in there and pack those boxes.
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:07.520]  You want to become a warehouse worker.
[3:30:07.520 --> 3:30:11.520]  Matter of fact, you could go to college and get a degree in it.
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:15.520]  And for the rest of your life, you'll have to pay it off.
[3:30:15.520 --> 3:30:18.520]  Oh, you can thank Joe Biden for not paying off you.
[3:30:18.520 --> 3:30:23.520]  Yeah, he made it impossible almost to get the fault on alone.
[3:30:23.520 --> 3:30:25.520]  But that's for God.
[3:30:25.520 --> 3:30:27.520]  And so is a lot of other things for God.
[3:30:27.520 --> 3:30:30.520]  But we're going to be bringing them back for you to remember.
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:32.520]  You can care for the future.
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:34.520]  Right.

[3:32:00.520 --> 3:32:09.520]  This is the highest end AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and shell caps at night.
[3:32:09.520 --> 3:32:16.520]  It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect.
[3:32:16.520 --> 3:32:18.520]  Because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:40.520]  The renaissance, the great enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[3:32:40.520 --> 3:32:52.520]  That's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[3:32:52.520 --> 3:32:57.520]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[3:32:57.520 --> 3:33:00.520]  That is the post-human extermination plan.
[3:33:00.520 --> 3:33:20.520]  That is the public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[3:33:20.520 --> 3:33:30.520]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:39.520]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity. This is the essence of evil.
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:52.520]  The future isn't coming, it's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:55.520]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:34:11.520]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:21.520]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050. This is their stated goal.
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:30.520]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:59.520]  We turn this around. You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[3:34:59.520 --> 3:35:10.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:36.520]  They're robbing us of our freedom like you can't imagine. I'm a trend forecaster. I can never imagine a freak show like they've created with this one, and it's global, as we were talking about.

[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:26.520]  And one of the ways to do that is to support Info Wars. These products are great for you, and the information you're getting is hard to find anywhere else.
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:36.520]  And of course, we have the Trends Journal at TrendsJournal.com. So support those who fight for freedom, because if we don't fight for freedom, we're going to die in the COVID war.
[3:37:36.520 --> 3:37:40.520]  And it's not going to be a very happy future.
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:50.520]  I'm going to go back to that story about the second wave jolts central Europe in the Financial Times.
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:59.520]  Because then you go on and you keep reading, and you go on to say, it's also about a heavy economic toll.
[3:37:59.520 --> 3:38:16.520]  In the second quarter, economic output fell 14.5% in Hungary, 12.3% in Romania, 8.9% in Poland, 8.4% in the Czech Republic, 8.3% in Slovakia.
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:43.520]  So, we have a huge deficit, the biggest in our history, and it seems that the government deficit next year will be roughly the same, said Danus Nerudov, who is part of an economic task force advising the Czech government on coping with COVID.
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:54.520]  And quote, we warned the government a complete lockdown would really destabilize the public finances.
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:39:02.520]  And that's maybe the reason that they were reluctant to close the economy. Well, they did close the economy partially.
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:16.520]  But I read to you those numbers and how bad they are and how they're going to be as bad next year.
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:20.520]  We are in the greatest depression.
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:45.520]  This is what they keep blaming it on the pandemic. It's not the pandemic, it's the pathological liars, it's the parasites, it's the sociopaths and psychopaths that closed down the global economy that did this.
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:58.520]  Where is the money going to come from for these deficits? And again, this all ties back together, goes back to the equity markets.
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:09.520]  They're printing all of this cheap money to keep this thing going, digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:17.520]  One country after another, what is the other reason why the markets are going up today in the United States?
[3:40:17.520 --> 3:40:21.520]  Well, it looks like a stimulus bill might be passed.
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:35.520]  Oh, a stimulus bill, great, great, more cheap money, printed on nothing and backed by nothing.
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:48.520]  Now, at the same time, as you well know, besides shortages of toilet paper, which shows you what crap heads the people are, that's the first thing they did when the COVID war began.
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:41:01.520]  We need that paper, we need that paper because we're crap heads. Besides the shortage of that, treated lumber, screws, parts, you name it, shortages.
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:11.520]  It's all ties together. Well, when you have a shortage of supply and demand, the price of the thing goes up.
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:24.520]  And now, with demand for those goods going up and the value of the currency going down, you have inflation.
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:33.520]  Gold and silver prices. I still forecast gold well over $2,000 an ounce, I did over 2,000 this year already.
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:40.520]  I see going to three and four and silver well over $100 an ounce.
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  And I don't give financial advice, but I'm giving you the reasons why.
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:57.520]  You're going to see why more public inflation. As all these nations, that's why I read you this article from the Financial Times.
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:03.520]  And by the way, this is what I do every day. You can see the underlying red in there.
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:13.520]  So I read articles from all over the world and I pick out the salient points to highlight on to see where this is going.
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:21.520]  Now we're going to take it one step further. Where are they going to get the money for these deficits besides printing cheap money?
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:32.520]  And of course, to boost the economies falsely with this digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing. You ready?
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  This is from, this is the only story that was of any value for me yesterday from Sunday's toilet paper of record.
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:50.520]  The New York Times. There's a story down the bottom.
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:58.520]  And this is on page 18 down the bottom.
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:08.520]  Gas tech spikes in New Jersey to compensate for slowdown.
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:11.520]  Isn't that nice?
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:15.520]  Oh, look what they do because of pandemic's impact.
[3:43:15.520 --> 3:43:27.520]  Not because of pandemic's impact, because of the impact by low life scum politicians like the governor they got over there, Murphy and the rest of them.
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:43.520]  Drivers in New Jersey purchased nearly 40% less gas between March and May as businesses and schools closed down and more people began working from home.
[3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:48.520]  That led to a draft in tax revenue that shoot into funds.
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:43:55.520]  The state was required by law to set aside to pay for improvements and rails and roads and bridges.
[3:43:55.520 --> 3:44:00.520]  And in turn mandated a 9.3% tax increase.
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:06.520]  State officials said the new rate took effect on Thursday.
[3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:09.520]  Isn't that great?
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:14.520]  Tax we the little people as the billionaires get.
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:28.520]  Don't get all raise the taxes on a big one. Don't give the buffets and the bezos and the gates and the musks and the Cubans and all the rest of the multi billionaires.
[3:44:28.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  Don't take any more from many from them.
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:34.520]  Raise the gas taxes.
[3:44:34.520 --> 3:44:36.520]  Raise the gas taxes.
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:39.520]  Get the little people.
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:42.520]  The COVID was begun.
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:49.520]  We the people against the murderous people that are destroying our lives in so many different ways.
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:44:53.520]  Liberty love joy and beauty freedom.
[3:44:53.520 --> 3:44:56.520]  As they get more money from us.
[3:44:56.520 --> 3:44:59.520]  And they destroy our economy.
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:02.520]  So do what you can to support info wars.
