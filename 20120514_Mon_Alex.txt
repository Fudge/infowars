[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.943]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.524]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.065]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:17.268]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:21.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:42.540]  It is Monday my friends.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.788]  Thank you for joining us the 14th day of May 2012 and Lord willing we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:56.093]  The former Navy SEAL and one of the top hand-to-hand combat trainers in the country
[00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:01.548]  Who was banned from entering England to teach the population self-defense.
[00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:05.451]  Because a criminal state does not want its slaves knowing how to defend themselves.
[00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:10.855]  Only want special paramilitary units that know how to defend themselves and abuse the population.
[00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:15.418]  Tim Larkin, training so evil it's banned in the UK.
[00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:20.362]  He will be, I mean that sarcastically, victim disarmament is what's evil.
[00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:23.024]  You see, I don't even need a firearm to get a firearm.
[00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:27.417]  It's the old joke of the ball-peen hammer or butter knife brigade.
[00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:33.241]  I'm not even the toughest guy around, but I am willing to defend myself.
[00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.103]  I am willing to kill people with my bare hands.
[00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:37.165]  It's not very hard to do, by the way.
[00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:45.551]  Tim Larkin, he's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour today.
[00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:48.333]  Banned in the UK.
[00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.316]  We're going to be discussing that with him.
[00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.268]  Coming up.
[00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:04.353]  Also, all over the United States, and we've been reporting on this the last few months, but now it's getting attention even in the Hill newspaper.
[00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:09.797]  Why is the Obama administration allowing the Chinese government to buy up U.S.
[00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:15.240]  oil and gas deposits worth billions of dollars while passing regulations selectively to harass U.S.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.002]  developers, I should add?
[00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:22.426]  That dovetails with lawmakers largely silent over Chinese takeover of U.S.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.381]  Bank branches and took the headlines.
[00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:29.823]  Lawmakers stay largely silent over Chinese takeover of US bank branches.
[00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:41.088]  We're going to be discussing globalism, how it's designed to destroy a country's national sovereignty and how that's happening right now in our precious republic.
[00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:45.951]  A true witch, Dianne Feinstein, the so-called senator,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.362]  We'll never leave.
[00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:55.351]  Imagine someday when she dies, it'll be like Lenin's tomb and she'll still be the senator ruling California from hell.
[00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.104]  From the 9th Circle.
[00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:01.667]  Feinstein, get ready for more aggressive molestation at the airport.
[00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.509]  She says, I know the American people are mad.
[00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.831]  Well, you're not going to do jack squat.
[00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.773]  Because if they can stick their hands down your pants, they can do anything.
[00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:13.677]  This is about total federalization and annihilation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:16.840]  But it integrates in with real security threats that they say aren't an issue.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.203]  49 headless corpses found in northern Mexico.
[00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.146]  Just a few weeks ago, it was 30-something on the U.S.
[00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:24.386]  side.
[00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:27.108]  I mean, this is a weekly occurrence.
[00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:31.030]  Last time I checked now, it's over 50,000 dead in the last three years.
[00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.772]  Seventy-something thousand dead in the last five.
[00:03:33.772 --> 00:03:36.614]  I mean, this is a imploded society.
[00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.530]  Which is what the globalists like.
[00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.152]  Again, the Soviets did that everywhere they took over.
[00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.313]  It's about wrecking society.
[00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:46.814]  They do this on purpose.
[00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:51.236]  But it's okay, we've got to give our rights up because Al-Qaeda is so scary.
[00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:57.140]  Coming up, Al-Qaeda rebel pictured with UN observers in Syria.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:06.765]  And they've had the US ambassador to the UN say last week, listen, there's going to be more bombings Assad, so you let us take over.
[00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:07.966]  The freedom fighters will get you.
[00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:25.437]  And they go on to admit the groups blowing up police stations and military bases and shopping malls is Al Qaeda and they mass in Jordan and other areas at US bases.
[00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:44.187]  And then they just pour across and murder everybody, and Anderson Cooper gets up there all breathless in his ninny, little breathless, pillow-biting way, and little CIA agent he is on record, and he goes, oh, freedom fighters, but I'm supposed to give up all my rights for your freedom fighters.
[00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.328]  I mean, they have such disdain for us.
[00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:50.171]  That Feinstein says they're going to grope your little girls and boys regardless.
[00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:53.053]  He's going to break America's will because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:54.814]  Because they're such a threat.
[00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:57.737]  But then Al-Qaeda openly works for them.
[00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:00.279]  The dirtbag terrorists that have hijacked our country.
[00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.622]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water?
[00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.783]  Laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:08.205]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:13.929]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:17.312]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:20.734]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:22.436]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:24.717]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:27.219]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.801]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.222]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:34.385]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:37.768]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:37.768 --> 00:05:41.911]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:44.653]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:46.235]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:49.537]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:05:49.537 --> 00:05:54.802]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:10.285]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:14.365]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:21.666]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:42.883]  This is an amazing deal.

[00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:01.119]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:06.724]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:06.724 --> 00:07:11.748]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:16.773]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:22.518]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:24.840]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.645]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:29.645 --> 00:07:30.766]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:33.548]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:07:33.548 --> 00:07:37.132]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:40.613]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:42.834]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:43.795]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:44.115]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:47.436]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:49.157]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:04.250]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.051]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.746 --> 00:08:30.830]  It is Monday, the 14th day of May 2012.
[00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.392]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:40.197]  I'm going to plunge directly into the news and tell you about the guests we've got coming up.
[00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:42.959]  Also, we're going to have a jam-packed third hour.
[00:08:44.687 --> 00:08:53.071]  We're going to play a clip from arguably the biggest television show in the UK that I was on.
[00:08:53.071 --> 00:09:01.116]  They played a clip of my Nightly News broadcast, InfoWars Nightly News, that airs every weeknight at 7 o'clock Central.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:11.502]  The show is called 8 Out of 10 Cats, and Hasselhoff was on the show and made some comments about it.
[00:09:11.502 --> 00:09:15.022]  We've had to edit out the cuss words, but that is coming up.
[00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:30.045]  The reason I'm going to air this coming up in the third hour is it's a perfect example of how they take what the TSA is doing, groping people and abusing them, and turn it around on me, like I'm the bad guy, and make a big joke out of it.
[00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:38.890]  And this is how our society is turning into a tyranny, is that everything is now a big joke.
[00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:48.378]  And I understand it's a comedy show, but they edited it to make it sound like I'm not going to be at a park groping on women.
[00:09:48.378 --> 00:09:50.259]  I'm not attracted to that.
[00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:51.460]  I'm not into that.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.663]  Pointing out that I wouldn't want a job as a TSA agent.
[00:09:56.107 --> 00:10:11.224]  Only people that like the raw exercise of power, only people that have something fundamentally wrong with them would want to be pulling people's babies diapers off and pulling colostomy bags off people and groping women's breasts.
[00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:11.944]  This is a joke!
[00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:22.091]  And it's all based on the false threat of a manufactured Al-Qaeda threat that is publicly working for the globalists.
[00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:24.993]  That's not debated and we have some news on that today.
[00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:30.496]  Al-Qaeda rebel pictured with UN observers in Syria and the West and the U.S.
[00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:36.360]  Ambassador to the UN says, step down Assad or Al-Qaeda will continue to blow up your police stations.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.161]  They are freedom fighters.
[00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:41.423]  I mean, I call it like a magical skeleton key.
[00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:46.914]  We've got to give up all of our rights because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:57.758]  Kills less people every year, even if it was real, that honeybee stings, or water moccasin bites, or rattlesnake bites, or birds flying into windshields and causing wrecks, or deer.
[00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:58.618]  Look the numbers up.
[00:10:58.618 --> 00:10:59.939]  Hundreds killed by deer a year.
[00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:01.920]  It's over 200 on average.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.560]  Hundreds killed by honeybees.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.581]  Hundreds by red wasp.
[00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.782]  Hundreds by yellow jackets.
[00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:09.523]  Per species.
[00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:11.323]  Hundreds by brown recluse.
[00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:12.604]  Hundreds by black widow.
[00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:15.773]  Hundreds by rattlesnakes.
[00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:18.957]  Hundreds by... on and on and on.
[00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:20.919]  Not even hundreds a year by Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:28.987]  And then Al-Qaeda, publicly, is a creation of the globalists, the CIA, and is used to menace the West and take our liberties.
[00:11:28.987 --> 00:11:33.632]  And they use Al-Qaeda to take over Libya, now Syria, and it's on the news.
[00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:34.233]  And the U.S.
[00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.294]  Ambassador to the U.N.
[00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:40.962]  Rice said last Friday, step down Assad or there'll be more bombings.
[00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:46.506]  And I listen to NPR and it's like, the Freedom Fighters bombed some more police stations.
[00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:53.871]  And the Freedom Fighters wear Al-Qaeda uniforms with the Al-Qaeda patch.
[00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:54.871]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:11:54.871 --> 00:11:56.072]  That's in the stack.
[00:11:56.072 --> 00:11:57.653]  Infowars.com.
[00:11:57.653 --> 00:12:00.835]  Al-Qaeda rebel pictured with UN observers in Syria.
[00:12:00.835 --> 00:12:03.437]  This is even in French news agency AFP.
[00:12:03.437 --> 00:12:04.438]  That's where the photo comes from.
[00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:15.736]  But again, I've got to, as I guess I'd ride on the highway now, because they're training the police to do this, have them grope my wife and children.
[00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:27.966]  Again, getting in our space, prisoner training, that's all this is, where I'm a terrorist because of Al Qaeda, while they work for the West, and then the biggest show in the UK, 8 out of 10 cats, makes a joke out of it.
[00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:33.993]  And I'm told some of the people inside the thing are fans.
[00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:36.855]  In fact, somebody I even know, I guess, works there.
[00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:39.477]  And so this is their way of at least getting the point out.
[00:12:39.477 --> 00:12:42.959]  And Hasselhoff and the others get a big laugh out of it.
[00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.681]  But it's not funny.
[00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:48.784]  It's not funny.
[00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:50.005]  So we're going to be airing that.
[00:12:50.005 --> 00:12:53.427]  Now, this is a case of censorship.
[00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:55.009]  We played this a week and a half ago.
[00:12:56.232 --> 00:13:01.297]  On the nightly news, when the video first got released, and YouTube banned the video.
[00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:03.178]  They blocked it.
[00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:07.342]  Now, ABC News can show clips, Russia Today can show clips, because they're media.
[00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:15.129]  But, you know, my show on XM, and over 100 AM and FM's, and award-winning Project Censored Award, you name it, we're not news because they say.
[00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:17.111]  Just like we're delisted from Google News.
[00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:20.414]  If you click the news section, we didn't used to be, we are now.
[00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:27.140]  And the monolith that they now admit works for the NSA and the CIA and was a creation?
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.583]  Oh, that's been declassified last week completely.
[00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:35.648]  That it's totally a government front for private individuals to make money while they spy on us illegally.
[00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.109]  They hack your computers.
[00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:38.370]  They hack your passcodes.
[00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.273]  Google is the private global government.
[00:13:41.273 --> 00:13:41.793]  It's above NSA.
[00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:56.363]  That's why we're delisted from Google News and more and more being knocked down in ranking in the Google listings, which basically is the Internet for all intents and purposes, on Google Web, or Google Everything as they call it.
[00:13:56.363 --> 00:14:02.104]  Doesn't matter, we're still growing by leaps and bounds, but this is the attempt to curtail what we're doing because we'll talk about that.
[00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:21.992]  Anybody that tries to post the video of Kelly Thomas being beaten to death over 10 minutes by the police while they pin him down and enjoy, for no reason, tasering, crushing his windpipe, smashing his skull and breaking his jaw, crushing his ribs, crushing his organs.
[00:14:21.992 --> 00:14:32.197]  They continue to beat, you know, even after he's there on the ground in a pool of blood, they just stomp for fun, knee kick into the neck, and they get off on it and make jokes after they've basically killed him.
[00:14:32.197 --> 00:14:33.138]  Took him a few days to die.
[00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:35.252]  This is what cowards do.
[00:14:35.252 --> 00:14:39.515]  They go sign up now so they can pull your wife over and rape her on the side of the highway.
[00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:40.636]  Got news of that.
[00:14:40.636 --> 00:14:41.917]  So they can beat you up.
[00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:45.459]  They never get enough exercising power.
[00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:46.340]  Not all police.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.481]  Not the old line police.
[00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:49.142]  There were always some problems.
[00:14:49.142 --> 00:14:50.763]  But now, this is the system.
[00:14:50.763 --> 00:14:52.264]  This is what they want.
[00:14:52.264 --> 00:14:54.746]  This is what they get.
[00:14:54.746 --> 00:14:58.129]  And YouTube blocks this video.
[00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.121]  They either remove it or they block it.
[00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:12.864]  Kind of like the video we showed that hundreds of news agencies showed of the military in the helicopter shooting Reuters reporters and blowing up vans full of children in the middle of Baghdad.
[00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:15.105]  And the helicopter pilots make jokes about it.
[00:15:15.105 --> 00:15:21.626]  But then I show the ground troops coming over who are in the real world and picking up the little girls and saving them.
[00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:24.027]  And you hear the troops with tears in their voice.
[00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:28.008]  I was showing the difference between people that actually have to see the death
[00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:30.808]  That's what Kurt Vonnegut talked about.
[00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:43.683]  He was on the ground under the bombing as a POW in Germany, Slaughterhouse-Five, versus the guys in the helicopters who were dehumanizing the people down there on the ground.
[00:15:43.683 --> 00:15:46.686]  And I was making the points of how much do drones dehumanize us?
[00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:49.769]  So because it was a powerful piece of information,
[00:15:50.805 --> 00:16:00.872]  It didn't attack the military, it showed how they're being dehumanized as well, so they would think they banned that video and said that they were looking at banning our channel.
[00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:05.815]  We had a huge protest, they put it back up.
[00:16:05.815 --> 00:16:14.801]  Well listen, I have PrisonPlanet.tv and I have my syndicated radio show, show that as the internet gets censored, we've got other legs to stand on.
[00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:18.703]  Doesn't mean they won't chop those down as well, but we've got more than one leg we're standing on.
[00:16:18.703 --> 00:16:19.384]  We're gonna air.
[00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:29.275]  The news report we aired Friday on the Nightly News titled, Police Hunt Man For Sport.
[00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:30.555]  And that's what it is.
[00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:32.816]  They've got a lot of famous police tapes.
[00:16:32.816 --> 00:16:38.998]  That's why they're now going to federally controlled systems where the scanners can't pick it up or it's scrambled.
[00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.059]  And it's like, let's go out hunting tonight.
[00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:43.679]  They don't go out and hunt wild boar.
[00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:45.300]  They don't go out and hunt pheasant.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.781]  They don't go out and hunt white-tailed deer, mule.
[00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.841]  They go out and they hunt people.
[00:16:50.254 --> 00:16:56.402]  And, you know, be careful you don't stare into the abyss, lest you become the abyss.
[00:16:56.402 --> 00:16:58.926]  I understand that the society's degenerated.
[00:16:58.926 --> 00:17:00.968]  I understand there's a lot of slobs and trash.
[00:17:00.968 --> 00:17:05.634]  The trashification, the wussification, the scummification of America.
[00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:07.277]  It's not just the police turning into scum.
[00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:09.746]  The general public.
[00:17:09.746 --> 00:17:14.028]  So, I wouldn't want your job in a million years, but it doesn't matter.
[00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:17.749]  You sign on for it, you're going to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:17:17.749 --> 00:17:20.569]  Everybody knows Guatemala's got thug police.
[00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.950]  Everybody knows North Korea's got thug police.
[00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.291]  Everybody knows China's got thug police.
[00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:32.233]  So why is it then bad if I say what the Founding Fathers said, and say, hey, we better keep government on a short leash?
[00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:35.594]  It's the number one threat to liberty, to family, to society.
[00:17:39.366 --> 00:17:43.610]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.591]  That's what America's based on.
[00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:57.282]  And the fact that they have all these handbooks and training manuals and training videos that we've gotten over the years from good police and shown you, where they talk about, you criticize the police state, you criticize warrantless searches, you're a terrorist.
[00:17:57.282 --> 00:17:58.963]  You, like Ron Paul, you're a terrorist.
[00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:02.146]  You're a returning veteran who hadn't joined their ranks, you're a terrorist.
[00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:10.435]  That's what it's all about because the government is an alien group now.
[00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:13.217]  It has been taken over by foreign banks.
[00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.779]  It's a money takeover.
[00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:18.742]  That's the new world order.
[00:18:18.742 --> 00:18:21.324]  And so we spent a lot of time on police and military because
[00:18:23.188 --> 00:18:26.270]  You're being forced into oppressing the people.
[00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:33.255]  You got all these reasons for why you do it and all these little PR stories you follow, but that's not the larger system.
[00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:37.058]  At the top, the government is directed now by criminals.
[00:18:37.058 --> 00:18:41.542]  There is an evil agenda, an evil endgame, an evil destination.
[00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.883]  We're all going on.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:51.329]  And when the Bill of Rights and Constitution is fully destroyed, which it's getting close to, the shields are down and the liberty
[00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:55.958]  As it leaves, the prosperity leaves with it.
[00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:00.321]  And I am fundamentally upset about going into bondage.
[00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:04.364]  I am fundamentally concerned.
[00:19:04.364 --> 00:19:10.848]  I can feel, not just see it intellectually, but feel in my gut the immediacy of this.
[00:19:10.848 --> 00:19:17.572]  We've got a chance of turning this around, because a bold attack has a way of having a bold response, and we're already seeing it.
[00:19:17.572 --> 00:19:19.814]  I've got some reports for you today that are very exciting.
[00:19:21.175 --> 00:19:29.377]  Coming up, 8 out of 10 cats, Channel 4, TSA, Worship Fest, Police hunt man for sport.
[00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.097]  That full report before they ban it is on the InfoWarrior channel.
[00:19:32.097 --> 00:19:33.477]  I've asked the webmasters to post it.
[00:19:33.477 --> 00:19:36.278]  I don't think folks are reading their IMs.
[00:19:36.278 --> 00:19:43.359]  Also, we'll try to get it up at InfoWars.com before they... Because once it's posted and embedded, even if they block it, it's still there.
[00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:45.620]  They just block it on YouTube.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.760]  And then, my experience at the beach.
[00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:53.906]  Oh, you don't go to the South Texas beach anymore.
[00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:56.573]  I'm going to tell you that whole story about the Federales.
[00:19:56.573 --> 00:19:57.636]  It's all coming up.
[00:20:00.648 --> 00:20:07.795]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:20:07.795 --> 00:20:20.887]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:25.492]  That our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:31.638]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered Youngevity.
[00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:39.727]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:21:39.005 --> 00:21:39.806]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.806 --> 00:21:46.070]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.951]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:10.684]  I got it!
[00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:16.679]  All right, my friend.
[00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:38.534]  Coming up in the third hour, again, 8 Out of 10 Cats, biggest TV show in the UK.
[00:24:38.534 --> 00:24:52.924]  They played a clip from the Nightly News last week where I was breaking down the TSA is basically stalking people and groping them and harassing movie stars and elected representatives.
[00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:54.004]  And they say, we don't care.
[00:24:54.004 --> 00:24:57.567]  We're here to let you know everybody is going to be abused by us.
[00:24:59.793 --> 00:25:02.475]  And then police hunt man for sport.
[00:25:02.475 --> 00:25:05.117]  This is censored video and audio.
[00:25:05.117 --> 00:25:10.881]  We're going to listen to him beg for his daddy while they kill him real slow and take their time.
[00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:15.745]  By the way, the only reason the cops have been arrested is the guy's dad is a cop.
[00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.326]  Only reason.
[00:25:17.326 --> 00:25:26.714]  Okay, continuing here, because just even being the child of a cop is so close to being a god creature that the police may actually get in trouble.
[00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:28.015]  Also, we're going to
[00:25:29.983 --> 00:25:31.884]  Go over this.
[00:25:31.884 --> 00:25:36.305]  My wife was able to shoot a little bit of video on her camera, but it ran out of batteries right as she started.
[00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:39.746]  I got a few snapshots on my iPhone as they drove away.
[00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:44.387]  But my parents were staying out at the National Seashore in their pop-up camper.
[00:25:44.387 --> 00:25:46.908]  I went out there to stay with them.
[00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:48.048]  Needless to say, I didn't.
[00:25:48.048 --> 00:25:55.350]  I mean, we'd been there a couple hours and the cops kept stopping and talking to us and stopping and talking to everyone like it was a Monty Python skit.
[00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:02.192]  And telling us that they were federal law enforcement and staring at us and seeing if they could intimidate us.
[00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:07.073]  And I thought it was a joke or implying we wanted to steal sea turtles.
[00:26:07.073 --> 00:26:09.014]  And I hadn't seen any sea turtles.
[00:26:09.014 --> 00:26:11.274]  And it was so weird.
[00:26:11.274 --> 00:26:16.816]  It was like living on Mars or North Korea or something that I just said, I'm getting out of here.
[00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:24.151]  And then on my way out, they were pulling people over, left and right, and waiting and driving off their jurisdiction.
[00:26:24.151 --> 00:26:29.252]  They were waiting with their vehicles pointed at people at the National Seashore, where I've gone since I was born.
[00:26:29.252 --> 00:26:33.413]  My parents have gone there since before they were married, 40 plus years.
[00:26:33.413 --> 00:26:36.694]  And, I mean, it was incredible.
[00:26:36.694 --> 00:26:46.296]  And then I realized that they've announced that all over the country, they are, all over the country,
[00:26:47.987 --> 00:26:57.735]  They are shutting down parks, shutting down buffer zones, saying you can't swim in the ocean, you can't go in the dunes, you can't drive.
[00:26:57.735 --> 00:27:00.937]  I mean, and it's just all about your slaves.
[00:27:00.937 --> 00:27:10.424]  And these guys would get out of the cars and talk to us, and they were basically, the only way to describe them was like mentally retarded, slash autistic.
[00:27:10.424 --> 00:27:17.430]  And they would sit there and talk on their radios like little kids, and I'd look at them, and then they'd say, I'm a federal law enforcement officer.
[00:27:18.499 --> 00:27:21.641]  And you better watch out walking around up on that dune, there's rattlesnakes.
[00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:25.402]  And of course, everybody knows there's rattlesnakes.
[00:27:25.402 --> 00:27:28.024]  And then, do you know about the sea turtles?
[00:27:28.024 --> 00:27:29.965]  You know, don't touch them.
[00:27:29.965 --> 00:27:35.367]  And I'm just sitting there, and then I'd watch them pull the next people 50 yards down and bug them.
[00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:39.469]  And it just went on and on, and I'm just like, what planet am I on?
[00:27:39.469 --> 00:27:46.993]  And I've been going down there, some of my earliest memories, of course, are going to Puerto Ransos and other areas, they're quite frankly much nicer, but we like to go down there to camp.
[00:27:48.727 --> 00:28:03.094]  And I mean, you'd see a border, not a border patrol, it's hundreds and hundreds of miles from the border, you'd see a Department of the Interior truck or a park ranger once every two days.
[00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:08.837]  And I mean, this was like police just driving up and down and it never stopped.
[00:28:08.837 --> 00:28:13.640]  And driving by and staring at you and looking and trying to stare you down.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.281]  And I thought, well, it must be because they know me.
[00:28:18.117 --> 00:28:21.858]  Because when I drove in, the guy goes, excuse me, where are you from?
[00:28:21.858 --> 00:28:22.918]  I'm from Austin, Texas.
[00:28:22.918 --> 00:28:30.760]  And I noticed I'd gotten the airport treatment when I was at Carlsbad Caverns a few months ago, but they were doing this to everybody there.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.180]  So I knew it wasn't because they knew who I was.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.041]  And the guy goes, you're Alex Jones, I'm a listener.
[00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:39.322]  And I went, okay, well, hi, how you doing?
[00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:44.243]  And so I thought maybe they're harassing us the first time it happened, because they know who I am.
[00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:46.824]  And then I noticed they were stopping every two or three cars.
[00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:55.155]  And I went and talked to people, and these people were listeners.
[00:28:55.155 --> 00:28:56.355]  That's the other story.
[00:28:56.355 --> 00:28:59.157]  Then I go talk to these people and they're listeners.
[00:28:59.157 --> 00:29:05.800]  And then more of the guys drive by, and they roll down their window and say, hi Alex.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.942]  The park rangers, that was a different group.
[00:29:12.178 --> 00:29:14.583]  And I guess I'm already telling the story.
[00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.666]  It was so bizarre.
[00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:17.370]  It was Twilight Zone.
[00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.479]  And then right after this one group comes up and confronts us, I'm gonna tell the whole story later.
[00:29:22.842 --> 00:29:25.604]  Another car drives up, they go, Alex Jones, Alex Jones!
[00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:31.328]  So it was that experience of, here's the oppression of the tyranny, just to train me I'm a slave.
[00:29:31.328 --> 00:29:33.469]  That's all this is, is training you to be a serf.
[00:29:33.469 --> 00:29:37.051]  You know, they tell them, make contact, boss people.
[00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:38.552]  That's how it is everywhere now.
[00:29:38.552 --> 00:29:40.614]  Get them in the system, henpeck them.
[00:29:40.614 --> 00:29:43.595]  But then, everybody I talked to was a listener and a wake.
[00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:44.816]  Everybody.
[00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.459]  So, the battle is joined is all I can say.
[00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.831]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.831 --> 00:30:01.353]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.353 --> 00:30:15.796]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:21.511]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:32:00.023 --> 00:32:04.406]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:08.429]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best storable food on the planet.
[00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:12.453]  Every day, we document the attempts to take control of our lives.
[00:32:12.453 --> 00:32:14.654]  But there's one thing we can all control.
[00:32:14.654 --> 00:32:16.176]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:32:16.176 --> 00:32:16.516]  Food.

[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.721]  More the best for less guaranteed.
[00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:16.780]  How am I supposed to put this?
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:39.666]  We have documented so exhaustively the fact that we have a extremely predatory anti-human group of globalists who absolutely hate every sovereign nation on earth and are playing countries off against each other to bring in a world government
[00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:48.062]  Who's endgame is mass extermination of at least 80 to 90% of the population.
[00:33:48.062 --> 00:33:51.944]  The numbers vary depending on which UN document you read.
[00:33:51.944 --> 00:33:58.187]  And as an educated, informed person, and by educated, educated to what the globalists are really saying and doing.
[00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:11.527]  Not the false reality of the sports and the TV shows and the dramas and all of the, you know, men acting tough and macho with each other.
[00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:24.996]  I drove back from Port Aransas this weekend, the mid-Texas coast, and I watched men
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:43.829]  Race up on people's tails, even when the people were going above the speed limit and couldn't get over because of an 18-wheeler, and get right up on them like they were going to run into them, over and over and over again.
[00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:45.210]  I had them do it to me.
[00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.012]  I was following my parents home, saw them do it to us.
[00:34:49.012 --> 00:34:51.674]  I would be in the slow lane, people would run up behind me.
[00:34:53.510 --> 00:35:09.461]  And my point is, they'll do something violent and aggressive and dangerous just to feel powerful in their car, because they feel secure in their car, but they won't go out and speak out for liberty or freedom.
[00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:12.123]  Just a very strange psychology.
[00:35:12.123 --> 00:35:17.346]  There's all these biker guys that drive around acting real mean and tough on their motorcycles.
[00:35:17.346 --> 00:35:18.287]  Okay, great.
[00:35:18.287 --> 00:35:20.328]  What are you doing to fight tyranny?
[00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:22.690]  I guess some of you are, but I mean, we're in trouble.
[00:35:25.029 --> 00:35:51.978]  To see the American people, and to see humanity as a whole, isolated, dumbed down, the trashification, the scummification, the wussification, and to see how ignorant the general population is, and to see the globalists perched on us, like vampires, sucking our blood, sucking our liberty out of us, destroying our country, every day acts of treason.
[00:35:53.439 --> 00:36:01.122]  Knowing where it leads us, knowing where this dark river goes, the sea that it leads to, is not a place you want to go to.
[00:36:01.122 --> 00:36:05.163]  We're on the river Styx as a society.
[00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:14.427]  Charon, the boatman, is driving the boat, pulling us across, and I'm like, folks, we want to turn this baby around.
[00:36:19.358 --> 00:36:21.840]  All I can do is relate to it from my perspective.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:34.450]  Every time I look at my innocent, sweet, good, decent children, and every time I see what the globalists are doing to innocence worldwide, it makes me sick.
[00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.712]  It hurts my heart.
[00:36:36.712 --> 00:36:48.321]  And to watch people like Senator Dianne Feinstein, very wicked woman, do everything she can to destroy private property, to destroy California, to shut off their industries with carbon taxes,
[00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:54.125]  To expand TSA on the streets, to dominate and break the American people.
[00:36:54.125 --> 00:36:55.806]  I don't even hate her.
[00:36:55.806 --> 00:37:04.534]  I recognize her for the anti-human, anti-freedom, anti-American, parasitic witch.
[00:37:06.445 --> 00:37:08.207]  That she is.
[00:37:08.207 --> 00:37:15.453]  I recognize Barack Obama for the parasitic teleprompter reading empty vassal that he is.
[00:37:15.453 --> 00:37:20.358]  And then I think about the power structures behind people like this.
[00:37:20.358 --> 00:37:31.688]  And I think about what this country is going to go through and how they're preparing the tattletale squads, how they're federalizing the training of the police, how everywhere
[00:37:33.507 --> 00:37:40.629]  The police more and more have the look in their eyes that I see in the eyes of North Korean and corrupt Latin American police.
[00:37:40.629 --> 00:37:42.310]  And it really hurts me.
[00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:51.573]  It really hurts me to see the sun setting on our country.
[00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:58.335]  It really hurts me.
[00:37:58.335 --> 00:38:02.937]  And it hurts my heart to know that it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:38:06.846 --> 00:38:07.887]  It freaks me out.
[00:38:07.887 --> 00:38:10.688]  I know it freaks you out.
[00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.609]  Really, really bad.
[00:38:12.609 --> 00:38:17.631]  That, on record, Al Qaeda is a globalist creation that they use against countries to take their liberties.
[00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:23.754]  Again, the criminals that have hijacked our government finance Al Qaeda to menace and threaten the West as a pretext to take our freedom.
[00:38:23.754 --> 00:38:25.075]  It's a simple equation.
[00:38:25.075 --> 00:38:34.780]  And to have them in the news, our government, so-called government, funding Al Qaeda to attack Syria and blow up police stations and military bases, and admitting it,
[00:38:36.539 --> 00:38:43.925]  And then talking to me like I'm dumb, saying, give your rights up, Dianne Feinstein says, the screening's gonna get more invasive now.
[00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:47.849]  We're gonna start strip searching a large numbers of people in those rooms they've built.
[00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:52.973]  Whether you like it or not, they're gonna take your kids now, it's already started, and strip search them as they scream and cry.
[00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:55.735]  And if you try to fight for your kid, they're gonna kill you.
[00:38:55.735 --> 00:38:58.417]  They're gonna have the police come and kill you.
[00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:01.700]  They killed people at airports in Canada and the US.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.642]  They standardized TSA systems.
[00:39:04.588 --> 00:39:07.109]  Remember the woman they beat to death in Phoenix?
[00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:09.210]  She had a panic attack when they were tackling her.
[00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.151]  So they took her behind closed doors and broke her neck.
[00:39:12.151 --> 00:39:13.431]  They had her handcuffed from behind.
[00:39:13.431 --> 00:39:18.133]  They said she choked herself with her own handcuffs with them behind her back.
[00:39:18.133 --> 00:39:20.033]  Of course, they jumped on her head.
[00:39:20.033 --> 00:39:22.654]  The autopsy showed and broke her neck.
[00:39:22.654 --> 00:39:24.055]  That's the thing.
[00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:29.817]  They're upping the power of the tasers now that they know are killing people.
[00:39:29.817 --> 00:39:31.017]  And it tears my guts out.
[00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:36.198]  And again, police, you're going to be affected by this.
[00:39:36.198 --> 00:39:40.100]  You take the vaccines, you drink the water, you eat the GMO.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:49.986]  I was in a little restaurant yesterday afternoon, there right as you enter Padre Island from Corpus Christi, delicious little place called Snoopy's.
[00:39:49.986 --> 00:39:54.970]  And we went in about four o'clock on Mother's Day before we drove back to Dallas, so there wouldn't be a crowd, but it was still packed.
[00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.231]  And there were probably 25 children in there.
[00:40:00.674 --> 00:40:06.500]  About five of them were autistic, waving their arms in all directions.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.004]  The others, a couple were in wheelchairs.
[00:40:11.004 --> 00:40:16.109]  Others were acting real weird and screwed up just environmentally and socially from the television sets.
[00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:23.396]  About half the kids in there were totally soft killed.
[00:40:23.396 --> 00:40:24.157]  See, I'm awake.
[00:40:24.157 --> 00:40:25.258]  I have to look at this all day.
[00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:32.251]  And then I got cops harassing me the entire time I was down there and harassing everybody else.
[00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:33.492]  And it's the new way.
[00:40:33.492 --> 00:40:36.614]  Get in your face, make contact, get them in the system, get them ready.
[00:40:36.614 --> 00:40:39.856]  Because they've announced they're coming in our houses without warrants.
[00:40:39.856 --> 00:40:42.677]  They're going to have neighborhood watch people in our houses every week.
[00:40:42.677 --> 00:40:46.419]  This is inspections, government meetings, block captains.
[00:40:46.419 --> 00:40:49.321]  This is everything that was in Soviet Russia is here.
[00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:52.763]  The shut off of the economy, total tyranny, the end.
[00:40:52.763 --> 00:40:55.585]  And they're just going to pull us into it.
[00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.836]  They're going to collapse the economy.
[00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:03.797]  We're going into total world government.
[00:41:03.797 --> 00:41:11.479]  The good news is, and my parents saw this and were completely blown away, because it wasn't like every fifth car driving by, stopping, and seeing me.
[00:41:11.479 --> 00:41:16.981]  I could be up in the pop-up, getting a glass of water, and with my back turned, and they knew it was Alex Jones.
[00:41:19.088 --> 00:41:23.750]  I went in a little fishing place in Port Aransas, and the entire family were listeners.
[00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.530]  Restaurants, they were listeners.
[00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.511]  Everywhere I went, listeners.
[00:41:27.511 --> 00:41:30.592]  With a bald cap and my hair sticking out, they knew it was Alex Jones.
[00:41:30.592 --> 00:41:32.633]  My voice.
[00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:38.955]  I went and got some of the interviews, actually, with people in the car next to us, in the other car, and they go, you're Alex Jones.
[00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:44.797]  Yeah, they were just over here harassing us, telling us not to touch the sea turtles, stuff like that, when there are no sea turtles we can see.
[00:41:44.797 --> 00:41:47.078]  Just getting in our face, the environmental police.
[00:41:50.196 --> 00:41:51.217]  But that's the news.
[00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:54.640]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.862]  The globalists want to be hyper-dominant.
[00:41:56.862 --> 00:42:01.465]  They want to eradicate freedom, eradicate the family, because they know you owe allegiance to that.
[00:42:01.465 --> 00:42:08.051]  They want to eradicate any religion, just like China with the Falun Gong, because they want the state to be God.
[00:42:08.051 --> 00:42:09.352]  And they say that.
[00:42:09.352 --> 00:42:11.894]  This is an overthrow of humanity.
[00:42:11.894 --> 00:42:13.716]  This is an attempt to engineer us.
[00:42:17.842 --> 00:42:24.607]  into a abject tyranny, which is only in preparation for our death.
[00:42:24.607 --> 00:42:28.810]  That's why I have zero fear, even for my children and myself.
[00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.192]  Whatever happens, happens now.
[00:42:31.192 --> 00:42:36.456]  And that's actually a very strange feeling, because I always had a little bit of fear, which is a healthy thing.
[00:42:36.456 --> 00:42:40.840]  Now, I realize I'm facing pure, and you're facing pure
[00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:44.814]  One hundred and ten percent evil.
[00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:46.555]  I mean, it's so evil I can't even imagine it.
[00:42:46.555 --> 00:42:48.817]  So, a hundred and ten percent.
[00:42:48.817 --> 00:42:50.278]  People always say a hundred and ten percent.
[00:42:50.278 --> 00:42:53.140]  Well, that's because you can always go harder than you think you can.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.262]  So it's more like five hundred percent evil.
[00:42:56.262 --> 00:42:57.783]  One thousand percent evil.
[00:42:57.783 --> 00:43:08.912]  Because every time I think I'm plumbing the depths of how evil they are, I break through to an entire new catacomb of
[00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:19.671]  If the public knew what I knew and what my research team knew, if you only knew how horrible it is, there's got to be some way to turn this around.
[00:43:21.834 --> 00:43:26.417]  There's got to be a way to turn this around.
[00:43:26.417 --> 00:43:28.398]  We've got to wake people up.
[00:43:28.398 --> 00:43:29.639]  The public is in a trance.
[00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.300]  You can't get angry at them.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.002]  When people aren't awake, they're in a trance.
[00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:36.484]  And I want to warn the enforcers of this system.
[00:43:36.484 --> 00:43:51.634]  They get you when you're young, they psychologically test you, that you like to enforce, that you're either like a hunter type that likes to go out and hunt bad guys, but they just define good people as bad, or you're a control freak that likes to dominate and who's obsessive compulsive.
[00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:59.720]  I mean, you know, in the old days, cops would just drive by on the beach if they saw something or, you know, a problem, they came out and did something.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:09.828]  These feds were stopping at every other car just harassing people and eyeing everyone and getting in everyone's face and telling you, I'm federal law enforcement.
[00:44:09.828 --> 00:44:17.714]  I sat there for like 20 minutes just listening to one lecture my parents about not walking in the dunes.
[00:44:17.714 --> 00:44:19.416]  Even though it's not illegal, you shouldn't do it.
[00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:34.459]  And he would sit there, because my mother had her hands in front of her folded, you know, submissively listening, and I just sat there in the lawn chair watching this, watching the guy literally feed.
[00:44:34.459 --> 00:44:36.121]  And it was making me sad for him.
[00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:39.823]  He looked like he was mentally retarded.
[00:44:39.823 --> 00:44:42.445]  He's not the one I got photos and videos of later.
[00:44:42.445 --> 00:44:50.932]  He told us how he was from East Texas, and my little kids were coming over, talking to him, and he was just a poor little mindless idiot.
[00:44:55.151 --> 00:45:02.357]  And you know what, whenever I start crying on air, I involuntarily start having tears come out of my eyes, because I know what this country's already going through and where it's gonna go.
[00:45:02.357 --> 00:45:05.379]  And people say, oh, look at that fake crying.
[00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:13.966]  You know what, I wish it was fake, that I involuntarily sometimes lay down at night and just tears start coming out of my eyes.
[00:45:13.966 --> 00:45:20.511]  And you know, that's my brain saying, it's okay from the pain, here's some endorphins, because that's how much pain I'm feeling.
[00:45:25.697 --> 00:45:29.679]  I want to go to this report, because we're going to run out of time in this hour.
[00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:31.200]  I'm going to skip this break coming up.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.300]  The report says it all.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.182]  This is being censored all over YouTube.
[00:45:35.182 --> 00:45:45.567]  But if we're able to post it at Infowars.com, which we just did, even though they'll block it for parental reasons, which is their excuse, because it's embedded at Infowars.com, we'll still be able to get the link out.
[00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:48.028]  It's police hunt man for sport.
[00:45:48.028 --> 00:45:53.591]  Here is the report where he begs for daddy.
[00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:54.011]  Here it is.
[00:45:57.781 --> 00:46:00.306]  Well, hey, I'm sick of playing games.
[00:46:00.306 --> 00:46:02.471]  Which one is it?
[00:46:02.471 --> 00:46:06.740]  You've only cut out the cussing.
[00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.191]  We don't even have the part where the cop says, you see these fists?
[00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:18.072]  They're going to F you up.
[00:46:18.072 --> 00:46:28.577]  A year ago, InfoWars.com reported on the brutal, beating, tortured death of 37-year-old Kelly Thomas, born the same year I was.
[00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:30.477]  This is him before.
[00:46:30.477 --> 00:46:32.378]  By the way, his father's a retired police officer.
[00:46:32.378 --> 00:46:36.160]  He says he's ashamed of what police have turned into in this country.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.461]  And here he is after.
[00:46:39.577 --> 00:46:40.878]  And he didn't resist anything.
[00:46:40.878 --> 00:46:45.959]  It was all on video from the police surveillance system.
[00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:48.861]  They beat him to death over nine minutes.
[00:46:48.861 --> 00:46:49.621]  I'm sorry, dude!
[00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:49.901]  Please!
[00:46:49.901 --> 00:46:50.961]  Please, I'm sorry!
[00:46:57.024 --> 00:47:00.486]  A few days ago they released the video and we posted it on Infowars.com.
[00:47:00.486 --> 00:47:02.667]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:03.867]  I didn't go watch it.
[00:47:03.867 --> 00:47:07.789]  There's so much police brutality, tasering, murder, death.
[00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:09.650]  Let me tell you something folks.
[00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:11.852]  I could barely watch this.
[00:47:11.852 --> 00:47:13.633]  The cops are getting off on it.
[00:47:13.633 --> 00:47:15.774]  They play the game of saying don't move while they
[00:47:25.318 --> 00:47:36.153]  It's just like you'd imagine Jeffrey Dahmer while he was torturing people.
[00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:37.816]  And they just keep tasering and tasering.
[00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:44.538]  Remember, don't tase me, bro, with his hands up, did nothing.
[00:47:44.538 --> 00:47:46.440]  They want the power.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.681]  These are powerless people.
[00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:49.682]  You see, they've upped the power of tasers.
[00:47:49.682 --> 00:47:55.065]  They know that in the internal literature, all these systems are called less lethal.
[00:47:55.065 --> 00:48:00.569]  So they just train the public that they're basically able to torture us and then even kill us.
[00:48:00.569 --> 00:48:03.291]  It's all pain compliance.
[00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:06.013]  And they're training police on all this and just normalizing it.
[00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:08.834]  This is what they're going to turn loose on everybody.
[00:48:08.834 --> 00:48:12.396]  And they're trying to get all the cops to become these demon creatures.
[00:48:12.396 --> 00:48:15.537]  And it is, it is, it is really disgusting.
[00:48:15.537 --> 00:48:19.379]  And the culture of just worshipping police no matter what is what has allowed this.
[00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:22.800]  Now they're charging one cop a second degree murder, another with manslaughter.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.941]  No, folks, this is torture.
[00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:25.842]  And probably the only reason
[00:48:27.045 --> 00:48:40.914]  These guys are even getting charged is that the guy's dad was a retired well-known police officer in the area and spoke out and they're like, well, since your son was a son of a god, an upper class, you know, minion of the New World Order, we're going to do something about it.
[00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:44.437]  Now more cars arrive and it's just the beating with the batons.
[00:48:44.437 --> 00:48:54.824]  Well, you saw the damage, just the enjoyment, the piranha or really what I'd call the orgy type feeding frenzy of the sharks.
[00:48:54.824 --> 00:48:55.484]  It's pretty bad.
[00:48:55.484 --> 00:48:56.765]  Now the begging for daddy's coming up.
[00:49:00.267 --> 00:49:10.235]  Beating with baton in the head, crushing the throat, ribs, internal organs.
[00:49:10.235 --> 00:49:17.340]  Thorax.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.923]  Daddy's not coming.
[00:49:21.923 --> 00:49:25.386]  By the way, police, you know this is all going to come back on your kids.
[00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:26.327]  That's how God works.
[00:49:27.657 --> 00:49:30.939]  I wonder what Dad did as a police officer.
[00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:34.561]  Your families are going to be killed by your own people.
[00:49:34.561 --> 00:49:36.142]  And they're going to get cancer.
[00:49:36.142 --> 00:49:37.943]  That's how the universe works.
[00:49:37.943 --> 00:49:39.604]  Hear him beg for Daddy?
[00:49:39.604 --> 00:49:48.110]  The universe is coming for your kids.
[00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.952]  And then he begins sobbing like a child for Daddy.
[00:49:51.932 --> 00:49:56.677]  That's what people do, generally, before they pass out and, well, then later die.
[00:49:56.677 --> 00:49:59.820]  And the police are really enjoying it and getting off on it.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.841]  I've seen footage and videos.
[00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:06.045]  It's in my film, Martial Law, where they're breaking a pro-lifer's arms.
[00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:08.628]  So there's the face of the New World Order.
[00:50:10.017 --> 00:50:11.578]  And they killed this guy.
[00:50:11.578 --> 00:50:21.267]  And then after they've pretty much killed him, you know, he died later at the hospital, when he's laying there with his blood pouring out in all directions, they all basically act like they want to have a cigarette, like they just had sex or something.
[00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:25.330]  I mean, there's a real satisfaction congratulating each other coming up.
[00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.133]  So, you know, they've gone out and bagged a trophy.
[00:50:28.133 --> 00:50:31.496]  A homeless guy hadn't done anything wrong, who, by the way, was mentally ill.
[00:50:32.975 --> 00:50:34.015]  How do you want to pull this down?
[00:51:06.555 --> 00:51:09.357]  He's still gonna fight.
[00:51:09.357 --> 00:51:10.037]  Yeah.
[00:51:10.037 --> 00:51:11.798]  He's still fighting, dude.
[00:51:11.798 --> 00:51:12.219]  Relax.
[00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:12.819]  Relax.
[00:51:12.819 --> 00:51:13.480]  Relax.
[00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:29.673]  Alright, they're crushing his throat now.
[00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:34.119]  And stomping on every body part.
[00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:38.124]  Doesn't get any better than this right here.
[00:51:47.402 --> 00:51:58.826]  And it's all about their force continuum, and how they're the boss, and they're gonna win, you're gonna lose.
[00:51:58.826 --> 00:52:08.690]  No, like all tyrants that rationalize their sadistic activity, you guys are the ones that are gonna pay.
[00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:12.912]  The fact is, they don't help me, nobody's gonna help you, son.
[00:52:12.912 --> 00:52:14.072]  You're dead!
[00:52:14.072 --> 00:52:15.373]  You know, my grandfather worked in
[00:52:17.262 --> 00:52:20.363]  Less lethal weapons development.
[00:52:20.363 --> 00:52:26.286]  Developed a taser robot, a remote control system, sold to the Pentagon.
[00:52:26.286 --> 00:52:29.827]  They never mass-developed it, but they were told to call it non-lethal.
[00:52:29.827 --> 00:52:32.168]  This was back in the 60s.
[00:52:32.168 --> 00:52:34.489]  But they know they're lethal.
[00:52:34.489 --> 00:52:35.410]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.431]  They just train us with rubber bullets and all the rest of it and kill people all the time.
[00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:39.971]  They're just getting everybody ready for it.
[00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:42.332]  And then you talk back, they use it on you.
[00:52:42.332 --> 00:52:45.494]  It's all about all these people that crave authority, getting into these positions.
[00:52:46.714 --> 00:52:48.935]  And, again, the begging for daddy just goes on and on.
[00:52:48.935 --> 00:52:50.676]  This made me sick watching it.
[00:52:50.676 --> 00:52:54.138]  But, you know, for him, he got to die quickly, though.
[00:52:54.138 --> 00:53:02.121]  Not like all these kids that, you know, the formula's more than half corn syrup and the diabetes exploding or the cancer viruses and the vaccines or the way the globals kill us.
[00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:04.523]  Because, see, these guys like to kill people there on the ground.
[00:53:04.523 --> 00:53:09.285]  The Rockefellers and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they like to go real slow through soft kill.
[00:53:09.285 --> 00:53:11.086]  And, you know, all these cops are taking soft kill.
[00:53:12.166 --> 00:53:16.308]  See, there's bigger, badder demons than you boys up above you.
[00:53:16.308 --> 00:53:18.869]  It's all about their force continuum.
[00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:21.831]  Well, he didn't comply properly.
[00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:24.632]  They gave him an order to put hands on his head, hands on his knees.
[00:53:24.632 --> 00:53:25.312]  He said, which one?
[00:53:25.312 --> 00:53:26.053]  The guy said, that's it.
[00:53:26.053 --> 00:53:27.193]  You see my fist?
[00:53:27.193 --> 00:53:28.274]  I'm going to F you up.
[00:53:28.274 --> 00:53:28.894]  Get on the ground.
[00:53:28.894 --> 00:53:32.196]  He gets on the ground, and the murdering starts.
[00:53:32.196 --> 00:53:34.937]  Ha ha, yeah.
[00:53:34.937 --> 00:53:38.459]  Oh, it's so good to be a psychopath in America and get to torture people to death.
[00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:43.662]  Just like Abu Ghraib, the Army Zone reports where they rape children in front of their parents.
[00:53:43.662 --> 00:53:45.243]  And people have been defending that.
[00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:45.804]  Well, not me.
[00:53:45.804 --> 00:53:46.784]  I don't want any part of it.
[00:53:46.784 --> 00:53:48.806]  Any part of your demonic New World Order.
[00:53:48.806 --> 00:53:49.806]  Or fetal parts.
[00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:51.828]  Fetal tissue in the Pepsi.
[00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:52.648]  Or the cosmetics.
[00:53:52.648 --> 00:53:54.590]  I don't want any part of it.
[00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.290]  Alright, America.
[00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:56.051]  You want evil?
[00:53:56.051 --> 00:53:57.111]  You're going to be judged by it.
[00:53:58.292 --> 00:54:00.134]  To be quite honest, I can't even watch the entire thing.
[00:54:00.134 --> 00:54:01.555]  I've watched pieces of it.
[00:54:01.555 --> 00:54:03.336]  I've watched about 90% of it.
[00:54:03.336 --> 00:54:04.557]  It is unbelievable.
[00:54:04.557 --> 00:54:09.961]  We'll post this video and the full video up at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:11.762]  I guess we need to start watching more of this.
[00:54:11.762 --> 00:54:15.005]  This was out like 4 or 5 days ago and I just couldn't look at it.
[00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:17.787]  But I made myself this morning and it shook me to my core.
[00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.608]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:54:42.815 --> 00:54:45.237]  Hey look he's a vegetable!
[00:54:45.237 --> 00:54:48.741]  Remember cops, all your kids are going to be out on the street with that too.
[00:54:51.826 --> 00:54:54.487]  You know what comes around goes around.
[00:54:54.487 --> 00:54:57.689]  Better be repenting to God real quick.
[00:54:57.689 --> 00:54:58.969]  It just goes on from there.
[00:54:58.969 --> 00:55:06.853]  And believe me, we didn't show half the beating and the tasering and the cops walking around with satisfied looks, bowing their arms out.
[00:55:06.853 --> 00:55:08.014]  Yeah, we're real tough.
[00:55:08.014 --> 00:55:10.855]  The guy got on the ground and we killed him.
[00:55:10.855 --> 00:55:12.096]  Yeah, we're real men.
[00:55:12.096 --> 00:55:13.957]  We're gonna show you.
[00:55:15.017 --> 00:55:17.980]  And you just win and win and win and win and win, don't you?
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.343]  Every day you just keep having victories over us.
[00:55:20.343 --> 00:55:29.373]  And again, I focus on the police because the New World Order is taking them and twisting them right now and turning them into their battle axe to use against the American people.
[00:55:29.373 --> 00:55:36.180]  I know most police are out there actually trying to help the community, but the feds are coming in.
[00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:50.162]  With all of this training, where they kick a pregnant woman in the stomach if she doesn't jump fast enough, or taser old ladies, and now they're upping the power of the tasers, the less lethal munition.
[00:55:50.162 --> 00:55:53.706]  And it's admittedly causing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of deaths.
[00:55:53.706 --> 00:55:54.187]  It's over 500 now.
[00:55:55.748 --> 00:55:58.110]  And they like that idea that you could die.
[00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:00.631]  By the way, they have the cops get tasered, too, in their training.
[00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:04.073]  A lot of cops are getting heart problems and stuff from it.
[00:56:04.073 --> 00:56:06.095]  Better not do that macho stuff.
[00:56:06.095 --> 00:56:10.137]  See, they want you to do it so they can legally say, well, our guys have done it.
[00:56:10.137 --> 00:56:11.498]  No, sir!
[00:56:11.498 --> 00:56:14.240]  It can screw up the little nerves in your heart.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.901]  I don't care how big and tough you are.
[00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:17.602]  In fact, they've done some studies.
[00:56:17.602 --> 00:56:20.544]  The bigger an athlete you are, the better a shape you're in.
[00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:32.716]  The worst high voltages for your heart cells, the little cells that control, you know, that's what they, when those go out, that's what they put a pacemaker in, to get a little electrical charge.
[00:56:32.716 --> 00:56:35.678]  You see, you don't want to be tasered.
[00:56:35.678 --> 00:56:44.102]  You don't want to be, one time I fell asleep at a party in college and they, they stun gunned me.
[00:56:44.102 --> 00:56:46.703]  Not, it wasn't even a very powerful one back then, my foot.
[00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:50.185]  And then I woke up and I hadn't even been drinking and threw up
[00:56:50.865 --> 00:56:54.188]  Whatever it did to me, I woke up and was like, oh, and threw up.
[00:56:54.188 --> 00:56:55.930]  The voltage had that effect.
[00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.392]  Imagine what these tasers are doing to people.
[00:56:58.392 --> 00:57:00.374]  It is incredible.
[00:57:00.374 --> 00:57:03.637]  And they're just upping and upping and upping the power.
[00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:05.079]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:57:05.079 --> 00:57:06.560]  At the 8 after, we're going to get our guest on.
[00:57:07.489 --> 00:57:15.052]  In the second segment of the next hour, Tim Larkin, former Navy SEAL, he's been banned from England because you're not allowed to teach the public shelf defense.
[00:57:15.052 --> 00:57:20.834]  The police officers are facing one second degree murder, the other's manslaughter, the other may be charged.
[00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:29.257]  But I mean, when you're dropkicking and dropping your knee like you're watching Hulk Hogan from two, three feet in the air onto somebody's neck, I mean, come on.
[00:57:29.257 --> 00:57:30.598]  That's how you kill somebody, Bubba.
[00:57:31.394 --> 00:57:32.435]  Anybody knows that.
[00:57:32.435 --> 00:57:42.179]  And by the way, they train police in how to punch people in the throat, how to punch people in the side of the arteries, how to, once they bend over, how to hit them in the back of the neck.
[00:57:42.179 --> 00:57:43.700]  They're trained on all this.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:50.924]  And these guys watch UFC, they got a guy held down, and they beat him to death.
[00:57:50.924 --> 00:57:54.806]  And it happens all the time.
[00:57:54.806 --> 00:57:57.467]  Happens all, I mean, people get killed all the time getting punched once.
[00:58:00.336 --> 00:58:03.217]  You punch somebody, you knock them out, they hit their head on the concrete.
[00:58:03.217 --> 00:58:04.917]  What did they think happened here?
[00:58:04.917 --> 00:58:10.838]  And so, I mean, he's sitting there moaning for daddy and they're saying, don't resist, I'm going to taser you again, just because he's begging.
[00:58:10.838 --> 00:58:16.299]  You know, there's nothing worse than that feeling of claustrophobia when everybody's piled on top of you.
[00:58:16.299 --> 00:58:17.740]  That ever happen in football?
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.220]  They're just like, oh, get up, get up.
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.300]  You can't breathe.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.841]  Imagine that going on for nine, ten minutes while they just steadily
[00:58:24.912 --> 00:58:31.957]  Take the butt of the taser and bash your eyeballs out, crush your nose off, break your jaw, and then just go, you know what?
[00:58:31.957 --> 00:58:32.798]  It looks too good.
[00:58:32.798 --> 00:58:35.780]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna hit you in the throat a bunch.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:43.546]  Kinda like that guy they had in handcuffs in San Francisco that shot in the back.
[00:58:43.546 --> 00:58:47.269]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.544 --> 00:58:56.048]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:56.048 --> 00:58:58.450]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:07.557]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:07.557 --> 00:59:11.000]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.681]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:12.681 --> 00:59:14.963]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:59:14.963 --> 00:59:17.465]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:18.626 --> 00:59:20.047]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:20.047 --> 00:59:21.468]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:21.468 --> 00:59:24.630]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.013]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:28.013 --> 00:59:29.934]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:59:29.934 --> 00:59:32.156]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:32.156 --> 00:59:34.898]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:34.898 --> 00:59:36.479]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:36.479 --> 00:59:39.802]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:59:39.802 --> 00:59:45.046]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[00:59:46.988 --> 00:59:48.289]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:54.456]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.198]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:11.779]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.522]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.522 --> 01:00:21.584]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:38.011]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, Tim Larkin, a master hand-to-hand combat expert.
[01:00:38.011 --> 01:00:40.111]  Trains US military, police, you name it.
[01:00:40.111 --> 01:00:46.813]  He's been banned in the UK saying his training is too violent to defend yourself.
[01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:51.573]  And so we're going to be talking to him coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:54.434]  UK banned self-defense expert from entering country.
[01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:58.054]  Government wants a nation of cowardly, defenseless victims.
[01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:00.935]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:03.197]  Very, very important.
[01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:05.884]  I'll be on this about 45 minutes.
[01:01:05.884 --> 01:01:11.197]  Then we are going to get into all the other world news.
[01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:14.102]  Like this report.
[01:01:14.102 --> 01:01:20.968]  Why is the Obama administration allowing the Chinese government to buy up U.S.
[01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:25.432]  oil and gas deposits worth billions of dollars inside the U.S.?
[01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:29.116]  Just south of Austin, they bought up several billion dollars of natural gas.
[01:01:29.116 --> 01:01:32.018]  Lawmakers, again, stay largely silent.
[01:01:32.919 --> 01:01:34.959]  Over Chinese takeover of U.S.
[01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.140]  bank branches.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.840]  That's out of the Hill newspaper.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.881]  And I've got another report here where they're buying up giant areas of land.
[01:01:42.881 --> 01:01:44.321]  The government!
[01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:47.802]  I don't care unless somebody came here who was Chinese and wanted to become an American citizen and got land.
[01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:48.702]  That's fine.
[01:01:48.702 --> 01:01:49.842]  That's the American dream.
[01:01:49.842 --> 01:01:54.343]  But the government has got over 6,000 front companies in this nation.
[01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:57.784]  The Justice Department estimates that.
[01:01:57.784 --> 01:01:58.564]  Probably a lot worse.
[01:01:59.676 --> 01:02:04.838]  One of the Justice Department's shipping them guns like fast and furious, so we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:02:04.838 --> 01:02:07.199]  Very, very serious situation.
[01:02:07.199 --> 01:02:14.883]  Also, we have another report here, what the government should be worried about and what isn't in the Constitution for the feds to deal with.
[01:02:14.883 --> 01:02:17.384]  49 headless corpses found in northern Mexico.
[01:02:17.384 --> 01:02:21.565]  They found 30-something on the Arizona side of the border just a few weeks ago.
[01:02:21.565 --> 01:02:23.086]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:02:23.086 --> 01:02:24.987]  But, you know what, that's not a threat.
[01:02:26.215 --> 01:02:30.039]  Dianne Feinstein says, get ready for more aggressive molestation at the airport.
[01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.561]  She told Fox News that.
[01:02:32.561 --> 01:02:35.984]  It's in an article at Infowars.com by Kurt Nemo.
[01:02:35.984 --> 01:02:43.691]  And they go on to say, because of the new underwear bombing that's so scared, so frightening, the land of the free and home of the brave has to fall to its knees.
[01:02:43.691 --> 01:02:45.312]  And we meant to have strip searches now.
[01:02:45.312 --> 01:02:47.534]  First they denied they were strip searching old women.
[01:02:47.534 --> 01:02:48.735]  Now they say, no.
[01:02:48.735 --> 01:02:50.337]  Now we're going to take your wives and children.
[01:02:51.195 --> 01:02:53.895]  Back there, because the TSA people like it.
[01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:59.256]  You know, every week I read about TSA caught with child porn or raping kids or raping people.
[01:02:59.256 --> 01:03:00.757]  And that's the point I've made.
[01:03:00.757 --> 01:03:01.857]  Who wants a job?
[01:03:01.857 --> 01:03:10.838]  The one thing, if you, you know, probable cause, you check to see if somebody has a weapon, you can, you know, actually see without grabbing their genitals if they have a weapon.
[01:03:10.838 --> 01:03:14.199]  No, this is, this is, this is everybody's guilt until proven innocent.
[01:03:14.199 --> 01:03:16.540]  And we're going to, oh, you're a movie star.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.080]  We're going to stick our hands on your pants.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.980]  You're Miss USA.
[01:03:20.819 --> 01:03:22.780]  They know who you are.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.721]  So this is the political correctness gone wild.
[01:03:25.721 --> 01:03:29.803]  We don't profile, we just say everybody has no rights.
[01:03:29.803 --> 01:03:35.146]  Well, that's the Soviet model at its best.
[01:03:35.146 --> 01:03:37.667]  And we've got some reports on that.
[01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:38.427]  Here's one.
[01:03:38.427 --> 01:03:44.370]  TSA flags 18-month-old baby as terrorist, forces family to disembark plane.
[01:03:45.603 --> 01:03:48.846]  Oh yeah, they put one-year-olds, or even younger, on the terror list.
[01:03:48.846 --> 01:03:51.128]  They say, hey, my son's a baby.
[01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:53.090]  You know, Bob Jones is a common name.
[01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:53.891]  It's always names like that.
[01:03:53.891 --> 01:03:55.212]  And they go, we don't care.
[01:03:55.212 --> 01:03:56.533]  No judge, no jury, you don't fly.
[01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:59.636]  And now they say, you're going to be on a no-gun-buy list.
[01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:00.497]  No judge, no jury.
[01:04:00.497 --> 01:04:03.740]  They just say, you don't buy guns anymore.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.183]  Just like Obama can launch wars in Libya, and Congress says, you've got to get approval.
[01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:08.845]  And they say, we don't get approval anymore.
[01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:09.586]  We do whatever we want.
[01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:13.600]  Oh look, HPD.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.544]  Pregnant woman raped by security guard at Greyhound bus station.
[01:04:17.544 --> 01:04:22.149]  Took her in the security office, allegedly, and raped her.
[01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:24.271]  See, who watches the watchers?
[01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:26.754]  Who protects us from the system?
[01:04:26.754 --> 01:04:30.018]  Because, you know, we all know the system is corrupt in North Korea and Guatemala.
[01:04:31.078 --> 01:04:32.259]  And many other places.
[01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:33.619]  We don't want to become that here.
[01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:37.241]  And that's what we have the Bill of Rights and Constitution for.
[01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:39.983]  Also coming up, big news on the economic front.

[01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:51.209]  Totally jam-packed broadcast.

[01:04:56.072 --> 01:04:56.953]  It's pretty interesting.

[01:08:13.462 --> 01:08:17.646]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.646 --> 01:08:25.613]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.613 --> 01:08:28.616]  Alright, late last week we ran the headline.
[01:08:28.616 --> 01:08:30.157]  It was also reported on the BBC.
[01:08:32.165 --> 01:08:35.248]  UK bans self-defense experts from entering the country.
[01:08:35.248 --> 01:08:37.730]  That story's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:41.253]  Government wants a nation of cowardly, defenseless victims.
[01:08:41.253 --> 01:08:49.060]  What's happening is you've got people coming in from Eastern Europe, third world countries, very, you know, aggressive, crime-plagued areas.
[01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:56.403]  Who are pretty tough and they run into the now desensitized brainwashed Brits.
[01:08:56.403 --> 01:09:00.365]  And I got two crew members, Paul Watson and Steve Watson, who live there and work there.
[01:09:00.365 --> 01:09:07.847]  And they describe it as that, that when people get attacked or somebody's wife gets attacked, the average person just lays down and takes it.
[01:09:07.847 --> 01:09:11.269]  I've seen cases where a woman is in her house being attacked.
[01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:14.450]  She stabbed someone with a butcher knife and they arrest her.
[01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.152]  There's many famous cases of this.
[01:09:18.152 --> 01:09:23.895]  And so they just go after you if you defend yourself because the government wants the power monopoly.
[01:09:25.974 --> 01:09:33.518]  And Tim Larkin heads up one of the leading groups out there, TargetFocusTraining.com.
[01:09:33.518 --> 01:09:38.320]  Here's the headline, I never dreamed I would come to this, but they banned me in the UK.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.301]  Is my training too violent?
[01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.802]  This will be some of the best business he ever gets.
[01:09:42.802 --> 01:09:44.883]  Not that he needs it.
[01:09:44.883 --> 01:09:53.027]  For over 20 years, he has headed up and run and created the organization Target Focus Training.
[01:09:54.494 --> 01:10:02.541]  And Tim Larkin has been well known in the self-defense and combat close training world, but under the radar to ordinary folks like you.
[01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:04.463]  He's the guy operations like the U.S.
[01:10:04.463 --> 01:10:05.283]  Navy SEALs, U.S.
[01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:06.244]  Special Forces, U.S.
[01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:09.006]  Border Patrol call in behind the scenes to teach them.
[01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:11.788]  When it is kill or be killed.
[01:10:11.788 --> 01:10:26.117]  During the last 20 years he's trained not only the elite military special forces and law enforcement units but corporate and civilian clientele in New York, Las Vegas, London and other cities around the world using a combination of live training sessions and DVDs.
[01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:31.740]  A Saudi Republic speaker Larkin has spoken to CEOs, government officials and business leaders in over 40 countries.
[01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:41.141]  on how to use the same principles of surviving life or death violence in the less life-threatening environment of business.
[01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:42.382]  And he joins us now again.
[01:10:42.382 --> 01:10:46.725]  TargetFocusTraining.com is the website.
[01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:48.727]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:10:48.727 --> 01:10:49.347]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:10:49.347 --> 01:10:52.130]  I appreciate it.
[01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:54.471]  Why do you think you've been banned from the UK?
[01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:55.993]  I mean, break that down, how that happened.
[01:10:59.795 --> 01:11:05.662]  I think obviously it's a gross misunderstanding of who I am, what I do, and also I think it
[01:11:08.476 --> 01:11:17.642]  I think it was a quick reaction to some comments that were made after the riots in August.
[01:11:17.642 --> 01:11:27.009]  And I'm pretty sure that people just did a quick view of a couple of articles of who I was and didn't really look into my background at all and thought it would be just an easy fix.
[01:11:27.009 --> 01:11:33.413]  I think they thought they were banning somebody who was kind of a kill-em-all-like-God-sort-em-out type of guy.
[01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:47.843]  You know, when I was banned, you know, when I found out at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas on Tuesday, when I was presented the letter, that I would not be allowed to travel to the UK anymore.
[01:11:47.843 --> 01:11:51.825]  It really, you know, it's quite of a shock.
[01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:56.508]  Well, it's also a dangerous police state development when they ban Michael Savage and others.
[01:11:56.508 --> 01:12:02.752]  They've tried to block me from coming into Canada but became a big diplomatic fight and they had to back off.
[01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:03.233]  But, I mean,
[01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:05.729]  Now they're talking about not letting U.S.
[01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:10.957]  citizens leave if they claim we haven't paid our taxes, but there's no judge or jury involved.
[01:12:10.957 --> 01:12:13.540]  I mean, this is also an issue of just being able to travel.
[01:12:16.158 --> 01:12:17.259]  It's ridiculous.
[01:12:17.259 --> 01:12:28.510]  I mean, it's one of those things where the way the law is written on this particular law, too, is it's written in such a way that it's so vague that you really have very little wiggle room.
[01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.131]  You can't use comparisons.
[01:12:30.131 --> 01:12:36.717]  You can't say, well, you've allowed in, you know, X, Y, and Z who have, you know, resumes that you wouldn't believe.
[01:12:37.874 --> 01:13:02.691]  And you can't say that, you know, here I am a law-abiding citizen, you know, with a 20-year-plus history of going to the UK as a military officer and also as a professional contractor with zero incident, with never been cited for even a parking ticket, let alone, you know, inciting vigilantism, and just haphazardly get presented in a very dramatic fashion this letter at an airport here in the U.S.
[01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:12.165]  Well regardless of what we think of Michael Savage's political views, just because he criticizes radical Islam, they banned him from going to the UK.
[01:13:12.165 --> 01:13:16.128]  They're talking about banning people like him from other countries.
[01:13:16.128 --> 01:13:17.750]  Were you aware of Michael Savage's case?
[01:13:18.581 --> 01:13:22.004]  Yes it was, and that's why it was funny.
[01:13:22.004 --> 01:13:35.556]  When some of these comments were coming out in September about me, I dismissed it only because the Fleet Street media over in the UK is very sensational.
[01:13:37.137 --> 01:13:37.457]  I don't know.
[01:13:53.570 --> 01:14:08.441]  I've had lots of coverage in some of the bigger media and I figured, of course, people can see this balances out very quickly and people can make a quick decision of who I am and what my background is.
[01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:15.707]  I quickly decided that that's probably not the case and I better pay more attention to things like this in the future.
[01:14:16.155 --> 01:14:28.665]  Well, let's expand on that, because I know you want to be a neo-nice sport about this, but I'm sure you've seen the famous cases, because it's been in the news over the years, where they arrest people that defend themselves on the street or even their home.
[01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:31.307]  So the UK is the ultimate nanny state.
[01:14:31.307 --> 01:14:39.534]  Those in control there, in the bureaucracy, they do not want the people in the UK learning that they can defend themselves for whatever reason.
[01:14:39.534 --> 01:14:44.197]  I mean, do you disagree with that statement, or why do you think they have this anti-self-defense view?
[01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:47.272]  Oh no, Alex, let me be really clear.
[01:14:47.272 --> 01:14:54.016]  I've been very, you know, I think part of the reason I've got the media attention in the past is because I'll highlight a case.
[01:14:54.016 --> 01:14:57.918]  I'll highlight a case, you know, you nailed a couple on the intro.
[01:14:57.918 --> 01:14:59.018]  I'll highlight a case like this.
[01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:15.719]  And I tend to talk to them about, you know, the long history the UK had right up until about 1920 and then radically took a turn in the 1950s to where it was, you know, they actually have pretty similar self-defense laws to us.
[01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:16.820]  Well you're an expert on this.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:17.881]  Give us some of that history.
[01:15:18.702 --> 01:15:30.895]  Well, you know, the real thing is, you know, when you go back, their greatest justice was Justice Blackstone, and he basically said personal responsibility is the most, you know, is inherent in every citizen.
[01:15:30.895 --> 01:15:35.339]  Basically, you know, it's not up to the state to protect you first, it's you.
[01:15:35.339 --> 01:15:37.281]  You protect yourself and your family.
[01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:39.764]  And that pretty much held true up until about 1920.
[01:15:41.645 --> 01:15:50.747]  That's when they enacted a firearms act that basically severely restricted who could get firearms.
[01:15:50.747 --> 01:16:02.869]  The reasoning was supposedly for protection, but as most very sober analysts have looked at it, it was far more of a fear of insurrection of the population than that.
[01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.111]  Totally pro-gun.
[01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.053]  It's the way this country developed, and I'm fine with that.
[01:16:11.053 --> 01:16:13.935]  Where it really took a turn for the worse was in the 50s.
[01:16:13.935 --> 01:16:26.343]  In the 50s, there was an act that was put out by Parliament that said it was absolutely illegal for you as a citizen to help out somebody else.
[01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.864]  They always use criminals as a pretext to take our rights.
[01:16:56.051 --> 01:17:17.060]  Absolutely and you know this is something that you know you sit there and you say the idea was the Brits would like you know you in the UK there's still a very strong feeling amongst the authorities this is not the population but amongst the authorities they want to keep it that you always have a first responder that the police are the obvious
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:27.648]  Well, the Metropolitan Police for London came out about three years ago and said, we are no longer capable of being first responders.
[01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:34.553]  And so I've always been very pro victim, pro law-abiding citizen.
[01:17:36.534 --> 01:17:42.995]  And my method of training self-defense is controversial because I give the full picture.
[01:17:42.995 --> 01:17:49.077]  And that's where they try to ban me, that's where they try to say I'm an extremist.
[01:17:49.077 --> 01:17:58.539]  But if you do get in a fight with somebody, I mean you do, if they're attacking you, you want to get them off you as quickly as possible so they can't hurt you, then the only way to do that is to hurt them.
[01:17:59.298 --> 01:18:14.890]  Well, what I do, and this is worldwide, I mean, you know, we train all over the world, and what I try to educate people about is, as soon as you cross that physical plane, Alex, as soon as you put your hands on another person, no matter what your intentions were, you don't know where it's going to end up.
[01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:26.360]  And therefore, the incident that you choose to cross that physical plane better be justified, meaning it better be a situation that truly warrants you using physical action on somebody, because
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.763]  Even if you're trying to do things like, you know, just shut a guy up.
[01:18:30.763 --> 01:18:38.389]  You know, I have clients that'll come in and say, oh yeah, you know, just, I don't want to kill the guy, but just show me how to put his hands on, you know, how can I shut this guy up?
[01:18:38.389 --> 01:18:40.031]  You know, can I punch him in the solar plexus?
[01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:42.313]  And I'll say, sure, you can punch him in the solar plexus.
[01:18:42.313 --> 01:18:45.315]  I said, and yeah, that'll take his air, all things being equal.
[01:18:45.315 --> 01:18:53.482]  But then again, he could look like Schwarzenegger in his prime, and you hit him in the solar plexus, and all of a sudden he turns purple, grabs his heart,
[01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:56.524]  And you don't realize that, you know, he has a genetically bad heart.
[01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:58.806]  You've just caused an arrhythmia and the guy dies.
[01:18:58.806 --> 01:18:59.446]  Over what?
[01:18:59.446 --> 01:19:01.308]  Because he spilled a drink on you?
[01:19:01.308 --> 01:19:08.874]  So what I do is I spend a lot of time, you know, talking about what is avoidable and what is not avoidable.
[01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:14.739]  Now, where the media ignores me is, especially in the UK, which really just irritates me,
[01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:18.781]  I'm the first one to talk about all the avoidable, you know, the pub fights.
[01:19:18.781 --> 01:19:23.404]  There's lots of gratuitous anti-social aggression in the UK.
[01:19:23.404 --> 01:19:29.868]  There's lots of pub fights, football hooliganism, a lot of avoidable violence that people tend to get involved with.
[01:19:29.868 --> 01:19:35.752]  Which is what the authorities try to say anybody like me is advocating.
[01:19:35.752 --> 01:19:37.253]  That I'm thinking that you gotta get out.
[01:19:37.253 --> 01:19:41.056]  No, the thugs are acting like that because they know they're dealing with a bunch of sheep.
[01:19:41.636 --> 01:19:45.979]  Stay there, we're going to come right back and I want you to break this down.
[01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:58.266]  And then I want to bring an example in, Kelly Thomas and the police are using techniques on somebody who it looks like is not resisting into the confrontation and they kill him.
[01:19:58.266 --> 01:19:59.707]  So I want to break that down straight ahead.
[01:20:00.914 --> 01:20:01.935]  Attention all U.S.
[01:20:01.935 --> 01:20:02.475]  drivers!
[01:20:02.475 --> 01:20:09.680]  Do you own a vehicle with less than 150,000 miles, with a manufacturer's warranty about to expire, or no warranty coverage at all?
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:20.267]  In order to aid the American people with saving thousands on future auto repair costs during these hard economic times, VSC America is now offering an affordable, low-cost coverage plan to the general public.
[01:20:20.507 --> 01:20:26.530]  As of today, you could be one of millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle protected under this coverage.
[01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:31.712]  Those who qualify will have all future covered auto repair bills paid directly to the repair shop for them.
[01:20:31.712 --> 01:20:35.314]  You pick your plan, you pick your deductible, you even pick the repair shop.
[01:20:35.314 --> 01:20:39.156]  Roadside service, towing, and rental coverage is included with all plans.
[01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:41.857]  All this at a fraction of what many dealerships are charging.
[01:20:41.997 --> 01:20:46.600]  So call now for your free 5-minute quote and see if you qualify.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.841]  The number to call is 1-800-493-7561.

[01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:48.322]  Again, that's 1-800-493-7561.
[01:20:48.322 --> 01:20:49.162]  37 things to hoard.
[01:20:49.162 --> 01:20:51.864]  Do you have the 37 crucial food items you can't survive without?
[01:20:51.864 --> 01:20:54.586]  When disaster hits and mobs go crazy grabbing food off their shelves,

[01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:35.044]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:21:35.044 --> 01:21:43.253]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:21:43.253 --> 01:21:48.558]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.

[01:22:00.126 --> 01:22:02.047]  This year about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:03.387]  homes will have a break-in.
[01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:04.808]  That's almost 1 per block.
[01:22:04.808 --> 01:22:06.368]  Will that 1 home be yours?
[01:22:06.368 --> 01:22:10.750]  Well, I found an amazing little gadget to keep the bad guys fooled and it's called Fake TV.
[01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:16.331]  Fake TV is a low-cost, small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV.
[01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.752]  When you go on summer vacation,
[01:22:18.092 --> 01:22:24.496]  Yes, get rid of the obvious signs you're away by stopping the mail and the paper, but go a step further in fooling crooks with fake TV.
[01:22:24.496 --> 01:22:27.598]  At only $34.95, what?
[01:22:27.598 --> 01:22:28.939]  That can't be right!
[01:22:28.939 --> 01:22:37.345]  Yes, for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked and all your possessions gone.
[01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:42.208]  Fake TV simulates the light from a real TV and can be programmed just like a lamp on a timer.
[01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:46.891]  Use fake TV in any room for just $34.95 and get additional fake TVs for only $29.95.

[01:24:25.424 --> 01:24:39.654]  Tim Larkin of TargetFocusTraining.com, one of the leading self-defense experts out there, and he really is, everybody says they are, but we've done other research, you know, trains government, military, police, you name it, is our guest.
[01:24:39.654 --> 01:24:54.964]  This is a short segment, and I kind of sprung that on you because I had the article here in front of me, and during the break you said, no, I'd really like to talk about Kelly Thomas, father, retired police officer, schizophrenic, everybody knew him in the town, not a bad guy, and he's tired of the cops talking to him all the time.
[01:24:55.744 --> 01:24:58.225]  As I say, hey, I'm gonna F you up with these fists.
[01:24:58.225 --> 01:25:01.386]  They start swatting him, he gets on the ground.
[01:25:01.386 --> 01:25:03.487]  Because again, there's another side to this.
[01:25:03.487 --> 01:25:13.770]  The police now know all these techniques to kill people with their fists, and they're using it and enjoying it and killing a lot of people.
[01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:15.411]  What's your take on that, Mr. Larkin?
[01:25:16.587 --> 01:25:30.913]  Yeah, you know, what I think the problem is, it's kind of a problem inherent in most training in the industry, is there's lots of talks about hit here, kick here, control here, do this, and there's no discussion on trauma to the human body.
[01:25:30.913 --> 01:25:36.316]  There's no background on what can actually happen to the human body when you put systemic traumas like that into it.
[01:25:36.316 --> 01:25:38.176]  And that's the biggest problem, especially with the police.
[01:25:39.757 --> 01:25:44.218]  What I'm finding is there's a two-fold thing going on with the cops you have to realize.
[01:25:44.218 --> 01:25:46.659]  One, there's a lot of good cops out there as we all know.
[01:25:46.659 --> 01:25:57.342]  The problem is they don't police the bad cops the correct way, meaning what'll happen is you'll have an incident like what you're talking about right now, which, you know, hey, there's no justification for what went on.
[01:25:57.342 --> 01:26:00.423]  But the problem is you're going to have an overreaction.
[01:26:00.423 --> 01:26:07.385]  What you're going to have is kind of a UK-British reaction rather than you severely discipline, prosecute,
[01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:10.748]  The people that abuse their positions.
[01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:15.914]  But you then don't go and come out with some ridiculous requirement.
[01:26:15.914 --> 01:26:22.781]  No, they're gonna nanny state not just the police, they're gonna start trying to ban jujitsu clubs.
[01:26:22.781 --> 01:26:23.682]  That's what you're gonna see.
[01:26:23.682 --> 01:26:25.004]  And you're gonna also see cops.
[01:26:25.464 --> 01:26:27.846]  You know, they're not going to be able to train anymore.
[01:26:27.846 --> 01:26:38.073]  What happens is, we went from, you know, I had great uncles that were Boston cops, that basically if a guy pulled a knife, they'd pull out their nightstick, they'd hit him in the wrist, and they'd arrest them.
[01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:39.534]  Today, we shoot them.
[01:26:39.534 --> 01:26:39.874]  Why?
[01:26:39.874 --> 01:26:41.875]  Because of how we train officers.
[01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:45.097]  We do not train officers correctly, you know, that way.
[01:26:45.097 --> 01:26:51.662]  The problem is, when you have a bad cop, when you have a guy that abuses and severely, you know, injures somebody, if not kills them,
[01:26:52.142 --> 01:26:55.543]  What happens is the whole force pays for it, and how do they pay for it?
[01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.504]  With lousy training.
[01:26:57.504 --> 01:27:06.708]  So, the intended, you know, the political correctness of saying, you know, okay, we're only going to hit these areas of the human body, well, they only work on the people you don't care about.
[01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:16.352]  When you truly have somebody that you have to arrest correctly, you need to understand how to, in the most humane manner, and what I mean by that is, the guy has a knife and he's deranged,
[01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:18.553]  You know, there are.
[01:27:18.553 --> 01:27:22.995]  If police were better trained, they wouldn't have to always just, you know, go to lethal force.
[01:27:22.995 --> 01:27:26.536]  Well, I want you to break this down because you're just a great expert to have here.
[01:27:26.536 --> 01:27:28.717]  It's very exciting because I have a lot of questions.
[01:27:28.717 --> 01:27:32.579]  I've been arrested five or six times protesting peacefully.
[01:27:32.579 --> 01:27:33.019]  They show up.
[01:27:33.019 --> 01:27:34.439]  They say no protest allowed.
[01:27:34.439 --> 01:27:35.400]  We go First Amendment.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:41.447]  Whether it's for a Second Amendment rally, or a property rights rally, or as media covering the G20.
[01:27:41.447 --> 01:27:51.518]  They arrest my reporters, I've been arrested, and they always slam my head in the wall, put the cuffs on, wrench it up, pull my arm halfway out of socket.
[01:27:51.518 --> 01:27:54.061]  And I'm like, why do they do that?
[01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:56.424]  Because it really creates bad PR as well.
[01:27:57.318 --> 01:28:03.901]  Yeah, yeah, and it's again, it comes down to the way the way officers are trained.
[01:28:03.901 --> 01:28:11.165]  And oftentimes, you know, you're going to have for every cops that does that, you're going to have a cop that actually goes out of their way to do it.
[01:28:11.165 --> 01:28:14.927]  And again, I'm very balanced on this because I've trained tons of swats.
[01:28:14.927 --> 01:28:15.107]  Sure.
[01:28:15.107 --> 01:28:17.908]  But I'm saying zero, zero resistance.
[01:28:17.908 --> 01:28:19.789]  Like I got arrested once by state police.
[01:28:20.269 --> 01:28:27.636]  There's no, listen, there's no, you have a lot of guys that have attitudes out there and they probably shouldn't be in the job.
[01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:35.203]  You have to be incredibly patient, you know, especially with a citizen that's exercising, you know, their right to protest.
[01:28:35.203 --> 01:28:42.711]  And then if they're doing a non-violent protest like that and they're being taken away, there has to be, you know, and again, you know, they get frustrated and they do stuff.
[01:28:42.711 --> 01:28:44.732]  I'm not justifying any of it, but here's the issue.
[01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:49.796]  Because they're not correctly trained on, you know, injury to the human body.
[01:28:49.796 --> 01:28:55.679]  I just had a police officer in Australia who was an affecting arrest, kind of a similar situation that you're talking about.
[01:28:55.679 --> 01:29:04.244]  He was trying to get the cuffs on somebody and he was in the front of them and his knee was right over the spleen, you know, on the torso.
[01:29:04.244 --> 01:29:13.930]  And he didn't realize that every time he was adjusting his body weight and coming down, his knee, not brutally, if you and I were looking at it, it would almost look like he was doing a slight bounce.
[01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:23.154]  But because it was placed right over the spleen, he ended up snapping the guy's rim, doing blunt trauma to the spleen, and that guy ended up bleeding out.
[01:29:23.154 --> 01:29:25.334]  And it was because of lack of knowledge.
[01:29:25.334 --> 01:29:26.955]  Wow, stay there, stay there.
[01:29:26.955 --> 01:29:28.916]  The truth is the human body is incredibly fragile.
[01:29:29.796 --> 01:29:33.419]  I mean, it is easy to kill somebody, and we have an expert, Tim Larkin, in it.
[01:29:33.419 --> 01:29:40.564]  Not just an expert how to defend yourself, but an expert how to not kill somebody just because you're putting handcuffs on them.
[01:29:40.564 --> 01:29:41.345]  We're gonna break it down.
[01:29:41.345 --> 01:29:42.605]  Log segment coming up.
[01:29:42.605 --> 01:29:43.586]  Tim Larkin.
[01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:46.208]  His website's targetfocustraining.com.
[01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:50.171]  He's banned in the UK as a thought criminal.
[01:29:50.171 --> 01:29:51.572]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.572 --> 01:29:54.094]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.094 --> 01:29:56.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.711 --> 01:30:05.273]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.273 --> 01:30:06.174]  Number one.
[01:30:06.174 --> 01:30:09.596]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.596 --> 01:30:10.476]  Number two.
[01:30:10.476 --> 01:30:15.359]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.359 --> 01:30:16.099]  It's true.
[01:30:16.099 --> 01:30:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:21.783]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:25.366]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.366 --> 01:30:29.290]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.090]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:32.853]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.853 --> 01:30:36.196]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.516 --> 01:30:41.460]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:46.504]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.504 --> 01:30:50.688]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.688 --> 01:30:52.489]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:18.337 --> 01:33:23.059]  Giant news blitz coming up in the third hour and your phone calls.
[01:33:23.059 --> 01:33:24.440]  Tim Larkin is our guest.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:30.343]  He is a trainer of the Navy SEALs, Army, state agencies, police, you name it.
[01:33:30.343 --> 01:33:34.205]  And he was going over there to the UK saying, hey, you've got a right to defend yourself.
[01:33:34.205 --> 01:33:42.049]  And I'd see this footage of just hordes of people running up to people coming out of restaurants or out of hotels and beating them up.
[01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:45.531]  And I don't claim to be Mr. Tough Guy, folks, but I'm going to defend my wife.
[01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:46.772]  I'm going to defend my children.
[01:33:47.745 --> 01:34:09.458]  And as this world gets crazier and crazier, I think I need to get these DVDs and do this training, because I've been in a few fights growing up in North Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I guess a lot of this stuff seems like common sense, but falling through with a punch, don't just kick somebody, stomp them, but it's all done in an expert way, but the larger point is, is that
[01:34:11.823 --> 01:34:15.966]  People that are assaulting you don't care about you, so you have a right to defend yourself.
[01:34:15.966 --> 01:34:23.972]  Then there's the other issue of the police now have trained in similar systems to this, and they're doing it to people that are held down on the ground.
[01:34:23.972 --> 01:34:31.857]  So we're gonna finish up on that point and get into other areas he wants to cover, because I need to stop asking the questions, let him get into whatever he thinks is important.

[01:35:50.492 --> 01:35:52.993]  Going back to Tim, you got cut off by the break, Tim.
[01:35:52.993 --> 01:35:56.674]  We were getting into the police versus citizens.
[01:35:56.674 --> 01:35:59.315]  I mean, I guess we were teaching citizens, police, anybody.
[01:35:59.315 --> 01:36:05.457]  I mean, it needs to be the focus of what is the force continuum?
[01:36:05.457 --> 01:36:07.798]  How do you not get jacked up on adrenaline?
[01:36:07.798 --> 01:36:17.962]  Or after you've gotten somebody off of you, how do you not stomp on their neck and kill them and then have to deal with that whole headache versus not having any training at all?
[01:36:19.178 --> 01:36:27.586]  Yeah, and that's really the crux of my passion and why I continue to do this after all these years.
[01:36:27.586 --> 01:36:30.029]  It's the education process that you're really talking about, Alex.
[01:36:30.029 --> 01:36:37.156]  The biggest problem out there in self-defense, martial arts, control tactics, defensive tactics, whatever you want to call it.
[01:36:37.156 --> 01:36:41.780]  It's really when you're putting hands on the human body, and we usually only get half the story.
[01:36:42.813 --> 01:36:57.980]  So these guys will stomp their head, kick to the neck, do stuff because nobody's really told them, oh, by the way, when the body is on the ground like that and you tend to put, you know, strikes and doing kicks, there's no place for the body weight to move away.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:01.802]  If you and I are standing up and I push you, you're going to fall back because the human body will.
[01:37:02.182 --> 01:37:02.602]  We're good to go.
[01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:30.093]  Where people die is they die from the fact that they fall into the ground, their body weight can't move, and it absorbs all of the trauma.
[01:37:30.093 --> 01:37:36.256]  And people tend to, when somebody's on the ground, be able to put all of their body weight into the strikes, whether they want to or not.
[01:37:36.256 --> 01:37:41.978]  But the interesting thing that we've found over the years, when we started doing this in the special operations community and then the law enforcement community,
[01:37:42.498 --> 01:37:51.924]  We had, when people were educated in, you know, justified lethal force, when they're actually told at that level, there's very little training at the level of kill or be killed.
[01:37:51.924 --> 01:38:08.714]  And what I mean by that is, we will talk about every other level of the force continuum where, you know, you control somebody, you give them this hold, you do that, but a guy that truly is going after you and trying to kill you, maybe grabbing your weapon or, you know, trying to do, you know, real grievous bodily harm to you, there's very little training on how to deal with that.
[01:38:08.714 --> 01:38:11.596]  Normally, what they'll tell you is, just do whatever it takes.
[01:38:12.256 --> 01:38:14.398]  Which I think is just a horrible answer.
[01:38:14.398 --> 01:38:16.819]  And so what we do is we start there.
[01:38:16.819 --> 01:38:22.383]  If I start somebody at Justified Lethal Force and I show them what trauma to the human body actually does, here's the result.
[01:38:22.383 --> 01:38:27.647]  People are actually less likely to ever abuse the situation unless warranted.
[01:38:27.647 --> 01:38:41.537]  What we found was the police officers that we trained, when they were trained with the Justified Lethal Force, there were less incidences of excessive use of force down the line because they had a gross understanding of what happens to the body, you know, when you do things.
[01:38:42.057 --> 01:38:49.122]  Once you inherently know that, hey, if I do this, here's the potential damage I can do, and it's not warranted, you won't do it.
[01:38:49.122 --> 01:38:56.408]  Whereas, if your life is on the line, concurrently, because you know what that'll do, that particular strike could probably save your life.
[01:38:56.408 --> 01:39:09.338]  Sure, let's say somebody has attacked you, they've tackled you, whether you're a citizen, police officer, whatever, you beat them off of you, they keep coming, at a point you've got to make the decision, okay, I'm going to go ahead and put this guy out because they're not stopping.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:25.277]  Yeah, the majority of, on the civilian side, the majority of the civilians that we've trained over the past 20 years, what we talk about is taking a human being to non-functional, meaning in the threats that we're talking about, asocial violence, where it happens to you, you don't have choice.
[01:39:25.857 --> 01:39:27.138]  Meaning there's no exit.
[01:39:27.138 --> 01:39:28.358]  You've tried to negotiate.
[01:39:28.358 --> 01:39:29.178]  You can't.
[01:39:29.178 --> 01:39:29.719]  It's happening.
[01:39:29.719 --> 01:39:30.999]  The guy is stabbing at you.
[01:39:30.999 --> 01:39:44.605]  He's coming at you at that point where if you do not take action, you are, as you know, Mike Murphy, the CSI coroner out here in Vegas told me, he said, Tim, he said, if you don't take action, all you're going to do is be able to help me solve your murder.
[01:39:45.205 --> 01:39:46.206]  He said, he said,
[01:40:15.145 --> 01:40:15.445]  I don't know.
[01:40:42.368 --> 01:40:49.670]  The shooter's going for a reload, you cruise over there, you hit him in the head, you brain him on the concrete and you kill him, guess what?
[01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:50.651]  That's justified.
[01:40:50.651 --> 01:40:51.971]  Now you're a hero!
[01:40:51.971 --> 01:40:57.573]  Yes, but it's all with education, Alex, and where I get into trouble is, people don't.
[01:40:57.573 --> 01:41:02.695]  What they'll do is, I'll say, hey, I gave a demonstration a couple years ago for The Sun.
[01:41:02.695 --> 01:41:05.516]  The Sun newspaper in the UK sent a group over.
[01:41:06.616 --> 01:41:10.398]  And I was showing them a typical strike set that's shown in the martial arts.
[01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:12.520]  It was just four strikes.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.601]  And I showed that doing the strikes, you know, here's how they go.
[01:41:15.601 --> 01:41:16.742]  And everybody's, oh, that's really cool.
[01:41:16.742 --> 01:41:17.562]  That's really cool.
[01:41:17.562 --> 01:41:18.303]  And I go, great.
[01:41:18.303 --> 01:41:19.083]  It's really cool.
[01:41:19.083 --> 01:41:26.288]  Then I systemically showed them that those strikes, what they were doing to the human body, and that by doing it that way, it was a guaranteed kill.
[01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:29.109]  And everybody was shocked.
[01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:32.410]  It went from being a really cool technique to, oh my God.
[01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:34.891]  And they were simple strikes to do.
[01:41:34.891 --> 01:41:42.855]  And I was sitting there saying, without the education of the trauma, you inadvertently could do something stupid that's not justified for the situation.
[01:41:42.855 --> 01:41:47.477]  So my whole thing was education and self-defense, saying we got to do this.
[01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:49.597]  You know what the Sun did with that?
[01:41:49.597 --> 01:41:52.999]  They took the headline and they said, I can kill you in four moves.
[01:41:54.246 --> 01:41:56.547]  And that's what they ran with that.
[01:41:56.547 --> 01:42:08.772]  And then they also took liberty and they decided, you know, we don't really like his background, so we're going to call him a former Navy SEAL, even though, you know, I blew my ears a couple weeks before graduation and I had to switch over to the intelligence community.
[01:42:08.772 --> 01:42:19.096]  My whole story of my background and the reason I'm... Yeah, we even got that wrong until you pointed it out, because every newspaper says you're a former Navy SEAL, and then I bet you get accused of saying you were one when you weren't.
[01:42:19.816 --> 01:42:20.376]  I have been.
[01:42:20.376 --> 01:42:23.438]  What's so funny is I worked only in the community.
[01:42:23.438 --> 01:42:24.939]  I was an intelligence officer.
[01:42:24.939 --> 01:42:28.040]  I worked for the for Admiral Lemoine back in the 80s.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.181]  I worked directly for the highest seal command.
[01:42:30.181 --> 01:42:34.804]  My whole career was in special warfare, but it was as an intelligence officer.
[01:42:34.804 --> 01:42:36.025]  All my friends know this.
[01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:37.305]  I wouldn't be training the people.
[01:42:37.305 --> 01:42:41.267]  If I was some guy going around pretending to be something I'm not, there's no way I'd have the career.
[01:42:41.267 --> 01:42:42.088]  But I'll tell you.
[01:42:42.788 --> 01:42:44.129]  The press is just amazing.
[01:42:44.129 --> 01:42:47.592]  Trying to get that, you know, retracted has been a nightmare.
[01:42:47.592 --> 01:42:49.813]  And the problem is, it goes around.
[01:42:49.813 --> 01:42:59.461]  But the whole story, the reason it's so funny is because when I blew my ears, I, you know, my eardrum got blown underwater and my semicircular canals ended out.
[01:42:59.461 --> 01:43:09.008]  An injury to my inner ear ended my career, no matter how much I willed it, no matter how much I wanted to overcome it, no matter how much personal, you know, fortitude I put in.
[01:43:09.008 --> 01:43:10.449]  The body is delicate.
[01:43:10.449 --> 01:43:12.191]  It's a delicate of an injury, you know?
[01:43:13.192 --> 01:43:14.533]  And that's what my whole thing is.
[01:43:14.533 --> 01:43:22.722]  And so, the thing is, if you try to go out there and you try to be sane and socialized and say, listen, there is absolutely a time when the only answer is violence.
[01:43:23.806 --> 01:43:27.089]  Then you're going to be vilified as promoting violence.
[01:43:27.089 --> 01:43:40.799]  You're going to be vilified as somebody who's out there, you know, as they said, promoting vigilantism and all this other ridiculous stuff, rather than looking at what a citizen is facing out there these days, especially citizens of the UK.
[01:43:40.799 --> 01:43:43.061]  As you said, you've got a lot of Eastern Europeans coming in.
[01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:45.082]  Knife culture is huge there.
[01:43:45.082 --> 01:43:46.423]  Stuff they were never facing.
[01:43:46.423 --> 01:43:48.485]  I went to university in 86 over there.
[01:43:48.485 --> 01:43:50.346]  I went to the University of London on an exchange program.
[01:43:51.207 --> 01:43:56.691]  It was unthinkable, some of the crimes that are now readily happening in London these days.
[01:43:56.691 --> 01:44:04.316]  And yet, the authorities are still acting like, you know, you as a citizen do not respond.
[01:44:04.316 --> 01:44:11.661]  Even brandishing something, there was a young mother who had a couple of kids jump over into her lot, her place has been broken into.
[01:44:12.881 --> 01:44:14.683]  Now, she didn't actually even use the butcher knife.
[01:44:14.683 --> 01:44:16.965]  She just was in her kitchen window.
[01:44:16.965 --> 01:44:19.047]  She showed the butcher knife, scared out of her death.
[01:44:19.047 --> 01:44:26.173]  She has her infant upstairs, and the two teenage guys looked at her kind of menacingly, and then they just left.
[01:44:26.173 --> 01:44:26.654]  They jumped.
[01:44:26.654 --> 01:44:27.594]  They felt, you know what?
[01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:28.455]  I'm not going to deal with this.
[01:44:28.455 --> 01:44:30.397]  She's got a knife.
[01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.579]  She calls the cops, scared out of her mind.
[01:44:32.579 --> 01:44:37.703]  They come over, and when she tells them the story, they're debating on whether or not they have to arrest her.
[01:44:38.723 --> 01:44:45.149]  And they chastised her, and because she was on a reality TV show over there, they decided not to.
[01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:52.775]  But they were more concerned, rather than the threat she was faced, they were far more concerned that she might actually try to protect herself.
[01:44:52.775 --> 01:44:53.616]  And it's asinine.
[01:44:53.616 --> 01:44:55.918]  But look at the crime statistics.
[01:44:55.918 --> 01:45:02.324]  If you look at areas like Chicago or New York, where they have basically a total gun ban, they have the highest crime rates.
[01:45:03.044 --> 01:45:16.724]  And homicide rates, and then it takes somewhere like Texas or Vermont, even around the big cities, there's a much lower home invasion rate because people know half the houses you go into, if you go in there when somebody's there, they're going to shoot you.
[01:45:16.724 --> 01:45:17.685]  I mean, it's really simple.
[01:45:18.266 --> 01:45:21.349]  Listen Alex, here's the bottom line.
[01:45:21.349 --> 01:45:28.436]  The bottom line is each one of us as human beings possesses the greatest concealed carry that nobody can control and that's your mind.
[01:45:28.436 --> 01:45:30.679]  We cannot outlaw intent.
[01:45:30.679 --> 01:45:33.161]  What we do is we make the mistake.
[01:45:33.161 --> 01:45:35.604]  We make the mistake of thinking by outlawing tools.
[01:45:36.462 --> 01:45:38.163]  We have outlawed all weapons.
[01:45:38.163 --> 01:45:41.166]  We all possessed one weapon, and I'm not being dramatic here.
[01:45:41.166 --> 01:45:42.487]  Our weapon is the human brain.
[01:45:42.487 --> 01:45:49.872]  The human brain has done everything from, you know, create the space shuttle to create nuclear war, you know, nuclear weapons.
[01:45:49.872 --> 01:45:51.353]  It's just that creative.
[01:45:51.353 --> 01:45:56.818]  We are not the top, you know, the top species on Earth because we are bigger, faster, and stronger.
[01:45:57.358 --> 01:46:06.721]  And I tell people all the time, if anybody thinks that, you just, you know, just tell me who wants to get in a 10 by 10 cage with a 45 pound mountain lion that hasn't eaten in three days.
[01:46:06.721 --> 01:46:07.721]  You know, we are not.
[01:46:07.721 --> 01:46:11.903]  We are dangerous and we are also brilliant because we have this mind.
[01:46:12.463 --> 01:46:14.365]  And we cannot outlaw intent.
[01:46:14.365 --> 01:46:18.528]  If somebody wants to do harm to you, they will find a way to do it.
[01:46:18.528 --> 01:46:21.931]  And all you have to do is look at the prison population.
[01:46:21.931 --> 01:46:30.639]  If you study how the prisoners use violence as a tool, you'll see just how ingenious the human mind is when it wants to be.
[01:46:30.639 --> 01:46:38.906]  Yeah, and if they would just put that intent into working and ideas and sales, they'd be living in a million dollar house instead of in a hellish prison.
[01:46:39.704 --> 01:46:41.286]  But that's it, that's just it Alex.
[01:46:41.286 --> 01:46:45.550]  The people that are doing that are people that we want to protect.
[01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:54.699]  The guys, the great people that are taking the human mind and using it for the best to improve society, we're also the ones most at risk and we're not allowed.
[01:46:54.699 --> 01:47:00.644]  We are told that if we look at the tool of violence, if we study the tool of violence, we will become one of them.
[01:47:00.644 --> 01:47:01.545]  We'll be a bad guy.
[01:47:01.545 --> 01:47:03.267]  It's the biggest sham that's out there.
[01:47:03.647 --> 01:47:05.168]  I feel incredibly secure.
[01:47:05.168 --> 01:47:06.969]  A lot of radio hosts get threatened.
[01:47:06.969 --> 01:47:07.769]  People do stuff.
[01:47:07.769 --> 01:47:08.810]  They shoot them.
[01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:09.230]  Not me.
[01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:10.291]  I got a gun in my car.
[01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:11.331]  I know how to use it.
[01:47:11.331 --> 01:47:14.533]  I've got one here in my studio and a little instant access pixel safe.
[01:47:14.533 --> 01:47:15.613]  And it's not even a big deal.
[01:47:15.613 --> 01:47:18.535]  It's like I got a pen over here if I need to write.
[01:47:18.535 --> 01:47:19.736]  I've got video cameras.
[01:47:19.736 --> 01:47:21.056]  I've got a microphone.
[01:47:21.056 --> 01:47:27.760]  And it's just there in the one chance out of 5,000 that somebody ever came in here and tried to do something.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.762]  And for so many people, that is a shocking idea.
[01:47:32.302 --> 01:47:34.603]  That I would defend myself.
[01:47:34.603 --> 01:47:39.665]  That's alien to them, and that shows this attempt to fully domesticate us.
[01:47:39.665 --> 01:47:40.645]  But that's the same thing.
[01:47:40.645 --> 01:47:48.007]  What I try to tell people all the time, I go, what you're acting, you know, people like to believe the world is a certain way rather than the way it is.
[01:47:48.007 --> 01:47:52.469]  And the thing is, if you accept the world for the way it is, then you do certain things.
[01:47:52.469 --> 01:47:54.270]  And most people do it in their daily lives.
[01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:58.231]  Most people have a fire extinguisher in their house.
[01:47:58.231 --> 01:48:00.592]  Now, does that mean they're paranoid about fire?
[01:48:00.592 --> 01:48:02.732]  Does that mean that they're constantly thinking about it?
[01:48:02.732 --> 01:48:05.013]  That they're just ridiculous for having it there?
[01:48:05.013 --> 01:48:05.393]  No!
[01:48:05.393 --> 01:48:10.575]  Because they're saying, worst case scenario, I have a plan of action.
[01:48:10.575 --> 01:48:13.896]  I do everything to make sure that, you know, my house is not going to catch fire.
[01:48:13.896 --> 01:48:15.636]  I do all the normal things.
[01:48:15.636 --> 01:48:18.257]  Make sure that I take care of everything.
[01:48:18.257 --> 01:48:21.218]  I don't have bad electricity or bad wiring.
[01:48:21.218 --> 01:48:21.618]  All those things.
[01:48:21.618 --> 01:48:22.078]  But you know what?
[01:48:22.078 --> 01:48:23.659]  I'm still going to have this fire extinguisher.
[01:48:24.039 --> 01:48:27.963]  Even though it's going to be really rare that I would ever have to use it.
[01:48:27.963 --> 01:48:35.249]  But if you take that same approach to your self-protection or your self-defense, you are shown, you know, that you're a bad person.
[01:48:35.249 --> 01:48:37.731]  And what I try to tell people all the time is I give an analogy.
[01:48:37.731 --> 01:48:38.272]  I say, listen,
[01:48:39.398 --> 01:48:40.979]  Let's take a look at this.
[01:48:40.979 --> 01:48:42.040]  A door gets kicked in.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.103]  There's a young woman in her kitchen.
[01:48:45.103 --> 01:48:46.244]  Baby's upstairs.
[01:48:46.244 --> 01:48:48.586]  Guy attacks her.
[01:48:48.586 --> 01:48:49.746]  He's strangling her.
[01:48:49.746 --> 01:48:52.769]  He's trying to attack her, trying to sexually assault her.
[01:48:52.769 --> 01:48:58.854]  She sees the butcher's knife and she reaches back for that butcher's knife and she's successful.
[01:48:58.854 --> 01:49:03.617]  She plunges it inside of the neck and she's able to defeat this guy.
[01:49:03.617 --> 01:49:05.879]  She actually ends up killing him.
[01:49:05.879 --> 01:49:06.180]  Okay?
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:11.146]  We as society would look at that situation and we'd say she needs to be protected to the full extent of a law.
[01:49:11.146 --> 01:49:12.788]  She needs to be lauded for what she did.
[01:49:12.788 --> 01:49:16.132]  She did everything she could do to protect the baby.
[01:49:16.132 --> 01:49:20.218]  And we all hope that that's going to be the case.
[01:49:20.218 --> 01:49:21.419]  Now let's look at that same thing.
[01:49:22.458 --> 01:49:23.959]  Kicks the door open again.
[01:49:23.959 --> 01:49:24.620]  Comes through.
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.602]  This time they're in the epic struggle.
[01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:28.643]  She tries to reach for that butcher's knife.
[01:49:28.643 --> 01:49:29.744]  He sees it.
[01:49:29.744 --> 01:49:32.006]  He's angry because he's not getting what he wants.
[01:49:32.006 --> 01:49:33.187]  He grabs the butcher's knife.
[01:49:33.187 --> 01:49:36.190]  He plunges it into the side of the neck, killing her.
[01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:36.930]  You know, murdering her.
[01:49:37.711 --> 01:49:41.915]  Now, we all agree that in that situation, that was a heinous murder, completely unjustified.
[01:49:41.915 --> 01:49:46.359]  This guy should face, you know, life imprisonment, if not the death penalty, if that's available.
[01:49:46.359 --> 01:49:50.123]  But bottom line, he should never see the light of day in society again.
[01:49:50.123 --> 01:50:00.893]  What I try to tell people is, listen folks, what I need you to understand is the knife to the side of the neck worked in both instances, whether it was the good guy or the bad guy using it.
[01:50:00.893 --> 01:50:03.014]  It does not make you bad to study this.
[01:50:03.735 --> 01:50:07.936]  You need to study this because you need to know it works if your life is ever on the line.
[01:50:07.936 --> 01:50:12.837]  How you use the information will determine whether or not it was justified.
[01:50:12.837 --> 01:50:18.998]  But I'm not worried about the same socialized humans that I train because the predators don't need me.
[01:50:18.998 --> 01:50:19.658]  They don't need me.
[01:50:19.658 --> 01:50:21.419]  They already know how to do this kind of stuff.
[01:50:21.419 --> 01:50:27.640]  They may not have the technical knowledge I have, but they have boatloads of intent and they have no need for seeking me out.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.261]  What I try to do is I try to get through to people like my clients in the UK that say, hey, listen, folks.
[01:50:33.061 --> 01:50:34.783]  It's okay to look at this stuff.
[01:50:34.783 --> 01:50:36.564]  It doesn't make you one of them.
[01:50:36.564 --> 01:50:37.345]  And guess what?
[01:50:37.345 --> 01:50:43.551]  They don't want you to look at this stuff because it'll put you on par with them if they ever threaten you.
[01:50:43.551 --> 01:50:44.312]  Very well said.
[01:50:44.312 --> 01:50:45.513]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:50:45.513 --> 01:50:49.296]  Amazing interview and the conclusion of it straight ahead.

[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.042]  Tim Larkin is our guest.

[01:50:57.364 --> 01:50:57.805]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.383 --> 01:51:04.966]  In an emergency situation, would you drink contaminated water?

[01:51:13.153 --> 01:51:15.815]  It filters contaminated water from almost any source.
[01:51:16.516 --> 01:51:16.816]  I think so.

[01:52:01.625 --> 01:52:02.986]  Don't answer it!
[01:52:02.986 --> 01:52:05.808]  How can I stop these annoying collection calls?
[01:52:05.808 --> 01:52:13.913]  Imagine being free from your debt without settling, and with no payment plan, no negotiating or filing bankruptcy, and no attorneys.
[01:52:13.913 --> 01:52:17.295]  What if you could eliminate the risk from all your unsecured debt in about
[01:52:17.435 --> 01:52:17.855]  I'm good.
[01:52:39.707 --> 01:52:40.407]  We're good to go.
[01:53:00.297 --> 01:53:01.318]  Attention all U.S.
[01:53:01.318 --> 01:53:01.858]  drivers!
[01:53:01.858 --> 01:53:09.063]  Do you own a vehicle with less than 150,000 miles, with a manufacturer's warranty about to expire, or no warranty coverage at all?
[01:53:09.063 --> 01:53:19.650]  In order to aid the American people with saving thousands on future auto repair costs during these hard economic times, VSC America is now offering an affordable, low-cost coverage plan to the general public.
[01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:25.912]  As of today, you could be one of millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle protected under this coverage.

[01:53:34.695 --> 01:53:38.536]  Roadside service, towing, and rental coverage is included with all plans.
[01:53:38.536 --> 01:53:41.237]  All this at a fraction of what many dealerships are charging.

[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:47.561]  Again, that's 1-800-493-7561.
[01:53:47.561 --> 01:53:51.203]  I'm gonna say something here publicly that I'm ashamed of just so that I'll mark this point.
[01:54:11.024 --> 01:54:14.246]  The 14th day of May, 2012 on this Monday edition.
[01:54:14.246 --> 01:54:18.808]  I have a son and I have two daughters.
[01:54:18.808 --> 01:54:21.309]  And the daughters are smaller.
[01:54:21.309 --> 01:54:23.770]  My son is almost 10.
[01:54:23.770 --> 01:54:25.991]  My daughters are younger.
[01:54:25.991 --> 01:54:34.995]  And I find myself taking him shooting, taking him hunting, teaching him basic self-defense.
[01:54:34.995 --> 01:54:38.096]  And I catch myself and my daughters, the ones that are really going to need it,
[01:54:39.625 --> 01:54:41.386]  I'm not teaching him any of it.
[01:54:41.386 --> 01:54:46.189]  I mean, I've done some shooting with a seven-year-old, and she doesn't like it as much.
[01:54:46.189 --> 01:55:01.838]  That's part of the role, but I think of this, of people that have, they send their daughters off to college without any self-defense, without knowing how to use a gun, any of it, and that it's bad to want women to know how to fight or how to use a gun.
[01:55:01.838 --> 01:55:07.822]  You know, the feminists just want to teach women how to hate men, the mainline feminists, because it's another form of enslavement.
[01:55:08.766 --> 01:55:10.868]  What do you say to that, Tim?
[01:55:10.868 --> 01:55:13.409]  Again, Tim Larkin, trainer of U.S.
[01:55:13.409 --> 01:55:16.151]  military, Navy SEALs, you name it, banned in the U.K.
[01:55:16.151 --> 01:55:20.394]  That must be great advertising for the work you do.
[01:55:20.394 --> 01:55:22.776]  But what's a good way to start?
[01:55:22.776 --> 01:55:26.178]  Because before you know it, they're going to be, you know, teenagers.
[01:55:26.178 --> 01:55:28.900]  What is a good way, or for my wife for that matter?
[01:55:30.501 --> 01:55:39.091]  Yeah, because I forget the fact that I took some basic martial arts when I was, you know, in junior high and stuff and played football and all that, and a lot of that just comes natural to a guy.
[01:55:39.091 --> 01:55:40.573]  What about for women?
[01:55:40.573 --> 01:55:42.315]  Because they're the ones that really need it, aren't they?
[01:55:42.315 --> 01:55:48.963]  I mean, men need it as well, but what do you say to women out there where the culture says, don't learn how to fight, don't learn how to shoot?
[01:55:50.578 --> 01:55:56.445]  I have a book that I'm working on right now that will be coming out next year for women.
[01:55:56.445 --> 01:55:59.409]  The title of it is Survive the Unthinkable.
[01:55:59.409 --> 01:56:01.532]  Women have been a huge focus of mine.
[01:56:01.532 --> 01:56:07.119]  It's extremely difficult to get women by themselves to come in seeking self-defense training because
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.602]  They've always been taught, bigger, faster, stronger.
[01:56:10.602 --> 01:56:12.503]  Nothing you can do.
[01:56:12.503 --> 01:56:13.344]  Talk your way out of it.
[01:56:13.344 --> 01:56:14.925]  Don't get them angry.
[01:56:14.925 --> 01:56:17.487]  In fact, I had a woman come up to me in Sydney one time.
[01:56:17.487 --> 01:56:21.170]  I was doing a big presentation down in Australia for a large group.
[01:56:21.170 --> 01:56:32.578]  And she came up to me after the presentation and she said to me, she said, you know, I've taken three self-defense classes and the only thing I ever remembered was, don't kick a man in the groin because it might anger him.
[01:56:32.578 --> 01:56:34.019]  And she said, that's it.
[01:56:34.019 --> 01:56:36.301]  She goes, I've been living, you know, fearfully.
[01:56:36.841 --> 01:56:37.041]  I don't
[01:56:54.774 --> 01:57:06.064]  We as males live with intermale aggression, you know, this locker room, back and forth, and you know, you want most boys to navigate high school without this information because they don't have the proper filters oftentimes to deal with this.
[01:57:06.064 --> 01:57:11.028]  Whereas girls, the only time they experience violence is when it's the real thing.
[01:57:11.889 --> 01:57:24.543]  Women don't have that intramural locker room aggression where, you know, hey, you and I will knock each other around to see who's, you know, who's the badass and, you know, I own the locker room and you take your social status and all that stuff.
[01:57:24.543 --> 01:57:26.245]  You know, that's the intramural aggression stuff.
[01:57:26.245 --> 01:57:27.526]  That's not violence.
[01:57:27.526 --> 01:57:29.969]  Whereas women, they experience the real thing.
[01:57:29.969 --> 01:57:33.332]  And the cool thing about training women is there's no ego involved.
[01:57:33.332 --> 01:57:33.633]  Women
[01:57:34.193 --> 01:57:34.833]  Are you
[01:57:56.421 --> 01:58:02.228]  And if I have that little guy and I'm holding him up, he'll throw his head back, hit me in the nose, poke me in the eye.
[01:58:02.228 --> 01:58:09.256]  And, you know, I am, I am, you know, basically, you know, mildly injured and out of it for a little bit of time.
[01:58:09.256 --> 01:58:12.920]  And what I say is, you know, you know, remember, remember how that felt.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.862]  Now you look at a child throwing a fit.
[01:58:14.862 --> 01:58:17.285]  Can we do five more minutes to finish up on this?
[01:58:18.814 --> 01:58:23.796]  Alright, one minute break and we'll be back in one minute to finish up because this hour is over and then a big news blitz coming up.
[01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.836]  We'll come back and break that down, absolutely.
[01:58:25.836 --> 01:58:29.638]  Women, if you're gonna get attacked anyways, you might as well be able to fight back.
[01:58:29.638 --> 01:58:32.859]  I mean, does that mean you're gonna be able to beat Mike Tyson?
[01:58:32.859 --> 01:58:35.520]  I don't know, you get women mad, it's something else.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:41.562]  The point is, absolutely, we need to get women to know how to fight.
[01:58:41.562 --> 01:58:42.902]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.001 --> 01:58:52.301]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.301 --> 01:58:57.903]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:57.903 --> 01:59:02.905]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:02.905 --> 01:59:07.947]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:59:08.487 --> 01:59:13.711]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.711 --> 01:59:16.012]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:59:16.012 --> 01:59:20.835]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.835 --> 01:59:21.956]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.956 --> 01:59:25.018]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:59:25.018 --> 01:59:28.641]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.641 --> 01:59:31.823]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:31.823 --> 01:59:34.044]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:59:38.607 --> 01:59:40.049]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:40.049 --> 01:59:47.678]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:47.678 --> 01:59:53.865]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:53.865 --> 01:59:56.267]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.267 --> 01:59:59.010]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:10.454]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.454 --> 02:00:12.056]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.056 --> 02:00:13.598]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.598 --> 02:00:17.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.783 --> 02:00:21.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.467 --> 02:00:31.953]  Self-defense expert Tim Larkins with his final segment.
[02:00:31.953 --> 02:00:37.061]  My point is, is that your children grow up so fast before you know it.
[02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:38.323]  You know they're going to be out there.
[02:00:40.916 --> 02:00:42.497]  You know, alone.
[02:00:42.497 --> 02:00:57.049]  And it's just the roles are so ingrained to not have women know how to defend themselves that even, you know, I'm a guy pro-Second Amendment, you know, liberty, constitutionalist, and I'm not really teaching my daughters that stuff.
[02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:58.050]  It's just instinctive.
[02:00:58.050 --> 02:01:00.072]  Well, you know, a male is interested in that.
[02:01:00.072 --> 02:01:01.513]  My son wants to know about that.
[02:01:01.513 --> 02:01:04.055]  He's into that because that's what males do.
[02:01:04.055 --> 02:01:05.936]  But then you see the so-called feminists.
[02:01:05.936 --> 02:01:07.518]  They're always about women.
[02:01:08.479 --> 02:01:14.025]  You know, basically just henpecking at men and just some political power.
[02:01:14.025 --> 02:01:16.668]  I'm talking about Gloria Steinem and stuff.
[02:01:16.668 --> 02:01:20.833]  Finishing up with what you were saying about a baby and how hard they are to control, Tim.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.803]  Yeah, well, you know, the problem is, you know, when you talk about, you know, a woman going against Mike Tyson, that's the problem.
[02:01:26.803 --> 02:01:27.584]  That's what they see.
[02:01:27.584 --> 02:01:34.288]  Whereas, you know, I was, you know, 10 years ago, my son, my older son, oh, gosh, it was longer.
[02:01:34.288 --> 02:01:37.611]  I hate to admit I'm that old, but it was actually 13 years ago.
[02:01:37.611 --> 02:01:41.573]  My son, little four-year-old, came over, and I think he was going to try to give dad a hug.
[02:01:41.573 --> 02:01:51.460]  He trips over his little feet, and his little hands come up, slap me in the groin, and I swear, Alex, I'm on the ground for five minutes just sucking my thumb, completely helpless, you know, at that point.
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:55.522]  Now, that's what predators give you the opportunity to do.
[02:01:55.522 --> 02:02:04.786]  I felt no, you know, my son obviously, we know if we put myself and a four-year-old in the ring and we all knew what was going on, we know how that would end up.
[02:02:04.786 --> 02:02:17.752]  But predators, the reason they seek you out is because they don't think you're an issue and oftentimes they will put vulnerable parts of their body close to you and give you an opportunity to do that one injury that we're talking about that can change everything in your favor.
[02:02:18.492 --> 02:02:29.378]  And if a small child can do it to a fully grown adult, use a fully grown adult, even if you weigh 95 pounds, who wants to feel 95 pounds going through one part of a vulnerable body?
[02:02:29.378 --> 02:02:29.798]  Well, exactly.
[02:02:29.798 --> 02:02:36.602]  I mean, have you ever tried to like take your cat to the vet and it doesn't want to go in the cage and it'll tear you up?
[02:02:36.602 --> 02:02:38.103]  I mean, resistance is victory.
[02:02:38.103 --> 02:02:41.665]  Bottom line, you teach folks the most effective ways to resist.
[02:02:42.785 --> 02:02:44.906]  Absolutely, and clearly defined.
[02:02:44.906 --> 02:02:45.947]  Two-fold.
[02:02:45.947 --> 02:02:46.987]  You get two things.
[02:02:46.987 --> 02:02:48.588]  You understand all the things.
[02:02:48.588 --> 02:02:49.649]  My clients tell me two things.
[02:02:49.649 --> 02:02:58.394]  They go, boy, I've really modified my behavior because you've really taught me all the things I was taking chances with over the years that I no longer participate in.
[02:02:58.394 --> 02:03:02.236]  But I also immediately recognize those rare times where, hey,
[02:03:02.876 --> 02:03:03.796]  You know what?
[02:03:03.796 --> 02:03:05.337]  I would have to do violence here.
[02:03:05.337 --> 02:03:09.098]  I have to protect myself, and I completely switched into that mode.
[02:03:09.098 --> 02:03:19.742]  That's the greatest gift you could ever... If you're a parent, it's that type of understanding that you give your kids prior to life, because it's one of those 800-pound gorillas that's in the room.
[02:03:19.742 --> 02:03:24.244]  Nobody wants to talk about a physical threat to you, but it's something that we're all worried about.
[02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:29.246]  I asked most parents this, I go, how many people have taught your kids how to swim?
[02:03:29.246 --> 02:03:31.306]  And they all, you know, raised their hands.
[02:03:31.306 --> 02:03:32.427]  Well, why did you do that?
[02:03:32.427 --> 02:03:33.627]  Well, because I don't want them to drown.
[02:03:33.627 --> 02:03:34.548]  I go, oh, you don't?
[02:03:34.548 --> 02:03:37.969]  I thought it was because you all want them to become Olympic swimmers.
[02:03:37.969 --> 02:03:38.769]  And they go, no, no, no.
[02:03:38.769 --> 02:03:39.649]  You know, you don't want them to drown.
[02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:44.331]  I go, same reason you want to teach people how the human body responds to trauma.
[02:03:44.331 --> 02:03:48.433]  Not because you want them to be a world-class MMA artist or martial artist or anything.
[02:03:48.433 --> 02:03:49.733]  It's because you want them.
[02:03:49.733 --> 02:03:51.414]  Chances are they're going to get mugged.
[02:03:51.414 --> 02:03:52.334]  They're going to get attacked.
[02:03:52.714 --> 02:03:54.636]  And they need to have that skill.
[02:03:54.636 --> 02:03:57.878]  Good people need to stop being domesticated.
[02:03:57.878 --> 02:04:03.263]  In closing, just in my experiences in life, I've learned how serious fights can be.
[02:04:03.263 --> 02:04:07.546]  I've just gotten to the point, as you run into it, somebody tailgates you, cuts you off, gets in my face.
[02:04:07.546 --> 02:04:11.109]  I just have learned to be satisfied and walk away.
[02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:13.551]  And, you know, usually people back off.
[02:04:13.551 --> 02:04:17.974]  I mean, what do you do if somebody gets in your face for no reason and says, hey, I'll kick your butt, buddy?
[02:04:17.974 --> 02:04:18.435]  What do you do?
[02:04:18.435 --> 02:04:19.355]  Just turn and walk away?
[02:04:19.355 --> 02:04:19.796]  Or what do you do?
[02:04:20.376 --> 02:04:22.037]  Alex, I'll give you the perfect example.
[02:04:22.037 --> 02:04:26.018]  I went to pick up my older son when he was about 10 years old.
[02:04:26.018 --> 02:04:31.941]  I was going to drop him off at a park with his grandfather, and I was in San Diego about to give a seminar.
[02:04:31.941 --> 02:04:36.763]  And I come out from where my son was, picking my son up.
[02:04:37.443 --> 02:04:38.424]  We pulled out.
[02:04:38.424 --> 02:04:39.204]  Guy comes by.
[02:04:39.204 --> 02:04:41.586]  He claims that I ran him off the road.
[02:04:41.586 --> 02:04:42.627]  He looks at me.
[02:04:42.627 --> 02:04:46.149]  He starts yelling in the car, you know, flipping me off.
[02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:48.110]  My son's looking at me like, Dad, what's this all about?
[02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:48.711]  I'll tell you what.
[02:04:48.711 --> 02:04:49.391]  I know you.
[02:04:49.391 --> 02:04:51.113]  Listen, I'm not trying to keep you on here more.
[02:04:51.113 --> 02:04:53.674]  We got to come back, finish this story, and then we'll let you go.
[02:04:53.674 --> 02:04:54.775]  I got to hear this.
[02:04:54.775 --> 02:04:55.536]  What a cliffhanger.
[02:04:55.536 --> 02:04:56.636]  That's a short segment.
[02:04:56.636 --> 02:04:58.778]  Tim Larkin's our guest.
[02:04:58.778 --> 02:04:59.959]  TargetFocusTraining.com.
[02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:05.336]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct.

[02:05:15.611 --> 02:05:17.133]  Your greatest dependency.

[02:06:07.817 --> 02:06:12.979]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.979 --> 02:06:21.682]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.682 --> 02:06:25.763]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:25.763 --> 02:06:28.004]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:34.771]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:34.771 --> 02:06:38.612]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.612 --> 02:06:39.853]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.853 --> 02:06:41.994]  We turn jeans inside out.

[02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.221]  Others don't.
[02:07:00.456 --> 02:07:05.960]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.361]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:07:08.361 --> 02:07:17.467]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:17.467 --> 02:07:20.909]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:07:20.909 --> 02:07:22.610]  There's no priming required.
[02:07:22.610 --> 02:07:24.872]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:07:24.872 --> 02:07:27.373]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:07:28.434 --> 02:07:29.954]  Easy to set up and use.

[02:07:31.375 --> 02:07:34.536]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:07:34.536 --> 02:07:37.936]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:07:37.936 --> 02:07:42.078]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:07:42.078 --> 02:07:44.798]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:07:44.798 --> 02:07:46.379]  It's what my family uses.
[02:07:46.379 --> 02:07:49.700]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[02:08:02.525 --> 02:08:09.169]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:12.211]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.211 --> 02:08:18.855]  You know, there's not just guns to protect you and your family.
[02:08:21.408 --> 02:08:26.193]  There's also your mind and using your body or anything around you to defend yourself.
[02:08:26.193 --> 02:08:28.976]  Tim Larkin is about to leave us.
[02:08:28.976 --> 02:08:34.301]  I appreciate him staying a little bit in the second hour or the third hour because we ran out of time.
[02:08:34.301 --> 02:08:37.505]  He was starting to tell a story about how his classes are...
[02:08:38.906 --> 02:08:45.751]  Mainly about ways to not have that confrontation, but then what to do if there's no way out of it and that forced continuum there.
[02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:51.895]  But I was describing, as I see it more and more, and it's not just me saying this, the crime statistics show it.
[02:08:51.895 --> 02:08:53.316]  I see it everywhere.
[02:08:53.316 --> 02:08:57.999]  I drove back from the Texas coast, from Port Aransas back to Austin yesterday.
[02:08:57.999 --> 02:09:00.481]  Left about five o'clock, got home by dark.
[02:09:01.201 --> 02:09:03.564]  And I've never seen so much road rage.
[02:09:03.564 --> 02:09:10.671]  People in the slow lane pulling up behind you, pulling up behind other people, flipping each other off.
[02:09:10.671 --> 02:09:14.976]  I see men bowing up to each other constantly as the economy falls apart.
[02:09:14.976 --> 02:09:16.337]  There's a lot of stress.
[02:09:16.337 --> 02:09:23.484]  And then men want to feel like they're successful because of, I guess, the male prowess if I had to psychologically analyze it, psychoanalyze it.
[02:09:24.534 --> 02:09:31.758]  You see that with the police, the police taking roids, and you've got the media hyping all these threats and all this fear.
[02:09:31.758 --> 02:09:33.579]  I mean, I'm just trying to analyze it.
[02:09:33.579 --> 02:09:43.404]  For whatever reason, I'm seeing, I guess the MMA culture or whatever, and I'm not even saying that's a bad thing overall, people wanting to go out and have some rite of passage.
[02:09:43.404 --> 02:09:47.026]  Maybe they didn't have it in high school or college, I don't know.
[02:09:47.026 --> 02:09:53.229]  But a lot of times I find it's older, you know, like middle-aged guys who actually haven't been in a lot of fights.
[02:09:54.049 --> 02:10:02.936]  Once I, you know, look into who they are later in some of the cases I see in the newspaper and people I know, I mean, maybe I'm just grabbing at straws here.
[02:10:02.936 --> 02:10:11.743]  For whatever reason, finishing up with that question here with our guest of TargetFocusTraining.com, self-defense expert Tim Larkin.
[02:10:12.463 --> 02:10:14.124]  Who trains Navy SEALs, you name it.
[02:10:14.124 --> 02:10:20.107]  Tim, are you seeing more fights on the streets and things, not just in England, but also here in the US?
[02:10:20.107 --> 02:10:21.108]  A, why?
[02:10:21.108 --> 02:10:34.095]  And then B, finish the story you started before the break, where I was asking you, what do you do when you go down to the bar district to eat at a nice restaurant, and some guy for no reason goes, what you looking at, punk?
[02:10:34.095 --> 02:10:35.475]  And you're not even looking at him.
[02:10:35.475 --> 02:10:36.016]  And you're like,
[02:10:36.936 --> 02:10:37.877]  Nothing.
[02:10:37.877 --> 02:10:45.624]  And they think, just because you're clean cut, that you'll back off and it's like some little counting coup for them and their buddies.
[02:10:45.624 --> 02:10:50.189]  And then you give them what they want and you say, I don't see anything, mister, and walk away.
[02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:53.031]  So then they say something else and start walking towards you.
[02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:59.297]  What do you do when just everything in you wants to turn around and punch him right in the throat?
[02:10:59.297 --> 02:11:00.178]  What do you do at that point?
[02:11:01.138 --> 02:11:03.199]  Well that's the challenge and that's really what I do.
[02:11:03.199 --> 02:11:07.740]  I guess to illustrate the reason, I'll tell you where I changed tactics.
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:09.661]  I wasn't always this way.
[02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:15.363]  In my 20s I was doing a lot of work with the military, doing a lot of really fun stuff and I thought I was invulnerable.
[02:11:15.363 --> 02:11:25.146]  I made a huge, huge mistake in the idea that I had been working down in South America and I came back up to San Diego and I was hanging out with my friends and we're having a great time and I'm driving.
[02:11:26.747 --> 02:11:29.748]  We're talking bumper-to-bumper traffic and some guy thinks I cut in front of him.
[02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:31.489]  It was absolutely asinine.
[02:11:31.489 --> 02:11:39.953]  Guy gets in front of me, well he's raging, he's getting, you know, all, you know, he's behind me and he's getting all just worked up and I'm a couple cars up.
[02:11:39.953 --> 02:11:45.596]  And of course being a young guy and being, you know, hey I just got out of the jungles down here, what threat is San Diego?
[02:11:45.596 --> 02:11:51.479]  I start like blowing kisses in the mirror behind so he can see me because I just know it's just gonna, it's gonna get him.
[02:11:51.479 --> 02:11:52.039]  My friends are like,
[02:11:52.259 --> 02:11:53.340]  We're good to go.
[02:12:10.612 --> 02:12:10.812]  I don't
[02:12:32.185 --> 02:12:34.626]  Throw him down the back of his car.
[02:12:34.626 --> 02:12:36.047]  Throw him right down the back of his car.
[02:12:36.047 --> 02:12:38.268]  Just about to put him out, right?
[02:12:38.268 --> 02:12:40.469]  Gonna get that justification for the idiot, you know?
[02:12:40.469 --> 02:12:42.410]  My ego's feeling really great.
[02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:43.131]  And what do I see?
[02:12:43.131 --> 02:12:49.174]  I see a little three-year-old girl, face pressed up against the glass, crying, going, please don't hurt daddy.
[02:12:50.492 --> 02:13:12.836]  Today, you know, that image stuck in my head so many times, so that when the incident that I was telling you about, my son, you know, and I driving, and this guy just doing all the road rage stuff, he must have had a bad day, maybe he's in an office cubicle and he just decided, you know, I look like an easy guy to go off on because, you know, he was making fun of the fact that I seemed to be in good shape, all this other, he's trying to push every button on me.
[02:13:12.836 --> 02:13:17.057]  And I just told him, hey, have a good day and let him go, dropped my son off, and then went to
[02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:20.837]  I went to give my seminar.
[02:13:20.837 --> 02:13:29.459]  Now, the funny part about it was that week was the week that I came out on the cover of Black Belt Magazine as being a self-defense instructor.
[02:13:29.459 --> 02:13:34.860]  And my son was just kind of laughing to himself, going, Dad, does this guy... And I said, hey, Connor.
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:36.420]  I said, it makes no difference.
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:43.061]  I said, just because I have my training doesn't prevent me from being protected from violence.
[02:13:43.061 --> 02:13:46.382]  But the discipline of not using violence unless you absolutely have to.
[02:13:47.222 --> 02:13:49.344]  Wasn't it satisfying when you did the right thing?
[02:13:49.344 --> 02:13:53.446]  Because I know that whenever I do the right thing now, it's very satisfying.
[02:13:53.446 --> 02:13:58.290]  Alex, I tell everybody, whatever action, if you're going to put your hands on somebody, you have to think.
[02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:00.231]  And you can't do this stuff in the heat of the moment.
[02:14:00.231 --> 02:14:04.954]  You have to sit down, cup of coffee, by yourself, and think about this kind of stuff.
[02:14:04.954 --> 02:14:09.037]  And you have to ask yourself, does that action that I'm thinking of doing,
[02:14:09.697 --> 02:14:14.939]  You know, to satisfy my ego on the road rage and be the alpha in the road rage.
[02:14:14.939 --> 02:14:16.900]  Is it going to pass the three-day test?
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:27.505]  Meaning, when I do this action and if it ends up, now that I know, I'm educated about violence and I realize once I put my hands on this individual, either he or I could end up seriously injured or killed.
[02:14:27.505 --> 02:14:29.286]  Is that going to pass the three-day test?
[02:14:29.286 --> 02:14:35.529]  Three days from now, when I'm thinking about this incident, will I still sit there and say, yes, that was worth it?
[02:14:35.529 --> 02:14:38.110]  Very, very, very few situations meet that.
[02:14:38.871 --> 02:14:43.282]  Well, in closing, I'll tell you why the UK bans you, because I've seen this as part of a pattern.
[02:14:43.282 --> 02:14:44.826]  They want the monopoly of power.
[02:14:44.826 --> 02:14:46.089]  They're under that UN treaty.
[02:14:47.305 --> 02:14:56.572]  Where they believe the state has the monopoly on power and it's because you're cogent and charismatic and filled with Veritas, common sense.
[02:14:56.572 --> 02:15:02.357]  They don't want you to be able to go over there and be the keynote speaker and have it all over the news and actually speak for yourself.
[02:15:02.357 --> 02:15:10.623]  They don't want the people in the UK to pick up on what you're saying and doing because it makes so much sense and it's despicable.
[02:15:10.623 --> 02:15:12.325]  But I think now because of the internet
[02:15:13.635 --> 02:15:31.338]  This is going to backfire a hundred times the people in the UK, conservatively, this is all over the news now, that would have learned about what you're teaching, are now going to find out about it, and that's where tyrants always fail, is they think they're going to win by shutting us down up front, but if we just keep on it coming, they can't win.
[02:15:32.987 --> 02:15:36.293]  Well, Alex, I can't thank you enough for giving me the opportunity on this forum.
[02:15:36.293 --> 02:15:37.014]  It's been incredible.
[02:15:37.014 --> 02:15:38.497]  Well, it's been amazing having you.
[02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:40.179]  Thank you, Tim Larkin.
[02:15:40.179 --> 02:15:43.325]  The website where people can learn more, TargetFocusTraining.com.
[02:15:43.325 --> 02:15:44.868]  Are there any other websites folks should visit?
[02:15:46.259 --> 02:15:48.762]  They can do five-second survival.
[02:15:48.762 --> 02:15:50.443]  You know, they can spell it any different way.
[02:15:50.443 --> 02:15:52.705]  That's another great website where they get a lot of free information.
[02:15:52.705 --> 02:15:57.309]  I'm providing my whole book for people to download so they can really see what we're all about.
[02:15:57.309 --> 02:16:00.732]  So they can kind of see that we're not, we certainly aren't vigilantes.
[02:16:00.732 --> 02:16:01.113]  All right.
[02:16:01.113 --> 02:16:02.334]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:16:02.334 --> 02:16:03.235]  Take care.
[02:16:03.235 --> 02:16:04.256]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:06.778]  Well, that was a powerful interview.
[02:16:06.778 --> 02:16:08.039]  It went even better than I thought it would.
[02:16:08.039 --> 02:16:11.042]  So he's banned from the UK because he's articulate.
[02:16:11.861 --> 02:16:25.326]  And you got a bunch of crooks running that government, a bureaucracy that wants to have a bunch of victims that they can feed on while they flood the country with people from rough-and-tumble nations that are just... I mean, they admit it.
[02:16:25.326 --> 02:16:26.927]  I've had members of the Parliament on it.
[02:16:26.927 --> 02:16:27.287]  I don't care.
[02:16:27.287 --> 02:16:30.368]  It's not about race or color or even religion.
[02:16:30.368 --> 02:16:33.229]  The police force is being made up now of all the foreigners.
[02:16:34.534 --> 02:16:37.337]  In fact, when I was there, the cops would come over and they could hardly speak English.
[02:16:37.337 --> 02:16:39.459]  I'm like, is there an Englishman in this country?
[02:16:39.459 --> 02:16:47.286]  And I'm told it's the same in Ireland, it's the same in Scotland, it's the same in Wales, is that the bureaucracy, and I've had members of parliament on.
[02:16:48.007 --> 02:16:56.931]  The social workers, the cops, the little ninny cops, they've got these little sub-cops like TSA, they aren't even from the UK.
[02:16:56.931 --> 02:17:00.972]  And they come from countries where just 15 years ago they were under Soviet control.
[02:17:00.972 --> 02:17:02.673]  And they're bringing that exact system.
[02:17:02.673 --> 02:17:10.857]  And do they want the Brits or the Scots or anybody else rediscovering their humanity and their right to self-defense?
[02:17:10.857 --> 02:17:12.297]  Absolutely not.
[02:17:12.297 --> 02:17:13.798]  They don't want you discovering health.
[02:17:14.338 --> 02:17:18.562]  And I'm not... I've been out of shape for like a decade, just starting to get back into it.
[02:17:18.562 --> 02:17:20.824]  They don't... It's a revolution against tyranny.
[02:17:20.824 --> 02:17:21.985]  Get your body in order.
[02:17:21.985 --> 02:17:23.746]  Get your mind in order.
[02:17:23.746 --> 02:17:24.667]  Get prepared.
[02:17:24.667 --> 02:17:26.729]  Think about what you're going to do.
[02:17:26.729 --> 02:17:27.149]  I mean, me...
[02:17:28.644 --> 02:17:43.672]  I mean, constantly, you know, you run into these guys now, because a lot of them are on steroids, whatever, I don't think they've been in a lot of vicious fights, so they're not, I mean, run into real tough guys, they're real friendly, they're real nice, like that guy, all about being friendly, because you understand the reality of it.
[02:17:43.672 --> 02:17:48.155]  You get a bunch of cops, though, get this type of training, they go out and kill people all the time.
[02:17:48.789 --> 02:17:55.537]  TSA, the police they've got at the airports that aid the TSA, killing people all the time.
[02:17:55.537 --> 02:17:56.959]  And it's disgusting.
[02:17:56.959 --> 02:18:03.166]  And believe me, even if the cops get away with it, even if they're thugs, they don't feel good when you break some lady's neck three days later.
[02:18:03.166 --> 02:18:06.209]  I mean, you don't feel good when you do that.
[02:18:06.209 --> 02:18:07.171]  You don't feel good.
[02:18:09.338 --> 02:18:13.439]  I mean, I grew up, I can't believe I grew up in what I grew up in.
[02:18:13.439 --> 02:18:18.561]  I mean, it was ridiculous, the amount of fights and hospitalizations, and I've had my leg broken.
[02:18:18.561 --> 02:18:26.224]  It was a joke how many fights I got in, because people always started it, but I would never back down.
[02:18:26.224 --> 02:18:28.465]  And I'm like, wow, I got a pin in my leg.
[02:18:28.465 --> 02:18:30.746]  I've had all these concussions.
[02:18:30.746 --> 02:18:34.267]  I've got permanently black eyes from all these fights.
[02:18:34.267 --> 02:18:37.228]  What if I would have known to back off
[02:18:38.322 --> 02:18:41.894]  When people started fights with me.
[02:18:41.894 --> 02:18:43.559]  There would only been a handful.
[02:18:44.696 --> 02:18:46.036]  Of the fights I would have had to have.
[02:18:46.036 --> 02:18:49.297]  And the point is, you want to save yourself up for that.
[02:18:49.297 --> 02:18:52.819]  You want to save yourself up for when you've really got to defend yourself.
[02:18:52.819 --> 02:19:01.401]  Not just getting in a bunch of knock-down, drag-out fights, but instead it's just a bunch of men on police forces or in their pickup trucks.
[02:19:01.401 --> 02:19:09.184]  The way I see these cops act, they act just like some right head out of the gym who wants to come up to you because they're bigger than you and get in your face.
[02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:21.274]  Or, you know, I mean, I told the story when I was at South Padre last year, and I walk out of this restaurant, and these guys in motorcycles pull up with all their devil stuff and almost run over my three-year-old daughter.
[02:19:21.274 --> 02:19:25.716]  And I'm sitting there, and the guy starts to bow up, and I didn't even say anything.
[02:19:25.716 --> 02:19:30.038]  I just leaned over, and I was seconds from hurting him really bad, folks.
[02:19:30.988 --> 02:19:33.069]  And because I don't have a governor.
[02:19:33.069 --> 02:19:36.511]  And the guy backed off and said, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:19:36.511 --> 02:19:42.875]  But, you know, the point is, is that is that that's what those instincts are for is defending your children.
[02:19:42.875 --> 02:19:48.859]  The instincts to kill people are not there so you can act tough at the gym and shove people around.
[02:19:48.859 --> 02:19:53.702]  And all you so-called tough guys out there throwing your weight around, you obviously haven't met the right tough guy yet.
[02:19:54.102 --> 02:19:57.246]  Because any day of the week you're going to run into somebody 10 times tougher.
[02:19:57.246 --> 02:19:59.429]  That's where the Second Amendment comes in for defense.
[02:19:59.429 --> 02:20:00.311]  The big equalizer.
[02:20:00.311 --> 02:20:01.252]  We'll be back.
[02:20:01.252 --> 02:20:06.779]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:20:06.779 --> 02:20:09.183]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:20:09.183 --> 02:20:10.765]  My friends, I've done a lot of research.
[02:20:11.005 --> 02:20:14.889]  And the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[02:20:14.889 --> 02:20:18.272]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:20:18.272 --> 02:20:21.715]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:20:21.715 --> 02:20:23.396]  There's no priming required.
[02:20:23.396 --> 02:20:25.678]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:20:25.678 --> 02:20:28.180]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:20:29.241 --> 02:20:30.762]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:20:30.762 --> 02:20:32.203]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:20:32.203 --> 02:20:35.346]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:20:35.346 --> 02:20:38.748]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:20:38.748 --> 02:20:40.650]  Save money by not buying bottled water.

[02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:50.748]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:24:03.286 --> 02:24:25.320]  Hey, the New World Order's out there running around crazy, but at least we can get guns, get trained to defend ourselves physically, try to get prepared for what's coming down on us, because as things get worse and worse, more and more people are going to listen to us.
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:30.083]  Coming up, I'm going to get into some world news, and then to get into the fact that
[02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:41.699]  I watched federal police harass the daylights out of people down on the Texas coast, and it's all part of the nanny state getting the general public accustomed to being henpecked.
[02:24:41.699 --> 02:24:43.641]  That is coming up.
[02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:48.385]  8 Out of 10 Cats is probably the number one show in England.
[02:24:48.385 --> 02:24:56.412]  I had no idea how big this show was, but they asked last week permission to air a short clip of the show.
[02:24:58.353 --> 02:25:04.497]  Where I was talking about TSA people molesting people and basically raping them.
[02:25:04.497 --> 02:25:10.400]  That's what the penal code says, is that it's groping people, going in the pants as a felony.
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:13.061]  The outside is a misdemeanor.
[02:25:13.061 --> 02:25:17.924]  And they edited the tape, which is, I understand it's a comedy show.
[02:25:17.924 --> 02:25:18.905]  They want to make a joke out of it.
[02:25:18.905 --> 02:25:25.689]  And David Hasselhoff, you know, laughs, says, Alex Jones, like, oh, well, whenever they play the clip and ask him what he thinks about it,
[02:25:27.045 --> 02:25:30.268]  But my issue here is, they edited it down.
[02:25:30.268 --> 02:25:33.851]  Because I'm describing who wants a job as a TSA agent?
[02:25:33.851 --> 02:25:37.654]  Strip searching old ladies, looking in babies diapers, grabbing on women.
[02:25:37.654 --> 02:25:45.601]  And I want to point out, even if a woman looked like Marilyn Monroe, I wouldn't want to touch a woman who wasn't into it.
[02:25:46.505 --> 02:25:49.206]  But there are plenty of people that like to force it.
[02:25:49.206 --> 02:25:52.547]  Well, they edit it together to make it sound like I'm bad.
[02:25:52.547 --> 02:25:53.587]  So just classic.
[02:25:53.587 --> 02:26:00.689]  I mean, this is how they take this incredible issue of the now the TSA on the streets doing this.
[02:26:00.689 --> 02:26:03.470]  They're just the opposite of freedom and make a joke out of it.
[02:26:03.470 --> 02:26:05.891]  But at the end of the day, they'll go to Infowars.com and
[02:26:06.912 --> 02:26:11.936]  I guess this is what it takes to get the info out on the air because I'm told, a little bird told me, that we actually have fans over there.
[02:26:11.936 --> 02:26:17.920]  But it's interesting to have Hasselhoff, he's a funny guy, talking about the TSA.
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.982]  The full video is up at Infowars.com if you're a radio listener.
[02:26:20.982 --> 02:26:24.664]  It's titled, David Hasselhoff Loves the TSA.
[02:26:24.664 --> 02:26:26.226]  Let's go ahead and go to part of the clip.
[02:26:26.226 --> 02:26:26.566]  Here it is.
[02:26:31.515 --> 02:26:35.077]  And welcome to 8 Out Of 10 Cats, a show about opinion polls, surveys and statistics.
[02:26:35.077 --> 02:26:41.480]  Did you know, for example, 33% of British men say they like their smartphone as much as they like sex?
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:42.821]  For me, they're similar.
[02:26:42.821 --> 02:26:50.465]  About 5 inches long, and they've seen more than their fair share of Angry Birds.
[02:26:50.465 --> 02:26:53.787]  Meerkats are able to recognise each other by voice alone.
[02:26:53.787 --> 02:26:54.787]  How do they manage it?
[02:26:54.787 --> 02:26:55.928]  Well, it's complicated.
[02:26:59.987 --> 02:27:03.171]  And 43% of people say they've made love in a car.
[02:27:03.171 --> 02:27:04.032]  I know I have.
[02:27:04.032 --> 02:27:08.838]  I'll tell you what, if my car could talk, I'd be David Hasselhoff.
[02:27:08.838 --> 02:27:11.001]  Right, let's get started.
[02:27:11.001 --> 02:27:12.142]  OK, we've got one more thing to get.
[02:27:12.142 --> 02:27:12.703]  Fingers on buzzers.
[02:27:14.195 --> 02:27:15.095]  Go on, Sean.
[02:27:15.095 --> 02:27:18.257]  It's the, uh, the, the bomb.
[02:27:18.257 --> 02:27:19.138]  Pants bomber.
[02:27:19.138 --> 02:27:21.259]  The guy who had a bomb in his underpants.
[02:27:21.259 --> 02:27:24.540]  And he had no metal in it, which means it's obviously very bad news, because it means... That the U.S.
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:26.822]  government got on the plane, and the other guy's CIA.
[02:27:26.822 --> 02:27:31.184]  Next, you're gonna have to go onto the plane with your pants and a cellophane bag.
[02:27:31.724 --> 02:27:32.425]  Yeah, sway training.
[02:27:32.425 --> 02:27:38.530]  So this one, he was in fact a double agent, so they said, right, okay, you've got to go and blah blah, put these pants on and get on that plane.
[02:27:38.530 --> 02:27:40.471]  No, they staged it, what a double agent.
[02:27:40.471 --> 02:27:48.117]  I don't get it, so the old thing isn't there, say, suicide bombers, the idea is if they die in the process, they go to heaven and they get 72 virgins.
[02:27:48.117 --> 02:27:51.520]  If that's going to happen, then the last thing you're going to be blowing up is down there first, isn't it?
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.844]  My favourite fact about that is apparently it was supposed to be a mistranslation and it's not 72 virgins, it's 72 grapes.
[02:27:58.766 --> 02:28:00.807]  You'd be a bit ****, wouldn't you?
[02:28:00.807 --> 02:28:01.788]  You'd blame yourself.
[02:28:01.788 --> 02:28:03.169]  Yeah, we cut the cuss words out.
[02:28:03.169 --> 02:28:03.689]  Grapes.
[02:28:03.689 --> 02:28:04.209]  Grapes.
[02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:04.410]  What?
[02:28:04.410 --> 02:28:04.790]  Grapes.
[02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:06.971]  And even virgins isn't great, is it?
[02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:09.753]  Give me one girl who knows what she's doing.
[02:28:09.753 --> 02:28:12.294]  David, what do you make of airport security?
[02:28:12.294 --> 02:28:13.495]  Do you mind it?
[02:28:13.495 --> 02:28:20.880]  I'm very happy to wait in security and go through as long as, you know, they don't ask for an autograph or a picture.
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:22.741]  That isn't why the queue's so long, by the way.
[02:28:23.866 --> 02:28:24.767]  I'm very happy.
[02:28:24.767 --> 02:28:31.591]  I'm very happy with the security everywhere I go because it makes it a lot safer and if you have to wait in line.
[02:28:31.591 --> 02:28:33.993]  Some of your country people are not as fond of the airport security.
[02:28:33.993 --> 02:28:34.453]  Have a look at this.
[02:28:34.453 --> 02:28:43.019]  There's all these stalkers in people I've been reading now going and getting jobs especially in LAX and other areas so they can grope you.
[02:28:43.019 --> 02:28:45.100]  Pedophilia off the charts with them.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:46.281]  Robbing people's bags.
[02:28:46.281 --> 02:28:47.082]  Hitting on women.
[02:28:47.922 --> 02:28:48.862]  It's incredible.
[02:28:48.862 --> 02:28:52.883]  Who else wants to grab people's genitals all day?
[02:28:52.883 --> 02:28:55.804]  Who else wants to rub men and women's crotches?
[02:28:55.804 --> 02:29:00.065]  I mean, I don't care if it was Marilyn Monroe in her height of beauty.
[02:29:00.065 --> 02:29:03.165]  And I obviously would be attracted to a woman like that.
[02:29:03.165 --> 02:29:07.966]  I would be embarrassed and would not want to put my hands on her without her wanting it.
[02:29:07.966 --> 02:29:09.607]  I'm not a rapist.
[02:29:09.607 --> 02:29:10.767]  I'm not a molester.
[02:29:10.767 --> 02:29:12.127]  I'm not an abuser.
[02:29:12.127 --> 02:29:13.327]  I'm not a fondler.
[02:29:13.327 --> 02:29:16.128]  I don't go to parks to jump out and grab women.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:28.983]  Excuse me, I'm just filling out my application form.
[02:29:28.983 --> 02:29:31.465]  That was Alex Jones, the American shock jock.
[02:29:31.465 --> 02:29:34.807]  It's really one of those things, if you have to keep saying that, it doesn't look good.
[02:29:34.807 --> 02:29:42.272]  In my experience, if you have to hire a camera crew to film and go, hey, I don't jump out of parks and touch women.
[02:29:42.272 --> 02:29:44.154]  Stop saying I do.
[02:29:44.154 --> 02:29:46.155]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[02:29:50.458 --> 02:29:54.382]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:31:00.814 --> 02:31:05.357]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.357 --> 02:31:06.277]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.277 --> 02:31:09.700]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.700 --> 02:31:10.560]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:15.443]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.443 --> 02:31:16.184]  It's true.
[02:31:16.184 --> 02:31:21.067]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.067 --> 02:31:21.887]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.887 --> 02:31:25.470]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.470 --> 02:31:29.152]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.372 --> 02:31:30.173]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.173 --> 02:31:32.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.936 --> 02:31:36.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:37.400]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:41.565]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.565 --> 02:31:46.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:06.941 --> 02:33:08.502]  Touchin' hands.
[02:33:08.502 --> 02:33:10.183]  Your little daughter cryin'.
[02:33:10.183 --> 02:33:13.446]  The pot belly man with the mustache.
[02:33:13.446 --> 02:33:16.028]  He's a pedophile.
[02:33:16.028 --> 02:33:19.450]  And your kid is his.
[02:33:19.450 --> 02:33:25.294]  Cause Dianne Feinstein hates America.
[02:33:25.294 --> 02:33:31.439]  And she says get ready for anal cavity searches as well.
[02:33:32.319 --> 02:33:37.046]  It's the pervert, control freak government.
[02:33:37.046 --> 02:33:42.855]  The symbol of America is strip searches.
[02:33:42.855 --> 02:33:43.976]  You like that I'm a good singer?
[02:33:43.976 --> 02:33:47.681]  Ha ha, can't handle it anymore.
[02:33:47.681 --> 02:33:48.362]  Oh my God.
[02:33:50.646 --> 02:33:55.129]  Now they're saying because of butt bombers they're going to have to start doing intense inspections.
[02:33:55.129 --> 02:33:57.130]  They say strip searches.
[02:33:57.130 --> 02:33:59.892]  Australia's talking about full body x-rays.
[02:33:59.892 --> 02:34:04.435]  And that they're going to have to strip search you and well, I told you that was coming next.
[02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:07.277]  And then there might be a butt bomber on the highway.
[02:34:07.277 --> 02:34:11.500]  So your wife's got to get a proctology exam by some perv!
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:15.823]  And these psych warfare chiefs know what they're doing.
[02:34:16.624 --> 02:34:25.227]  If they can get away with this, they got away with putting fluoride that's 8-fold increase in cancer in boys, it's 7-fold in men.
[02:34:25.227 --> 02:34:28.469]  I mean, go look it up, they can get away with anything!
[02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:29.489]  Look at this!
[02:34:29.489 --> 02:34:33.331]  That's a pretty good thing, my voice cracking and everything.
[02:34:33.331 --> 02:34:41.494]  I'm walking up right before I go back on air live, and they're sitting there playing clips, and I could tell it was for TSA, and they were like laughing.
[02:34:41.494 --> 02:34:44.575]  Neil Diamond, so there you go, my imitation of Neil Diamond.
[02:34:46.061 --> 02:34:58.086]  By the way, the video and audio of my breakdown of Bilderberg this year with Mike Adams went up on the website over the weekend.
[02:34:58.086 --> 02:35:06.369]  Sources inside Bilderberg, Spill Cabal's secret plans, very important article, location and details of Palm Tree Conference confirmed.
[02:35:06.369 --> 02:35:13.352]  Now I have one mole who's not connected to Bilderberg, and I need to be clear on that, but is connected to Bilderberg.
[02:35:16.015 --> 02:35:21.480]  They're not part of Bilderberg, but it's a source inside Bilderberg, if you know what I mean.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:33.530]  And then we have another penetrator, and no, I'm not talking about TSA with, well, excuse me, who is under Bilderberg.
[02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:35.752]  This is quite a coup d'etat.
[02:35:35.752 --> 02:35:44.059]  So I'm very excited about that, and this ups the ante with the globalists, so I'll imagine they're not too pleased with any of this.
[02:35:44.963 --> 02:35:48.906]  But it is in Chantilly, and I want to see everybody there, so please get that article out.
[02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:51.949]  The easiest place to find it is at realalexjones.com.
[02:35:51.949 --> 02:35:54.211]  It's like seven or eight tweets down.
[02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:58.954]  If you go to the RSS feed, it says Breaking News, or even the Featured News Archive.
[02:36:00.845 --> 02:36:12.782]  Off the page because hundreds of new articles go up a day at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but it's so important to check out the stuff that you may miss at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:12.782 --> 02:36:15.085]  You can simply go there.
[02:36:16.816 --> 02:36:20.639]  And I'm trying to get back to the site, actually, so I can tell you what the top stories are.
[02:36:20.639 --> 02:36:25.102]  Because so many new ones have just gone up on the site in the last 20, 30 minutes or so.
[02:36:25.102 --> 02:36:28.925]  No, I said I'd open the phones up today, and I haven't done that yet.
[02:36:28.925 --> 02:36:30.466]  Oh, just some news like this.
[02:36:30.466 --> 02:36:36.050]  FEMA and Pentagon's National Guard Homeland Response Force trains in New York.
[02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:41.774]  It's also in the news again, confirming, oh yes, the Russians are training over here to take on American terrorists.
[02:36:41.774 --> 02:36:43.275]  Russian TV's very proud of that.
[02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:52.156]  The Communist Chinese government's buying up land, railways, infrastructure, banks, natural gas.
[02:36:52.156 --> 02:36:53.698]  Police hunt man for sport.
[02:36:54.798 --> 02:37:00.959]  That video they've been censoring is reposted up at Infowars.com of the murder of Kelly Thomas.
[02:37:00.959 --> 02:37:06.581]  Established dirty tricks at conventions target Paul supporters.
[02:37:06.581 --> 02:37:07.701]  New Steve Watson article.
[02:37:07.701 --> 02:37:10.362]  Also talking surveillance cameras coming to U.S.
[02:37:10.362 --> 02:37:10.682]  streets.
[02:37:10.682 --> 02:37:12.742]  They've had them in England for five years.
[02:37:12.742 --> 02:37:13.722]  Now they're coming here.
[02:37:13.722 --> 02:37:15.803]  They have microphones hidden and watch you.
[02:37:15.803 --> 02:37:17.823]  All part of living in 1984.
[02:37:17.823 --> 02:37:24.125]  But the border's wide open and the government's shipping in narcotics, but they've got to teach you that you're a little prisoner.
[02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:26.723]  Another report we just played part of.
[02:37:26.723 --> 02:37:28.424]  The rest of it's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:28.424 --> 02:37:30.746]  David Hasselhoff loves the TSA.
[02:37:30.746 --> 02:37:36.049]  And then he laughs and says after they play the clip, Alex Jones!
[02:37:36.049 --> 02:37:37.450]  Hey, we'd like to get the Hoff on.
[02:37:37.450 --> 02:37:39.172]  He is quite a character.
[02:37:39.172 --> 02:37:40.633]  Big fan of him and Hop as well.
[02:37:40.633 --> 02:37:42.314]  You can tell I like Hop.
[02:37:42.314 --> 02:37:43.795]  I like Carlos and Hop.
[02:37:44.711 --> 02:37:49.214]  Feinstein, get ready for more aggressive molestation at the airport.
[02:37:49.214 --> 02:37:52.155]  And that's why I just look at the photograph of Feinstein.
[02:37:52.155 --> 02:37:55.517]  I mean, she has armed guards but wants you disarmed.
[02:37:55.517 --> 02:37:57.318]  She wants total socialism.
[02:37:57.318 --> 02:38:00.520]  She loves the carbon taxes that have just devastated California.
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:01.481]  That's in the news today.
[02:38:01.481 --> 02:38:04.342]  I mean, she is a piece of trash.
[02:38:04.342 --> 02:38:08.064]  And she looks like Darth Vader with a wig on.
[02:38:08.064 --> 02:38:10.886]  Remember when they take the helmet off Darth Vader and he's like,
[02:38:12.188 --> 02:38:14.409]  Luke, I can see you with my own eyes.
[02:38:14.409 --> 02:38:16.630]  She literally looks like that actor.
[02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:19.971]  I mean, she looks like a weird skeletal creature.
[02:38:19.971 --> 02:38:21.251]  And I'm just sick of her.
[02:38:21.251 --> 02:38:23.812]  Listen, you witch piece of trash!
[02:38:23.812 --> 02:38:24.952]  I'm sick of you!
[02:38:24.952 --> 02:38:37.917]  I can't even fly because your dirty federal pedophile army, who's out of their jurisdiction and aren't even sworn officers, are going to molest everybody and put us in microwave ovens that are killing the little idiot TSA workers.
[02:38:38.337 --> 02:38:46.020]  You witch who flies around on government jets and is filthy rich doesn't put up with this, you piece of filth, you maggot!
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:50.782]  Oh, you make me angry.
[02:38:50.782 --> 02:38:56.183]  I read her quotes here about, I know the public has not been terribly sympathetic, but get used to it.
[02:38:56.183 --> 02:38:57.044]  There's more coming.
[02:38:57.044 --> 02:38:59.785]  I mean, go read the quotes.
[02:38:59.785 --> 02:39:02.206]  She's like, steady, we've got to control these slaves.
[02:39:02.206 --> 02:39:04.526]  We can get away with this.
[02:39:04.526 --> 02:39:05.827]  We can get away with anything.
[02:39:10.051 --> 02:39:11.092]  And it just goes on.
[02:39:11.092 --> 02:39:20.720]  I mean, this is all based on a made-up baloney about the last underwear bomber who was a government minion, mind-control idiot.
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:21.381]  They admit the U.S.
[02:39:21.381 --> 02:39:26.946]  government got him on the plane, and he's being escorted drooling onto the aircraft.
[02:39:26.946 --> 02:39:33.131]  The FBI, even the New York Times has met, has gone and set up schizophrenics, mentally ill, retarded people, you name it.
[02:39:34.090 --> 02:39:41.537]  I mean, they literally go find mentally retarded street people who don't even know their name and say they're jihads or white supremacists.
[02:39:41.537 --> 02:39:48.143]  They go find white homeless ex-cons, crackheads, and they're the new army that's gonna kill everybody.
[02:39:48.143 --> 02:39:49.865]  And we gotta give our rights up to the government.
[02:39:50.902 --> 02:39:57.944]  Justice Department runs all this, that idiot moron, new Black Panther group saying, start race wars, kill Whitey, burn everything down.
[02:39:57.944 --> 02:39:59.644]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:39:59.644 --> 02:40:01.845]  I told you they were feds and it came out they were.
[02:40:01.845 --> 02:40:04.646]  No one is allowed to do that unless they're fed, okay?
[02:40:04.646 --> 02:40:10.688]  If I got on air and said that, they would have police here in an hour, and they should.
[02:40:10.688 --> 02:40:15.189]  You got free speech, but you can't say, go blow up the Capitol.
[02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:21.942]  If somebody actually tried to organize that on air, they'd go to jail.
[02:40:21.942 --> 02:40:25.345]  Because that is calling for violence.
[02:40:25.345 --> 02:40:28.387]  You can't do that.
[02:40:28.387 --> 02:40:31.329]  It just makes my head spin.
[02:40:31.329 --> 02:40:32.850]  By the way, I'm trying to find my article.
[02:40:32.850 --> 02:40:33.951]  Where did it go?
[02:40:33.951 --> 02:40:35.091]  It's a top story today.
[02:40:35.091 --> 02:40:37.333]  It's already scrolled off the main page.
[02:40:37.333 --> 02:40:39.274]  It's so important.
[02:40:39.274 --> 02:40:41.836]  No, there's my other article about the imploding economy.
[02:40:41.836 --> 02:40:43.117]  Where's my article about the...
[02:40:47.930 --> 02:40:53.492]  Where's my article about the, uh, no, that's the 18-month-old baby flagged as a terrorist can't fly.
[02:40:53.492 --> 02:41:16.782]  Guys, pull up Paul Watson's article, please, um, with the photo from French news agency where they admit, where they admit on record that there's Al-Qaeda guys in black uniforms with the Al-Qaeda flag with the UN observers and the Secretary
[02:41:18.305 --> 02:41:18.865]  The U.N.
[02:41:18.865 --> 02:41:19.946]  envoy to the U.N.
[02:41:19.946 --> 02:41:30.094]  under Secretary Clinton, Rice, comes out Friday and says there'll be more bombings inside Damascus of government buildings if you don't do what we say.
[02:41:30.094 --> 02:41:30.715]  There it is.
[02:41:30.715 --> 02:41:32.436]  Al Qaeda rebel pictured with U.N.
[02:41:32.436 --> 02:41:34.197]  observer in Syria.
[02:41:34.197 --> 02:41:37.600]  Video also shows rebels transported in U.N.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:38.541]  vehicles chanting
[02:41:39.585 --> 02:41:39.985]  I don't know.
[02:41:55.098 --> 02:41:57.981]  Al-Qaeda flag flying over Tripoli.
[02:41:57.981 --> 02:42:08.629]  All over Libya, Al-Qaeda is the main force, given weapons by our criminal Federal Reserve occupational New World Order government, along with the collaborators with the New World Order.
[02:42:08.629 --> 02:42:09.230]  They're giving them...
[02:42:10.819 --> 02:42:12.220]  Who do you think the globalists are allied with?
[02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:12.820]  Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:14.461]  That's Al Qaeda central.
[02:42:14.461 --> 02:42:15.902]  Who do you think they use to attack Iran?
[02:42:15.902 --> 02:42:16.903]  Al Qaeda.
[02:42:16.903 --> 02:42:21.326]  The State Department admitted six years ago they fund five different terrorist groups to attack Iran.
[02:42:21.326 --> 02:42:22.186]  Four of them Al Qaeda.
[02:42:22.186 --> 02:42:22.927]  There it is.
[02:42:22.927 --> 02:42:23.687]  Daily Mail.
[02:42:23.687 --> 02:42:26.269]  Flying proudly over the birthplace of Libya's revolution.
[02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.669]  The flag of Al Qaeda.
[02:42:27.669 --> 02:42:28.650]  There it is.
[02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:31.052]  That's the patch on the guy's arm.
[02:42:31.052 --> 02:42:34.634]  That's who they landed by the thousands in those boats the U.S.
[02:42:34.634 --> 02:42:37.656]  and NATO navies brought in.
[02:42:37.656 --> 02:42:37.996]  And then
[02:42:39.761 --> 02:42:45.226]  I've gotta, when I fly, they'll say, oh Alex Jones is a troublemaker, where are you going?
[02:42:45.226 --> 02:42:48.748]  They now do the behavior thing, and I go, dude, you want me to play patty cake with you?
[02:42:48.748 --> 02:42:53.352]  You work for a criminal government that has you seizing control of transportation.
[02:42:53.352 --> 02:42:55.294]  You work for the people that run Al Qaeda.
[02:42:55.294 --> 02:42:56.655]  Just shut up!
[02:42:56.655 --> 02:42:57.616]  Shut up!
[02:42:57.616 --> 02:42:58.596]  Shut up!
[02:42:58.596 --> 02:42:59.958]  Shut up, traitor!
[02:42:59.958 --> 02:43:02.259]  Shut up, scum!
[02:43:02.259 --> 02:43:03.400]  Get out of my face!
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:14.627]  I'm not an unconscious jellyfish yuppie that doesn't know what country this is, that doesn't know the New World Order, it runs Al-Qaeda!
[02:43:14.627 --> 02:43:18.570]  There's more photos of it, of the Al-Qaeda flags.
[02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:19.610]  And that's who they're using.
[02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:23.673]  They admitted, they even said, oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda's bombing Syria a month ago.
[02:43:23.673 --> 02:43:25.775]  We better give our rights up, they may attack us.
[02:43:25.775 --> 02:43:27.436]  Look, I actually saw on the news.
[02:43:28.626 --> 02:43:30.627]  I was flipping through channels here at the office like a month ago.
[02:43:30.627 --> 02:43:32.488]  I mean, there's articles you can pull them up.
[02:43:32.488 --> 02:43:35.731]  They're like, well, it just shows Al-Qaeda is still alive.
[02:43:35.731 --> 02:43:40.073]  They're attacking Syria and blew up the police stations.
[02:43:40.073 --> 02:43:41.434]  And then it was Fox News.
[02:43:41.434 --> 02:43:44.236]  I remember it was at CNN.
[02:43:44.236 --> 02:43:47.118]  And they just moved right along.
[02:43:47.118 --> 02:43:54.803]  So they use Al-Qaeda to attack Syria and Libya and then even use that to say, look, Al-Qaeda is alive and well.
[02:43:54.803 --> 02:43:57.965]  We need to take all your money and take all your freedom.
[02:43:59.551 --> 02:44:03.492]  That is propaganda designed for people that are completely asleep.
[02:44:03.492 --> 02:44:18.317]  It's like when Bush gets up and says, well, Iran is running Al-Qaeda, the Shiite Al-Qaeda, and the State Department official gets up and says, Mr. President, respectfully, the Shiites and the Sunnis are two different groups.
[02:44:18.317 --> 02:44:20.118]  And Bush goes back to the podium and goes, no, they're not!
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:36.575]  The total disdain, where you're going to give your rights up, you're going to have your family assaulted, you're going to have fed goons running around at checkpoints everywhere on the highways now.
[02:44:36.575 --> 02:44:42.862]  And again, there's no real threats, so they have to manufacture them, and then everything becomes a threat.
[02:44:42.862 --> 02:44:43.824]  Let me tell you this story now.
[02:44:45.908 --> 02:44:54.513]  Okay, it's my mother for Mother's Day wants to go to where my parents went when they first went on a road date.
[02:44:54.513 --> 02:44:57.715]  You know, they've been dating a few months at University of Texas in the 60s.
[02:44:57.715 --> 02:45:07.461]  And the first place they went on a road trip date was to the Texas National Seashore Padre Island to camp out.
[02:45:07.461 --> 02:45:08.742]  And so she likes to go down there.
[02:45:08.742 --> 02:45:10.803]  We went down there last Mother's Day.
[02:45:10.803 --> 02:45:14.265]  And so I'm going to go out there and I'm going to hang out with them at their pop-up camper.
[02:45:15.666 --> 02:45:21.090]  And so we're sitting there on the beach and there's no one down there on Friday.
[02:45:21.090 --> 02:45:24.213]  I mean, literally like one fisherman an hour drives by.
[02:45:24.213 --> 02:45:36.922]  Except, there's with Homeland Security decals, SUVs, big trucks and SUVs driving up and down.
[02:45:36.922 --> 02:45:42.646]  And you look at the body language of these Department of the Interior federal law enforcement officers assigned to the
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:54.708]  Park Service, which is hundreds of miles from the border, no crime to speak of, middle of nowhere, and they're driving up and down, and they drive, and they stare at you, and they look at you, and there's little kids.
[02:45:54.708 --> 02:45:56.609]  My little kids are building sandcastles.
[02:45:56.609 --> 02:45:59.011]  I'm sitting there, leaning back, drinking a fresca or whatever.
[02:45:59.011 --> 02:46:03.254]  I wasn't actually drinking a fresca, but you know what I mean, drinking a water.
[02:46:03.254 --> 02:46:06.877]  I like to say that because Ted Knight says it in Caddyshack.
[02:46:06.877 --> 02:46:07.917]  How about a fresca?
[02:46:07.917 --> 02:46:10.640]  Point is, totally non-threatening.
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:13.642]  You can assess, this is just, you know, oh, there's the grandparents, there's the parents.
[02:46:14.824 --> 02:46:16.065]  And they keep looking at us.
[02:46:16.065 --> 02:46:17.506]  So I think, okay, something's going on here.
[02:46:17.506 --> 02:46:20.688]  And they just keep driving back and forth, back and forth.
[02:46:20.688 --> 02:46:22.970]  I mean, just right in front of us, right in front of the beach.
[02:46:22.970 --> 02:46:24.231]  Just over and over again looking at us.
[02:46:24.231 --> 02:46:27.173]  Nothing to do.
[02:46:27.173 --> 02:46:30.236]  That's my video I shot when I was showing it on screen when I went to town.
[02:46:30.236 --> 02:46:33.018]  That's another video that I shot once I got into town.
[02:46:33.018 --> 02:46:33.638]  I left.
[02:46:33.638 --> 02:46:36.120]  I went into Port A. I just couldn't handle it.
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:36.961]  I had to get out of there.
[02:46:38.237 --> 02:46:47.965]  And this guy pulls up, and my children are walking around, and my children have been running around up on the edge of the dunes, and of course the Nanny State always has an excuse for why they're there.
[02:46:47.965 --> 02:46:50.867]  Oh, I just want to warn you, there's rattlesnakes.
[02:46:50.867 --> 02:46:52.748]  We're like, oh, thank you, yes.
[02:46:52.748 --> 02:46:54.110]  And then it goes on for about 20 minutes.
[02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:55.991]  Yeah, it's not illegal.
[02:46:55.991 --> 02:47:01.055]  It starts looking at us like it's Barney Five, it's going to scare us, but you probably don't want to do that.
[02:47:01.055 --> 02:47:03.677]  And I went, yeah, I know, we live in Central Texas, we even have more rattlesnakes.
[02:47:03.677 --> 02:47:05.759]  I go, how many rattlesnake incidents?
[02:47:05.759 --> 02:47:06.960]  Oh, four last year.
[02:47:08.101 --> 02:47:12.344]  Of what, millions that come down here to the, you know, 70 miles of this or something?
[02:47:12.344 --> 02:47:12.684]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:12.684 --> 02:47:13.525]  Oh, you're right.
[02:47:13.525 --> 02:47:15.026]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:15.026 --> 02:47:16.867]  The parents are actually doing the talking.
[02:47:16.867 --> 02:47:20.669]  And he goes, yeah, we've got people that try to poach the sea turtles.
[02:47:20.669 --> 02:47:21.430]  He starts looking at us.
[02:47:21.430 --> 02:47:23.091]  They're about to, they're about to hatch.
[02:47:23.091 --> 02:47:24.912]  And we're going, okay, great.
[02:47:24.912 --> 02:47:26.533]  Oh, yeah, green sea turtles.
[02:47:26.533 --> 02:47:27.634]  Yeah.
[02:47:27.634 --> 02:47:29.315]  And he just goes on and on.
[02:47:29.315 --> 02:47:32.017]  The questions, he's assessing us.
[02:47:32.017 --> 02:47:34.058]  Dude, I've assessed you.
[02:47:34.058 --> 02:47:36.540]  Okay, you're lucky if you can tie your shoelaces.
[02:47:37.878 --> 02:47:42.079]  Don't look like the chromosomes mix too well, okay?
[02:47:42.079 --> 02:47:43.920]  I've assessed you.
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:46.320]  I actually built a media system.
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:50.381]  I actually have a successful family of professionals.
[02:47:50.381 --> 02:47:51.461]  I'm somebody.
[02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:52.722]  You're nobody.
[02:47:52.722 --> 02:47:57.263]  Your uniform doesn't make you anybody, little boy.
[02:47:57.263 --> 02:48:00.384]  My mind is light years ahead of you.
[02:48:00.384 --> 02:48:02.144]  So you haven't had success with women.
[02:48:02.144 --> 02:48:04.065]  Let me assess that part.
[02:48:04.065 --> 02:48:05.205]  Oh yeah, I know who you are.
[02:48:06.127 --> 02:48:08.208]  I bet your family hadn't had much success.
[02:48:08.208 --> 02:48:16.152]  They picked you up like somebody scooped dog manure off the ground to turn you into a little minion.
[02:48:16.152 --> 02:48:24.877]  Anyways, the point is, then more rolling by later, and I'm walking around with my kids on the beach and I hear, hey Alex.
[02:48:24.877 --> 02:48:26.878]  I go, oh, this is personal.
[02:48:27.714 --> 02:48:33.663]  It's another group of them, two lazy ne'er-do-wells who want to exercise power on people all day.
[02:48:33.663 --> 02:48:35.024]  Losers!
[02:48:35.024 --> 02:48:36.547]  Losers!
[02:48:36.547 --> 02:48:40.472]  Again, in the old days, you'd see them maybe once a day and they're like, hey, how you doing?
[02:48:40.472 --> 02:48:41.654]  Hey, have you checked out this?
[02:48:41.654 --> 02:48:42.915]  No, this is in your face.
[02:48:44.284 --> 02:48:48.227]  Of course, I forgot to add, when I pull in, the guy goes, excuse me, where are you from?
[02:48:48.227 --> 02:48:51.509]  And I'll go, oh God, an assessment, just like at Carlsbad Cavern.
[02:48:51.509 --> 02:48:52.270]  I'm from Austin.
[02:48:52.270 --> 02:48:54.892]  He goes, oh, I'm a listener, Alex, like your show.
[02:48:54.892 --> 02:48:56.273]  And he seemed, oh, okay.
[02:48:56.273 --> 02:48:58.435]  And he had another guy with him, and the guy's like, huh?
[02:48:58.435 --> 02:48:59.255]  And I'm like, okay.
[02:48:59.255 --> 02:49:02.758]  So I go, huh, and I drive in.
[02:49:02.758 --> 02:49:04.539]  Okay, so now it's about an hour later.
[02:49:04.539 --> 02:49:09.543]  I'm behind the pop-up showering off, because that little, you know, shower thing to get the salt water off me.
[02:49:09.543 --> 02:49:11.424]  And I hear two of them get out.
[02:49:12.304 --> 02:49:18.867]  And they walk over and they go, just what do you think you're doing?
[02:49:18.867 --> 02:49:23.349]  And I hear my wife go, oh, get the camera.
[02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:26.890]  And I walk around with water dripping off me in shorts.
[02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:30.212]  And it's about seven o'clock at night, beautiful sunset.
[02:49:30.212 --> 02:49:31.452]  And there are two of them.
[02:49:31.452 --> 02:49:32.513]  I haven't seen these.
[02:49:32.513 --> 02:49:34.254]  It's like roaches, there's so many.
[02:49:34.254 --> 02:49:36.775]  Way too much tax money, folks.
[02:49:36.775 --> 02:49:39.396]  I mean, that, anyway, side issue.
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:43.261]  They're listening right now, I'm sure.
[02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:44.421]  I don't have any better time.
[02:49:44.421 --> 02:49:52.926]  It's a giant compound like a like a Martian base or something that they've got out there of tax money when you drive in there.
[02:49:52.926 --> 02:49:55.787]  And again, everybody feeds the seagulls.
[02:49:55.787 --> 02:49:57.488]  We actually weren't even feeding them.
[02:49:57.488 --> 02:50:04.552]  Because I told the kids I didn't want to because I don't want them defecating on us, which still happened anyways.
[02:50:04.552 --> 02:50:06.273]  The point is, is that
[02:50:08.379 --> 02:50:14.043]  A few seagulls are flying around, and the kids had dropped a hamburger bun in the thing and threw it up.
[02:50:14.043 --> 02:50:21.189]  They instantly caught it, like a South Park episode, and pop up, but didn't say, hey kids, don't feed the seagulls.
[02:50:21.189 --> 02:50:30.536]  My mother said in 40 plus years going down there, never seen this many, never had them even talk to her other than waving, just like piranhas, and telling you, you know, I'm a federal law enforcement agent.
[02:50:30.536 --> 02:50:34.319]  We're like, I'm like, dude, I walk around the corner,
[02:50:36.516 --> 02:50:37.957]  And again, they need to be pulled down off their pedestal.
[02:50:37.957 --> 02:50:38.617]  That's why I'm doing that.
[02:50:38.617 --> 02:50:39.957]  They can't stand it.
[02:50:39.957 --> 02:50:42.078]  I walk around the corner and I say, look, I'm never coming back.
[02:50:42.078 --> 02:50:42.558]  I understand.
[02:50:42.558 --> 02:50:43.659]  It's June 21.
[02:50:43.659 --> 02:50:46.440]  I know you're shutting down seashores all over the country, which they're doing.
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:47.300]  They're like nodding.
[02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:48.681]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:50:48.681 --> 02:50:51.382]  You're not even going to be on most of that soon.
[02:50:51.382 --> 02:50:54.443]  They're passing weird regulations where you can't even get in the water.
[02:50:54.443 --> 02:50:57.244]  The nannies, they ban dodgeball all over the country.
[02:50:57.244 --> 02:50:59.285]  These people hate America.
[02:50:59.285 --> 02:51:00.446]  I mean, they are scum.
[02:51:01.386 --> 02:51:05.770]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[02:53:51.706 --> 02:53:55.028]  Do business with an authority on survival.
[02:53:55.028 --> 02:53:57.710]  CampingSurvival.com.
[02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:59.651]  Confidence born on preparation.
[02:54:08.018 --> 02:54:09.899]  Yeah, the summers of old are gone.
[02:54:09.899 --> 02:54:13.221]  You can't fly without perverts trying to assault you.
[02:54:13.221 --> 02:54:17.183]  You can't go to a federal beach.
[02:54:17.183 --> 02:54:19.944]  By the way, it wasn't just us, though.
[02:54:19.944 --> 02:54:26.788]  They were stopping at every two or three cars and harassing other people.
[02:54:26.788 --> 02:54:30.009]  And what I found was, because I went and interviewed them.
[02:54:30.009 --> 02:54:31.150]  I've got some of this on video.
[02:54:32.745 --> 02:54:34.946]  Car to my left's a listener, car to my right.
[02:54:34.946 --> 02:54:41.929]  Right after I confront them and they leave, first car that drives by, hey, Alex Jones, we're listeners.
[02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:43.050]  I'm like, yeah, it's a police state.
[02:54:43.050 --> 02:54:46.531]  He goes, yeah, we got 20 questions back at the gate.
[02:54:46.531 --> 02:54:50.653]  And again, my great uncle was dying of cancer.
[02:54:50.653 --> 02:54:52.634]  Wanted to go deer hunting one more time.
[02:54:52.634 --> 02:54:54.475]  Shot a deer, they took it to the processor.
[02:54:54.475 --> 02:54:55.496]  He didn't want to field dress it.
[02:54:55.496 --> 02:54:58.257]  I mean, they cut its guts out.
[02:54:58.257 --> 02:55:00.238]  They didn't want to fully chop it all up.
[02:55:01.474 --> 02:55:07.778]  State police pull my uncle and my dad over, blow up, pull guns out, freak out, tell them they're going to jail.
[02:55:07.778 --> 02:55:12.981]  My dad's sitting there going, the law is, we're the landowner, we can take it to the processor.
[02:55:12.981 --> 02:55:14.222]  There's the tag.
[02:55:14.222 --> 02:55:14.922]  They don't care.
[02:55:14.922 --> 02:55:16.563]  They want you to be a prisoner.
[02:55:16.563 --> 02:55:18.725]  They want you to be bad.
[02:55:18.725 --> 02:55:21.967]  And this year, I'm not even deer hunting.
[02:55:21.967 --> 02:55:24.368]  We're on our property.
[02:55:24.368 --> 02:55:28.211]  Whole bunch of game wardens show up.
[02:55:28.211 --> 02:55:29.952]  I mean, man, my family founded the county.
[02:55:30.663 --> 02:55:32.824]  You know, founded the area.
[02:55:32.824 --> 02:55:35.005]  Doesn't matter, I'm scum.
[02:55:35.005 --> 02:55:42.230]  And they're just swarming all over everyone and telling everybody we're part of a federally funded task force.
[02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:49.134]  And some of the guys that were there, one of them had read in a whitetail hunting magazine, knew one of them, and said, oh, I saw you in a magazine.
[02:55:49.134 --> 02:55:53.156]  Suddenly, when it was about ego that way, oh my gosh, we worship you now.
[02:55:54.383 --> 02:55:57.045]  And it's like, wow, there's like six or seven of you.
[02:55:57.045 --> 02:55:58.026]  Well, we're your friends.
[02:55:58.026 --> 02:56:03.650]  Let us go ahead and check your records and go in your building and without warrants and all this.
[02:56:03.650 --> 02:56:05.671]  This is what America's turned into.
[02:56:05.671 --> 02:56:16.019]  And meanwhile, the government is narcotics, child kidnapping running on record, guns in New Mexico, every form of crime run by big foreign banks.
[02:56:16.019 --> 02:56:21.122]  So even if you individually aren't bad, you are under the dragon's wing.
[02:56:21.122 --> 02:56:23.264]  You are the equivalent of a Soviet.
[02:56:24.747 --> 02:56:26.608]  Under Stalin.
[02:56:26.608 --> 02:56:29.109]  And so I don't care!
[02:56:29.109 --> 02:56:34.252]  Look, all I know is I don't want contact with you, and I can't get away from you.
[02:56:34.252 --> 02:56:44.257]  I mean, they've tripled the number of police in the last few years, and bureaucrats, and they're all arming, and training, and freaking out, and buying into it's Al-Qaeda.
[02:56:44.257 --> 02:56:50.039]  But meanwhile, they've now announced, oh, it's not Al-Qaeda, it's for you, the American people, selling Girl Scout cookies and lemonade.
[02:56:50.039 --> 02:56:50.880]  We're gonna arrest you.
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:58.967]  And we're going to shut down garage sales, and you're not allowed to use cash in Louisiana in second-hand sales, because you can't be trusted, or is it Mississippi?
[02:56:58.967 --> 02:57:00.889]  I mean, all of this is tyranny.
[02:57:00.889 --> 02:57:02.410]  I know what this is.
[02:57:02.410 --> 02:57:09.637]  So stop getting off on your government costume, and understand, I've read the Declaration of Independence.
[02:57:09.637 --> 02:57:11.318]  I know what it is to be an American.
[02:57:11.318 --> 02:57:13.641]  And what you're doing ain't it!
[02:57:13.641 --> 02:57:15.863]  I don't care if it's in some pipe dream about Al Qaeda.
[02:57:17.079 --> 02:57:19.980]  So I said, don't worry, you've destroyed America, Gen 21.
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:21.801]  I know they've told you to start pressuring people.
[02:57:21.801 --> 02:57:25.583]  Everybody used to not being able to go in the dunes or in the water.
[02:57:25.583 --> 02:57:28.644]  And they're like, kind of freaked out that I knew all that.
[02:57:28.644 --> 02:57:30.845]  I'm like, so do whatever you're going to do.
[02:57:30.845 --> 02:57:32.406]  I'm never coming back here.
[02:57:32.406 --> 02:57:33.566]  You've ruined America.
[02:57:33.566 --> 02:57:36.608]  Don't worry, you've got power, but you're not going to get fear out of me.
[02:57:37.654 --> 02:57:41.916]  And they got in their car and drove off, and I left, and they left my parents alone the next day and a half.
[02:57:41.916 --> 02:57:44.438]  I went in and rented a, you know, hotel or whatever you call it.
[02:57:44.438 --> 02:57:46.819]  They call them condos there, but they're hotel rooms.
[02:57:46.819 --> 02:57:48.380]  I just got out of there.
[02:57:48.380 --> 02:57:52.382]  And you went again, another part of America dead, another area gone.
[02:57:52.382 --> 02:57:55.944]  It's just so ridiculous.
[02:57:55.944 --> 02:57:57.605]  So ridiculous.
[02:57:58.661 --> 02:58:00.503]  And it has nothing to do with security, okay?
[02:58:00.503 --> 02:58:07.171]  The government is the security risk in history, and it's the big security risk now, and I'm sick of it.
[02:58:07.171 --> 02:58:09.013]  We've got some of the video and some of the photos.
[02:58:10.031 --> 02:58:18.299]  Coming up tonight, my wife got out her big, big camera, you know, 35mm that shoots video, and it died after she got part of the video of me confronting him.
[02:58:18.299 --> 02:58:26.868]  But you can't go to the beach now, because it's just, it's feds driving up and down in front of you and constantly questioning you, and, you know anything about sea turtle poaching?
[02:58:26.868 --> 02:58:27.449]  Huh?
[02:58:27.449 --> 02:58:28.630]  Huh?
[02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:32.254]  Again, it's all these enviro crimes, and it's just like, give me a break!
[02:58:33.723 --> 02:58:36.446]  And they knew who I was and didn't care.
[02:58:36.446 --> 02:58:38.809]  Because I was in their sandbox.
[02:58:38.809 --> 02:58:40.351]  Where they are, there is no America.
