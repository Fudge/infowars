[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.160]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:24.160 --> 00:29.560]  well I want to apologize for being out yesterday just all sorts of work
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.360]  piling up administratively around here to the point that trying to launch a
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.760]  bunch of projects that have been behind schedule for a long time then I took off
[00:37.760 --> 00:41.760]  the broadcast yesterday to work on things but we're here today and the news is
[00:41.760 --> 00:46.200]  stacked up from yesterday and obviously today it's breaking on every front we're
[00:46.200 --> 00:52.160]  going to be here for the next three hours as we are Monday through Friday from
[00:52.160 --> 00:58.480]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.640]  Time as well and again ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide
[01:04.640 --> 01:10.520]  today and I want to just open the phones up for first-time callers coming up in
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.200]  the next segment I'm going to get into the huge developments in Ukraine with
[01:14.200 --> 01:20.680]  Ukrainian troops massing more Russian troops coming into Crimea the Ukrainians
[01:20.680 --> 01:27.400]  calling for Western military support major military hardware from both sides
[01:27.400 --> 01:31.480]  moving in this is a big deal and you notice it comes right as the world's in
[01:31.480 --> 01:35.960]  an economic crisis sitting on the edge of a bubble implosion you expect big
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.760]  wars to start because the politicians are going to want to distract away from
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.120]  their criminal activities but the globalist that's just a standard operating
[01:46.120 --> 01:50.360]  procedure so we've got that we've got mysteries everybody loves a mystery and
[01:50.360 --> 01:57.640]  it's a tragic mystery without a trace you have this Malaysian airline
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.000]  disappearing and I've and I've seen the videos of the Iranians that were
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.400]  boarding the flight and I got to tell you looking at the eyes and the bearing
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.480]  of these two guys they look committed and I'm not saying they're guilty but my
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.680]  gut tells me these are trained trained trained people right here and they're
[02:16.680 --> 02:23.400]  very serious on a mission and they look like Iranian Republican Guard or
[02:23.400 --> 02:29.400]  something so that's all I'm that's all I can say is that they look like the
[02:29.400 --> 02:34.160]  exact type of infiltrators you would use who don't look like big tough guys but
[02:34.160 --> 02:40.240]  are actually infiltrators I mean just my gut looking at this photo and I'm
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.240]  showing people on TV folks can go to info wars.com or any other news site for
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.040]  that matter and see the photos drudgereport.com probably has the best
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.600]  most extensive coverage of it all and people have been asking me you know
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.520]  since the weekend what do I think is going on and my gut tells me it's a
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.760]  hijacking and they crash the plane into the ocean we've seen quite a few of
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.880]  those getting hijacked out of Egypt and other areas and when it's a real
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.760]  hijacking they will take over and they will get in the cockpit and they will
[03:07.760 --> 03:15.320]  fly the plane into the water and they'll generally do it with firearms or
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.160]  bombs they've smuggled on again if it was a false flag you would have naked
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.600]  body scanners rolling out next week like the Christmas Day bombing where the guy
[03:24.600 --> 03:30.160]  was known government minion his dad tied into the CIA they they did fake videos
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.840]  putting his face into you know hooded Muslims at terror training camps he was
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.080]  clearly drug getting the towel on the plane we have witnesses that saw it and
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.400]  broke it turned out the CIA again basically ordered the airline there in
[03:42.400 --> 03:46.000]  Amsterdam to get him on the plane and we broke that here and later came out in
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.120]  congressional testimony but they moved away from it very quickly that was a
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.160]  staged event because oh we're going to put naked body scanners in next week
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.240]  because of this when they'd ordered them a year and a half before and the
[03:58.240 --> 04:01.360]  outgoing head of Homeland Security Chertoff stood to make hundreds of
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.720]  millions himself off of it off the billions he headed up the company so
[04:05.720 --> 04:11.320]  that was a total PR rollout just like you know when a new flavor of coax coming
[04:11.320 --> 04:17.000]  out you see the ads a new coax coming out or you see them you Ukraine three
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.760]  months ago voted to not join the EU I said get ready for him to destabilize
[04:20.760 --> 04:24.280]  and overthrow the Ukrainian government I mean that's a no-brainer when you
[04:24.280 --> 04:27.840]  study geo politics and the tricks and how they work it's very clear but then
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.160]  when you see an airplane go down and oh we don't know what happened they're real
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.080]  hijackings folks and they happen every year or so and that's what a real
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.840]  hijacking does especially when Hezbollah type connected groups are involved
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.520]  that's Iranian connected grips they get on the airplane and they fly it into the
[04:44.520 --> 04:50.120]  water now it could have been the plane just went down it could have been it's
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.680]  a coincidence these guys are on board I don't know there's also a lot of
[04:53.680 --> 04:59.600]  suspicious tech people on board but my gut tells me it's a hijacking
[04:59.600 --> 05:05.200]  introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the
[05:05.200 --> 05:10.040]  go no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride
[05:10.040 --> 05:14.560]  you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of

[05:18.480 --> 05:23.320]  silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media a
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.520]  removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element it is
[05:27.520 --> 05:32.200]  the only one that does it and out of the gates we have a discounted at 10% off

[06:05.480 --> 06:09.400]  family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American
[06:09.400 --> 06:14.800]  people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down
[06:14.800 --> 06:19.560]  the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not
[06:19.560 --> 06:23.600]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.440]  it out of our bodies I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[08:18.280 --> 08:31.880]  radio network well we have a big broadcast lined up today I have told
[08:31.880 --> 08:35.800]  people over and over again it's just common sense historical fact it's no
[08:35.800 --> 08:45.360]  big secret that the NSA is about political control and MI6 is a spy grid
[08:45.360 --> 08:53.400]  that's tied in to the NSA and the whole global echelon system is designed to
[08:53.400 --> 09:00.320]  politically thank you so much this is gonna give me some coffee thank you I
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.400]  appreciate it sorry I left that out there thank you now getting back to what
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.120]  I was saying you guys reprint me my Larry McDonald I spilled coffee on this
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.480]  reprint me my Larry McDonald thank you now getting back to what I was saying
[09:14.480 --> 09:25.680]  here on this live Tuesday edition it is the 11th day of course of March 2014
[09:25.680 --> 09:34.880]  and Lord willing we're going to be here for the next three hours and we're
[09:34.880 --> 09:40.160]  going to get into a whole host of issues but obviously Diane Feinstein who has
[09:40.160 --> 09:46.280]  defended the NSA spying expanded the NSA spying is privy to the NSA spying data
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.280]  on the intelligence committees and others that she has access to and then
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.160]  now it's coming out that the CIA was spying on Congress the House and Senate
[09:56.160 --> 10:03.160]  to see what they were up to and they're acting like this is some revelation the
[10:03.160 --> 10:11.640]  basic information that I am covering here on air is well known and has been
[10:11.640 --> 10:17.560]  well known forever that political spying going back thousands of years in
[10:17.560 --> 10:24.040]  every culture is just that political it's not focused on terror threats it's
[10:24.040 --> 10:31.360]  not focused mainly on an outside enemy invading it's not focused on keeping the
[10:31.360 --> 10:36.960]  public safe it's focused on cornering markets controlling economies shutting
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.520]  down competition and setting up mafias and there's a lot of reasons for that
[10:42.520 --> 10:46.560]  obviously number one you know in ancient times if a foreign enemy is
[10:46.560 --> 10:49.960]  massing on your border because you'll have scouts and you'll have towns on
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.600]  your border of your empire your country that will see the enemy presence
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.880]  intensifying and then the emperors of Rome or Babylon or Egypt right through
[10:59.880 --> 11:05.000]  to the modern empires would then dispatch a larger force to investigate to see if
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.680]  a full army is needed to be rotated into that area to repel the threat but it's
[11:13.680 --> 11:17.680]  always an outside threat that is used whether it be Al Qaeda that's synthetic
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.120]  and manufactured predominantly or whether it be a domestic terror threat
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.400]  that's totally manufactured or whether it be you know the boogeyman of mass
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.920]  shootings that kill 167 people on average a year almost all of them getting
[11:32.920 --> 11:36.320]  related but categorized as mass shootings I mean you would think there's an
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.040]  epidemic of mass shootings and death and killing but it's actually shootings
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.720]  total are way down 51% just departments own numbers that they keep under a hat
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.600]  but are publicly available my point is is that you've got all these manufactured
[11:51.600 --> 11:58.040]  terror now you've got all these manufactured synthetic boogeymen that
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.040]  are hiding under the table historically and statistically and intellectually it's
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.600]  it's prima facie it's on its face there's no debating about it it's not my
[12:08.600 --> 12:14.120]  opinion and so we need to have that revelation they lied to us and said the
[12:14.120 --> 12:17.440]  NSA wasn't spying on us it wasn't grabbing data and listening to phone
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.120]  calls and tracking emails and faxes when on congressional record they had
[12:22.120 --> 12:27.600]  investigations in 1988 1996 that were white washes in Congress when they
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.960]  passed the telecommunications act it's all in there how everything is built to
[12:31.960 --> 12:36.840]  spy on you the main function of a telephone is to spy on you the main
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.160]  function of a computer is to spy on you the main function of a smartphone
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.320]  platform computer grid is to spy on you and model human behavior and track
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.520]  everything you do and control you and predict the future to then manipulate the
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.520]  future this is all on record by the way no this is my opinion people have to
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.640]  understand oh that guy's wild I am not wild I sit here in stacks of news every
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.760]  day for 19 years anyone that did this would be informed
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.720]  Catherine Harris Fox News channel thanks for taking my question will the Utah
[13:11.720 --> 13:21.720]  data center hold the data of American citizens no part one well I can't go
[13:21.720 --> 13:26.280]  into all the details of the Utah data center that's Alexander we don't hold
[13:26.280 --> 13:33.520]  data on US citizens the head of cybersecurity that's the Pentagon branch
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.640]  of the North com domestic spy grid that's just already operating completely
[13:40.640 --> 13:44.000]  illegally they're trying to pass the cybersecurity legislation it's it's
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.600]  operating in plain view since the early 1980s under cyber command at space
[13:50.600 --> 13:59.200]  command in Colorado space command runs everything with NASA corporately above
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.120]  it as an as an executive branch creation that's the shadow government so it's
[14:04.120 --> 14:09.760]  it's it's space command nexus with the public face NASA and their interstellar
[14:09.760 --> 14:12.880]  programs that are classified they're really freaking out folks when I talk
[14:12.880 --> 14:16.080]  about this stuff by the way most of it I've gotten from sources other I've
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.600]  reverse engineered their program and it's unbelievable they've already gone
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.920]  I'm I could even get into it I just cannot believe how screwed we are the
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.800]  general public has no idea what's even going on the globalists are trying to
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.000]  start a war with Russia I'm not saying Russia's good I'm not saying Putin's
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.720]  good the West is starting it and I've had some people run up beyond the street who
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.720]  are pro-Russia Ukrainians go we really appreciate what you're doing and I have
[14:42.720 --> 14:48.000]  other people coming up to me who are Ukrainian or from Poland in one case and
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.480]  are really mad at me and they're like why are you pro Russia I am not pro Russia
[14:54.480 --> 15:02.520]  I'm pro not having World War three but I'm already digressing my point here is
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.760]  tying all this together is that it's now coming out that of course the
[15:07.760 --> 15:13.400]  national security agency and defense intelligence and North com and space
[15:13.400 --> 15:20.520]  command of course they're spying on Diane Feinstein of course they're spying on
[15:20.520 --> 15:26.120]  Ron Paul they're spying on Matt Drudge they're spying on anyone of consequence
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.800]  they're spying on the local megachurch preacher they're they're not just spying
[15:31.800 --> 15:36.520]  they're feeding everything into giant artificially intelligent super
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.040]  computers that are then modeling what you're going to do and then integrating
[15:41.040 --> 15:48.240]  anyone else is going to do to literally know the future over the horizon true
[15:48.240 --> 15:54.280]  crystal ball Palantir control this is the end of free will the end of
[15:54.280 --> 16:00.640]  civilization as we know it the end of humans being truly sentient
[16:00.640 --> 16:07.720]  and involved in the real world and informed because you take away privacy
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.120]  and you take away free will where Amazon knows what you're going to order
[16:11.120 --> 16:16.000]  before you order it they can then put in the stimuli into the equation to
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.160]  control the future not just predict the future first you predict the future then
[16:21.160 --> 16:28.800]  you control the future and they're very close to controlling the future that's
[16:28.800 --> 16:32.600]  what this grid is they knew the internet would be used for liberty they knew it
[16:32.600 --> 16:39.160]  would be used in an attempt to restrain power then but but the globalist know
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.840]  that they're in a race technologically with everyone else in the system and so
[16:44.840 --> 16:52.440]  they all want to obtain the unattain him they all want to get that godlike
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.440]  power to a great extent to be able to predict the future they all want to be
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.240]  able to get those life extension technologies you imagine the globalist
[17:01.240 --> 17:05.120]  what they want all the old rich people what do you think they're into living
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.120]  longer because if you can live 20 years longer they believe technologies will be
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.960]  developed where you can live a hundred years longer if you can live a hundred
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.000]  years longer you can live a thousand years longer this is the Elysium golden
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.080]  fields of the demigods not my words there's this is the program this is the
[17:22.080 --> 17:28.200]  reality we're gonna skip this network break and this is the real world and I'm
[17:28.200 --> 17:33.240]  just someone who wants you to know what's going on because I believe it's a
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.720]  destructive path we're on because only the worst people the most controlling
[17:37.720 --> 17:43.560]  people only the most jealous envious covetedist selfish people are running
[17:43.560 --> 17:50.840]  things and if we had angels good angels better angels running this it would
[17:50.840 --> 17:55.640]  probably turn into a disaster and destroy free will this will unleash
[17:55.640 --> 18:05.080]  abomination desolation the the the psych warfare technologies the dehumanization
[18:05.080 --> 18:12.000]  smart grid smartphone TV systems are already mesmerizing people and sucking
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.680]  them into their television sets sucking them into their iPhones sucking them in
[18:16.680 --> 18:20.960]  imagine it and I want somebody to create an animation of this out there I know
[18:20.960 --> 18:23.760]  there's great animators listening many people to create this don't count on
[18:23.760 --> 18:32.400]  somebody else do it where it shows someone in an evolution from say 1947
[18:32.400 --> 18:37.040]  with the widespread rollout of televisions and the entire culture
[18:37.040 --> 18:47.920]  changing where you have people rolling the television into the house and the
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.280]  family goes from the dinner table and the kids go from playing outside to now
[18:53.280 --> 18:59.400]  living around the television and changing how you even eat food packaged
[18:59.400 --> 19:05.360]  space food TV dinners in front of the television being inserted into a false
[19:05.360 --> 19:12.040]  reality being bombarded five six seven hours a day with messages of the
[19:12.040 --> 19:18.200]  establishment that at first were quite wholesome but only to hook people this
[19:18.200 --> 19:21.320]  was all done scientifically ever grenades and others are on record not my
[19:21.320 --> 19:28.080]  opinion and so imagine the animation they're all sitting around the table
[19:28.080 --> 19:32.760]  they're outside playing kids are on their bikes they're building forts they're
[19:32.760 --> 19:38.240]  looking at the stars they're they're they're fishing in the creek they're
[19:38.240 --> 19:43.240]  you know kissing a girl for the first time when they're 12 they're getting in
[19:43.240 --> 19:50.520]  a fistfight they're living they're humans and now within years they within
[19:50.520 --> 19:54.280]  just a few years suddenly everyone has a television set it's a sign of status if
[19:54.280 --> 19:58.680]  you have two television sets by 1955 you're suddenly living around the
[19:58.680 --> 20:01.760]  television you're suddenly getting home you're now not in the real world you're
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.920]  entering the proto matrix this is a proto matrix suddenly they all gravitate
[20:06.920 --> 20:12.560]  around the television the flicker rate designed and picked in animal and human
[20:12.560 --> 20:18.280]  studies to put you into a suggestible hypnotized suspended disbelief false
[20:18.280 --> 20:24.080]  reality this is literally the key people are in a trance I can't stake that
[20:24.080 --> 20:27.840]  enough that's it that's why they're so dumb that's why you can't get through to
[20:27.840 --> 20:33.240]  them that's why they're so suggestible I don't even try to be manipulative now
[20:33.240 --> 20:37.120]  and I could just walk directly up to police and basically start programming
[20:37.120 --> 20:40.960]  them I can walk up to women and start programming start talking to them
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.240]  literally using basic systems that they use in television and the people
[20:46.240 --> 20:50.200]  literally go back into trances and I'm not even a hypnotist and have never
[20:50.200 --> 20:55.760]  even stated your identification you don't need to see his identification we
[20:55.760 --> 20:59.800]  don't need to see his identification these aren't the droids you're looking for
[20:59.800 --> 21:06.120]  these aren't the droids we're looking for he can go about his business you can
[21:06.120 --> 21:12.520]  go about your business move along now again I mentioned police because they're
[21:12.520 --> 21:15.800]  about the hardest on average because actually live in the real world and I'm
[21:15.800 --> 21:19.560]  not glorifying police here they actually live in the real world see what's
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.240]  going on they're not watching a lot of television they're having to interact
[21:24.240 --> 21:29.160]  with people they're having to deal with all sorts of crises constantly and so
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.640]  that's why I say police are more awake than anybody in the country on average
[21:32.640 --> 21:36.440]  except for the military and the military is awake because they've seen the
[21:36.440 --> 21:39.800]  corruption they've seen arms and legs blown off they've seen dead kids they've
[21:39.800 --> 21:44.760]  seen the bid rigging they've seen what goes on at the military basis they've
[21:44.760 --> 21:50.160]  seen people getting killed at the basis that talk about the drug dealing they've
[21:50.160 --> 21:56.240]  they've been hired by the CIA to carry out hits they live in the real world
[21:56.240 --> 22:02.480]  that's how naive the public is they're like children but even the police now
[22:02.480 --> 22:07.680]  are suggestible and I can just organically watching the tricks on
[22:07.680 --> 22:12.720]  television now go out and talk to the public and you can see who's conscious
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.240]  who's unconscious and the globalists study this they invented this they were
[22:17.240 --> 22:23.160]  and it's incredible so my response to it is to have zero manipulation just be a
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.920]  hundred percent upfront with folks on how this is working and what's going on
[22:26.920 --> 22:31.120]  because even if someone's in a subconscious state they subconsciously
[22:31.120 --> 22:35.680]  are hearing this now and will work through the data and start seeing how
[22:35.680 --> 22:39.680]  they're being manipulated how they're in a trance the only way to wake people up
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.240]  now I realize it's not to even show them data and facts and proof because they'll
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.080]  just call you a conspiracy theorist because that's the hypnotic trance
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.560]  word that means disregard don't look at this oh that person says don't trust the
[22:53.560 --> 22:56.840]  system that's known for lying this person says think outside the box think
[22:56.840 --> 23:03.320]  for yourself that's a heretic and I realize
[23:04.920 --> 23:10.880]  that everything is about getting people to take the red pill and just for
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.960]  themselves see what's around them you're never going to tell them about it
[23:15.960 --> 23:21.960]  you they've got to see it what did Morpheus say to neo one cannot be told
[23:21.960 --> 23:26.320]  about the matrix and by the way all I'm offering is the truth before you take
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.240]  that red pill you say you're taking it all I'm offering is the truth but I got
[23:30.240 --> 23:33.640]  to tell you folks it's like weightlifting I'm getting back into
[23:33.640 --> 23:38.000]  weightlifting getting back into shape it just feels so good and when I get like
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.480]  dumbbells 20 pound dumbbells on a bench press are heavier than 60 70 hundred
[23:44.480 --> 23:51.040]  pound dumbbells because I'm not used to lifting a light weight for muscle memory
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.520]  20 years ago I'm used to lifting a heavy weight and it's the same thing it's
[23:55.520 --> 23:58.840]  like an atmosphere it's like a plant that isn't in the wind that isn't in the
[23:58.840 --> 24:02.680]  rain will not thrive a plant that's in the wind and rain will grow and thrive
[24:02.680 --> 24:06.920]  from the pressure what do they say pain is weakness leaving the body well it's
[24:06.920 --> 24:11.720]  the same thing mentally you're meant to be in the real world your ancestors
[24:11.720 --> 24:19.760]  folks drove mastodons off cliffs so they could eat them our ancestors fought
[24:19.760 --> 24:25.200]  tigers and lions and big cats and cave bears twice the size of a grizzly bear
[24:25.200 --> 24:32.240]  humans with spears and rocks would go and and kill big bears bears ran from
[24:32.240 --> 24:39.280]  humans polar bears ran from humans everything red and and and humans could
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.200]  look up and see the stars and and and invent systems to track them and in
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.240]  literature and art and everything and look what we've been turned into because
[24:48.240 --> 24:54.080]  this is we're all being killed by the softness killed by the domestication
[24:54.080 --> 25:02.120]  we are being sucked in to the dehumanizing evil and and and the
[25:02.120 --> 25:08.320]  animation the animation that I want people to come up with shouldn't have
[25:08.320 --> 25:10.840]  to have a contest people pay people ten thousand dollars even though it's great
[25:10.840 --> 25:14.160]  you should do it for humanity do it for art that's how we'll defeat the
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.000]  tyrants is is giving the human art the human spirit expression to jam the
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.280]  culture wave of the mind control that would have to take our free will dumb
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.840]  us down and put us in a trance to control us that is the ultimate sin
[25:27.840 --> 25:35.640]  against free will God gives us free will the enemy the devil the deceiver the
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.400]  accuser get behind me Satan what does Satan do gets in front of you on our
[25:41.400 --> 25:47.400]  road to the stars Satan gets in front of human development Satan only gives us
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.360]  mutated technologies and mutated systems that control us and dumb us down in an
[25:52.360 --> 25:57.280]  attempt to play God and build an artificial system to predict the future
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.440]  the devil doesn't have omnipresence the devil is trying to use humans made in
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.880]  the image of God to build a God machine to be able to understand the future and
[26:09.880 --> 26:15.200]  decipher everything the devil only knows how to con people and manipulate people
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.800]  because he is a magician he is a deceiver he is a fraud he is a lie he is not one
[26:21.800 --> 26:28.320]  one trillionth what the Creator is to hell with the devil straight to the pet
[26:28.320 --> 26:35.640]  with Satan down with Satan in the name of Jesus Christ get behind me Satan down
[26:35.640 --> 26:45.160]  with the devil down with the fraud get out of the road get behind me you
[26:45.160 --> 26:50.160]  understand that get out of the road New World Order get out of my mind get out of
[26:50.160 --> 26:57.440]  my free will get out of my way humanity is going interstellar and and and this
[26:57.440 --> 27:02.280]  great challenge of the devil and the smartphones and the NSA and the culture
[27:02.280 --> 27:06.720]  destroying and the chemicals in the water and the war on the family it's all
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.280]  coming down it's all going down it's the test we're going through the fire in
[27:13.280 --> 27:20.040]  through and beyond in the animating contest of liberty the devil doesn't
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.760]  give you the animating contest the devil lies and tells you that he gave you
[27:25.760 --> 27:32.920]  what God gave you God gave you your gifts God gave you your power the devil
[27:32.920 --> 27:39.640]  lies and says sell your soul to me and I will give you gifts the devil will do
[27:39.640 --> 27:46.440]  nothing but pervert the gifts of the Creator we are made think about that in
[27:46.440 --> 27:53.280]  the image of the master builder the supreme architect of the universe and
[27:53.280 --> 28:01.280]  idiots will go that's a masonic no the Bible says the heavens are the handiwork
[28:01.280 --> 28:08.640]  the signature of course they are all of it this whole creation and we are made
[28:08.640 --> 28:18.800]  in the image and the likeness in our mind in our body in our form of the
[28:18.800 --> 28:25.720]  supreme entity that has built the entire interdimensional system that our
[28:25.720 --> 28:32.760]  minds cannot even begin to imagine and the devil has a good idea of that and
[28:32.760 --> 28:41.760]  the devil wants that because the devil is never a maker the devil is a taker and
[28:41.760 --> 28:48.480]  a twister and a counterfeiter from the beginning and a fraud with a false
[28:48.480 --> 28:54.600]  light of black sunshine and I've got a lot of news to cover but when it comes
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.840]  down to the final equation the NSA of course it's spying on us I think I got
[28:58.840 --> 29:02.320]  caught lying of course it's spying politically to control people of course
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.560]  they're spying on the Associated Press of course it's illegal of course it's all
[29:06.560 --> 29:13.120]  a fraud and it's all meant to shudder your consciousness it's all meant to keep
[29:13.120 --> 29:20.600]  you from being empowered it's all meant to rob you of the absolutely holy
[29:20.600 --> 29:30.340]  vision that we experience on a tiny scale of the Creator to commune with the
[29:30.340 --> 29:40.320]  Creator of the universe whose creation is a giant hundred dimensional gate into
[29:40.320 --> 29:46.000]  other worlds that the eye have not seen the ears not heard what is in store it's

[33:18.480 --> 33:27.600]  I'm not joking it's up on infowars.com it's up on prisonplanet.com I
[33:27.600 --> 33:31.120]  realize why I come in here and rant sometimes to start preaching I look at
[33:31.120 --> 33:35.400]  all this news and it just it's so insane and it's so scientifically being
[33:35.400 --> 33:39.800]  deployed on record that if people would just wake up and see it it would all be
[33:39.800 --> 33:45.360]  over but people have been eased in from birth into the lie into the fraud and
[33:45.360 --> 33:50.960]  it's basically all they know now major feminist group which is actually
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.400]  anti-feminine they've done to women done to men done to the human species have
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.640]  come out and said they want to ban the word bossy because it's associated with
[34:00.640 --> 34:06.920]  women in pecking well women are supposed to be bossy with the children
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.040]  they're not supposed to be bossy with their men and they're never happy when
[34:10.040 --> 34:13.840]  they are bossy but men are supposed to act like men as well so I don't blame
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.280]  women but feminist control freaks want to ban the word bossy campaign backed by
[34:18.280 --> 34:22.840]  banks oil companies and transnational corporations yeah the World Bank is
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.160]  sponsoring South by Southwest one of the main sponsors and they are
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.440]  sponsoring Bloomberg and they moved to ban our guns that piece of filth came
[34:30.440 --> 34:36.160]  here and that's why we're going to have a open carry armed March there's an
[34:36.160 --> 34:42.800]  article up on infowars.com in fact that I want to get Kit Daniels to repost
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.560]  Jakari Jackson did a video report on that we're going to be airing coming up
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.160]  here in a little while and so there's gonna be an armed March open carry at the
[34:52.160 --> 34:57.280]  giant media conference that that literally is a giant fraud with a bunch
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.280]  of near-duel well-meaning zombies wandering around buying a thousand
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.120]  twelve hundred dollar passes to line up and not even get into most of the events
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.640]  and then have corporations try to sell them things it literally is the
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.120]  Impersion who clothes it literally is a giant hoax run by anti-free speech
[35:18.120 --> 35:25.040]  anti-gun anti-family swabs who literally are enemies of everything good
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.000]  it's just these people that you want to vomit anyways excuse me and because
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.480]  yesterday I was thinking about doing a big report on it and it was it was we
[35:34.480 --> 35:36.640]  were in the meeting for like an hour looking at the South by Southwest
[35:36.640 --> 35:40.640]  website and it was everything was anti-human everything was anti-family
[35:40.640 --> 35:44.520]  everything was the feminized men everything was how to be face-scanned and
[35:44.520 --> 35:48.880]  have no privacy and how great it is while they have Snowden on talking
[35:48.880 --> 35:55.040]  about how the NSA spying on us great for Snowden folks I am not saying aye aye
[35:55.040 --> 36:03.240]  aye but it's a fact we had all the NSA whistleblowers on James Bamford so many
[36:03.240 --> 36:08.080]  others just so many it's hard to even bring them all up my mind this is all
[36:08.080 --> 36:13.960]  on record it's like Snowden said the Sun came up this morning Wayne Madsen
[36:13.960 --> 36:20.120]  the limit he was in security at the NSA over spying on people at the NSA to make
[36:20.120 --> 36:27.040]  sure they weren't spying on the government and I mean he's a he wasn't a
[36:27.040 --> 36:33.040]  contractor with the NSA folks he was there and testified to Congress in the
[36:33.040 --> 36:38.200]  EU and broke basically most of what we know about the NSA we all knew they were
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.000]  spying illegally we all knew they were targeting other politicians we do they
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.280]  were spying on the media I mean what look at Google look at Facebook look at
[36:47.280 --> 36:53.240]  Twitter look at Microsoft they the whole platforms are built around spying on
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.920]  you while you move the mouse over the cursor while you're spelling it tells
[36:57.920 --> 37:01.000]  you where you're going it tells you what you're thinking it tells you what
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.960]  you're doing Amazon five years ago had nearly a hundred percent accuracy rate
[37:06.960 --> 37:12.800]  now they have a hundred percent accuracy rate off of your profile and where
[37:12.800 --> 37:17.080]  your cursor goes and what you linger on in real time it's looking at you
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.840]  everything you do has your profile and it knows where you're going and what
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.320]  you're doing and it can then order it before you even order it and have it
[37:27.320 --> 37:31.160]  going into the shipping process to be delivered to you and I told you that
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.080]  five years ago and it finally was announced this year because it was
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.880]  already in MIT papers it was already public I told you the reason they went
[37:38.880 --> 37:42.800]  to the new type of light bulb is because they can send data over power line and
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.560]  flicker rate it to remote control the new computers that are coming out that was
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.200]  finally in mainstream music in last week they have mainstream dinosaur press
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.120]  every few months to a story saying Jones claims the light bulbs are controlling
[37:56.120 --> 38:00.880]  you well they do also in the patents say the flicker rate has the added goodie of
[38:00.880 --> 38:05.680]  being able to mesmerize people I mean look at the public look at the IQ
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.640]  dropping look at people in a dreamlike state the brainwaves are lower
[38:11.840 --> 38:16.280]  I mean this is all fact folks just like the spider goats I told people about 18
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.440]  years ago and I was reading it out of a technology publication that somebody
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.080]  mailed me before it was in CBS news NBC news a few years before and
[38:26.080 --> 38:31.080]  people said I was a liar and I was on air with the biotech technology magazine
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.200]  because I used to have listeners they still do it but back then it was precious
[38:34.200 --> 38:37.920]  because the web wasn't very big they would send me publications hey here's MIT
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.800]  publication hey here Stanford publication hey here it's a lot more serious
[38:41.800 --> 38:47.000]  hey I'm an engineer at UT come on down and I would be let in you know and they
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.240]  go oh you didn't see this and punch a button and to be hundreds of monkeys with
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.480]  wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them you know it's
[38:54.480 --> 38:58.000]  just it's just I just don't even know what to tell people anymore I mean we're
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.960]  living in a positronic psych warfare hell grid and they know that if we wake up
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.760]  to it there it is a new use for LEDs mind control you're back it up what's that
[39:08.760 --> 39:14.640]  from that wired a New York Times boom when was that
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.440]  2011 see print that actually print that but see see see that's what I mean I'm
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.440]  just trying to warn you folks the television is a giant LED weapon system
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.800]  it's so advanced they got a monkey farm in Bastrop folks that they do all sorts
[39:30.800 --> 39:41.480]  of testing on great apes Reese's monkeys the whole nine yards and I've seen it
[39:41.480 --> 39:51.320]  over closed-circuit television it was punched up in a DARPA facility the the
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.120]  the labs are funded by DARPA and and let me tell you they're training them fuck
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.440]  I don't want to start a cussing excuse me I just folks it's getting to me and
[40:00.440 --> 40:07.360]  I'm realizing that it half measures are not going to defeat this operation they
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.040]  have got thousands of monkeys at facilities all over the world they have
[40:12.040 --> 40:18.160]  hundreds at this facility with wires in their brains in a 40-year program it
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.760]  just keeps going with flicker rates to mind control them and attest them to
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.680]  then deploy the weapon system against you of course governments were going to do
[40:28.680 --> 40:38.320]  this of course they would use it of course they would do it anything they
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.160]  can do they're going to do it they're putting hundreds of deadly chemicals in
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.480]  your water they're putting hundreds of deadly chemicals in the food chain they're
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.240]  putting all sorts of different wavelengths out and DARPA is on record in the
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.640]  Baltimore Sun in 1999 I read this article on air probably 25 times I
[40:58.640 --> 41:02.240]  couldn't believe it a listener actually mailed me the Baltimore newspaper I
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.800]  wish somebody would go to the microfilm and dig it up and they said it's true
[41:06.800 --> 41:13.160]  DARPA is looking at fluxing the cell towers and doing tests to just relax the
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.640]  public during crises and I was holding in my hand because they do that as a test
[41:17.640 --> 41:23.320]  DARPA in the Baltimore Sun talking about mind control towers I mean this is a
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.520]  stuff that's schizophrenics I just showed you the New York Times admitting
[41:26.520 --> 41:34.160]  LED lights and but it's also not just the LED it's the the new curly Q ones what
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.880]  do you call those yeah full rest and I know but they've got a certain name the
[41:38.880 --> 41:44.240]  point is those are the ones where they have the data over the power line and
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.960]  then it can control devices in your house off its flicker rate but also
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.280]  control you and they admit it and then the public so weak minded they think I'm
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.520]  crazy because if they admit this is going on then you're gonna have to do
[41:59.520 --> 42:03.640]  something about it folks and I get it I could go insert myself into the matrix
[42:03.640 --> 42:07.960]  hell I already do I already sometimes you get weak and go to a friend's house
[42:07.960 --> 42:11.120]  and watch a football game and get bombarded with TV and manipulation and
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.200]  brainwashing and I want to be able to forget the brainwashing I want to be
[42:14.200 --> 42:18.160]  able to have fun be but I can't do it folks because it's constant and it's
[42:18.160 --> 42:22.000]  total and it's my consciousness I will not give up my consciousness and by the
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.360]  way I'm I'm alive I'm very happy it is invigorating to be in the real world
[42:27.360 --> 42:30.280]  and to have these pressures on you and to know how real it is that's what
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.320]  consciousness is that's what our ancestors have gone through and I said I'd
[42:35.320 --> 42:38.680]  take your phone calls we've got the Malaysia airline mystery that could be
[42:38.680 --> 42:42.360]  one of several things that I'm gonna be getting into but I got to settle down to
[42:42.360 --> 42:47.680]  that the third hour after dr. Stallman top technology expert leaves us and I
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.960]  said I'd take your calls on just the Ukraine situation is escalating so
[42:51.960 --> 42:56.200]  horribly because there's a world economic meltdown happening and they're
[42:56.200 --> 42:59.600]  gonna start a big war when that happens to divert off of the fact that they're
[42:59.600 --> 43:07.960]  behind it all over the I mean here's some drudge headlines city ad security
[43:07.960 --> 43:12.360]  checkpoints to all entryways touts non-stop fiber optic video surveillance
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.840]  that's what the Google thing is about police block highway lanes go car to car
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.320]  in search of bank robbers everything's martial law lock everything down
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.760]  randomly you know half of Boston for one guy beach town band smoking on
[43:24.760 --> 43:27.160]  boardwalk
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.080]  lady Gaga Foundation spends more on lawyers consultants than on charity of
[43:34.080 --> 43:37.480]  course all these rich people have charities to pay for their jets and
[43:37.480 --> 43:40.240]  everything like Bill Clinton
[43:40.240 --> 43:49.200]  you and it just goes on and on from that point
[43:53.040 --> 43:56.400]  I mean we're just sitting here deciphering all this news and it just
[43:56.400 --> 44:01.560]  goes on and on Branson says a global warming deniers get out of our way see
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.600]  Satan tells us to get out of their way they're the ones trying to corner our
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.320]  markets and control them and shut everybody off but themselves and they're
[44:09.320 --> 44:14.600]  failing and losing at every level virgin Atlantic Airlines emitted 7.1
[44:14.600 --> 44:21.920]  million metric tons of CO2 and they're only intensifying their fear mongering
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.320]  saying that genius calm was able to conquer all before him because of climate
[44:26.320 --> 44:30.280]  change and they're now saying you know that we're going to be flooded even
[44:30.280 --> 44:33.320]  faster even though the ice caps are getting bigger I mean it's just all
[44:33.320 --> 44:41.800]  giant criminal hoaxes the Dems declare war on weather
[44:42.400 --> 44:47.880]  meanwhile Google driverless cars maybe environmental disaster it's all just
[44:47.880 --> 44:52.000]  mafia telling you you're guilty and you've got to pay them some indulgence
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.760]  if you want to be able to operate and live look at the info wars.com
[44:56.760 --> 45:04.560]  articles Obama Surgeon General pick guns are public health issues see England's
[45:04.560 --> 45:08.520]  about two steps ahead of us on this about five years ahead of us here's the
[45:08.520 --> 45:12.880]  article from yesterday doctors forced to become state snitches to spot radical
[45:12.880 --> 45:18.040]  parents and the mayor of London has called for anyone who's a nationalist or
[45:18.040 --> 45:21.640]  conservative to have their children taken this is mainstream news and by the
[45:21.640 --> 45:28.800]  way they are taking them visitors that come especially from Eastern Europe who
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.280]  have the babies they can sell for 300 400,000 pounds are having their kids
[45:33.280 --> 45:36.840]  taken at the airports for no reason so there's now emergency advisories going
[45:36.840 --> 45:40.480]  out not to travel to England because they will that the CPS will grab your
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.080]  children at the airport or if you're seeing yelling at your kids your kids
[45:44.080 --> 45:47.800]  are gone they'll be in a Saudi dungeon being gang raped pretty quickly now
[45:47.800 --> 45:51.880]  continuing here doctors forced to become or they'll be with Seville get their
[45:51.880 --> 45:56.980]  throat slit with the Prime Minister's doctors forced to become state snitches
[45:56.980 --> 46:04.480]  to spot radical patients and it goes on to radical meaning anyone that
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.200]  disagrees with the government so they're just government spies and you're in a
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.440]  psych warfare meeting here's another one of this is in the US Obama Surgeon
[46:12.440 --> 46:19.240]  General pick guns are a public health issue Murphy's organization calls for
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.680]  doctors to interrogate patients about guns in the home including your children
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.360]  and then of course called CPS on you claiming that oh they're a doctor they're
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.880]  a high priest wearing a white lab coat you're the little lab rat and so and so
[46:31.880 --> 46:34.760]  this is the guy he wants for attorney general so this has been going on for a
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.280]  while but that's what they're doing by the way here's that New York Times
[46:40.280 --> 46:42.840]  article just I don't even know they've been in the New York Times I'd read it in
[46:42.840 --> 46:48.160]  AP a new use for LEDs mind control
[46:50.280 --> 46:55.240]  biological specific lights to make you restful sleep better and not be depressed
[46:55.240 --> 46:59.600]  yeah they're given the trip shots that curing of depression after seven eight
[46:59.600 --> 47:05.360]  tours the virus the live virus actually eats areas of the brain it's designed to
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.240]  go into certain chemical areas that have certain receptor sites and dad come
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.740]  home and he's not upset anymore he just does whatever mom tells him she says go
[47:14.740 --> 47:20.560]  get this groceries yes ma'am oh yeah I'm oh yeah these troops are now coming back
[47:20.560 --> 47:22.800]  and believe me they're not depressed anymore because they're not humans
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.000]  anymore oh by the way it came out about a month ago in wired magazine they're
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.920]  now admitting what I was already told years ago they're brain shipping troops
[47:30.920 --> 47:36.920]  who sign waiver forms to not be depressed anymore the guys type in chips to
[47:36.920 --> 47:42.560]  help with PTSD or or brain implants to help with PTSD you know my I have a
[47:42.560 --> 47:49.680]  cousin now just now got out of the military over 30 years and last few
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.120]  years he was in secret operations in Mexico and he says it's corrupt he
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.080]  won't tell me everything about it says that's why he's getting out but and of
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.280]  course the State Department North com run everything but the point is is that oh
[48:04.280 --> 48:10.600]  yeah there it is up we've got all the articles about about brain chips oh no
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.560]  that's the one about PTSD and brain chips that's blast to the head primed
[48:15.560 --> 48:22.280]  brains for PTSD study says no no the exact headline pull it up would be
[48:23.720 --> 48:30.520]  implants to help with PTSD in troops and then it's articles about brain
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.760]  implants that shows the guy in the chair getting a brain implant and how easy it
[48:34.760 --> 48:41.680]  is it's a small hole and then there's no more pain brain implants but this is
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.080]  about eight years ago he goes I gotta apologize to you we're having a little
[48:45.080 --> 48:49.920]  family and he goes they called us in the officers instead special forces are
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.000]  gonna be getting chips but you're not allowed to tell anybody and it's gonna
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.200]  start with the non-commissioned officers and then next time I ask
[48:58.200 --> 49:01.760]  anybody says I'm not allowed to talk about it we'll see I went on air and
[49:01.760 --> 49:05.920]  told everybody they're putting chips in people at that time now it's admitted
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.920]  that's for their safety of course in Mexican police are getting them and
[49:09.920 --> 49:14.160]  Attorney General got him I don't know 10 years ago in Mexico for kidnapping or
[49:14.160 --> 49:17.720]  whatever but I went on if you have the chip in Miami you get in the Baja Beach
[49:17.720 --> 49:22.720]  Club blah blah blah you know it's so trendy it's so cool and that's all South
[49:22.720 --> 49:26.320]  by Southwest is is the big exercise and how to be chipped and how wonderful it
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.160]  is and how fantastic it is and how super duper it is and my point is this is
[49:30.160 --> 49:36.760]  all just going on they're now giving troops quote anti-stress vaccine that
[49:36.760 --> 49:42.160]  is a virus must say this again that literally goes into the area associated
[49:42.160 --> 49:47.680]  with spiritual experiences euphoria endorphins creativity higher brain waves
[49:47.680 --> 49:51.760]  but also with depression anger because you're supposed to be depressed and
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.560]  angry you were used for seven eight years a phony war to chip narcotics out
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.600]  of Afghanistan or whatever when the government runs al-Qaeda openly there it
[50:00.600 --> 50:04.480]  is Pentagon wants to fit soldiers with a little box brain implant yes he will
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.640]  just be the depressed soldiers it's gonna be all the soldiers now you go see
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.960]  Robocop and it prepares you for that what's wrong with the brain implant
[50:13.960 --> 50:17.600]  boys and girls 30 years ago they were remote controlling cockroaches with a
[50:17.600 --> 50:23.320]  chip on their head it was a larger chip back then it was a wafer I guess about a
[50:23.320 --> 50:29.360]  quarter of an inch square I don't see a little antenna they had Robo Rats 30 years
[50:29.360 --> 50:31.760]  ago

[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:30.840]  the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen the day
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:37.560]  after 9 11 George W. Bush El Presidente went and stood on the pile of smoking
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:43.400]  deadly rubble and then later he went and gave a press conference at police
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:46.680]  headquarters we'll dig that video up and he said listen we're gonna be able to
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:50.680]  remote control planes now with the systems that are already on most bowings
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:53.680]  and we're gonna be able to stop hijackers and somebody behind him grabs
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.400]  him and jerks his arm and tells him classified in his ear and I played that
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.560]  clip at the time and I can't find it again the archives are now digital people
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:07.000]  need to find that he gave a press conference I think it was at police
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.520]  headquarters it was somewhere in New York a bunch of cops behind him and
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:13.720]  White House people and the reason I raised that as we start this hour
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:19.080]  about to go to a top technology expert and privacy expert and the internet
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:23.760]  liberation expert that's what I see the hackers as his liberators we're gonna be
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:27.840]  talking to dr. Stallman here in just a moment and quantify what he is breaking
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:31.360]  into computers illegally versus hacking that they try to demonize that word I
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:34.760]  think it's important we stress that you know he really stresses that and I
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:37.960]  agree with him I want him as the one of the top experts to explain the real
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:41.560]  nomenclature to us but the reason I raised this and I'm gonna have Paul
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:47.400]  Watson or Kit Daniels or one of our Don Salazar, Mikhail Saylan, whoever wants to
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.000]  ride it needs to do it that they remote-controlled aircraft in World War
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.880]  One by radio control John F. Kennedy's older brother Joe Kennedy Jr. who was
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  gonna be the guy they ran for president he blew up over Germany flying a
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:06.280]  fighter plane rigged piloting two remote-control base 17s loaded with
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:10.560]  explosives oh the the allies had cruise missiles as well not just the Germans
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:15.240]  and he got shot down reportedly by a bunch of German aircraft but the point
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:22.480]  is is that I told everybody on 9-11 you can remote-control aircraft and the
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:26.920]  only real phone calls that came out this ties into Malaysia that I'm gonna go to
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:29.600]  my guest and get his take just on generally the NSA everything that's
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:32.880]  happening but also on this because he's talked about hacking these smart
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:37.920]  devices in your house and in cars the smart cars the planes the the point is
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.520]  in the 80s they'd flown jumbo jets from California to Australia on record so I
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.680]  would tell people about this saying the only real air phone calls not the fake
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:50.600]  calls that were 30,000 feet the FBI later said there was no record of but
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:56.480]  the solicitor general's you know wife that all came out the real air phone
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:01.640]  calls said there's gas we can't breathe so the my hypothesis is somebody gassed
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:05.240]  them they remote-control the aircraft regardless that can happen we don't
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:08.720]  know what happened in Malaysia that have been a hijacking they could have flown
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:11.840]  it somewhere else change the transponders we don't know just like Larry
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:14.720]  McDonald I'm gonna cover this the next hour after our guest leaves us Larry
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:19.880]  McDonald Lawrence Patton McDonald who was uber presidential material a
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:24.920]  Democrat who was a John Berger in anti-New World Order and they were scared
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:28.880]  of him he was gonna end up being president he was he was just an
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:36.600]  absolute just just 500 times you know better than anything out there and they
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:40.080]  landed his aircraft reportedly in North Korea and marched him off and the word
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:45.840]  is he was alive until recently but that was flight 007 they redirected it a
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:50.520]  bunch of congressmen got off it was real suspicious they flew out of Alaska they
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.480]  definitely landed that aircraft commandeered it and it was a set up in
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:58.640]  some side deal with North Korea and the Russians very nasty folks the new order
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:02.520]  was so scared of Larry McDonald I mean he was the knight in shining armor he
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:08.200]  was the the deal super smart super articulate super good-looking super
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:12.480]  patriots super pure they killed him but I'm sure he was tortured a long time
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:16.120]  before that happened now now regardless this new flight and we're going to our
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:19.360]  guest everybody wants me to talk about this the Daily Journal the United States
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:25.080]  government special conditions Boeing model 777 200 300 remote control
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:29.700]  electronic system security protection from unauthorized internal access these
[1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:32.520]  things are meant to be remote controlled and they've been in there for
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:35.680]  decades and I just wanted to point that out do an article that this could be
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:39.600]  somebody hacking the aircraft pilots don't even know how to land now that's
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:42.240]  what they're having more accidents they said in the AP a few months ago because
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:45.560]  they're doing it all by remote control soon the pilots is going to be some
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:51.240]  vestigial guy who goes out and serves you or derv's because it's everything's
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:56.920]  being flown by remote control by by AI systems now enough of that intro I'm
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:00.000]  really honored for the balance of the hour and if he wants to we'll take some
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.400]  calls towards the end to have Dr. Richard Stallman on who tirelessly travels the
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:09.320]  world speaking out for free speech and internet freedom he's a software
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:14.480]  developer and software freedom activists he resigned for MIT to start the free
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:20.880]  Libre operating system GNU I guess Genu I'm not an internet guy I just know the
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:24.680]  guys are that try to keep it free millions use the system but most think of
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:29.120]  it as Linux Dr. Stallman also launched a free software movement in October 85 he
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:32.960]  started the free software foundation he called for the development 99 of a free
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:37.080]  online encyclopedia through the means of inventing the public or inviting the
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:40.520]  public to contribute articles so he's a total trailblazer Renaissance man
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:48.080]  Stallman pioneered the concept of copy left and is the main author of the GNU
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:53.800]  general public license the most widely used free software license since the
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:57.640]  mid 90s Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy for free
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:01.320]  software and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement as well as the
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.100]  campaign against both software patents and dangerous extensions of copyright
[1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:09.480]  laws of course Aaron Swartz did that and I believe they actually killed him
[1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:12.280]  didn't just drive into killing self he was saying he was gonna fight it just
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:18.920]  gotten engaged we'll talk about that as well stallman.org or GNU.org and
[1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:21.960]  folks I don't get excited whenever professional basketball player on who
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:25.720]  we've had on it's exciting or top cowboys and stuff you know who are on for
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:28.960]  political reasons I get a little excited but I get excited when we have a
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:33.200]  trailblazer even though I don't agree with his politics I would get excited to
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:38.400]  have Ray Kurzweil on he's a total genius and and so my rock stars are trail
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.520]  blazing people who also fight for freedom and that's Dr. Stallman. Dr. I
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.040]  don't mean to give a gushing intro here thank you for coming on during that what
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:51.720]  do you want to stab at first in the world I could ask a lot of questions but
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:56.120]  where should we go first Dr. Stallman? Can you hear me first of all? Yes sir I
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:02.400]  can't hear you go ahead. Good so it might be good to talk about what we know of
[1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:09.000]  government's massive surveillance of people in general because we found out a
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.680]  lot about this since the last time I was on the show if I remember right. Yes sir
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.960]  so let's talk about it the Snowden revelations all of it confirm what you've
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:24.440]  been saying. Well yes and we should express our appreciation of Edward Snowden
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  so three cheers for Edward Snowden hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah we
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:36.800]  have to say that very often I say that in my speeches and ask people to cheer him
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:43.200]  because there are the people who don't want us to know how they're mistreating
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:51.320]  us Paul Snowden a criminal and they say he should be assassinated we have to not
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:58.280]  just think that he's a hero but say he's a hero and invite others to say so to
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:06.800]  counteract the movement to demonize him in any case thanks to his heroism we now
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:14.800]  know of many ways that the government collects data about people in general and
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:21.960]  then misrepresents you know using to twisted bureaucratic language to make
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:27.880]  it seem that that's not what they're doing but that is what thanks to the
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.960]  careful analysis done by journalists we know that that's what the government is
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:41.240]  doing and we just found out that many countries in Europe have made deals
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:48.840]  saying we'll give you access to snoop on people through our systems as long as
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:54.800]  you promise not to use them to snoop on our citizens of course they can't tell
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.520]  that that promise is being kept but it doesn't even matter because if each
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:05.120]  country says you can use our digital systems to snoop on everybody except the
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:10.040]  people in our country then they can snoop on anybody through the systems of
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:19.880]  other countries so what is this imply it puts democracy in danger you see the
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:24.800]  idea of democracy is that the people control what the state does and that
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:29.880]  enables the people to have the state do the things that they wanted to do and
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:34.920]  not do the things they don't want it to do but in order to control what the state
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.360]  does we need to know what the state is doing and that's difficult when states
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:44.760]  act secretly and in order to find out what they're really doing we need heroes
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:48.240]  like Snowden whistleblowers and we've got to defend him because if they can
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:53.000]  bring him down they'll be able to sell the rollout of total surveillance
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:59.320]  publicly that was already there when exactly they also they want to bring
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:06.000]  him down so as to scare anyone else from trying to tell us what the state is
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.400]  doing to us he was exposing criminal activity he is a hero and the criminals
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:18.240]  are saying they want to murder a US citizen this is outrageous yeah under
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:24.680]  the first amendment you can say that you think certain kinds of people ought to be
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:32.080]  killed you can't ask someone to actually do it but you know freedom of speech is
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:36.600]  pretty broad and when it's government officials doing it I think it crosses
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:42.920]  the line it becomes very dangerous maybe so it won any case it is dangerous but
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:47.920]  for me the crucial point is we want to defend Stoden and get it clearly
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:52.640]  established that we regard him as a hero and that had clearly established that
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:55.800]  the government we need to celebrate snowden we need to celebrate him we need
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.680]  to celebrate measures saying yeah in any case the point is the government
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:06.320]  doesn't want other people to tell us what the government's doing and therefore
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:11.800]  it tries to demonize whistleblowers prosecute them but in order to do that
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:17.960]  it has to figure out who they are so this leads us to a conclusion how much
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:24.920]  general surveillance can permit the existence of democracy and the answer
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:31.520]  is if there's enough general surveillance to find the whistleblowers then we
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:35.760]  can't have democracy and we know the NSA on record is aimed at the media now
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:40.720]  and aimed at whistleblowers to suppress speech and people exposing crime I want
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.560]  to come back with you Dr. Stallman after this quick break to continue your
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:49.440]  analysis and then I want to get into not just the government all as you've
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:53.640]  pioneered exposing the corporations with all their spy tech and everything
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:59.480]  where is this going if we don't turn it around how do we stop it stay with us

[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:07.680]  seconds could get me in a lot of trouble I just created a free video
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:13.120]  presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.240]  government agencies for what they really are incompetent line crooks that are
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.200]  counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:25.960]  some have called this a conspiracy others have called it a cover-up and you
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:31.960]  will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes my video at 123coverup.com
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:36.320]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:40.720]  can beat them to watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:45.520]  patriots have already seen in the last three months go to 123coverup.com and
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:50.360]  discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home go watch
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:56.040]  my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down again
[1:23:56.040 --> 1:24:10.000]  that's 123coverup.com Alex Jones here back live Dr. Richard Stallman
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:17.880]  genu.org GNU.org for stallman.org a pioneer of internet freedom free speech
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:22.880]  inventor of really some of the only alternatives to the horrible operating
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:28.600]  systems and things that are designed to spy on us and he joins us now this is a
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:31.560]  six-minute segment long 18-minute segment coming up he says he will take
[1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:34.800]  phone calls so I'll give that number out coming up in the next segment you know
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:39.240]  tech questions internet freedom questions for Dr. Stallman so where are we in
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.360]  the battle lines I mean it's not just the government as you've said it's
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:47.600]  everything from television sets to quote smartphones to smart meters to cars
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:51.360]  having black boxes that track us to taxes they're just putting all these
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:54.960]  Trojan horses and everything openly and saying they're going to be able to
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:00.200]  predict the future and manipulate us in corner markets with all the stolen data
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:07.080]  but it's really a revolution of the thieves and of the snoops to take over
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:10.800]  the culture and then I guess you're one of the top generals out there fighting
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:15.720]  it what I mean obviously you've spoken about Aaron Swartz how they came after
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:21.480]  him this is a war is it not dr. Stalman well yes and no first I should fill in
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:27.000]  a gap in what I said in the previous segment why is it that this level of
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:32.200]  general surveillance is incompatible with democracy it's because the level of
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:35.720]  general surveillance of people's communications makes it possible to
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:42.200]  identify the whistleblower they can see which officials or staff people talked
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:46.680]  with a journalist and that means they can find out who blew the whistle and
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:51.600]  they can punish those people and that's what makes them scared to people scared
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:57.720]  to do it so we must read redesign digital systems so that they don't collect
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:03.360]  enough data to let the government find the whistleblowers and that's a massive
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.480]  technological change that we need to make now you've brought up the point that a
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:13.240]  lot of the surveillance is directly done by companies and they do it mostly for
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.320]  their commercial reasons they want to predict what sorts of things people will
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:25.720]  buy and so on transforming advertising from an a mere annoyance to something
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:31.960]  dangerous when they add the tracking of people to it but the point is the
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:37.240]  business surveillance of people is dangerous because the data they collect
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:43.240]  is available to the state so they're like is it that each business is like
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:48.400]  another tentacle of the state surveillance apparatus and they trade
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:55.360]  the baseball cards and they all share in the data mining yeah so the point is we
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:01.280]  have to redesign all of these systems so that they don't track what people are
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:06.560]  doing except for those people who are the subject of a court order because there
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:13.040]  was some reason to suspect a particular person and that authorizes investigation
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:18.000]  of someone well we always protected whistleblowers until just recently we've
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.600]  seen an incredible persecution of legitimate whistleblowers well actually
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:26.920]  we didn't always protect them for instance Daniel Ellsberg Nixon tried to
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:31.360]  prosecute him but the prosecutors made a mistake and they had to drop the case
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:34.800]  sure I mean the press used to come to the aid more of whistleblowers that's
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:42.800]  true and in addition Obama has attacked whistleblowers with an energy unlike any
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.160]  previous president or maybe even all I think I read it was all previous
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:54.080]  president that's what I meant there's an escalation yes and we also see many
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:01.600]  practices meant to invite people into being surveilled like Facebook like the
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:06.680]  car insurance companies that say they'll charge you less if you install the black
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:12.520]  box that box that records where your car goes and then there the the navigator
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:19.120]  devices that record everywhere your car goes if you buy a GPS navigator box to
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.520]  stick in your car on the dashboard well it records everywhere that you go and if
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:30.400]  you ever connected to the net to update the maps it says where you went how do
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:35.880]  you like that and that's because it's not free software see that's how the
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:42.160]  surveillance connects with free software because basically with the surveillance
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:45.880]  issue connects with the free software issue with software either the users
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:50.840]  control the program that's free software or the program controls the users
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:58.680]  which is non-free proprietary user subjugating software now when I
[1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:03.920]  started the free software movement it was because non-free software is an
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:08.800]  injustice in itself the fact that you can't have control over the program
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:14.680]  you're running but ethical standards in the software industry have fallen over
[1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:20.840]  the years and nowadays it's quite common for the developers of proprietary
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:26.160]  non-free software to put in surveillance functionalities and other malicious
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:29.720]  things like Dr. Stallman that is so important when we come back I'm gonna
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:33.480]  give you the floor to talk about that because not only is it now you're paying
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:38.880]  for the software that's spying on you but it doesn't work well I mean I run a
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:44.680]  media company and and most the equipment and stuff has spy grids and blockers on
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:49.480]  it where the stuff is useless because they don't it's amazing stay with us
[1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:58.960]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:22.160]  think we've struck the right balance and if people can't trust not only the
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:28.680]  executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:33.320]  to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution due process and rule of law
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:39.720]  then we're gonna have some problems the Alex Jones show because there is a war
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:56.280]  on for your mind Dr. Richard Stallman is our guest we're gonna go back to him
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:01.080]  in just a moment in this long segment and getting to break down what he's
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:04.400]  saying I mean it's so simple but it's also so important and nobody thinks
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:11.240]  about it the software controls you and almost all the time when it doesn't
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:15.560]  work it's because of the surveillance application and by the way we've bought
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:20.640]  all our software here other than the Linux genu so stuff that a lot of our
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.000]  stuff runs on I'm no tech guy but a lot of our guys you know big fans of what
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:31.600]  Dr. Stallman invented the genu system that's known as Linux but expanding on
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:40.680]  that it just I mean I buy a monitor in the studio and want to run video through
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:43.840]  it and we've got to break into it and jack with it you can't even buy them
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:47.280]  commercially that don't do this you have to get specialist in and pieces of
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:52.560]  equipment just to run the video you want over it because it doesn't see the code
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:57.920]  from the cable or from the the Blu-ray disc telling you that it's authorized
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:01.760]  where I bought a television about eight years ago that a DVD player built into
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:07.680]  it that DVD player broke so I had an old DVD portable one on the garage I plug
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:12.840]  it into that in the garage so I could run on the treadmill and it said no this
[1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:21.600]  device is an authorized copyright and I deal with this all day long and I've
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.280]  had software companies send us lawsuit threats pay money we know you stole the
[1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:29.280]  software and I call the lawyer up and go I we bought all our software he goes
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:32.320]  well our systems picked up that you might have some stolen software we're
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:37.040]  gonna drop this and the guy hangs up and I call back the law firm and I go no
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:42.080]  you're trolling to scare people to see if I'd send those that money and he goes
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.760]  I'm not gonna talk to you and it hangs up it's like getting images will send
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:50.840]  stuff out on Twitter you can embed and clearly I've talked to lawyers in the
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:54.920]  law they've embedded it they've made it embeddable you can have it in your
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:58.360]  article because it's not on your site it's their Twitter photos they put out
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:01.160]  and don't even tell you don't use them then they send you letters and give us
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:04.040]  a bunch of money and most people cook crap their pants and pay a bunch of
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:08.120]  money not restalment I'm ranting it's just that this stuff really frustrates
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:15.800]  me to your rent if I may yes sir um you're talking about DRM digital
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:20.360]  restrictions management which is found in some malicious hardware like those
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:26.640]  monitors and Blu-ray and DVD players and also in software and in fact often
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:31.920]  it's implemented by the firmware inside the product now that is a malicious
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:36.600]  functionality and it ought to be illegal but why is it in there it's in
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:41.960]  there because the software is non-free because the users don't control it if
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.800]  the users controlled it they would fix the software so it didn't maliciously
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:52.920]  restrict them so if they want if their goal is to attack you by it imposing
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:58.960]  restrictions they have to first attack you by making the software non-free now
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:05.160]  I don't think there's anything virtuous about paying for an authorized copy of a
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:10.800]  non-free program you see what's bad about the non-free program is that it's
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:17.640]  non-free an unauthorized copy of a non-free program is a nasty thing
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:22.360]  because it's proprietary because it's non-free it's almost as bad as an
[1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:28.640]  authorized copy but and so I won't use either one I reject them on principle
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:34.040]  no no I totally agree my point is we play in their system and then they still
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:39.440]  come after us yes they do but please don't repeat their propaganda terms like
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:46.040]  stolen there they say that because they want to demonize sharing but sharing is
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:50.920]  good what's wrong is trying to stop people from sharing which is what they're
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:55.440]  doing quantify your view on that and explain the difference between hacking
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:59.800]  which they've demonized as a term versus criminal breaking into computers oh
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:03.480]  well these are two different questions and I can explain them both but not at
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.880]  the same time so the point is software should respect your freedoms and there
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:13.080]  are four freedoms you should have freedom zero is the freedom to run the
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.960]  program as you wish for whatever purpose freedom one is the freedom to
[1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:22.320]  study the program source code and change it to make it function for you the way
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.120]  you wish now those two freedoms are enough to give each user separately
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:31.880]  control over the program but the separate control was not enough because
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:35.920]  most people are not programmers and don't know how to exercise freedom one
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:39.600]  they don't know how to study and understand source code or change it so
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:43.600]  we need more than just a separate control we also need the freedom to work
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:48.520]  together and exercise collective control which means any group of people or
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:54.400]  companies or both whatever any group of users should be free to work together to
[1:38:54.400 --> 1:39:00.480]  adapt the program to do what they want it to do and then offer copies of that
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:06.120]  to others if they wish and that requires two more freedoms freedom to is the
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.680]  freedom to redistribute exact copies of the program you know copy it and
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:14.840]  distribute the copies to others and freedom three is the freedom to copy
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:19.320]  your modified versions to distribute those to others those two freedoms allow
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:23.560]  the members of any group to work together and change the program to do
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:29.160]  what they want so if you don't know how to change software but you wish the
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:33.720]  program work differently in its free software there will be others who are
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:38.040]  programmers who also would like it to work differently and they'll change it
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:42.880]  and then they'll make their version available to the public and if they don't
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:46.440]  do this soon enough you can join with other non programmers to raise money
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:50.920]  and pay somebody to do it there is business in the free software world
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:56.480]  you know people are getting paid to develop free software and to maintain
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:01.440]  it and to tweak it and exactly and you so you can if people want to pay you you
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.560]  can take money to do it you could also do it because you just feel like it but
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:11.040]  those are you know free software doesn't mean it's gratis it doesn't mean
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:15.520]  nobody's paying anything or nobody's getting paid for anything it means we
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:20.760]  all have freedom anyway the other issue you brought up was that was that of
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:26.120]  hacking and what is hacking mean well it's one of those words that's had many
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:33.200]  different meanings but in the 1970s when I joined the hacker community in MIT
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:39.680]  sometimes it meant figuring out a clever way to do something on a computer and
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:46.880]  sometimes it meant prank and sometimes it meant doing something that was
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:53.360]  surprising and funny and sometimes the thing that was clever or surprising and
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:59.480]  funny might be in the area of breaking security on a computer of course at that
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:05.840]  time it wasn't further for robbing anything it was so that you could get
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:09.600]  access to the computer at night when it was sitting there going to waste because
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:15.080]  nobody was using it and you had some schoolwork or project you wanted to do
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:22.320]  so you got around the security and you put the computer to use of course
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:29.160]  there's nothing to say my deficit my definition which sort of summarizes all
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:35.520]  these things is playful cleverness hacking is playful cleverness and you're a
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:40.840]  hacker if you appreciate it enjoy playful cleverness perhaps your own
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.560]  perhaps other people's perhaps both all I've ever experienced from people that
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:52.440]  call themselves hackers is is helping us on so many fronts and then we've only
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:57.720]  had a few malicious things and again I wouldn't even call those people hackers
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:01.680]  they were connected to government groups trying to censor us so so what do you
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:06.600]  call someone who's malicious against good people online when I speak of
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:12.840]  breaking computer security I call it cracking now that can be done for good
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:17.960]  or for evil there are lots of people who break computer security in order to
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:25.440]  steal from people but there's this ransomware it's a kind of malware that
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.960]  gets into people's computers and encrypts everything and says we'll tell you how
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:36.760]  to decrypt it if you send us some money now that's very bad the people doing it
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:41.840]  I would say mostly are not thinking of playful cleverness they just want some
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:48.560]  money but so I don't know if they're hackers but they are crackers so they're
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.480]  those are various different aspects of things I wouldn't say that being a
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:58.400]  hacker intrinsically means what you're doing is ethical any more than an
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:01.920]  intrinsically means what you're doing is unethical what about this doctor
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:08.080]  I don't question but lots of kinds of hacking are perfectly fine and don't
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:15.040]  hurt anybody Lady Gaga's clothing is hacking now expanding on this Dr. Stallman
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.600]  I want to throw this out at you we now learn Stuxnet was put out by the US and
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:22.880]  Israel they didn't use Stuxnet to try to pass cybersecurity their false flag we
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:27.960]  now learn the FBI and government infects millions and millions of computers to
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.320]  quote look for one bad guy and so the old conspiracy theory that was really
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:36.200]  government corporations and virus companies putting out the viruses is now
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.880]  is now being proven yeah and that's that's a malicious conspiracy indeed
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:50.920]  but it's I don't know maybe a little of it is hacking a lot of it is cracking
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:44:00.080]  breaking security now my own hacking has not involved breaking security very
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:07.640]  much I that's not what I do but you occasionally I found clever ways to turn
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:13.600]  off security in the systems that I administered that didn't involve
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:20.600]  breaking any security my access was authorized interesting let me ask you
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:25.000]  this question back to the subject I don't think you had time to get to it the
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  phenomenon of what Aaron Swartz was doing and what happened to him what is
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.920]  your overall thought on that tragedy well from what I've read about what
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:41.920]  happened it looks like some people at MIT when they saw that there was a
[1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:48.520]  laptop that was downloading lots of papers from from J store I believe it
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:56.160]  was but they didn't know what was going on so they thoughtlessly called the
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:04.920]  authorities and the authorities were looking for somebody to kick to set an
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:10.680]  example of how horrible it was to violate terms of service and they had the
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:21.560]  law the CFA that they could stretch in that way and so the prosecutors
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:27.480]  picked on the Swartz and the people at MIT they didn't realize that that was
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.400]  going to happen they didn't even know that it was Aaron Swartz at the time
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:37.800]  when they brought the authorities into it and the lesson that people at MIT are
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:44.840]  learning is you better not bring the authorities into it until you know what's
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:50.600]  going on and you can decide whether it warrants that response that's right you
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:55.080]  call the FBI in or the government and you better have a really good reason
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:45:58.680]  because they will destroy people look he was getting married he said he was going
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:02.160]  to beat it in court I know they said they drove him to suicide but I think
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:05.720]  they realized they were making him a cause celeb and I think they killed him
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:10.800]  physically I doubt it and the reason is just that according to people close to
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:18.520]  him he had a tendency to depression and that so he thought about suicide before
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:25.360]  it's plausible that he would have killed himself even if the day before he wasn't
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:30.640]  feeling so down I don't know I didn't know his father said the FBI of the
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:34.840]  Justice Department killed my son but but but he said drove him to kill himself
[1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:38.960]  so regardless they killed him yeah I mean they were responsible for his death
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:44.880]  but that's not to say that they are directly killed him sure I wonder what
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:50.320]  it feels like for some for a you know top internet so much the FBI as far as I
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.600]  know it was the prosecutors sure sure the prosecutors to be technical you're
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:58.680]  right the FBI did the administered the K will ran the case but then the
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:47:04.000]  prosecutors administered it it's just a total tragedy that clearly this was an
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:07.760]  attempt at a chilling effect but I don't think it worked and you know I think the
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:13.400]  answer is what you've said get outside the system build new systems try to
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:19.600]  promote the free software movement that you started but also for whistleblowers
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:24.040]  it's the same thing stop complying more whistleblowers overwhelm the system
[1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:28.440]  don't comply with anything and that will bring it down oh but no we have to do
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:34.400]  more than that we have there are many systems that we use that don't belong to
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:40.280]  us for instance we're big we're talking by a telephone call the phone
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:46.560]  companies collect the information of who you talk with and they make that data
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:52.520]  available to the government we can't prevent that by developing our own
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:48:01.160]  parallel systems ISPs if you have an ISP account the ISP records all the
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:07.360]  connections that you make and makes that data available to the government so we
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:14.280]  it's almost impossible for us to avoid the government's knowing who we're
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:18.920]  talking to and that's the crucial data remember to find the whistleblower the
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:23.560]  government needs to know who talked with a journalist even if they don't have any
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:29.400]  records of the discussions just identifying who talked with a journalist
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:33.880]  is enough to find the whistleblower and then they can of course get that
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:41.680]  person's computers study everything and so on the point is that we need to
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:49.520]  insist that these systems which we don't own be redesigned so that they do not
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:55.240]  keep dossiers about oral and sundry that requires legislation we have to
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:03.120]  organize politically to demand that phone companies and ISPs not keep these
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:09.040]  long-term dossiers about us exactly as a culture the government can get about the
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:13.200]  past of a person who was not a suspect and that's why they always wanted to
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:16.120]  deny all this was going on because they didn't want to have the debate because
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:19.440]  they know morally they can't win the debate so all we have to do is like the
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.480]  organic food movement vote with our dollars vote with our actions and we
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:26.960]  can reverse the surveillance no it's not enough to vote with our actions
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:32.640]  because we don't have an alternative there's nothing comparable to organic
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:39.600]  food for talking by phone there's just no communications system available to us
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:46.720]  which we could use and meeting in person may not do it because of license plate
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:55.480]  trackers that have been set up by the well by the cops in lots of cities and
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:50:04.600]  also by repo men but and the point is we need legislation to restrict the
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:10.520]  license plate recognizers so that if your car is if your license plate is
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:16.200]  valid and there is no surveillance order out on you and put on your car in
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:20.120]  particular warrant that the license plate recorder shouldn't see your car it
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:24.880]  shouldn't notice your car it should only notice the license plates that are not
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:31.160]  valid or the people for exactly you're then admitted which by the way as you
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:33.440]  know over a million people in California that work for the government
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:36.760]  they are omitted because they work for the government their license plates
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:40.960]  aren't seen I didn't know that but that's interesting so basically that
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:44.840]  means the only people who were actually that's interesting because if they work
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:48.280]  for the government that means they won't be seen which means that they can blow
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:53.120]  the whistle maybe if they're not caught some other way so I suppose in some
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:58.040]  ways that's good but the point is we all couldn't be seen exactly stay there

[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:23.520]  info on that front a bunch of other political news there is just so much of
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:28.000]  it the big scandal obviously now is that the Senate is being spot on by the CIA
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.880]  with the NSA systems and that they broke into their computers this is just
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:37.240]  lawlessness and it's a Pandora's box no matter how powerful these technologies
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:40.920]  are humans are always going to end up using them for their own petty reasons
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.680]  and it will be abused there's a reason we know that East Germany was an
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:49.000]  authoritarian hellhole there's a reason we know North Korea is an authoritarian
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.440]  hellhole there's a reason we know Nazi Germany was an authoritarian hellhole and
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:57.080]  Soviet Russia was an authoritarian nightmare we know what the forms of
[1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:02.320]  abuse look like the forms of oppression and surveillance illegally without
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:08.800]  warrants is the essence of it it's the blood of it the ether the oxygen on every
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.880]  front we're going into authoritarianism now there's a lot of countervailing and
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:16.800]  encounter movements as Einstein said for every action there's an opposite
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:21.440]  legal reaction and Dr. Stallman is a manifestation of that since the 80s when
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:26.000]  you left MIT to pioneer so much of what is the only alternatives today and it's
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.800]  a testament to the power of the individual and we need more people who
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.640]  are brains to not serve DARPA in the New World Order and to serve humanity and
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.080]  it's much more fulfilling I'm here to tell you I'm an open-source guy off the
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:44.640]  plantation who just wants to be free that's what makes me happy I'm not
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:49.920]  perfect I'm not on a high horse but I my gut is in the right place my heart's in
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:53.840]  the right place in closing Dr. Stallman you know Janu that you invented it grew
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:58.640]  into Linux all these other systems well actually no it's pronounced canoe gun
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:04.280]  new item it didn't go to Linux Linux is one component that's used with the
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:08.480]  canoe system so the right name for it is canoe plus Linux sure I mean I'm an
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:13.840]  internet dummy we're using and if you call it canoe plus Linux you're helping
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:19.480]  us another way to help us is don't say open source say free software open
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:26.360]  source is the slogan used for co-opting our work and hushing up the ethical
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:31.840]  aspects of it in 1998 there were people in the free software community who
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:36.520]  really contributed but they disagreed with our ethical political approach to
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:40.840]  the question and they wanted it to be forgotten they wanted to talk about the
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:47.040]  same software but hush up the political side of it and so they invented the term
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:51.440]  open source well your politics are up to you you can say whichever you like but
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:56.280]  you can if you say free software you're helping us for more information about
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:01.920]  this look at canoe.org slash philosophy and if you want to help our cause look
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:08.240]  at canoe.org slash help well it's very exciting and what you've done with
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:11.320]  canoe that I mispronounced Janu I mispronounce everything it's just it's
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.800]  part of what I do I just know from all my tech people and the stuff I read in the
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:21.080]  tech publications that it's so important and one of the only things
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:28.480]  that is somewhat free of all this control in closing what concerns you most
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:34.240]  briefly and then what what makes you most optimistic well what concerns me is
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:41.160]  the tendency to make technology more and more malicious it's a mistake to
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:46.880]  equate malware with viruses because lots of products are designed to be
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:53.640]  malware for instance the the i-things from Apple and Windows phones and tablets
[1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:57.720]  they're they've taken the malware to the point where they are designed as
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:04.720]  platforms for censorship censorship of apps on an i-thing it can only install
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:11.240]  the apps that Apple approves of and has put in the app store the only way to avoid
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:16.480]  that to get an escape from that is with jailbreaking now that term which was
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:21.520]  coined by the users themselves is very interesting it's a recognition that those
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:28.320]  products are jails and now the Microsoft things are the same but so this
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:31.840]  ought to be illegal okay what doc this is a one minute break come back and do
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:36.600]  five more with us so you can finish up the jailbreaking and then talk about the
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:40.680]  the positive stuff that's happening just briefly
[1:58:42.640 --> 1:58:52.120]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network in the last 50 years
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:56.720]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:59:02.360]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in
[1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:07.480]  the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:11.800]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:17.120]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.360]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:28.200]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a
[1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:33.040]  glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you

[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:23.720]  texas alex jones
[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:33.600]  alright final segment with dr. Stahlman and a huge news blitz tons of special
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:39.200]  reports coming up but I want to know about solutions and I'm a media guy I
[2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:42.320]  know how media works on a politics work all the nuts and bolts of internet you
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  know I'm you know not not too shabby on I just know the basics that everything is
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:52.200]  a surveillance grid and I read what the top experts over the years have put out
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:55.640]  on that and exposed with the telecommunications act you name it it was
[2:00:55.640 --> 2:00:59.680]  all right there what was really going on so I know the conclusions of what's
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:05.320]  going on more than most nuts and bolts not so much but dr. Stahlman you were
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:09.320]  getting into jailbreaking that organically came out of the community that term and
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:14.400]  that is what's happening I mean we we're trying to jailbreak out of these
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:20.680]  systems that are being designed to social engineer by what I call the eugenicist
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.600]  movement that's really what all of this comes out of this control
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:27.880]  fragmentality but in closing you were getting into positive and negative
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:33.120]  things that are happening go ahead yes for your freedom in your own computer
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:39.440]  you've got to reject non-free software there shouldn't be any installed in your
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:44.800]  computer and the products that depend on non-free software their threats to your
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:50.960]  freedom and you shouldn't use them and I don't have a portable phone because it's
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:54.680]  first of all they're full of non-free software and second they're tracking
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:02:00.000]  devices and I don't want to be tracked I pay cash that's another I don't pay
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:05.640]  through credit cards or debit cards because if I did I'd be tracked but I
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:11.560]  resist surveillance directly with my own decisions but at the same time I realize
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:18.760]  we're not going to win that way we need to organize we need to pass laws to
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:24.520]  reduce the level of surveillance we have to release to reduce the malware that we
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:29.960]  have and to make it easier for free software to be used in the computers
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:34.400]  that we get that are made the computers that are made should be usable with free
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:43.520]  software and that requires organizing and if you want to join the free software
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:50.440]  foundation go to fsf.org you can join through there that's one way you can
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:57.840]  support our cause are you optimistic in your gut that humanity's gonna be able
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:03.160]  to turn this around I'm a pessimist by nature and therefore I don't even ask
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:09.320]  the question there's no point in not fighting surrendering we immediately to
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:16.080]  defeat it's futile the only thing to do is do our best so I don't care whether
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:23.160]  there's a whether it looks hope for hopeless I'm gonna fight anyway because
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:26.840]  that's the human thing to do I can't see the future I don't know whether we're
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:32.000]  going to win because it depends on you well that's right in my gut I know we're
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.680]  gonna win but it's gonna be rough it's gonna be hard but we'll be stronger on
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:37.600]  the other end of this incredible journey we're all on but it is the
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:42.280]  animating contest of liberty fighting tyranny and being involved is what makes
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:48.080]  you human and alive people think avoiding conflict with with with oppressors
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:53.320]  is the way to win it's not what's empowering just like exercise is to
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:56.640]  engage in the animating contest dr. Stallman thank you so much for all the
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:01.480]  time thank you and happy hacking happy hacking dr. Richard Stallman very nice
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:07.040]  come on our show stallman.org really an amazing guy a trailblazer on every
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:13.760]  front there is no doubt about that and you know some of the trendies out there
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:17.480]  and people you know make jokes he's got long hair you know as a you know as a
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:21.800]  absent minded professor but it's very interesting you know that guy basically
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:26.000]  came up with a Wikipedia idea a free software movement Genu I would say
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:31.240]  Genu Genu that came into Linux all of it I mean it's just that's just some of it
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:36.160]  and that guy's like Ray Kurzweil he came with a lot of stuff and the names we
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:40.000]  use and so many of the organizations and movements that if we didn't have them
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.680]  there'd be no somewhat free internet now they would have already have internet
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:46.960]  taxes internet IDs they're trying to do it but people like stallman they're
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:50.520]  holding it back we wouldn't exist we wouldn't have this platform to fight
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:54.880]  these guys one of people like him so we owe dr. Stallman a debt of gratitude I
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:59.800]  mean I just admire freedom fighters I admire trailblazers
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:04.680]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:08.760]  on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:14.760]  highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:19.920]  down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and
[2:05:19.920 --> 2:05:25.000]  processed with poisons and additives our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:30.120]  big pharma runoff all of this has been engineered by design we can turn the
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:34.160]  tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[2:06:14.040 --> 2:06:18.160]  water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:22.280]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the

[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:07.640]  I'm gonna open the phones up in this hour for first-time callers home of
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:11.200]  Malaysia flight I you know I love a mystery as much as anybody this is a
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:14.440]  bunch of missing people the Washington Post now reports the cell phones are
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:20.280]  active and are contacting and reading their email and going back and forth and
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:23.480]  Mike Adams has a great article from naturalnews.com it's up on info
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:29.320]  wars.com this is the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 begins to
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:35.520]  demand supernatural explanations by the way CJ to his great credit no one's been
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:41.320]  able to ever find this I had it on tape taped on VHS back on September 12th or
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:47.640]  whatever it was on 9 11 day after and I saw Bush say we can remote control the
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.080]  jets and fix it and they grabbed his arm and said classified you can see him
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:58.240]  lip-sync it you can really hear it over the mic they're like classified and I
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:01.680]  was getting made fun of nobody can remote control planes or no such thing as
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:08.680]  drones I mean they only had him in World War one I mean come on you know 1918 so
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:17.120]  they had submarines in 1777 that Benjamin Franklin worked on to blow up
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:21.400]  British ships people don't know anything civil war at submarines all the
[2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:27.760]  place blasting up ships real subs people just don't know I mean it's buck Rogers
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:31.880]  folks the government's 40 years advanced stealing all our data stealing our
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:35.280]  ideas and thinking they're God when they're a bunch of thieves bunch of
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:41.480]  control freaks come so I want to break this down and go over it but Jordan was
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:47.440]  able to find it a PBS Bush announces new airline security measures to remote
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:52.280]  control aircraft by remote control from the air traffic control so they found
[2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:58.200]  he found an article where Bush were they quote Bush about we can remote control
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:03.680]  planes from the air traffic control tower I told him shut up because his best
[2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:09.960]  I know I talked to folks that were at a Republican fundraiser right after it
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:14.440]  happened and some high-level people and they said Marvin Bush was off record we
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:17.840]  also got some of this on tape and another speech he gave about Bush running
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:20.280]  around the bunker in his underwear is there making for their brother because
[2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:24.920]  that's what brothers do and Bush was actually scared running back into the
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:30.280]  bunker at night and wouldn't come out of the bunker so that's not like a guy
[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:35.200]  who actually did 9-11 no obviously the teleprompter reader who couldn't even
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:39.440]  read a teleprompter I'm not saying get it himself criminal elements folks
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:44.960]  clearly there were drills the hijackers thought they were part of drills we know
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:48.480]  the drills were happening live drills they've been doing weeks before James
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:51.320]  Woods is a witness to that but we know about the drills we know they were
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:55.480]  trained at US bases we know that the head of the Defense Language School went
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:12:03.960]  public and said that all I know is Muhammad at and three other guys were in
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:09.680]  my class something's going on there's a cover up here that guy they say is the
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:13.560]  lead hijacker at a high-level US government security clearance and then
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:17.560]  it came out from the embassy heads and we had them on springman where they were
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:21.040]  ordered hey these are terrorists with al-qaeda they're just an al-qaeda summit
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:24.640]  in Malaysia of all places coming back to Saudi Arabia we're not gonna let them
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:29.720]  fly and they said national security I don't care I'm not issuing it CIA calls
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:33.880]  this is an order from the State Department they work for us that's their
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.440]  terror designation is a cover you see you just keep adding and adding and adding
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:41.960]  and I don't know exactly what happened but I know they didn't want Bush talking
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:47.920]  about remote control and I know that the phone calls the FBI had to admit were
[2:12:47.920 --> 2:12:55.760]  not made or repeat this the solicitor general said that his wife called him
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:13:00.120]  and confirmed the hijacking everything from her personal cell phone at 33,000
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:05.760]  feet folks I do it every time I fly more than 50 60 times since 9-11 or more the
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:12.280]  phone always cuts out at 3,000 to 5,000 feet whether I fly out of England whether
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:18.840]  I fly out of New Jersey whether I fly to Austin Texas Los Angeles or Canada or
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:25.740]  Central America phones don't work above 3,000 to 5,000 feet a few times I've
[2:13:25.740 --> 2:13:29.200]  been in mountainous areas whether it's mountain towers and you take off from a
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:33.160]  valley and then you go up to 10,000 feet and the cell towers are there and you
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:37.560]  can still work if you're up at 10,000 feet in the mountains and they got towers
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:43.240]  it'll still work sometimes barely the phones do not work at 33,000 feet last
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:47.840]  year when the FAA started saying maybe we're gonna allow cell phones on planes
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:51.280]  everybody went oh my gosh you're discredited see they're gonna work at
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:57.320]  33,000 feet where they get above the weather the cruising altitude and if you
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:01.080]  read deeper it's just like when you're on a cruise ship and you can use your
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:06.840]  cell phone it jacks through its system to a satellite you're not cell phoning
[2:14:06.840 --> 2:14:11.560]  from the Gulf of Mexico you know a thousand miles away from Galveston if
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:15.640]  you take a cruise ship I've gone on family cruises you know and end up doing
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:20.480]  my radio show from a cell phone or do 30 minutes on the show there's breaking
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:26.720]  news you know a dollar a minute on the ship phone in the ship not even my
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.120]  cell phone but you could also walk around on deck on your cell phone and it
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:33.960]  jacks through to the satellite it's patching you through folks the cell
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:39.080]  phone is not working from a thousand miles away from me from the tower the
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:43.680]  public is so ignorant like they even saw headlines FAA's gonna authorize cell
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:49.760]  phones that shows up the 9-11 truthers I mean the level of these hit pieces
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:57.600]  they're so thin I won't explain this the FBI to their credit you can look this
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.400]  up it was in mainstream news but Barry said there were no phone calls to the
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:05.960]  solicitor general because it turned into a media investigation the media did for
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:09.880]  your request the FBI I was surprised released it and said no we checked his
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:15.760]  phone records we checked that too we didn't believe it and she didn't call
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:21.240]  him nobody called on their cell phones with all these government people who
[2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:29.040]  all had witnesses oh I'm so sad about my wife by the way they landed flight 93 at
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:32.160]  a military base hangar that even came out the news people all sought people
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:36.200]  getting off same-tail numbers they went oh just never mind that then something
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:41.040]  blows up over Pennsylvania I mean this all came out folks I don't know what's
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:48.280]  going on I know in Operation Northwoods 1961 LL Limnitzer's plan to bomb DC
[2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:52.600]  bomb US military bases shoot people in movie theaters commit bombings at public
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:57.360]  events with plastic explosives at Boston bombings coming up the anniversary
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:00.560]  here in April I think I'm gonna send reporters up there like I don't think I'm
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:04.680]  doing it I'm sending someone we'll send the Dondee to did a great job as the
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:12.080]  and then we'll send a corrector to help him but long story short just there's
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:17.600]  hundreds of pieces none of them fit the official story is fabricated from pillar
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:23.280]  to post up one side and down the other it's all a fraud no one made the cell
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:26.440]  phone calls they claim there were over 15 of them the only ones that were real
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:32.640]  were not one but two air phone calls by stewardesses with their credit cards
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:37.960]  panicking saying someone's taken over the plane they've got a bomb and their
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:44.280]  smoke gas gas can't breathe that's the transcripts that's what people said they
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:52.360]  heard and those phone calls were made to family and to the airports the two or
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:56.040]  is it three calls I'm sure it was to know the names one was an Asian lady the
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:00.840]  point is the point is the point is is that they nerve gas them it's clear you
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:04.320]  got guys I think they're part of a drill to cover the fact that you have hijackers
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:08.040]  they released a gas remote control the aircraft in the building and look he
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:14.120]  found it bush announces new airline security measures 927 so I guess this
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:19.040]  somehow got put weeks later into a transcript about it but I saw bush give
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:23.160]  this press conference and then grab him and tell him shut up it's a sensational
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:28.760]  video somebody's got to find it I had it it's lost in the myriad labyrinth the
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:31.240]  president said the new security measures would also dramatically increase the
[2:17:31.240 --> 2:17:35.120]  number of plainclothes federal marshals on airplanes give 500 million to
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:39.920]  develop enhanced cockpit security and enabled traffic controllers to take over
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:45.680]  a distressed aircraft and land it by remote control bingo remember though
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:52.680]  this doesn't exist remember ladies and oh you found the video you're you're
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:57.760]  kidding you found bush oh my god this is gonna be incredible I haven't seen this
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:04.920]  and and to provide greater security for travelers by bus and by train this bill
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.680]  sets a one-year deadline for the transition to the new system it gives
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:15.320]  my administration the flexibility we need to make that transition work
[2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:20.400]  ultimately this bill offers local authorities the option to bring in
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:25.320]  outside experts a method that's worked well in Israel and Western Europe this
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:29.480]  is a later those are repeated our rigorous new safety this is not in
[2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:32.920]  New York environments so he's got the transportation security comes first
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:38.680]  but not a the federal government will set high standards and we will enforce
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:45.160]  them these have been difficult days for Americans who fly and for American
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:49.640]  aviation all right we're gonna we're gonna find that queued up during the
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:52.960]  break I got excited about it they just threw it up there they're they got the
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:56.280]  transcript from C-SPAN that they're trying to find the part in the video the
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:00.160]  point is as I said all this at the time and the media made fun of me it's like
[2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:05.400]  he says there's automobiles have been invented in 2001 I'm like yeah
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:10.600]  automobiles are real they're like showed up smart guy so so my point is
[2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:14.800]  about this disappearance of the Malaysian airline it could have been remote
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.440]  controlled it could have been landed somewhere because in operation
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:23.160]  Northwood's getting back to that they say we'll put CIA people and their families
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:26.880]  on who don't mind having our identities changed and we'll have one aircraft
[2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:30.160]  take off that lands somewhere else in a military base another will take off its
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:35.640]  remote controlled and we'll blow it up and we'll blame it on the Cubans and
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.000]  basically start World War three so that was part of the plan so you don't it was
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:43.200]  a bunch of tech people bunch of government people on we don't know what
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:48.000]  happened these two Iranian guys look like deep-cover paramilitary types who
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:52.280]  aren't meant to look like badasses but are so I'll say that the photo doesn't
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:57.480]  look good probably a hijacking and if it's a big ocean out there folks all right

[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:25.200]  aircraft and land them and he said yeah there's a classified program the US and
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:29.880]  the Israelis have folks all the bowings going back 20 years ago and most the
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:33.800]  other big aircraft have remote control wireless computer hubs in the software
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:38.280]  and I've all the pilots know this it's in the specs just like it's in the specs

[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:46.200]  create a database for 20 years it's been going on for at least 20 years since
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:50.280]  digital cable boxes people still think that's a conspiracy it's a very child
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:54.920]  like even till about five years ago people would come to my house and see a
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:58.400]  band-aid over the camera on a computer and go why do you cover that up you
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:01.920]  think they're watching you and even when it was in the news they're watching
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:08.240]  people people still think it's weird to be informed and it's so frustrating so
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:13.040]  here's the Air Force General talking to Congress on C-SPAN about remote
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.360]  controlling of aircraft because see if they can remote control them they can
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:20.360]  nerve gas everybody and remote control them into the buildings and all it takes
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:23.400]  is a very small group of people that have the codes to do it and then the rest
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:26.560]  of the military thinks hey Mohammed Atta and all these guys got on the planes
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:31.640]  they're taking part in the drill which we know was going on see how that works
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:37.100]  let's go to the clip you know the Israeli Air Force has exercised
[2:25:37.100 --> 2:25:41.120]  practiced and developed techniques for dealing with hijacked aircraft
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:47.040]  not 11 Commission John Lehman for instance they carry special missiles
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:52.880]  that are not to destroy design not to destroy airliners but to force them to
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:59.080]  land missiles with inert warheads and other sophisticated gear what have you
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:07.360]  guys done to equip our air guard and other NORAD is potentially assigned units
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:15.520]  with the training with the rules of engagement and the hardware that gives
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:20.000]  them an option
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:26.240]  guys let's go to the program what why the audio fell out fade out right there
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:30.740]  I'm totally confused when I talk about it offline or provide you the back it up
[2:26:30.740 --> 2:26:34.420]  back it up we're gonna get this right talk about it offline it pause back it
[2:26:34.420 --> 2:26:38.980]  up to the beginning of Myers okay I'm not mad I just heard the audio fading
[2:26:38.980 --> 2:26:45.420]  down I understand let's go ahead and try it again go ahead and put the missiles
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:50.420]  with inert warheads and other sophisticated gear what have you guys
[2:26:50.420 --> 2:26:58.940]  done to equip our air guard and other NORAD is potentially assigned units with
[2:26:58.940 --> 2:27:06.980]  the training with the rules of engagement and the hardware that gives them an
[2:27:06.980 --> 2:27:11.740]  option other than what we have now which is just to destroy the aircraft and all
[2:27:11.740 --> 2:27:17.460]  its passengers I'm aware of at least one program which is classified so we can
[2:27:17.460 --> 2:27:23.340]  either talk about it offline or provide you the the classified paper on it there
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:29.460]  may be others to do exactly that okay and people say oh no they're talking
[2:27:29.460 --> 2:27:34.140]  about missiles there no they're not here's bush in PBS bush announces new

[2:33:23.020 --> 2:33:26.460]  behind the scenes I end up grabbing at them on there as well you know they
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:30.820]  weren't messing up earlier I shouldn't go to clips I haven't seen yet because I
[2:33:30.820 --> 2:33:34.600]  had the transcript of Bush here talking about the remote control aircraft and I
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:38.500]  knew I'd seen that and so it was it was an interesting to find it on PBS they
[2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:41.020]  went and tried to find the press conferences but some of them are 30 40
[2:33:41.020 --> 2:33:45.540]  minutes long they're trying to find the spot I'm saying go to it and then I'm
[2:33:45.540 --> 2:33:52.100]  like off air saying while the clips playing I'm saying no more you guys
[2:33:52.100 --> 2:33:55.980]  don't play clips if even if I call for them if I haven't seen it yet we don't
[2:33:55.980 --> 2:33:59.460]  need to have a rush and then play the wrong clip so they thought no more and
[2:33:59.460 --> 2:34:04.420]  then faded the clip down and then I go put the clip back on so it's fun but
[2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:08.180]  listen this is real TV folks it's like we had Tucker Carlson here who's been on
[2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:14.660]  CNN Fox MSNBC and the same thing when we had Ben Swan who's you know been at a
[2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:20.740]  lot of stations he said nowhere on TV are they Johnny on the spot go right to a
[2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:24.860]  news article go right to a video clip it's all scripted so it looks very
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:29.140]  smooth because most of it's a teleprompter loaded in New York City that
[2:34:29.140 --> 2:34:33.980]  they read locally hey Alex yes this is John bound right here this is not by the
[2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:38.740]  way this is not teleprompter I just want to quote ghostbusters here to clear the
[2:34:38.740 --> 2:34:44.980]  air yeah listen smell that I do listen smell that I do smell that's the
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:50.060]  confusion of absolutely no no but I mean it's good that's why people like it is
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:55.220]  because it really is real including us strangling each other in the control
[2:34:55.220 --> 2:35:00.220]  room is joking no it's crazy to to be around this information all day and to
[2:35:00.220 --> 2:35:04.260]  really be focused on it okay I'm gonna go to your phone call Steve Mike Randy
[2:35:04.260 --> 2:35:09.340]  Chad Tony and others but first Leanne McAdoo went down to talk to the South by
[2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:14.260]  Southwest Zombies and I want to be clear I'm not saying I believe that in a
[2:35:14.260 --> 2:35:17.940]  moment I keep forgetting I've done two hours 35 minutes a day by the seat of my
[2:35:17.940 --> 2:35:21.740]  pants for whatever reason I'm unable to focus on all the news sometimes people
[2:35:21.740 --> 2:35:24.620]  say that's my best radio shows I don't know I like the shows where I knew
[2:35:24.620 --> 2:35:31.500]  radically cover news for three hours but I'm in kind of preacher mode today and
[2:35:31.500 --> 2:35:36.500]  I've done two and a half hours and have not plugged any products or any t-shirts
[2:35:36.500 --> 2:35:40.740]  or anything that we sell in for store.com a everything we sell is high
[2:35:40.740 --> 2:35:47.300]  quality as about getting the word out and fighting tyranny B it's really good
[2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:54.380]  products for everybody or that's kind of a but see it funds our operation we
[2:35:54.380 --> 2:35:56.900]  don't like to be beholden to sponsors quite frankly there's not a lot of
[2:35:56.900 --> 2:35:59.900]  sponsors that are high enough quality for us to even accept them and I'm kind
[2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:06.500]  of neurotic about that I only sell things I really believe in and if you go
[2:36:06.500 --> 2:36:11.380]  to infowarslife.com we are about to sell out of Supermail Vitality and it
[2:36:11.380 --> 2:36:14.300]  will be probably two three weeks until we get more of it in I'm just gonna tell
[2:36:14.300 --> 2:36:17.340]  you it right now it's going to sell out then it'll be back ordered we have a
[2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:23.660]  special going 15% off when it sells out the special will go bye bye and by the
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:28.260]  way this isn't hype people say really Alex a minority of folks but I'd say
[2:36:28.260 --> 2:36:32.100]  20 30% of vocal minority in the comments on YouTube and info wars when
[2:36:32.100 --> 2:36:35.460]  there's a video or something about this post that they go really man you know
[2:36:35.460 --> 2:36:41.380]  you claim you got mail enhancement drops really yeah yeah you bet eight
[2:36:41.380 --> 2:36:47.700]  superpower herbs concentrated that will blow your freaking socks off it costs
[2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:51.060]  just depending on how we get the wet herbs shipped in and everything organic
[2:36:51.060 --> 2:36:56.860]  certified everything between 10 and $20 it varies each each process when they
[2:36:56.860 --> 2:37:02.180]  make it I could put out a mail enhancement herb that would give people
[2:37:02.180 --> 2:37:07.020]  some effect for like $5 is what it would cost me instead of 20 nobody puts
[2:37:07.020 --> 2:37:11.700]  out products that cost 20 bucks I'm about to buy a product from mitochondrial
[2:37:11.700 --> 2:37:16.780]  DNA that nobody else is putting out my dad was developing it for I'm not gonna
[2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:20.060]  get into it the point is is that we're gonna put it out it's gonna cost us
[2:37:20.060 --> 2:37:26.340]  $60 a bottle to get this pharma pharmaceutical grade stuff and then
[2:37:26.340 --> 2:37:28.900]  I'm just giving you an idea of products that are coming out the type of stuff
[2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:34.220]  we're doing okay so yeah when it cost $120 that's cuz it's gonna cost us 60
[2:37:34.220 --> 2:37:37.260]  and we've got to have R&D money and all the other money and money to fund all
[2:37:37.260 --> 2:37:41.860]  the operations that's the kind of stuff we're rolling out is really powerful
[2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:48.500]  stuff okay and this supermail vitality I don't know if I'm even allowed to tell
[2:37:48.500 --> 2:37:54.460]  the story the point is everyone in the office we don't advertise it as an
[2:37:54.460 --> 2:38:00.140]  aphrodisiac that is not the intention it is mail vitality to get healthy to
[2:38:00.140 --> 2:38:05.740]  have energy to work out it doesn't have any testosterone mimicers like mostly
[2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:09.420]  herbs they push at GNC and the rest of it which do work by the way but have
[2:38:09.420 --> 2:38:13.660]  problems and breaks down in retrogrades and other hormones and causes stuff this
[2:38:13.660 --> 2:38:21.620]  is designed to to to block estrogen mimicers a b get your body to release
[2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:25.500]  its own growth hormone and testosterone that's what group says it does I don't
[2:38:25.500 --> 2:38:28.900]  know what it's doing I went and looked up each herb did research and other
[2:38:28.900 --> 2:38:32.500]  medical people look at it they said no this is all super high quality you know
[2:38:32.500 --> 2:38:36.500]  this is the eight things known you know to be really clean really good and that
[2:38:36.500 --> 2:38:41.140]  are FDA what they call grass certified being it's seen as safe and it's the
[2:38:41.140 --> 2:38:45.300]  proprietary way it's concentrated and you fund the operation and just buy a
[2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:49.860]  bottle buy a bottle and what are you out you've supported the broadcast by the
[2:38:49.860 --> 2:38:55.540]  way no negative reviews of this or the iodine or the fluoride shield I think
[2:38:55.540 --> 2:38:58.300]  the fluoride shield is the best product and it's double the size of the
[2:38:58.300 --> 2:39:01.180]  survival shield it has the mason iodide in it and five other key things to
[2:39:01.180 --> 2:39:04.700]  chelate and detox by the body of heavy metals fluoride you name it and we it
[2:39:04.700 --> 2:39:08.340]  sells good but nothing like the survival shield and the mail vitality I don't
[2:39:08.340 --> 2:39:12.580]  know why because it's the best deal for the price and but I really like taking
[2:39:12.580 --> 2:39:16.180]  and has really helped me detoxify and it's incredible with my stressful
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:19.140]  lifestyle and staying up till three in the morning sometimes and everything I
[2:39:19.140 --> 2:39:25.460]  do and I'm just seething with energy now everybody I know says like Shane
[2:39:25.460 --> 2:39:30.780]  Steiner and Rob do we bring Robin here see if I can tell the story just just
[2:39:30.780 --> 2:39:32.980]  just bring Rob do this was not planned he's on the other side of the building
[2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:36.380]  if he's even here and then I'm gonna go to this report your calls I'm gonna have
[2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:42.660]  to do some overdrive folks Steiner was getting irritable doing his powerlifting
[2:39:42.660 --> 2:39:46.620]  naturally and then he went on this he can work out even harder and is in a good
[2:39:46.620 --> 2:39:51.260]  mood do has had the same effect he's made him in a good mood and had the other
[2:39:51.260 --> 2:39:57.020]  effects that I get permission to talk about and everybody else me I gotta be
[2:39:57.020 --> 2:40:01.340]  honest I'm the only person I know who can't take my own product or I take like
[2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:05.220]  half of it I take like every other day or half a dose but once a day because it
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:09.780]  does make me even more aggressive and I guess that's how my physiology is
[2:40:09.780 --> 2:40:15.140]  already but it makes me irritable so check with your doctor health care
[2:40:15.140 --> 2:40:19.940]  provider first before you take it and it's not a game it's not a joke and
[2:40:19.940 --> 2:40:24.940]  people are always you know mad if I sell a magazine it costs it's bad or or if I
[2:40:24.940 --> 2:40:28.340]  sell t-shirts made to America at ten dollars less than you could get them
[2:40:28.340 --> 2:40:32.380]  anywhere else made to America the Molan Lombay or if if I exist it's bad
[2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:36.060]  because they want to demonize the Liberty Movement funding itself with high
[2:40:36.060 --> 2:40:40.260]  quality products we are funded by you we are funded by you supporting the local
[2:40:40.260 --> 2:40:45.140]  AM and FM affiliates we are funded by you being sponsors of local stations
[2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:49.780]  spreading the word we are funded by viewers and listeners like you mainly
[2:40:49.780 --> 2:40:53.780]  listeners the visual component of the show dominates everything but really
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:59.100]  first and foremost it's a radio show now do a stack of Bibles this was not
[2:40:59.100 --> 2:41:04.020]  planned correct totally correct yeah you just called for me and even though
[2:41:04.020 --> 2:41:08.180]  you're here we listening to show I think it's a super male thing I think you're
[2:41:08.180 --> 2:41:10.460]  even though you guys are not supposed to watch the show back there's what's work
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:14.300]  on the nightly news right anyways regardless we keep it on head of the
[2:41:14.300 --> 2:41:19.420]  news department what has super mail done for you it's done a couple things one
[2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:23.820]  I've been I've I guess I've been taking it about two weeks now I think it was
[2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:27.060]  after we shot that interview there was even some high rolling around here
[2:41:27.060 --> 2:41:29.620]  when I was coming out with Emily whatever what do you think I'm gonna put a
[2:41:29.620 --> 2:41:33.540]  joke out no but I you know it works differently on different people as you
[2:41:33.540 --> 2:41:38.460]  as you've attested and I've had it was after we shot let's just be honest I
[2:41:38.460 --> 2:41:43.700]  start I just it's probably not good for me you call it barbarian juice yeah go
[2:41:43.700 --> 2:41:47.300]  ahead so after we shot that interview I said oh you know what we had an open
[2:41:47.300 --> 2:41:50.500]  thing I said I'm gonna start taking it so I started taking it three dropper
[2:41:50.500 --> 2:41:54.780]  fools in the morning three in the taking more than you're supposed to yeah and
[2:41:54.780 --> 2:41:59.980]  it really you know in the morning you you have that kind of fog when you wake up
[2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:05.780]  I do that the fog goes away in about five minutes and I'm thinking clearly and I
[2:42:05.780 --> 2:42:08.900]  feel like I don't have I'm not I don't feel overly abundant of energy like when
[2:42:08.900 --> 2:42:12.700]  I drink because you are irritable sometimes oh yeah yeah I can be very
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:16.740]  you're known as do so for around here yeah it's definitely mellowed me out a
[2:42:16.740 --> 2:42:21.940]  little bit and I started doing I over the weekend I installed a pull-up bar and
[2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:24.740]  like every time I'll go into my office I just are doing like five or six pull-ups
[2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:27.620]  and it wasn't placebo right you were telling me this morning you did it to
[2:42:27.620 --> 2:42:31.260]  see if it was bull yeah I want to check it out see if it had any effect on me
[2:42:31.260 --> 2:42:36.620]  because I've I've I use the survival shield as well and I like it and it's
[2:42:36.620 --> 2:42:42.380]  I've definitely noticed that I had some changes and so start on the super mail and
[2:42:42.380 --> 2:42:45.940]  I mean I tell you it definitely it definitely worked for me and it
[2:42:45.940 --> 2:42:50.660]  definitely didn't give me like this hyper energy just nice smooth energy and
[2:42:50.660 --> 2:42:54.740]  it tastes good it doesn't you know it definitely tastes see I was out late
[2:42:54.740 --> 2:42:59.860]  last night it's pretty good and I took some this morning and then I feel really
[2:42:59.860 --> 2:43:03.140]  aggressive it definitely does something to me you should probably do half a
[2:43:03.140 --> 2:43:09.860]  dropper I mean I do three and it I don't really you know notice I don't
[2:43:09.860 --> 2:43:13.620]  notice a an adrenaline surge or anything but it's like a smooth it's like a
[2:43:13.620 --> 2:43:18.340]  slow ramp up of energy and I'm I'm definitely a believer after that but
[2:43:18.340 --> 2:43:24.820]  now what about the classified part you know I'd rather I'd rather well it my
[2:43:24.820 --> 2:43:29.620]  bedroom life didn't need any enhancement before this but people are
[2:43:29.620 --> 2:43:39.580]  begging for mercy why why fast did I stop taking no no no we're not the
[2:43:39.580 --> 2:43:45.340]  thing is this is real okay but the issue is women can take it too I haven't tried
[2:43:45.340 --> 2:43:51.020]  to get her to take it she hasn't done it yet just put it in her T the government
[2:43:51.020 --> 2:43:55.100]  force drugs is one that's true yeah I have put filters in my water to get the
[2:43:55.100 --> 2:44:02.060]  fluoride out you know so it's a it might be a fourth son now it definitely works
[2:44:02.060 --> 2:44:06.900]  well if there is that's great you know I won't get three great sons yeah I got
[2:44:06.900 --> 2:44:09.820]  two daughters of some but I gotta tell you it's something about three boys
[2:44:09.820 --> 2:44:15.060]  they're great boy is it's an army they all have electricity in their eyes too yeah
[2:44:15.060 --> 2:44:18.220]  most of kids are like zombies nowadays they're definitely awake and my oldest
[2:44:18.220 --> 2:44:22.180]  is really awake and he always brings back stories from stuff that happens and
[2:44:22.180 --> 2:44:25.820]  he's like they were talking about this at school today I said well you know what
[2:44:25.820 --> 2:44:28.740]  does that make you feel he's like it's just weird because people will agree with
[2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:32.580]  it you know and just the different things that they roll out and and it's
[2:44:32.580 --> 2:44:36.580]  it's but it's good to see I think when you're awake you can recognize those
[2:44:36.580 --> 2:44:40.620]  things and you're not enveloped by them you know you're not just taken in like
[2:44:40.620 --> 2:44:44.340]  oh like the people at South by how they just go get their faces scanned for
[2:44:44.340 --> 2:44:48.340]  these badges and it's no big deal but listen I'm glad that a minority of
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:52.460]  people have complained how dare you you know you know sale sell something for
[2:44:52.460 --> 2:44:56.020]  male vitality well they're bombarding our male vitality they're putting stuff in
[2:44:56.020 --> 2:44:59.340]  the food and water on record and writing books about how they're doing it to
[2:44:59.340 --> 2:45:04.660]  de-masculate us and so if it has the effect of blocking that at least
[2:45:04.660 --> 2:45:09.100]  partially why shouldn't we do that well I think if the haters hate it hate the
[2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:11.900]  stuff about Super Mario Vitality they're really gonna hate the next ad that
[2:45:11.900 --> 2:45:15.700]  rolls out which is even even better I'll just leave it leave it at that we'll
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:19.620]  have I think a sneak preview next week of one and should be pretty awesome we
[2:45:19.620 --> 2:45:24.340]  should do it just with the comedy part awesome or even more awesome or the quote
[2:45:24.340 --> 2:45:30.300]  Mike Adams so yeah I think it I describe what that just give him a sneak
[2:45:30.300 --> 2:45:34.340]  peek of what's coming up with the ad that I well we actually on camera were
[2:45:34.340 --> 2:45:39.460]  able to film Dr. Group making an amazing transformation an amazing
[2:45:39.460 --> 2:45:44.940]  transformation by taking the SuperMail and then activating it with with push-ups
[2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:49.220]  it was pretty I was blown away I couldn't believe it is satire and of course
[2:45:49.220 --> 2:45:54.180]  it's open over the top satire for the people should try it get one bottle and
[2:45:54.180 --> 2:45:58.300]  try it and see what you think there's a lot of comments in the videos of people
[2:45:58.300 --> 2:46:01.980]  who had tried it and said it works you know it usually the haters are just
[2:46:01.980 --> 2:46:05.340]  they're not gonna try it anyway no no no but I mean I get it because there's a
[2:46:05.340 --> 2:46:09.900]  lot of stuff out there but quite frankly a lot of the when I played football and
[2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:14.340]  then I sort of get into weightlifting heavy in college I never took any drugs
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:19.420]  but I would go to like G&C and get a Yohembe bottle and yeah man it would
[2:46:19.420 --> 2:46:23.460]  make me get bigger but I would also have hot flashes and feel crazy and and and
[2:46:23.460 --> 2:46:26.380]  just like my heart would be and I was like whoa I took it for like a week now
[2:46:26.380 --> 2:46:29.460]  and I tried something else and it made me feel just so maybe it's just me
[2:46:29.460 --> 2:46:32.460]  because this stuff doesn't do anything like that it doesn't be more aggressive
[2:46:32.460 --> 2:46:35.900]  it's just that I know there's most of those herbs and stuff actually do do
[2:46:35.900 --> 2:46:39.420]  stuff yeah I mean this plants folks I mean that's where most medicine comes
[2:46:39.420 --> 2:46:42.860]  from there's eight herbs in it yeah and for it well the it's roots and fruits
[2:46:42.860 --> 2:46:45.820]  that are mixed in concentrated right it's concentrate that's the key is this
[2:46:45.820 --> 2:46:49.620]  is really concentrated in a cold press yeah I mean this is like a ton of stuff
[2:46:49.620 --> 2:46:54.060]  the essence of it well you can feel the power in it when you you know when I
[2:46:54.060 --> 2:46:57.500]  have had but what I'm saying is I never really liked all that stuff right and
[2:46:57.500 --> 2:46:59.380]  then they're like hey you ought to do this we're developing I'm like no
[2:46:59.380 --> 2:47:03.180]  way and then I took it I'm like wow this is really real and it doesn't make me
[2:47:03.180 --> 2:47:06.580]  feel you know too insane yeah but then everybody else took it we had the test
[2:47:06.580 --> 2:47:10.860]  vials some they liked it I said okay I'll do it I will private label this and put
[2:47:10.860 --> 2:47:13.460]  it out officially your new formula and people love it I'm just saying I only
[2:47:13.460 --> 2:47:16.700]  put out stuff I believe in it really is good it definitely I interrupted you go
[2:47:16.700 --> 2:47:20.060]  ahead well it definitely works but one thing you could do when you put that in
[2:47:20.060 --> 2:47:22.780]  your mouth to the dropper full I don't even mix it with anything I just put it
[2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:27.300]  in straight in and you can really taste the power that's in it when you when you
[2:47:27.300 --> 2:47:31.100]  drink certain things or take certain things you could feel in your mouth
[2:47:31.100 --> 2:47:34.020]  you're like wow this has got something in it it's it's electric so when you eat
[2:47:34.020 --> 2:47:38.180]  mushrooms well whatever yeah if you eat mushrooms yeah that is he let I'm glad
[2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:41.420]  you so hypothetically are just joking about that of course but you know you
[2:47:41.420 --> 2:47:45.420]  can tell it's psychoactive just taking the one not one-world-way but that's good
[2:47:45.420 --> 2:47:49.740]  to but the the inner food when you drink that it's got you could tell it's got
[2:47:49.740 --> 2:47:53.100]  stuff in it we sell that at info our store.com immediately like goes into
[2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:55.740]  your system you could feel it going at things that are good you could tell
[2:47:55.740 --> 2:47:59.100]  they're good for you when you eat them like when I first started doing the
[2:47:59.100 --> 2:48:03.140]  shakes with the wheatgrass that Richard brings me oh yeah I would get like this
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:07.380]  well at first I was so unhealthy make me feel sick yeah now it feels good when
[2:48:07.380 --> 2:48:11.780]  it's cleaning yeah yeah and that's I think the first time I drank raw milk I
[2:48:11.780 --> 2:48:16.060]  was in the bathroom for a couple days but you know what after that boom it's
[2:48:16.060 --> 2:48:21.420]  like it's never done that it's never caused me any problems well as I talked
[2:48:21.420 --> 2:48:24.700]  to our milk supplier he goes well it's just cleaning you out and let me tell
[2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:28.860]  you a couple sessions of that and I was cleaned out and I'm ready to go you know
[2:48:28.860 --> 2:48:33.580]  now I mean I hardly even eat as much as I used to just because I'm only putting
[2:48:33.580 --> 2:48:37.100]  as good a thing you do look good I mean you look good before but you look
[2:48:37.100 --> 2:48:41.460]  really vibrant at turn 40 this year so yeah we're same age month yeah I am your
[2:48:41.460 --> 2:48:46.460]  elder though you are right by about a month over a month you know and I feel
[2:48:46.460 --> 2:48:50.580]  great I don't feel I don't feel like I'm 40 I don't feel like that I feel like
[2:48:50.580 --> 2:48:55.060]  I'm 22 still you know I still thought and in fact I feel better I was losing my
[2:48:55.060 --> 2:48:58.020]  hair in college doesn't Taco Bell and all that other I remember you said that
[2:48:58.020 --> 2:49:00.380]  drinking soda now we go high can we take the kids
[2:49:00.380 --> 2:49:04.500]  enter tubing yeah oh yeah well that's that's not a lot of exercise the enter
[2:49:04.500 --> 2:49:09.860]  tube unless it's hard to listen those bottles I'm just joking fun though with
[2:49:09.860 --> 2:49:14.100]  a lot of fun oh man but I didn't mean to digress I'm gonna do 20 30 minutes of
[2:49:14.100 --> 2:49:17.820]  overdrive now folks because I'm gonna go to your phone call Steve Mike Randy
[2:49:17.820 --> 2:49:21.180]  Chad Tony I'm gonna at least get to these calls I want to get to Mac at his
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:28.380]  report programmers at South by Southwest don't know Snowden leak spy news I
[2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:32.460]  mean they don't know anything it's a really good report but I don't know the
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:36.220]  headline might be too long programmers at South by Southwest don't know Snowden
[2:49:36.220 --> 2:49:40.820]  leak spy state info I would say programmers at South by Southwest don't
[2:49:40.820 --> 2:49:46.060]  know who don't know who Snowden is about Snowden yeah yeah yeah that's good
[2:49:46.060 --> 2:49:48.900]  and I'm not criticizing we all just help each other with headlines around here
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:51.900]  headlines are one of the biggest things out there for people getting into this
[2:49:51.900 --> 2:49:56.500]  and doing their own YouTube's headline is what will bring people in to watch
[2:49:56.500 --> 2:50:00.620]  your video yeah and I mean usually we're dealing with such sensational stuff our
[2:50:00.620 --> 2:50:04.300]  problem is we can't come up with something sensational enough to actually
[2:50:04.300 --> 2:50:08.140]  show what reality is yeah it's like mainstream media will take some horrible
[2:50:08.140 --> 2:50:11.660]  thing the government said to make it sound totally dry yeah well we just take
[2:50:11.660 --> 2:50:15.100]  it and report it and give it what our bias of liberty that we think it's
[2:50:15.100 --> 2:50:17.620]  terrible like they think it's terrible they want to put brain chips in the
[2:50:17.620 --> 2:50:20.300]  troops to control them and it's in the New York Times being promoted as good
[2:50:20.300 --> 2:50:24.220]  or I mean I have a bias openly I did you know the taser drones that they have
[2:50:24.220 --> 2:50:27.700]  that where that where they say they have taser drones it drills chasing people
[2:50:27.700 --> 2:50:31.100]  around in Austin and they'll make that seem like oh this is for crowd control
[2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:34.580]  purposes you know no this stuff is gonna be used to come after you it could be
[2:50:34.580 --> 2:50:37.060]  hacked it's like they show up at your party and climb up on the table the
[2:50:37.060 --> 2:50:41.300]  crap in the punch bowl go I'm gonna add some protein to everything you don't

[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:51.380]  to be spied upon but she's well they call us having free will discrimination
[2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:55.660]  yeah like if I have any opinion it's discrimination going back to this

[2:54:08.980 --> 2:54:12.940]  others on this Malaysian flight the article just went live up on info
[2:54:12.940 --> 2:54:18.460]  wars.com nobody's come out with this angle yet it happened the same area of
[2:54:18.460 --> 2:54:25.940]  Asia missing Malaysia flight similar to lost 707 or 007 McDonald's flight
[2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:28.860]  reason I'm butchering the headline is that kid just walked in with this great
[2:54:28.860 --> 2:54:32.500]  article but I asked him to do and then I just changed the headline he's going
[2:54:32.500 --> 2:54:36.740]  in there to change it right now so I was changing it on air missing Malaysia
[2:54:36.740 --> 2:54:43.700]  flight similar to lost 007 McDonald's flight I think that's the way to put it
[2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:46.940]  and it's a very very important article and I'll be breaking that down after I
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:49.780]  take some of your phone calls I want to show you something that's satanic though

[2:54:54.340 --> 2:54:58.180]  great guy running the shipping department and the product department but I
[2:54:58.180 --> 2:55:01.820]  guess Weldon was nice and sent people to a decent hamburger chain for fast food
[2:55:01.820 --> 2:55:06.100]  it's like organic they claim and I didn't ask for it they got me a p-terries
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:10.740]  hamburger and this is satanic not not p-terries in general the little chain
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:15.340]  that started in Austin this is satanic like a Ferrari that they're now coming
[2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:20.900]  out that are part hybrid that's satanic a Ferrari that doesn't and the wrappings
[2:55:20.900 --> 2:55:23.460]  races because it's white you know they're trying to phase out brown bags and
[2:55:23.460 --> 2:55:27.220]  the word bossy because it might hurt feminist feminist fault it's like a

[2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:38.940]  oh I'm gonna stop being silly let's get to some serious topics Steve I forgot to
[2:56:38.940 --> 2:56:43.980]  eat today Steve in Minnesota you're on the air hey Alex how you doing today
[2:56:43.980 --> 2:56:50.260]  what are you not too bad what do you think about what happened with the
[2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:56.940]  flight I don't know the others a bunch of ideas pulling around but I wonder if I
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:57:01.780]  might have something to do with the one those possible nukes that were secretly
[2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:06.780]  shipped out I know you mentioned that the plane could have been hijacked and
[2:57:06.780 --> 2:57:12.140]  maybe landed at some CI funded terrorist base and maybe they're retrofitting it
[2:57:12.140 --> 2:57:17.940]  with the stolen nuke that's a really good point anything's possible when
[2:57:17.940 --> 2:57:23.100]  Dr. Evil basically runs the government yeah exactly and you know the mind does
[2:57:23.100 --> 2:57:28.100]  wander sometimes but it's almost something out of a Tom Clancy novel I
[2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:32.220]  mean who knows what's going on well you know it happened right over North
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:38.220]  Korea the plane flew right by North Korea and the Russians are known for
[2:57:38.220 --> 2:57:41.820]  doing weird stuff they can remote control things I mean literally anything
[2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:45.260]  could have happened it is a giant mystery but it's just like the Larry
[2:57:45.260 --> 2:57:51.340]  McDonald flight do you know about that incredible case I do not know yeah I
[2:57:51.340 --> 2:57:53.980]  really should have covered that at the very start of the show but I went into a
[2:57:53.980 --> 2:58:01.020]  total rant about but please look it up Larry McDonald it's in the article that
[2:58:01.020 --> 2:58:05.220]  Kit Daniels just put up on info wars calm was back in 1983 they got all these
[2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:11.380]  politicians off the plane they they they redirected it he was invited to South
[2:58:11.380 --> 2:58:14.540]  Korea to attend a celebration 30th anniversary United States South Korean
[2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:18.260]  mutual defense treaty he was gonna end up being president folks he was anti-new
[2:58:18.260 --> 2:58:23.620]  world order a real guy super smart super good-looking and a Democrat he was just
[2:58:23.620 --> 2:58:27.500]  unstoppable and they killed him with three fellow members of Congress Jesse
[2:58:27.500 --> 2:58:32.620]  Helms of North Carolina Steve sums of Idaho and a representative Carol Hubbard
[2:58:32.620 --> 2:58:37.020]  of Kentucky and then they basically redirected the plane he still stayed on
[2:58:37.020 --> 2:58:40.420]  it and it disappeared by North Korea
[2:58:40.420 --> 2:58:48.460]  you are listening to GCN without a trace just like the Malaysian Airlines flight 370

[2:59:01.860 --> 2:59:05.060]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[2:59:05.060 --> 2:59:09.500]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by
[2:59:09.500 --> 2:59:14.060]  Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan

[3:00:10.940 --> 3:00:18.460]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[3:00:18.460 --> 3:00:28.220]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones got a Leanne McAdoo report coming up talking

[3:00:33.780 --> 3:00:36.940]  Randy Chad and Tony Mike what do you think's going on with this mystery
[3:00:36.940 --> 3:00:45.860]  Malaysia Airlines flight 370 maybe I'll go ahead what do you think yeah yes sir
[3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:50.380]  hey how are you today I'm good brother what do you think's going on well it's a
[3:00:50.380 --> 3:00:54.060]  pleasure speaking to you first of all secondly this could just be one of these
[3:00:54.060 --> 3:00:59.500]  rare rare situations where it could be an actual hijacking no no I agree because
[3:00:59.500 --> 3:01:03.180]  every time it's a real hijacking they never say it's a hijacking in the in
[3:01:03.180 --> 3:01:08.020]  the jihadis fly it into the water usually is payback for something I
[3:01:08.020 --> 3:01:13.660]  totally agree go ahead yeah usually if it's something staged okay there's some
[3:01:13.660 --> 3:01:17.260]  type of evidence by now that you know they can't hold out this wall and the
[3:01:17.260 --> 3:01:21.900]  media is all lined up ready to push some agenda absolutely no I agree it could be
[3:01:21.900 --> 3:01:26.460]  a real hijacking the only issue is where's the debris well that is a
[3:01:26.460 --> 3:01:33.020]  question you know I you know I think you know if it was a real hijacking you
[3:01:33.020 --> 3:01:36.060]  know the evidence is going to be extremely hard to find because you know
[3:01:36.060 --> 3:01:43.780]  obviously they put their minds to it you know that's that's my scenario it's
[3:01:43.780 --> 3:01:47.460]  always a possibility I just think that if it was a staged event and this could
[3:01:47.460 --> 3:01:51.780]  have been a drill or something we would have seen some type of evidence come out
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:01:57.860]  by now like you said with some sort of agenda you know to follow it up I
[3:01:57.860 --> 3:02:02.180]  agree with you and I mean I'm not trying to say these guys are guilty they just
[3:02:02.180 --> 3:02:07.260]  look like the type of guys they choose that aren't that big but still look like
[3:02:07.260 --> 3:02:12.060]  they're in shape and the looks in their eyes like they're they're not trying to
[3:02:12.060 --> 3:02:15.860]  act aggressive and mean on a mission but they can't help the fact that they look
[3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:20.700]  completely focused and just and it's just snapshots of video it just they look
[3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:28.220]  like has below type special forces people hey can I ask you a question a
[3:02:28.220 --> 3:02:32.180]  little bit off topic yeah sure with everything that's unfolding in our
[3:02:32.180 --> 3:02:37.580]  great country here and in your gut feeling do you feel that when the time
[3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:41.620]  comes do you think it's going to be some type of tragic event or do you feel
[3:02:41.620 --> 3:02:48.220]  that society is just gonna you know fold out into this whole thing man that's a
[3:02:48.220 --> 3:02:53.300]  big one I think it's what dr. Stallman said earlier it's really up to us and
[3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:56.940]  what we do and how we make changes and how we speak out and how we vote with
[3:02:56.940 --> 3:03:00.540]  our dollars and what we stand for but it doesn't matter because it's the animating
[3:03:00.540 --> 3:03:04.580]  contest of life we have to fight back against the tyranny or you're not
[3:03:04.580 --> 3:03:11.180]  you're not even alive I mean survival is success our entire development was on
[3:03:11.180 --> 3:03:15.180]  the edge until just 6,000 years ago or so with the development of agrarian
[3:03:15.180 --> 3:03:22.460]  civilization and so not fighting back and not standing for something and
[3:03:22.460 --> 3:03:27.460]  turning into jellyfish and becoming decadent slobs is our greatest threat so
[3:03:27.460 --> 3:03:31.020]  we've seen the enemy it is us look in the mirror we have bad government because
[3:03:31.020 --> 3:03:35.540]  we become bad people but it's gonna be crazy I think you're gonna have mega
[3:03:35.540 --> 3:03:39.620]  plagues real and manufactured super bugs are already out there I think it's
[3:03:39.620 --> 3:03:43.580]  gonna kill hundreds of millions I think you're just gonna I mean things are
[3:03:43.580 --> 3:03:47.100]  unsustainable the way they are because the public is not hard the public is
[3:03:47.100 --> 3:03:54.140]  soft myself included and nature abhors a an anathema a an enigma a fraud an
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:59.140]  infomnia I don't know what word I should use it's a it's a it's a it's a joke
[3:03:59.140 --> 3:04:04.060]  it's an unnatural shuffling weak soft people loving their programming loving
[3:04:04.060 --> 3:04:08.340]  their servitude I mean the new order is going to be allowed to kill all these
[3:04:08.340 --> 3:04:11.980]  people and probably a lot of us with them and quite frankly the new orders
[3:04:11.980 --> 3:04:16.340]  right it's natural that slovenly weak slobs who aren't animated with a spirit
[3:04:16.340 --> 3:04:20.020]  of liberty will be annihilated the only issue is the globalists are helping them
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:24.940]  be dumb slobs so they can control them instead of being
[3:04:24.940 --> 3:04:29.500]  chivalrous even in their evil if they were gonna be evil and believing they're
[3:04:29.500 --> 3:04:34.620]  so great that that that they could empower humanity and still be number
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:40.860]  one within that system and it's just so important now I know I always just
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:45.500]  endlessly talk about that because I want to see people successful I see some
[3:04:45.500 --> 3:04:50.460]  guy with a beautiful wife I don't get mad at him and say she should be mine or
[3:04:50.460 --> 3:04:53.540]  I see somebody with a really cool house I don't get mad their house is better
[3:04:53.540 --> 3:04:58.980]  than mine now I get mad if they steal it from me or somebody else then I want to

[3:06:30.220 --> 3:06:34.500]  electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV
[3:06:34.500 --> 3:06:39.340]  by simulating the light from a real TV fake TV could be the difference between
[3:06:39.340 --> 3:06:43.980]  coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked to get your fake

[3:07:14.340 --> 3:07:17.620]  pretty hefty salary as president but did you know that he also makes an
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:22.580]  additional $72,000 on average per month on the side wait president Obama
[3:07:22.580 --> 3:07:26.460]  collects money from something other than his job crazy right where's all this
[3:07:26.460 --> 3:07:30.660]  extra cash coming from well last week I came across a website called secret
[3:07:30.660 --> 3:07:35.260]  income 12.com which explained exactly where the money comes from but the cool
[3:07:35.260 --> 3:07:39.700]  thing is it also shows how guys like you and me can rake in thousands of dollars
[3:07:39.700 --> 3:07:42.940]  every month by taking advantage of essentially the same income secret
[3:07:42.940 --> 3:07:47.540]  Obama uses you mean there's a way I can do this for myself come on it sounds too
[3:07:47.540 --> 3:07:52.060]  good to be true if you don't believe me go to secret income 12.com and check out

[3:08:05.260 --> 3:08:11.100]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[3:08:11.100 --> 3:08:18.060]  Jones and the GCN radio network all right let's go to your phone calls the
[3:08:18.060 --> 3:08:23.300]  Malaysia flight what do you think happened 370 I'm leaning towards hijacking
[3:08:23.300 --> 3:08:27.020]  and somebody flying into the ocean it wouldn't be the first time they didn't
[3:08:27.020 --> 3:08:33.020]  find any debris for a while but I'm not sure about that and I don't want to say
[3:08:33.020 --> 3:08:35.380]  these guys that are getting on the plane or guilty just because they're
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:41.060]  Iranian but that's the Iranian style and it's happened before into the
[3:08:41.060 --> 3:08:45.220]  Mediterranean into the Persian Gulf over there where they get on board the
[3:08:45.220 --> 3:08:48.900]  planes and then fly them right down in the water there's also been cases where
[3:08:48.900 --> 3:08:53.420]  Egyptian military multiple times the planes get blown up that's probably the
[3:08:53.420 --> 3:08:56.660]  Israelis if the Egyptian military doesn't play ball there's been a bunch
[3:08:56.660 --> 3:09:01.380]  of cases of you know you got 20 30 40 50 Egyptian top brass on a airplane they
[3:09:01.380 --> 3:09:07.660]  blow those up so I don't know I mean this is a real mystery and Mike Adams
[3:09:07.660 --> 3:09:11.140]  has a really interesting story that's up on info wars.com I want to get him on
[3:09:11.140 --> 3:09:18.020]  tomorrow if he can come on the Skype or even studio and get into just the
[3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:23.340]  craziness like I had that article and now I can't find it maybe reprint it for
[3:09:23.340 --> 3:09:27.020]  me but here's the article up on info wars.com I kid Daniels missing Malaysian
[3:09:27.020 --> 3:09:34.540]  flights similar to lost McDonald's flight and I wanted to go over some of the
[3:09:34.540 --> 3:09:38.540]  points he makes it's just really interesting here's another one that this
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:41.420]  is unbelievable but there's video of it is up on info wars.com
[3:09:41.420 --> 3:09:45.420]  feminist control freaks want to ban the word bossy because that might hurt them
[3:09:45.420 --> 3:09:49.020]  because they're bossy these are bossy control freaks that want to rule everyone
[3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:53.020]  and say you're guilty because you're a man or you're white or whatever and then
[3:09:53.020 --> 3:09:58.060]  you do whatever they say politically because they have Beyonce come out and
[3:09:58.060 --> 3:10:01.820]  tell you that you know calling in pecking control freak women there's
[3:10:01.820 --> 3:10:08.020]  control freak men as well but it is kind of a trait known to some women that
[3:10:08.020 --> 3:10:12.580]  that is illegal folks you will you will ban white bags they're hateful round
[3:10:12.580 --> 3:10:15.420]  bags are hateful everything's hateful except the new world order putting
[3:10:15.420 --> 3:10:18.780]  cancer viruses in your vaccines yeah here's the article and we're going to
[3:10:18.780 --> 3:10:24.620]  your calls disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 begins to demand
[3:10:24.620 --> 3:10:29.980]  supernatural explanations by the way my buddy I know is out there listening I
[3:10:29.980 --> 3:10:32.980]  want to give him the code we are going shooting today we are going shooting
[3:10:32.980 --> 3:10:36.860]  today that's not really code for anything we are going shooting today but he
[3:10:36.860 --> 3:10:39.980]  was texting me earlier than my phone died I need to call my buddy I forgot and
[3:10:39.980 --> 3:10:44.540]  told me are going shooting side issue this I just had a feeling it was
[3:10:44.540 --> 3:10:48.660]  listening so I just said that disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370
[3:10:48.660 --> 3:10:54.220]  begins to demand supernatural expectations or explanations and it goes on
[3:10:54.220 --> 3:10:58.380]  to say that the phones are calling people and calling back home and calling
[3:10:58.380 --> 3:11:03.460]  computer systems the Washington Post is reporting for mind-bending possibilities
[3:11:03.460 --> 3:11:08.660]  none of which seem possible the kidnapped explanation the plane somehow landed
[3:11:08.660 --> 3:11:12.420]  somewhere without leaving a radar signature of any kind all the passengers
[3:11:12.420 --> 3:11:16.660]  being held hostage and were thus still alive their mobile devices are somehow
[3:11:16.660 --> 3:11:20.900]  within cell tower range and yet for some reason have not been confiscated
[3:11:20.900 --> 3:11:24.100]  maybe this is all just some big diversion for the war they're about to start in
[3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:27.900]  Ukraine I don't know who knows what the globalist this could be some mass
[3:11:27.900 --> 3:11:34.660]  diversion my mending popular possibility to the Stargate explanation the
[3:11:34.660 --> 3:11:38.060]  teleportation portal of some kind like to permit a triangle exist it has
[3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:40.860]  disappeared in the alternate universe where Al Gore lives with the man bear
[3:11:40.860 --> 3:11:46.020]  pick mind-bending possibility three the failed search explanation far more
[3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:49.900]  mundane explanation supposes that the massive multi-day search for the plane
[3:11:49.900 --> 3:11:53.620]  wreckage debris simply hasn't stumbled upon the correct location yet that that
[3:11:53.620 --> 3:11:58.540]  could be it it's a hijacking number four advanced military weapons explanation
[3:11:58.540 --> 3:12:03.340]  that they just obliterated it or vaporized it with some of the Philadelphia
[3:12:03.340 --> 3:12:07.460]  type experiment stuff we must stick to the mundane explanation until more
[3:12:07.460 --> 3:12:12.900]  searches can be conducted yeah or just be old-fashioned hijackers or it could
[3:12:12.900 --> 3:12:16.940]  have been remote-controlled to another base by hackers or by government or by
[3:12:16.940 --> 3:12:20.380]  the Easter Bunny I don't know let's move quickly now to your calls Tony in
[3:12:20.380 --> 3:12:23.860]  California thank you for holding what do you think's happening with the missing
[3:12:23.860 --> 3:12:31.180]  airplane I think you got it pretty much spot on I think it went down I'm hoping
[3:12:31.180 --> 3:12:35.260]  these guys are sitting on a tarmac but when they're talking about supernatural
[3:12:35.260 --> 3:12:42.020]  stuff they're just milk in the story that's interesting you what does your
[3:12:42.020 --> 3:12:49.820]  gut tell you I think I think it was a hijacking I'm hoping those guys are on
[3:12:49.820 --> 3:12:58.700]  a tarmac somewhere but I'm thinking yeah they they took it down you know I tend
[3:12:58.700 --> 3:13:08.340]  to think who do you think took it down oh it's kind of strange it's flying out
[3:13:08.340 --> 3:13:15.860]  of Malaysia so that'd be kind of I think what you were talking about before I'm
[3:13:15.860 --> 3:13:24.660]  pretty much sure like someone out of Russia or their ad one of those two
[3:13:24.660 --> 3:13:30.900]  interesting I appreciate your call well Malaysia is a mainly Muslim nation and
[3:13:30.900 --> 3:13:35.820]  that's the kind of place where you know the real folks that really want to do
[3:13:35.820 --> 3:13:39.340]  something can get on board but again it may not be I don't want to sit or pass
[3:13:39.340 --> 3:13:45.100]  blame on people even though they're suspects reportedly I just think they
[3:13:45.100 --> 3:13:50.380]  look like capable very serious people who are on a mission and are whacked out
[3:13:50.380 --> 3:13:53.660]  of their brains a little bit but but maybe that's a video still they just
[3:13:53.660 --> 3:13:56.860]  chose to make the guys look bad maybe they're totally innocent in fact I bet
[3:13:56.860 --> 3:14:02.180]  they are innocent I bet Obama's innocent of everything as well let's talk to
[3:14:02.180 --> 3:14:07.940]  Randy in South Carolina Randy you're on the air hey Alex how you doing today I'm
[3:14:07.940 --> 3:14:12.620]  doing all right what's on your mind well I've been thinking about this and you
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:17.900]  know I don't think it was a hijacking the reason I say that because these these
[3:14:17.900 --> 3:14:23.900]  cockpits are hard now ever since 9-11 they're hardened that the check-in security
[3:14:23.900 --> 3:14:28.420]  is it's heightened it'd be very difficult for some a couple guys to get on
[3:14:28.420 --> 3:14:33.340]  the airplane and hijack it without the pilots at least being able to call a
[3:14:33.340 --> 3:14:38.540]  tower somewhere real traffic control is somewhere unless they got a hang grenade
[3:14:38.540 --> 3:14:43.820]  on and said tell them not to contact anybody let me in the cockpit or I'm
[3:14:43.820 --> 3:14:46.540]  the detonate this hang grenade but I don't even believe that because there
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:50.020]  have been other real hijacking cases where guys had guns and stuff and people
[3:14:50.020 --> 3:14:53.260]  fought them and sometimes beat them I mean I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy
[3:14:53.260 --> 3:14:57.940]  around but if four guys pull not box cutters out and I'm on a plane I'd say
[3:14:57.940 --> 3:15:03.180]  man let's beat there you know what let's go I mean it would just be absolutely
[3:15:03.180 --> 3:15:07.660]  those guys I don't care how tough they think they are you're the attacker you
[3:15:07.660 --> 3:15:10.300]  don't have the high ground I'm gonna stomp you into the ground I'm gonna hurt
[3:15:10.300 --> 3:15:16.100]  you bad and I do I cannot believe those flights full of men a lot of them
[3:15:16.100 --> 3:15:20.500]  veterans defense contractors you name it some of them were guys about the
[3:15:20.500 --> 3:15:23.700]  military five years I mean I don't believe imagine walking into a military
[3:15:23.700 --> 3:15:27.460]  bar and pulling a box cutter out and going I'm gonna you know kick your butt
[3:15:27.460 --> 3:15:31.260]  do what I tell you they would get up and literally break your arm and probably
[3:15:31.260 --> 3:15:34.620]  break your neck I mean I just don't buy it I mean do you buy that nobody fought
[3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:41.660]  back on 9-11 no absolutely not and the other thing too you can look you can
[3:15:41.660 --> 3:15:46.180]  look at the passenger manifest and go through that and see if there's any people
[3:15:46.180 --> 3:15:50.620]  that actually stick out there may be somebody that they want to get rid of so
[3:15:50.620 --> 3:15:55.460]  they just took the whole plane down remotely that's a possibility look again
[3:15:55.460 --> 3:15:58.700]  I lean towards the fact that we know they have the remote systems it could
[3:15:58.700 --> 3:16:01.540]  have been done by any third party or government or agency or corporation
[3:16:01.540 --> 3:16:06.380]  you're right and maybe I'm just being influenced by the photos of the
[3:16:06.380 --> 3:16:13.580]  Iranians and again they're probably completely innocent it's just that when
[3:16:13.580 --> 3:16:18.860]  they stage stuff they hype it and there's no hype associated with this
[3:16:18.860 --> 3:16:24.100]  about some agenda they've got right now I mean Boston bombing they were lined up
[3:16:24.100 --> 3:16:26.820]  they were ready Sandy Hook Aurora they were lined up they were ready
[3:16:26.820 --> 3:16:30.100]  her not Bloomberg had his Twitter campaign set them the day before saying
[3:16:30.100 --> 3:16:33.180]  get ready I mean we really caught them with their pants down on this one
[3:16:33.180 --> 3:16:38.300]  because the scripting don't let a good crisis go to waste there's no scripting
[3:16:38.300 --> 3:16:42.380]  here and so it's just it's an incredible mystery thank you so much Randy
[3:16:42.380 --> 3:16:47.540]  Gray points Chad in Canada thanks for holding you're on the air hello hey
[3:16:47.540 --> 3:16:52.340]  brother how's it going good yeah I got some extremely good weather up here I
[3:16:52.340 --> 3:16:56.180]  think we're trading our bad weather with you guys down there here in the last
[3:16:56.180 --> 3:17:02.580]  couple of years I'm I'm a little I mean I've been looking at this too and I
[3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:06.780]  think the you know if it is a terrorist event would you not think that they
[3:17:06.780 --> 3:17:09.740]  would sort of be all over that and glorify that because they'd actually
[3:17:09.740 --> 3:17:13.580]  have something real they could use to further an agenda here's what I found
[3:17:13.580 --> 3:17:18.700]  because they follow playbooks the old rule was when there's real terrorism into
[3:17:18.700 --> 3:17:22.060]  the 80s you don't cover it or talk about it because it gives the terrorist
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:27.180]  attention and I've confirmed and talked to real sources that there have been
[3:17:27.180 --> 3:17:33.700]  power plants blown up people killed all sorts of terror attacks that were real
[3:17:33.700 --> 3:17:37.980]  carried out mainly by the Iranians is tit for tat because that's that's the
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:41.420]  only real military opposition Saudi Arabia and Al Qaeda that's all
[3:17:41.420 --> 3:17:45.140]  synthetic that's why we know that attack was fake as well Saudi Arabia was it
[3:17:45.140 --> 3:17:49.740]  invaded even though 15 of the so-called hijackers of the 19 came from there so
[3:17:49.740 --> 3:17:56.980]  there's a lot of points that go into it but I in my experience when the Iranians
[3:17:56.980 --> 3:18:03.700]  stage something the West doesn't give it attention or when another group does it
[3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:08.460]  they don't cover it real terror attacks do not get covered fake ones get covered
[3:18:08.460 --> 3:18:14.180]  and I'd only learned this last decade from watching it and then researching
[3:18:14.180 --> 3:18:18.340]  stuff that goes on but everybody knows you don't give terrorist attention you
[3:18:18.340 --> 3:18:21.180]  don't give into terrorist demands you don't that was always what you did that
[3:18:21.180 --> 3:18:24.460]  I mean my god changed the whole world because some terrorists hit us that's
[3:18:24.460 --> 3:18:27.620]  empowering the terrorist that's the terrorist winning whoever they are do
[3:18:27.620 --> 3:18:31.420]  you see what I'm saying oh I do you know and I think maybe my only other
[3:18:31.420 --> 3:18:34.860]  possibility I know there were some talks of possible North Korean missiles
[3:18:34.860 --> 3:18:39.180]  aloft but I don't know what type of damage a missile does to a plane in
[3:18:39.180 --> 3:18:44.620]  order to break up its debris so it couldn't be found I agree and Kim Jong
[3:18:44.620 --> 3:18:48.340]  was elected but 100% of the votes so he is not a dictator did you hear that
[3:18:48.340 --> 3:18:53.780]  today yeah that's for sure I got one last point there actually a question for
[3:18:53.780 --> 3:18:58.260]  you Alex just skipping cuz you can talk about 9-11 a little bit today have you
[3:18:58.260 --> 3:19:03.540]  received or looked at Dr. Judy Wood's book where does the towers go yeah I
[3:19:03.540 --> 3:19:07.460]  mean I've always said there's a lot of weird anomalies and things going on at
[3:19:07.460 --> 3:19:11.620]  the towers I've just stuck with what I could prove and they've made a faux
[3:19:11.620 --> 3:19:21.100]  controversy out there about that that I never covered toasted cars and energy
[3:19:21.100 --> 3:19:25.060]  weapons and all that and that's not true I mean I've had Ventura on covering it
[3:19:25.060 --> 3:19:28.660]  I've let them plug their stuff I've interviewed some of the people but then
[3:19:28.660 --> 3:19:33.060]  when it becomes you better have someone on not from her mother's or or or or
[3:19:33.060 --> 3:19:37.260]  else remember one guy one time sent me an email and he said you're gonna have
[3:19:37.260 --> 3:19:41.540]  me on to expose the Vatican or I'm gonna expose you was working for him I said
[3:19:41.540 --> 3:19:44.700]  email back saying well I'd be happy interview your views on the Vatican but
[3:19:44.700 --> 3:19:48.820]  not being threatened it's like coming up to I come up to a woman at a bar and
[3:19:48.820 --> 3:19:52.180]  saying go out with me or I'm gonna punch you in the nose I mean she's gonna
[3:19:52.180 --> 3:19:55.460]  call the bouncer and have you thrown out I mean that's not how you get so I just
[3:19:55.460 --> 3:20:01.860]  it's I'm not gonna have her on my show so that's the end of it ever because
[3:20:01.860 --> 3:20:05.060]  because what happens is there was all these attacks on Stephen Jones the
[3:20:05.060 --> 3:20:09.260]  professor and others about thermite that was clearly there and there was all
[3:20:09.260 --> 3:20:14.180]  these attacks just by a whole camp in infighting cognitive dissonance cast
[3:20:14.180 --> 3:20:18.180]  Sunstein sites type stuff and I just will not be part of it I mean people that
[3:20:18.180 --> 3:20:24.540]  I gave platforms and were super nice to a professor out of Minnesota others you
[3:20:24.540 --> 3:20:28.580]  know later came out and just created this whole fake controversy thinking I
[3:20:28.580 --> 3:20:36.020]  would then attack them that they would get attention and what they got was no
[3:20:36.020 --> 3:20:42.180]  attention now after the fact you know I'll tell people why I did that but I
[3:20:42.180 --> 3:20:48.980]  saw some real sophisticated operative type stuff coming out during that whole
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:53.420]  period whereas Mark Dice attacked me with a bunch of made-up stuff I saw him lose
[3:20:53.420 --> 3:20:57.380]  weight he didn't look as focused as he used to look I like Mark I called him up
[3:20:57.380 --> 3:20:59.940]  you know I said he's been going through a lot in your life I bet you have and
[3:20:59.940 --> 3:21:02.820]  you know what he goes yeah how do you know that and I said he's a good guy I
[3:21:02.820 --> 3:21:06.580]  said I forgive you you tried to destroy me you swore you know your best you
[3:21:06.580 --> 3:21:10.100]  could you failed I wanted you to fail first let you know that I love you in
[3:21:10.100 --> 3:21:13.540]  Christ and then I forgive you you're a talented guy who's a great author and a
[3:21:13.540 --> 3:21:19.380]  great mind and you do great work so I'm gonna promote you now and I'm gonna
[3:21:19.380 --> 3:21:22.780]  promote you to drudge and everybody else how's that sound but I only did that
[3:21:22.780 --> 3:21:25.740]  because he's a good guy he's not an operative I'm not saying Judy Woods an
[3:21:25.740 --> 3:21:29.780]  operative I'm saying that whole constellation like one of the guys
[3:21:29.780 --> 3:21:33.260]  involved it later came out the documentary about crowdsourcing that was
[3:21:33.260 --> 3:21:37.700]  award-winning was in the CIA and so that's what was happening they didn't
[3:21:37.700 --> 3:21:41.300]  want us looking at bombs in the towers and the collapse they weren't to be
[3:21:41.300 --> 3:21:46.720]  fantastical space beams or ground-based weapons which I know they have but you
[3:21:46.720 --> 3:21:51.140]  can't prove it I can prove the hijackers were trained at US military bases I
[3:21:51.140 --> 3:21:54.620]  can prove they were ordered to be given visas I can prove cell phones don't work
[3:21:54.620 --> 3:21:58.620]  at 33,000 feet I can prove those phone calls weren't made the FBI admits it I
[3:21:58.620 --> 3:22:07.940]  can't prove that the towers demolished and went down from some type of plasma
[3:22:07.940 --> 3:22:12.060]  resonance beam that vibrated the metal into pieces which I know they've got and
[3:22:12.060 --> 3:22:15.740]  there's some weird stuff kinetically going on in toasted cars and all the rest
[3:22:15.740 --> 3:22:23.380]  of it I mean it's it's weird it's weird it's weird so so I don't poo poo any of
[3:22:23.380 --> 3:22:27.660]  those people all right I'm out of time I apologize all of their callers call me
[3:22:27.660 --> 3:22:31.100]  back tomorrow nightly news is night 7 o'clock central we're gonna go to this
[3:22:31.100 --> 3:22:38.220]  macadoo leon macadoo report and we're gonna break down of the fact of the
[3:22:38.220 --> 3:22:43.820]  folks at South by Southwest at the computer conference most of them did
[3:22:43.820 --> 3:22:48.060]  not know why they were there to hear Snowden even after he spoke they just
[3:22:48.060 --> 3:22:51.300]  knew it was trending it was really cool and and my problem of South by
[3:22:51.300 --> 3:23:02.700]  Southwest is about 99 percent of the people who were there being abused and
[3:23:02.700 --> 3:23:08.940]  fed on by predators there's there's no real market there there's no real some
[3:23:08.940 --> 3:23:14.100]  people may make connections some people may be successful but low level it's
[3:23:14.100 --> 3:23:18.860]  just a bunch of folks there who literally believe that they're gonna be stars
[3:23:18.860 --> 3:23:21.260]  now I've heard conversations on the street when I've been down there like
[3:23:21.260 --> 3:23:26.020]  yeah I came here I'm gonna be a movie star now after I get money I spent all
[3:23:26.020 --> 3:23:30.980]  my money and you're not gonna be an NBA player you're five feet tall you're not
[3:23:30.980 --> 3:23:35.220]  gonna be a movie star okay in the Hollywood system that's collapsing let's
[3:23:35.220 --> 3:23:39.420]  go to Leanne Macadoo's report I'm here at the Austin Convention Center during
[3:23:39.420 --> 3:23:43.260]  South by Southwest Edward Snowden is the keynote speaker now we're gonna go
[3:23:43.260 --> 3:23:46.700]  around and find out what people think the impact surveillance has had on the
[3:23:46.700 --> 3:23:53.860]  tech industry how are you doing very well where you guys from oh Chicago glad
[3:23:53.860 --> 3:23:57.980]  to be here in Texas yeah there's Sun so that's nice where are you from I'm from
[3:23:57.980 --> 3:24:03.220]  Birmingham Alabama well welcome are you enjoying Austin I am lots of fun hey
[3:24:03.220 --> 3:24:09.060]  guys how are y'all doing where are you from here from Austin welcome are you
[3:24:09.060 --> 3:24:12.620]  excited about Edward Snowden being the keynote speaker today I think it's pretty
[3:24:12.620 --> 3:24:17.460]  cool yeah but I don't really want to be on camera you got glasses on no one can
[3:24:17.460 --> 3:24:23.060]  see who you are so are you all familiar with Edward Snowden yeah how do you feel
[3:24:23.060 --> 3:24:29.900]  the information that he shared has affected the tech industry mmm very good
[3:24:29.900 --> 3:24:32.620]  very good question I think it's made everybody more aware and more nervous
[3:24:32.620 --> 3:24:36.180]  about you know before we were kind of pushing everything out we didn't really
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:39.460]  care about what what it was and we would share what we're eating for breakfast
[3:24:39.460 --> 3:24:44.580]  now it's I would say more more nervous and more cautious about what we're
[3:24:44.580 --> 3:24:47.740]  doing it's really unpredictable right now I think that's why it's so
[3:24:47.740 --> 3:24:50.580]  interesting because there's so many different directions in which it can go
[3:24:50.580 --> 3:24:53.380]  and we struggle with that on like the government level we struggle with that
[3:24:53.380 --> 3:24:56.660]  on a marketer level we struggle with that on an everyday consumer level with
[3:24:56.660 --> 3:24:59.580]  all you know everyone putting their information out there through social
[3:24:59.580 --> 3:25:03.620]  media are you much more concerned and cautious now while you're doing they
[3:25:03.620 --> 3:25:08.780]  concerned I don't do anything sketchy on the internet so I'm not worried I'm
[3:25:08.780 --> 3:25:14.020]  I don't know I'm not really a private person seems sort of like kind of a
[3:25:14.020 --> 3:25:17.940]  wonderful thing to have access to someone who's divulging so much important
[3:25:17.940 --> 3:25:21.300]  information I think you're crazy if you're not concerned about privacy online
[3:25:21.300 --> 3:25:29.180]  that's super techie right yeah this is pretty intense right now are you guys
[3:25:29.180 --> 3:25:34.500]  going to the Edward Snowden talk right now no I'm not actually I'm going to a
[3:25:34.500 --> 3:25:38.500]  film are you familiar with some of the things that are being leaked by Edward
[3:25:38.500 --> 3:25:43.860]  Snowden about how much it's affecting society I'm not what I don't know what
[3:25:43.860 --> 3:25:47.860]  the Snowden leaks are is that something what the wiki leaks what am I supposed
[3:25:47.860 --> 3:25:53.740]  to say to that oh my goodness you are not aware you are building a mobile app
[3:25:53.740 --> 3:25:57.300]  and you do not know how this is gonna how are you gonna protect your your
[3:25:57.300 --> 3:26:00.660]  people that are gonna download your app well I just have to say thank you for
[3:26:00.660 --> 3:26:03.540]  keeping me informed I probably have to do some more research and look into it
[3:26:03.540 --> 3:26:08.460]  yes do you think people should have a right to privacy on the internet or we
[3:26:08.460 --> 3:26:13.940]  should have internet rights the internet is you can live your life without it so
[3:26:13.940 --> 3:26:19.860]  buyer beware right if you want to use that kind of technology it comes with
[3:26:19.860 --> 3:26:24.540]  that kind of a catch and that's that's probably okay so you're you're you don't
[3:26:24.540 --> 3:26:29.620]  mind that you're being watched like when you do yoga via the Xbox and stuff like
[3:26:29.620 --> 3:26:34.460]  that or like your webcam photos or go into somebody at the NSA yeah I guess
[3:26:34.460 --> 3:26:38.620]  it's kind of sketchy I think it's really scary and I think it's something that's
[3:26:38.620 --> 3:26:41.900]  really real that we kind of all need to think about everyday lives and we're so
[3:26:41.900 --> 3:26:46.180]  willing to offer up all the information I actually am a marketer by trade so I
[3:26:46.180 --> 3:26:51.340]  understand how how much we rely on that sort of information so it's I think it's
[3:26:51.340 --> 3:26:56.540]  really delicate balance I'm the fact that the government is surveilling and
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:27:00.380]  that they are going to be monitoring electronic transmissions I mean you know
[3:27:00.380 --> 3:27:03.780]  that's something that we should be aware of or we're naive to you guys catch
[3:27:03.780 --> 3:27:11.100]  Edward Snowden at all yeah all right how do you feel about the way that
[3:27:11.100 --> 3:27:15.540]  WikiLeaks gets whistleblowers information out there versus how Snowden's
[3:27:15.540 --> 3:27:20.540]  information is being given to the public what is how I feel about the
[3:27:20.540 --> 3:27:24.220]  difference between how we click dead and how he did yeah all at once versus
[3:27:24.220 --> 3:27:29.340]  slow drips every couple of months it seems a little more responsible to do
[3:27:29.340 --> 3:27:34.900]  it the way Snowden's doing it I think if you're gonna give it out give it out
[3:27:34.900 --> 3:27:38.620]  it's gonna take only look how long it took to go through the WikiLeaks right
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:43.060]  I think we're still going through the WikiLeaks stuff right so someone who
[3:27:43.060 --> 3:27:46.100]  actually used to work for Homeland Security I did a long time ago
[3:27:46.100 --> 3:27:52.460]  information if you just throw it out there then let people decipher to bite
[3:27:52.460 --> 3:27:56.700]  what they want and kind of do it properly instead of filtering it through
[3:27:56.700 --> 3:28:02.940]  giving time to people to change the message so to speak as a you know sort
[3:28:02.940 --> 3:28:07.500]  of a population we have a really short attention span and a fairly short memory
[3:28:07.500 --> 3:28:12.780]  for even major events I was talking to someone who worked on the legal team
[3:28:12.780 --> 3:28:18.140]  when the Enron affair was happening and really like things like that just
[3:28:18.140 --> 3:28:21.860]  disappear from the radar people forget really sort of pivotal important things
[3:28:21.860 --> 3:28:28.580]  so the more persistence and sort of incremental growth of information he
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:31.900]  can provide the better I think I think it's just the beginning I think it was
[3:28:31.900 --> 3:28:37.820]  just the the opening of things that are to come as long as Americans continue
[3:28:37.820 --> 3:28:41.500]  to use tools that are developed by advertisers then we can't expect to have
[3:28:41.500 --> 3:28:45.020]  privacy right so Google Chrome is the number one browser Google's an
[3:28:45.020 --> 3:28:48.380]  advertising company do you think we're all just kind of being conditioned to
[3:28:48.380 --> 3:28:54.620]  just be okay with it and accept it no I mean you have an option to either use
[3:28:54.620 --> 3:28:59.500]  it or not use it and use it you're it's you're putting yourself up at risk but
[3:28:59.500 --> 3:29:02.740]  what about all the people walking around with the Google Glasses on I think
[3:29:02.740 --> 3:29:09.140]  those are silly so can't opt out of that no you can't or just run away I guess I
[3:29:09.140 --> 3:29:12.900]  feel like maybe people are a little bit desensitized now like it seems that
[3:29:12.900 --> 3:29:17.540]  people should be outraged but they're kind of like yeah yeah I agree on it's
[3:29:17.540 --> 3:29:21.420]  a unfortunately evolution of this technology that we don't have control we
[3:29:21.420 --> 3:29:27.140]  did not know where it was going to go everyone's filming you everywhere you
[3:29:27.140 --> 3:29:31.420]  can't opt out anymore well it seems like this is just the beginning of what
[3:29:31.420 --> 3:29:34.700]  we've heard from Snowden a lot of people agree with the way that it's being
[3:29:34.700 --> 3:29:37.820]  slowly leaked out it keeps it in the news but it's also a little bit more
[3:29:37.820 --> 3:29:41.300]  responsible in the name of national security so people sort of understand
[3:29:41.300 --> 3:29:45.260]  that but it also seems like a lot of people really desensitized five years
[3:29:45.260 --> 3:29:48.900]  ago if you told them that they were being spied on through their webcam or via
[3:29:48.900 --> 3:29:55.700]  their telephone we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[3:29:55.700 --> 3:30:17.060]  GCN radio network
