[06:11.160 --> 06:15.440]  order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.280]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[06:19.280 --> 06:24.520]  people. Well Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election. If you
[06:24.520 --> 06:28.880]  have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[06:28.880 --> 06:34.120]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:34.120 --> 06:40.600]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[06:40.600 --> 06:47.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[07:59.320 --> 08:05.440]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.440 --> 08:10.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:15.240 --> 08:18.600]  I was on
[08:21.160 --> 08:28.600]  with man Cal Muller this morning for about ten minutes and he brings me up
[08:28.600 --> 08:32.320]  on the show and he sure it's giggling about how I talk about imaginary blimps
[08:32.320 --> 08:35.800]  a hundred thousand feet in the air and so I started I had a feeling he was gonna
[08:35.800 --> 08:39.080]  do that because he did last time I was on about a month ago so I said oh here's
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.120]  the LA Times headline here's an AP headline I mean can't you just Google
[08:43.120 --> 08:49.240]  this can't you just understand there are these surveillance blimps and you know
[08:49.240 --> 08:51.760]  I'm not bashing the guy because I know that's his shtick and he's got to act
[08:51.760 --> 08:58.680]  like he's mainstream and you know he claims he's anti-New World Order but I
[08:58.680 --> 09:04.840]  was just on there with him and his co-host laughing at me and then I read
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.120]  the New York Times headline about how the house has completely passed the
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.560]  force compulsory service act known as the give act the Senate passed it and had
[09:15.560 --> 09:19.520]  a cloture vote meaning they're not gonna have any more debate on it and so now
[09:19.520 --> 09:23.200]  they've just got to get together basically and have a full vote with and
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.560]  then pass it out of the house and it passed by 74 to 14 with a few
[09:27.560 --> 09:34.120]  abstentions people that didn't vote so it passed with huge numbers 321 to 105
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.560]  last Thursday we wrote stories about it at prisonplanet.com link to the bill
[09:39.560 --> 09:46.640]  link to the subsections where it says mandatory national service and the
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.280]  other host his co-host just said he googled it and said no that's a bill
[09:50.280 --> 09:53.880]  about taxes Charles Schumer and I said no it's not now here's the New York
[09:53.880 --> 10:00.120]  Times national service core bill clear Senate hurdle and I said here's the
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.440]  Associated Press Senate looks into expanding AmeriCorps and then here's
[10:05.440 --> 10:09.640]  the United States Senate roll call vote I mean you can go to senate.gov
[10:09.640 --> 10:18.160]  forward slash legislative and go to the vote on the bill on the 111th
[10:18.160 --> 10:24.760]  Congress first session but I mean that's the level of denial going on that I
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.360]  then this happens on lots of quote mainstream radio shows I go on where it
[10:30.360 --> 10:33.720]  won't matter if I've got mainstream news articles about a building FEMA camps
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.000]  from the Houston Chronicle and Associated Press it doesn't matter if I get
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.200]  the secret Mayak report with the phone numbers of the state police and the
[10:42.200 --> 10:45.600]  state police confirm that they put the report out it doesn't matter even when
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.040]  it's in the Associated Press afterwards and all over TV and all over CNN and
[10:50.040 --> 11:00.800]  Fox still people say I made it up it's not real and just the level of denial
[11:00.800 --> 11:08.240]  that we deal with here is staggering and I don't mind people saying I'm making
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.960]  stuff up around a liar because it doesn't bother me to be attacked but it
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.800]  upsets me for their mindset and even people quote me alternative media
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.680]  because there is just such a lack of research and information and we're
[11:22.680 --> 11:27.520]  always light years ahead of basically everybody and that isn't very good
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.800]  because we're not we're not you know perfect I have a lot of shortcomings
[11:32.800 --> 11:43.120]  and we miss a lot of things it's just the level of denial is staggering and
[11:43.120 --> 11:46.080]  the level of disinformation in the alternative media you know the mainstream
[11:46.080 --> 11:52.360]  media spends things and lies and puts out disinformation or they lie by
[11:52.360 --> 11:55.600]  omission but at the same time just because we have to watch the mainstream
[11:55.600 --> 12:00.280]  media you also have to take alternative media with a grain of salt and learn how
[12:00.280 --> 12:05.400]  to check things out for yourself learn how to look things up for yourself I
[12:05.400 --> 12:14.640]  mean I'm here talking about Pentagon directive that sets up
[12:15.280 --> 12:20.520]  force national service we have a link to it Paul Watson has done a masterpiece I
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.760]  asked him to do a master article and by a master article some you know something
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.520]  was encyclopedic something that had every bit of information every facet
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.280]  every angle of the police state New World Order takeover in it dealing with
[12:35.280 --> 12:39.760]  the National Compulsory Service bills moving through the House and Senate on
[12:39.760 --> 12:45.080]  the verge of being law and he did that this is just an unbelievably powerful
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.960]  article it's up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com Senate rubber stamps
[12:49.960 --> 12:58.080]  national enslavement bill and every claim we make is a link directly to the
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.520]  legislation or mainstream news every claim we make so prepare yourselves I'm
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.960]  going to read this now on air into the public record
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.880]  Senate rubber stamps national enslavement bill Paul Joseph Watson March 24th
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.240]  09 it's now the 25th the Senate last night rubber stamped a nightmare
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.800]  domestic draft bill that Legislature mandatory national service and creates a
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.120]  quote army of at least seven million civilian enforcers working at the behest
[13:28.120 --> 13:31.280]  she had been saying a million that's what they said a few years ago no now at
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.960]  seven million in the legislation to start see it's always worse than we first
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.560]  have from the info it's always worse people uses of exaggerating no it's far
[13:41.560 --> 13:47.600]  worse the Senate last night rubber stamped a nightmare domestic draft bill
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.280]  that Legislature mandatory national service it creates an army of at least
[13:51.280 --> 13:55.720]  seven million enforcers working at the behest of the government while also
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.320]  containing language that threatens to ban free speech and the right to
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.800]  protest last week were reported on the House passage of the generations
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.480]  invigorating volunteerism and education act known as the give act which was
[14:09.480 --> 14:21.280]  carried with a 321 105 margin vote it passed a passage contained in 6104 of
[14:21.280 --> 14:26.640]  the original House version entitled duties in subsection b6 states that a
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.760]  commission will be set up to investigate whether a workable fair and
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.600]  reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be
[14:36.600 --> 14:39.680]  developed and they're already telling public school kids they have to do this
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.800]  now but then 18 to 25 you're actually three months a year in military training
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.680]  the language has been dropped out of the version passed by the Senate but they
[14:48.680 --> 14:54.920]  added another clause however section 120 of the bill discusses the youth
[14:54.920 --> 14:59.800]  engagement zone program and states that serving learning service learning that's
[14:59.800 --> 15:05.320]  reeducation camp literally will be a mandatory part of the curriculum in all
[15:05.320 --> 15:12.120]  of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency notice that they
[15:12.120 --> 15:15.000]  call it local education agency but this is a federal law it's really federal
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.240]  agency locally this part remains in the version passed by the Senate roles which
[15:21.240 --> 15:26.040]  will be staffed by members of the programs labeled required national
[15:26.040 --> 15:31.040]  service corps that's in the bill that's in the current bill required national
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.960]  service corps what's that's required national service sitting in required
[15:35.960 --> 15:41.960]  required required required national service corps including criminal
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.600]  justice environmental stewardship and public safety so let me translate that
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.080]  that's what the philadelphia daily news and ap reported in two thousand two
[15:50.080 --> 15:57.080]  two thousand three bullies articles they already had secure corps at a subset of
[15:57.080 --> 16:02.920]  americor and it said warrant apprehension training with m16's fugitive
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.920]  apprehension checkpoints cordon operations and then now all over the
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.680]  country they're turning public schools into military camps run by the army and
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.440]  the marines and then they're saying public school children have to go to at
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.000]  the district i mean you you cannot make this up that's a land of journal
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.200]  constitution i mean it's everywhere it's happening in illinois texas california
[16:24.200 --> 16:31.800]  georgia florida just so you know in communist russia nazi germany that's
[16:31.800 --> 16:39.040]  what the schools were military camps so let me translate that when it says
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.280]  including criminal justice mandatory service of criminal justice that means
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.480]  being trained to be little devil dogs little little enforcers environmental
[16:46.480 --> 16:51.760]  enforcement that's land grabbing and knocking on doors and pushing propaganda
[16:51.760 --> 16:57.960]  fire rescue and emergency personnel and other individuals with backgrounds in
[16:57.960 --> 17:01.440]  disaster preparedness relief and recovery the mill was rubber stamped by
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.680]  the senate last night seventy four to fourteen motion and what was described
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.080]  as a procedural vote a move that creates an army dispersed to help with
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.920]  educations as a quote health services and the environment health services
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.640]  means force and force injections which would vastly enlarge the notion of
[17:19.640 --> 17:24.400]  community organizing and allow a senator barbara makulsky democrat of
[17:24.400 --> 17:29.680]  maryland said tonight for about seven million people to be engaged in such
[17:29.680 --> 17:35.880]  work reports the new york times all every claim we make has links the senate

[27:37.560 --> 27:41.560]  kind military style public high school then you read down

[27:52.120 --> 27:55.000]  the marine corps institute will be the first of its kind in georgia and joins
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.520]  an expanding network of schools nationwide the first public military
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.360]  academy opened in richmond virginia in 1980 and more than a dozen now exist in
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.120]  places from new york to wisconsin now it's over a hundred
[28:06.120 --> 28:10.440]  now they passed a law what three years ago to allow recruiting in the schools
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.800]  and it said in the bill and they do it now well they'll have access at lunch in
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.640]  the playground in middle school and high school
[28:17.640 --> 28:21.160]  and it came out in houston and denver in new york
[28:21.160 --> 28:23.640]  because the summer kids were smart enough to record it their parents will tell
[28:23.640 --> 28:28.520]  them to they go listen to me buddy you sign these documents to go to the
[28:28.520 --> 28:32.760]  military you're going to prison this is an order from the president

[28:36.120 --> 28:39.480]  that in the case of houston it was the army or you're going to prison and then
[28:39.480 --> 28:41.320]  they said oh we'll investigate these guys
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.600]  in these cities doing this and they actually promoted the people that got
[28:44.600 --> 28:48.040]  caught because that's their policy is to threaten them
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.320]  with going to prison if they don't sign up so you send your children to a
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.400]  government reeducation camp to be terrorized by troops that threaten
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.080]  them to join the military although be arrested
[28:59.080 --> 29:01.560]  that's why they're setting up portable buildings outside all the schools with

[35:18.200 --> 35:22.200]  in january we also reported on the introduction by the defense department
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.480]  of the civilian expeditionary workforce that will see american civilians
[35:25.480 --> 35:28.680]  trained and equipped to deploy overseas and domestically in support of
[35:28.680 --> 35:32.680]  worldwide military missions the do d report states management retains the
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.320]  authority to direct and assign civilian employees
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.720]  either voluntarily or involuntary or on an unexpected basis to accomplish the
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.480]  do d mission through the civilian expeditionary workforce program
[35:43.480 --> 35:47.640]  is restricted do d similar programs have already been established in public
[35:47.640 --> 35:50.920]  sector workers remember about four years ago they were talking about
[35:50.920 --> 35:55.000]  drafting professionals we're only going to draft
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.160]  doctors to make them join the military and nurses and firemen
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.920]  see the the pentagon says they want this one such program
[36:02.920 --> 36:05.960]  has seen hundreds of police firefighters paramedics and utility workers
[36:05.960 --> 36:09.240]  recently trained and dispatched as terrorism liaison officers in
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.160]  colorado arizona california to watch for suspicious activity in truck drivers
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.520]  too i would add 500 000 of them which is later fed into secret government
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.120]  databases similar initiatives have been introduced into other western
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.080]  countries including recently in the uk with the announcement
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.520]  that mi-5 is currently training up to 60 000
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.760]  uk citizens as part of a civilian network of terrorism spotters according to
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.520]  prime minister gordon brown and home secretary
[36:34.520 --> 36:38.040]  jaqueen smith and in the training there and in the u.s.
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.520]  they say that carpet cleaners plumbers when they're in your house spy on you
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.120]  in addition obama's chief of staff rama manual publicly stated his intention to
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.400]  help create universal civilian defense training
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.800]  in a book he wrote and on c span in 2006 2007
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.560]  in an interview with ben smith of the new york daily news a manual
[36:59.560 --> 37:02.920]  outline the agenda for the military style training essentially a domestic
[37:02.920 --> 37:06.680]  draft aimed at preparing americans for a chemical or biological terror attack
[37:06.680 --> 37:10.120]  asked by smith about the universal service plan and whether people would
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.880]  have to live in military barracks a manual laugh before responding
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.880]  we're going to have universal civil defense training somewhere between the
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.040]  ages of 1825 you will do three months of training
[37:22.040 --> 37:24.920]  but there can be nothing wrong with all americans
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.800]  having a joint similar experience of what we call civil defense training or
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.800]  civil service in the service of the country in preparation
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.240]  which we all give people a sense of what it means to be an american
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.960]  it will be a common experience and will be prepared god forbid god forbid this
[37:43.960 --> 37:46.600]  is a quote that there is a chemical hit another terrorist
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.920]  attack or natural disaster becoming more frequent
[37:48.920 --> 37:52.680]  there'll be a body of citizens who are ready and capable and trained
[37:52.680 --> 37:55.960]  that's all you have to think about set a manual before
[37:55.960 --> 38:03.480]  smugly declaring we're all here for you okay it's a circle of love
[38:03.480 --> 38:06.440]  ask if the training would be military style with people wearing uniforms
[38:06.440 --> 38:10.760]  manual stated if you're worried about are you going to have to do 50 jumping
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.120]  jacks the answer is yes adding that the service could be done
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.160]  throughout the state national guard that's what it is
[38:17.160 --> 38:19.960]  see they're introducing it like soup kitchens and things when you read all
[38:19.960 --> 38:22.680]  the bills and what they're doing it's military
[38:22.680 --> 38:26.200]  and then there's environmental title tail cores and forced inoculation cores
[38:26.200 --> 38:28.760]  that's all there
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.840]  it goes on ask if the training would be military style of people wearing
[38:36.840 --> 38:39.800]  uniforms manual said if you're worried about are you going to have to do 50
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.520]  jumping jacks the answer is yes adding that the service
[38:42.520 --> 38:45.560]  could be done through state national guard
[38:45.560 --> 38:48.440]  shockingly the give legislation also contains language
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.080]  that could completely demolish the first amendment the 12th amendment to the
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.000]  act states amendments to prohibit organizations from attempting to influence
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.720]  legislation organizer engage in protest
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.800]  petitions boycotts or strikes and assist promoter deter union organizing
[39:03.800 --> 39:07.640]  so see they force you in a national service then you have no first amendment
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.240]  as gary wood writes those in support of this legislation will argue this
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.000]  amendment is limited in scope and is not meant to interfere with the rights of
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.560]  citizens to protest petition boycott or strike
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.480]  in resistance to government proposed laws however the people associated
[39:23.480 --> 39:26.440]  through the service under the give act are considered volunteers
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.200]  still free citizens yet it will be unlawful for them to take part in the
[39:30.200 --> 39:33.400]  protest against any legislation this is as close
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.320]  to the sedition act of violation of the first amendment writes
[39:37.320 --> 39:40.840]  as have been proposed in recent history a basic right
[39:40.840 --> 39:44.520]  as part of our natural and amable rights is to resist government
[39:44.520 --> 39:48.360]  our founders only knew it was the right but it was a responsibility legislation
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.040]  begins to break that down significantly
[39:52.040 --> 39:55.880]  there's about obama's plans to create involuntary servitude and domestic spy
[39:55.880 --> 40:00.200]  squads were first stoked in july of 2008 when obama told a rally in colorado
[40:00.200 --> 40:03.320]  springs the real seat of government the u.s by the way
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.480]  north com space command we cannot continue to rely on our military in order
[40:07.480 --> 40:09.720]  to achieve the national security objectives we set
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.240]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[40:13.240 --> 40:17.480]  just as strong just as well funded despite denials that obama plans to
[40:17.480 --> 40:20.040]  institute a mandatory program of national service
[40:20.040 --> 40:23.720]  his original change dot gov website stated that americans would be required
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.480]  to complete 50 hours of community service in the middle school and high
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.560]  school 100 hours of community service in every college year
[40:31.560 --> 40:35.720]  the text was only later changed to state that americans would be encouraged
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.080]  undertake such programs numerous other national service bills have been
[40:39.080 --> 40:42.360]  introduced which target everyone from school children to the elderly
[40:42.360 --> 40:46.280]  they include the service for all ages initiative the summers
[40:46.280 --> 40:50.360]  of service act the semester of service stack the on-course service
[40:50.360 --> 40:53.560]  stack and the action act
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.880]  regarding the give act the bills opponents and there only a few in
[40:57.880 --> 41:01.080]  congress say it would cram ideology down the throats of young volunteers
[41:01.080 --> 41:04.440]  that's where it's federal total federalization of what's left in the
[41:04.440 --> 41:07.160]  school sovereignty many of whom could be forced into
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.840]  service since the bill creates a congressional commission on civic
[41:10.840 --> 41:14.680]  service we can
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.800]  tribute our time and money under no government coercion
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.080]  or scale the rest of the world doesn't emulate
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.520]  and probably can't imagine again we contribute our time and money under no
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.040]  government coercion on a scale that the rest of the world doesn't even
[41:28.040 --> 41:33.560]  emulate and probably can't imagine said luke she hand contributing editor to
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.720]  the family security foundation the idea that government
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.320]  should order its people to perform acts of charity is contrary to the idea of
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.440]  charity well it's not charities government-directed propaganda
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.520]  and it removes the responsibility for charity from the people of the
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.680]  government destroying private initiative
[41:50.680 --> 41:52.760]  lee karry of the conservative american thinker
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.160]  warns that obama's agenda is to tap into the already active volunteerism
[41:57.160 --> 42:00.200]  of millions of americans and recruit them to become cogs
[42:00.200 --> 42:04.680]  in a gigantic government machine grinding out his social re-engineering
[42:04.680 --> 42:10.120]  agenda the passes of such shocking legislation
[42:10.120 --> 42:13.000]  with barely a whimper from the political activist groups
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.760]  goes to show how well the corporate media has performed its camouflaging
[42:16.760 --> 42:20.040]  legislation with flowery characterizations of helpful
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.280]  volunteerism but in reality the bill creates the pretext for mandatory
[42:24.280 --> 42:27.640]  national service and the creation of a multi-million man
[42:27.640 --> 42:31.560]  domestic civilian defense unit who will be tasked with spying on their fellow
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.840]  americans under the justification of protecting the country from
[42:34.840 --> 42:38.680]  terrorism and under that he has some recent articles
[42:38.680 --> 42:42.200]  that nexus in house passes mandatory national service bill
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.240]  senate to push carbon tax enslavement bill democrats introduce public

[42:55.240 --> 43:01.000]  and as lengthy and detailed as that article is it doesn't scratch one
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.680]  tenth of the open statements and admissions

[46:09.560 --> 46:13.480]  a massive construction operation has been underway major amounts of earth
[46:13.480 --> 46:16.120]  have been excavated you'll see the photos
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.240]  out of about nine to ten feet deep and 600 to a thousand feet wide there is
[46:21.240 --> 46:23.480]  multiple locations on the property like this
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.560]  from the satellite view that appears to be more sections that have been
[46:27.560 --> 46:33.000]  covered with the concrete lids and backfilled to look as if nothing is
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.960]  there abc
[46:35.960 --> 46:40.600]  rock is put in place under the burial vaults for good drainage and soil
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.400]  bedding this will this will help not contaminating
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.800]  groundwater sources for decomposition of human bodies remember all the fema
[46:49.800 --> 46:55.960]  coffins in georgia and colorada remember the report
[46:55.960 --> 46:59.640]  and we went over from the daily newscaster with the county official
[46:59.640 --> 47:03.240]  out of indiana insider sourceville's fema and dhs preparing for mass graves
[47:03.240 --> 47:06.760]  and marshal law near chicago
[47:08.120 --> 47:12.600]  it goes on here the cleanliness of the heavy equipment operation in the
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.280]  large perfect cuts of earth is impressive these massive concrete boxes
[47:18.280 --> 47:21.960]  are transported from a nearby storage yard on various privately owned
[47:21.960 --> 47:26.520]  flatbed semi trucks and unloaded and put into place a half mile away from the
[47:26.520 --> 47:31.560]  actual grave site they are installed tight together
[47:31.560 --> 47:35.480]  side by side with no space in between seeing the regular graves have the
[47:35.480 --> 47:41.400]  space
[47:41.640 --> 47:44.360]  an interview was conducted between my friend and a truck driver involved in
[47:44.360 --> 47:46.840]  this operation after beating around the bush for 10 minutes the driver
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.600]  admitted i got paid a whole lot of money to speak good english
[47:50.600 --> 47:54.120]  take it for what it's worth but that sounds suspect the truck driver also
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.120]  admitted each burial vault holds four caskets
[47:58.120 --> 48:02.520]  i took note that the caskets were not used you could fit
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.160]  40 bodies or more in each one so if these were to hold
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.960]  four troops each and a truck driver did not know
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.400]  what he was talking about then this would mean there are plans
[48:15.400 --> 48:21.560]  in advance for 4 000 u.s soldiers deaths that sounds like pakistan
[48:21.560 --> 48:25.400]  if these are not if these do not contain caskets and only bodies
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.800]  are inserted there could be room for 40 000
[48:29.800 --> 48:34.360]  civilian bodies editors note on february 11 2009 dh williams writer for the
[48:34.360 --> 48:37.880]  daily newscast reported on the revelations of an
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.400]  indiana county municipal official in the vicinity of chicago we
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.800]  played the interview with who revealed how fema and dhs were
[48:45.800 --> 48:48.760]  attempting to prepare county officials to prepare a
[48:48.760 --> 48:53.080]  hazard mitigation plan to deal with floods fires highway winds and tornadoes
[48:53.080 --> 48:58.920]  fema inquired if and where mass graves could be placed in the county and would
[48:58.920 --> 49:02.520]  they accept bodies from elsewhere writes williams
[49:02.520 --> 49:09.480]  yeah and um
[49:09.480 --> 49:14.440]  so if there were to hold four trips each and the truck driver
[49:14.440 --> 49:17.800]  didn't know what he was talking about and this would mean that there are plans
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.960]  in advance over 4 000 dead u.s troops or 40 000
[49:21.960 --> 49:28.440]  dead civilian bodies mm okay so i babbled through that article there you
[49:28.440 --> 49:31.240]  have it and again we sent the photos in two different
[49:31.240 --> 49:34.680]  groups kurt's going to post more photos and we have that satellite photo it
[49:34.680 --> 49:38.360]  needs to be posted or kurt you can just go up to
[49:38.360 --> 49:44.280]  google earth and get another photo one of the current one of
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.880]  the memorial national memorial cemetery of arizona
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.240]  but they're doing this secretly at night they're covering
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.800]  the grave vaults up with a thin layer of soil
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.120]  and they're stacking the vaults side by side snuggling up against each other
[50:02.120 --> 50:05.000]  that's not how regular graves are prepared
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.400]  there's smaller vaults for an individual person and there's generally about
[50:09.400 --> 50:14.760]  four or five feet on either side for the north south east and west so these
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.240]  this is this is definitely mass graves this is definitely either four troops
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.720]  or u.s citizens or both and they're building these suckers again
[50:23.720 --> 50:26.680]  i keep mentioning on air and i have been so busy on time to pull it up because
[50:26.680 --> 50:29.640]  i've done searches and can't find it but i know our listeners can maybe it's been
[50:29.640 --> 50:33.800]  posted in the prison planet forum but i remembered in 2002
[50:33.800 --> 50:40.440]  headline rocky mountain news governor says state prepared with mass graves and
[50:40.440 --> 50:45.240]  incinerators and it said they could burn i think it was 15 000 bodies an hour or
[50:45.240 --> 50:48.200]  was it a day we need that article that's a key
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.040]  article i know i read it on air probably 10 times when it came out
[50:52.040 --> 50:55.240]  we'll integrate this all together we'll beef up this article that this listener
[50:55.240 --> 50:57.720]  sent us we've got him coming on in a couple hours

[55:25.560 --> 55:28.680]  i guess about seven years ago people didn't believe us now it's big news and
[55:28.680 --> 55:31.240]  folks go out and videotape it and talk to the local
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.680]  caretakers and you know you can read the company name and it's a company that
[55:34.680 --> 55:39.160]  sells coffin liners and they are putting these in all over

[55:48.200 --> 55:53.240]  fight them i've tried to do the best job i can

[55:57.160 --> 56:01.400]  like so many people in our movement do it it's just
[56:01.400 --> 56:04.520]  it's just unbelievable
[56:06.200 --> 56:09.960]  because the time is so short with all of this we don't have any time
[56:09.960 --> 56:13.560]  to screw around but the story is up on info wars dot com military industrial
[56:13.560 --> 56:17.800]  complex prepares mass graves for us citizens with the photos and
[56:17.800 --> 56:22.200]  everything and uh
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.680]  you know we have Dr. Stan Monti come up in about four minutes in fact go ahead and
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.120]  get him online john please and uh then we've got uh russ
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.400]  baker family of secrets book on bush he was here in town
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.400]  covered by c span and i'm being studio with us reportedly
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.640]  uh and uh then we have shepherd coming on who took the photos the mass graves
[56:39.640 --> 56:42.440]  we've called the cemetery the director is not there we keep calling back to see
[56:42.440 --> 56:48.600]  when he gets in webster tarpoli is also on the show today
[56:50.520 --> 56:54.840]  so it is definitely getting crazy this is a wicked murderous criminal
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.520]  illegitimate government and if we don't wake up to that and get the word out
[56:58.520 --> 57:01.160]  that they're taking over through martial law
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.360]  quietly federalizing everything and setting up national conscription for
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.200]  basically everybody this isn't just a draft this is slavery
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.400]  and the old soviet union and each germany in places in china
[57:13.400 --> 57:16.760]  they would just tell people you know okay ten hours a week you got to show up
[57:16.760 --> 57:20.920]  and dig ditches or you got to show up work in the fields and
[57:20.920 --> 57:25.160]  on top of whatever else you do and stalin in ukraine
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.480]  and in other areas for several decades wouldn't even let people have their own
[57:29.480 --> 57:33.400]  gardens they wouldn't even let them keep an acre of their own land
[57:33.400 --> 57:36.760]  and tens of millions starved and finally when stalin died they started
[57:36.760 --> 57:39.800]  letting them have these little uh actually quarter acres they have a
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.520]  name sultan eats and writes about them uh and those little plots produce most
[57:44.520 --> 57:49.080]  of the country's food because the big uh communal farms didn't work and fell
[57:49.080 --> 57:52.600]  apart see it's all about institutionalizing it's
[57:52.600 --> 57:54.600]  getting control of us getting us in the system
[57:54.600 --> 57:59.160]  so we're dependent on the state and i just hope everybody will realize that's
[57:59.160 --> 58:03.000]  obama's agenda that's the elite's agenda that's the republicans agenda as well
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.760]  and the obama deception shatters that left-right paradigm and i'm very excited

[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:43.000]  and what's your target in my other big stacks of news
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.640]  sticklets anticipates new world order
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:52.840]  that's right another new world order headline
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:56.520]  got a homeland security conference going on in san antonio texas lots of
[1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:59.160]  brainwashing the police and military against the people
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.440]  other headline here can private security guards act as cops that's exactly
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:07.320]  what they may soon be doing on the far side this is in chicago's society
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:10.360]  collapses by design look at mexico collapsing as a drug
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:14.600]  prohibition i was listening to bbc driving home last night like
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:18.440]  11 and uh they had a mexican government official
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:22.600]  ongoing isn't it american guns that are causing all the problems in mexico
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:26.680]  don't you need tighter gun restrictions in the united states
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:32.280]  and uh the mexican official he said uh no it's the drug prohibition
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:35.640]  that's what's causing all of this just like prohibition the united states
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:40.440]  caused all the collapse of society with alcohol
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:44.040]  and the bbc said thank you very much for that into the interview
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:46.600]  um china calls for new global currency that's
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:52.440]  obama got asked about that last night and kind of went sideways on it
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:56.200]  here's an interesting technology report out of the wall street journal
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:00.840]  behold the appearance of the invisible cloak
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.920]  scientists find new ways to bend radio and light waves making objects invisible
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:08.600]  to radar and the naked eye yeah they've had this for more than a decade and i
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:10.840]  tell people about it i mean i've seen it on discovery channel
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:14.520]  they have tanks that have a plastic video skin
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:18.280]  then has cameras all over it to project you know to pick up what's on the other
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:21.800]  side of the tank and then it's like a chameleon skin and so
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:25.240]  it looks like the movie predator you know where the alien like shimmers
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.080]  that's all you can see it's like looking through an inch of
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:34.120]  water it's like a phantom and uh so that's what they
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:38.040]  already have so that's some of what's coming up by the way
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:41.160]  there's another wall street journal article i'll get to later with dr
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:44.280]  stan montave when we come back from the break
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:46.840]  obama has announced what we knew he was going to announce
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:54.840]  hundreds of new taxes carbon taxes new regulatory taxes
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:58.600]  unfunded mandates with the states passing taxes they pass 84 new taxes in
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:01.640]  new york state alone but the but they're saying they're going to
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:06.920]  basically pull out hundreds of exemptions your mortgage exemption
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:11.320]  you name it out of the internal revenue code uh capital improvements like if i
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.240]  buy a video camera oh sorry you can't write that off or
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:18.840]  you can't write but half of it off so you literally can't operate and have a
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:22.120]  business uh in the wall street journal reports
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:26.440]  hundreds of new taxes within the code but you know the headlines are
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:31.160]  obama to fix the half a million page or it's actually 600 something thousand
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:35.320]  page internal revenue code and then you read deeper into the article
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:39.800]  with new taxes and closing loopholes
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:43.320]  because if you look at the oe cd that really manages the global government
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:48.120]  taxation system to the central banks they call the united states a tax avoidance
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:51.640]  haven and uh the few other countries that have
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:55.000]  taxes where you're only paid about you know 40 federal
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:58.440]  because you pay on average about 30 percent and you've got the 10 percent or
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:02.040]  so with social security and medicare and medicaid and all the or if you're an
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  employer then you got to match that so you're paying even more
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:09.880]  oh yeah if you're paying your employee 15 bucks an hour the employer is having
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:13.560]  to slap another five bucks on average on there and that's in states like texas
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:16.840]  that don't have that bad of a tax code most other states slap all these other
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:21.080]  state taxes on and texas is now passing those feverishly
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:26.520]  so see um it's bad it's bad that's the type of stuff
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:29.800]  employers have to match the social security have to match it all
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:33.160]  and they're talking about increasing the social security taxes as well so
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:37.080]  enjoy that being taken out of your check oh it's only tax increases for people
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:42.440]  making 250 thousand dollars
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:47.480]  divided by two so it's 125 thousand dollars husband and wife well
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:50.520]  you're going to pay all the new taxes but actually it's on everybody that pays
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:53.560]  income tax so we'll cover that as well understand

[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:48.280]  the bankers are bankrupting the country right now bringing in world government
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:50.760]  openly
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:55.560]  and announcing a new bank of the world and a new
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:59.880]  super currency that the world bank and imf are already issuing
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:03.000]  backed up by taxpayer money it is just the greatest
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.120]  theft and fraud and scam ever seen they are openly putting military liaison
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:10.920]  officers in every major police department even small departments they are
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:13.480]  openly using the military at checkpoints all over the country
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:17.960]  they are openly telling police agencies get ready for martial law it's openly
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.600]  in the john warren defense authorization act pdd-51
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:27.000]  it's openly in public pentagon directives and the army war college
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.240]  the phoenix newspaper i mean it's just everywhere the total nightmare
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.080]  dr stamonteef after four plus decades fighting the globalist
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:39.160]  as they built this architecture the u.s was a big target to take down
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.880]  we i believe are now at the flashpoint they are preparing to go
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:49.080]  red or go hot on us and uh... this is the moment of truth in the next uh...
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:52.680]  twelve to eighteen months do you concur
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:56.760]  we agree i think that uh... but we have the option you know we have the
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:00.120]  opportunity to reach people now that we never had before
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:03.320]  and i think there are more people out there listening than ever before
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:06.360]  because they know something's wrong they're looking for answers and
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:11.880]  and you've got them specifically boil it down the globalist from their own
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.240]  documents because you're a stickler on that master plan what they're doing
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:19.160]  with the worldwide economy how you see this breaking
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:22.600]  down with the military and police because i'm talking to a most of them are
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:25.960]  awake so i think the globalist of miscalculated but but break down the
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:29.400]  big picture well basically what they've done is they've
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:33.720]  artificially created a financial crisis this whole thing is contrived
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:38.040]  from the get-go and uh... we get we spend hours just talking how they've done it
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:42.200]  but be that as it may the whole world economy is collapsing
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:45.800]  and this was done very intentionally because the only you can't have a
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.000]  a world government if you got a few countries out there
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.120]  that are independent and there were people could flee to
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:56.360]  uh... you know as they fled from Hitler's Germany you know during these
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:00.760]  before the second world war the jews could at least some of them could get out
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:05.240]  but there's no place to flee to today because every country in the world
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.320]  their economy is collapsing their banks are are by simply
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:13.560]  becoming insolvent and that's the could be the excuse that used
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:17.960]  to bring this new economic order this new world government
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:22.120]  and because you're i'm not sure if you well aware of the article he wrote on
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:25.800]  the 12th of january in the international herald
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:29.640]  tribune where he invested said that this is a wonderful opportunity this
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:33.080]  financial crisis and we have two options
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:37.000]  either a new international order or chaos
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.840]  well you know most people do anything rather than live in a society where
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:44.440]  there's anarchy and chaos and i would just add to bring this thing about
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.880]  i would just add he also said that word for word on msnbc
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:51.880]  and then all the people started were parroting the talking point
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:55.640]  all over the news go ahead and said me if i think the
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:59.160]  what they're going to do here in the united states is destroy the value of
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.680]  our currency and what they're doing there they're talking about
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:07.880]  you know it's a trillion trillion 1.25 a trillion dollars to begin to
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:11.320]  bail out the banks and buy up the toxic assets and
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:15.640]  then another 300 billion dollars here another 200 billion dollars there
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:20.120]  and the what they've admitted now is they've started to monetize
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:24.280]  our currency in other words they're simply going ahead and printing money
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:28.200]  there's a wonderful little article at the wall street journal i just found
[1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:31.640]  they're talking about how they don't have to borrow
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:33.800]  money they can just go ahead and print money
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.960]  and massively expand that monetary supply and then the article concludes
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:42.200]  with a statement and when the economy begins to turn to normal
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:46.600]  they hope that they're going to be able to get all this money out of the system
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.200]  and prevent runaway inflation they hope well
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:54.680]  i don't think they say that they hope but i really believe there are people
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:59.720]  who want to destroy our currency and they want to create this chaos
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:03.160]  because that is the vehicle by which they're going to bring about this one
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:06.760]  moral government and you know who they are but our listeners need to
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:11.160]  understand that the trial outer commission is probably the apex of
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.600]  of the one of the secret organizations that
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:18.120]  exist today or you can go up to their website but they're never going to tell
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:22.200]  you what they're really up to they're never going to tell you that they put
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:27.000]  of paroch obama in power i mean who were his largest contributors
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.320]  why what the second largest contributor was goldman sacks bank
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:36.280]  and of course uh they are head of that ceo of that is a
[1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:39.160]  the currently a member of the trial outer commission
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:43.400]  another large contributor was jp morgan chaste and they come from the
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:46.520]  you know from the trial outer commission city group
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:52.280]  and certainly the major financial houses in the united states
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:55.800]  are either currently members of the trial outer commission or they have been
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:59.960]  members of the trial outer commission and they are all dedicated to this idea
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:03.160]  maybe world government they are subversive group
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:07.640]  they want to destroy america but what is most significant is
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:11.320]  and what most people have missed when they discuss this
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:15.880]  is the powerful spiritual forces behind this whole movement
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:20.120]  and you get into the background of the control of finance and you find out that
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:24.280]  there many of these people are involved in the occult
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:27.480]  you can go up on the internet and for instance
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:31.960]  google jp morgan or go to one of world word searches and go to
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:37.560]  jp morgan and time it type in the occult and you'll find out that jp morgan
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.120]  certainly one of the most powerful forces in finance in the united states for
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:46.520]  you know three quarters of a century jp morgan was deeply involved in the
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:49.480]  occult many members of the rocker fellow
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:53.720]  family are involved in the occult and they finance hundreds of public occult
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:56.680]  organizations let me stop you there and read a very gold water
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:16:01.240]  quote that he wrote in his book it says the trial outer commission is the
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:05.960]  international and is intended to be the vehicle for
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:09.560]  multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.680]  seizing control of the political governments of the united states the
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:16.440]  trial outer commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.440]  control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:23.880]  intellectual and ecclesiastical absolutely and
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:27.320]  people don't understand that this is a subversive
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:32.200]  organization and the least eleven members of the trial outer commission
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:35.320]  hold key positions in the above administration
[1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:40.040]  from the national security council to the chief of security and it's a
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:42.520]  revolving it's a revolving door a bunch of
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.160]  trilateralists and cfr people left when bush went
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:48.920]  they went back into the think tanks to set policy and then those that have been
[1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:52.280]  on the bench uh... they went to uh... you know
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:55.240]  uh... into the administration so it's a revolving door
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:59.080]  well what most people would find it very difficult to believe
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:05.800]  as that since nineteen seventy six every president and or every vice
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:10.280]  president of the united states do you sometimes it's both sometimes just one
[1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:13.000]  have been members of the trial outer commission up to the current
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.440]  administration and now of course here we have nine people
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:20.760]  if that were true why hasn't somebody told the american people
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:23.160]  why doesn't somebody told the american people
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.280]  these people almost always control the state department
[1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:29.800]  i mean kerry clinton's husband was a member of the trial outer commission
[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:34.040]  and certainly you know they almost always control the department of defense
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:36.600]  they almost always control the world bank
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:41.080]  and the international monetary fund their people are always in key positions
[1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:44.680]  and there's only well at the present time there are only eighty seven
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:47.240]  american citizens who are member of the
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:51.000]  of the north american group of the trial outer commission did you see
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.160]  uh... james jones in the national security council
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:18:00.120]  on cfr website saying he takes his orders from henry kissinger
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:03.400]  absolutely doesn't matter what administration it is
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:07.400]  it it it the same puppet masters are behind the scenes
[1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:11.960]  and for james jones general jones is a member he's one of the eighty seven
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:15.720]  members of the north americans who are members of the north american
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:18.600]  group i mean how could that possibly be his assistant
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:22.760]  thomas dalvin donald flan is a member of the trial outer commission
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:27.640]  here's a small cabal and they are cabal and they worked secretly behind the
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:30.920]  scenes and they control the media i mean
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.160]  you find that the people who control the washington post and newsweek magazine
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.400]  their ceo mr graham is a member of the trial outer commission mr
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:43.000]  zuckerman who controls u.s. uh... u.s. news and world
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.160]  report you go down the list and because you can go to my website radio liberty
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:50.280]  dot com and we have all of this and i think in my
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.880]  uh... it'll be the february newsletter it's not up quite yet but it will be
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:57.080]  shortly but and certainly i know you have the
[1:18:57.080 --> 1:19:00.520]  information as well people have to understand these people control the
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:04.280]  media they control banking but they control the government
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:07.960]  and what barry goldwater warned back in nineteen seventy nine
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:11.560]  in his book with no apologies has come to pass
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.840]  and the reason people are concerned is because the media is controlled
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:18.840]  and that's why what you do and what the other people on alternative radio do is
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:21.560]  so widely important people have to understand
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:26.680]  there is this secret cabal but behind this are powerful spiritual forces
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:30.040]  and that has always been their goal and now doc leaves this movement has been
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:33.640]  around for three thousand years we've got to break
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:37.160]  the world government we've got a break when we come back i want to get into the
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:40.040]  occultic nature of this and even if you're an atheist
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:44.360]  if you just scientifically from a uh...
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:48.360]  view of anthropology or psychology study
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:52.360]  what the elite believe in they are satan worshipers but they believe satan is
[1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:55.560]  god lucifer the devil and they believe mass
[1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:58.920]  death is a sacrament to their god will come back with

[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.600]  all right dr. monteef you know you've written the brotherhood of darkness
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:43.400]  you know we understand they're setting up world government they've now revealed
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.200]  themselves it's out in the open but what makes them tick why are they eugenicist
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:52.840]  what do they believe in we have the 1996 un biological diversity assessment
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:57.880]  passed as world law by the un saying that they want to reduce population
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.960]  for gaya so i mean it's even in official
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:06.680]  government world government documents that that this is all about the occult
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.160]  well really one of the big problems today is most people do not understand
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:15.960]  of the gnostic faith but the gnostic faith is one of the most prominent basis
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:20.840]  of faith in america today and is based on the assumption that there are two gods
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:25.800]  are there's the inferior god that the christians worship and the real god is
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:29.720]  lucifer and he's the one of course that i will give you
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:33.320]  a total freedom i mean there he doesn't have any restrictions on you
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:39.000]  thou shall not do this thou shall not do that no lucifer gives you total freedom
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.280]  and not only that could give you great wealth and prosperity
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:45.960]  if you of course give your uh allegiance to him
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:50.440]  and it's incredible as it may be why there really are millions of people in
[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:55.480]  america who uh knowingly are involved in this many who do not know
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:57.800]  they're involved in it who are involved with the new
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:01.080]  age or many of the other alternative religions out there
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.000]  but they don't understand the basis of this faith is gnosticism now
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.440]  fortunately you can go up on the internet and you can begin reading up there
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:13.720]  about gnosticism and google we do have the the opportunity to have
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:17.240]  information that's never been readily available before
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:20.840]  if you go to the for instance the lucis trust website
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:27.720]  and i suggest you go to a search engine and google in lucis trust and then
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:30.840]  lucifer and you go to the website and they'll tell you that
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.360]  yes they they did come out of an organization known as the
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.280]  lucifer publishing house and then they have a link to
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:42.440]  an article that somebody had written about lucifer and of course you go there
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:45.640]  and they tell you that lucifer really is the pretty good guy you know he just
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:49.160]  got a bad rap but he came to earth to suffer
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.520]  for humanity and what we've really got to do is give our
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:55.640]  allegiance to him because he is the god that will give you
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:59.000]  so much and the trouble is alex that there are
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.200]  many people who actually you know come into
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:05.160]  allegiance with lucifer and they have prospered
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:09.080]  some of the vices people in america have
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:12.760]  given themselves to the dark side and they've amassed tremendous
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:16.200]  wealth and power and fame there's an organization
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.880]  it's in colorado it's called the bacher grantee and we have an article from
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:24.040]  west magazine that tells how you know henry kissinger used to go to the
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:27.560]  bacher grantee which is where the occultists and the witch
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:32.280]  doctors and the shaman's and the people involved with all of the occult
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:36.760]  and the dark art arts meet on a regular basis and according to the article in
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:41.000]  west magazine henry kissinger and robert mcdomarum
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.680]  would go there frequently and of course you have to remember robert mcdomarum
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:48.520]  with the boys who mad who sent our boys he was secretary of defense
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:53.240]  uh... under the kennedy and yeah that's more strong there and there's also of
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:57.480]  course um... tony blaren his wife mainstream news
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.360]  doing weird rituals they're obsessed with this
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:04.360]  right but this is what people find is so difficult to believe
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:08.360]  uh... because but the the common denominator behind all of these
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:12.360]  is these powerful spirits of forces these people who've given themselves to the
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:15.960]  dark side and you will find people within the rockerfella family
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:19.240]  for instance lorence rockerfella uh... you know
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:22.040]  actually finance the writings of barbara mark covered
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:26.440]  who's one of the one of the leading new ages the occultists of the united states
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.600]  who's actually talked and written about the necessity of killing
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:35.640]  a quarter of the world's population and as he says in the original
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:39.000]  manuscript of her book the revelation the book of new creation
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.600]  you know there's a quarter of the world population will evolve to a higher
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:45.960]  a step at the higher level of consciousness they're going to have to be
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:50.600]  removed and that is not your job my dear that is ours
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:55.800]  because we are the writers of the pale horse that was then financed by the
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:59.480]  pentagon and taught the special forces and they call it the earth first
[1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:02.920]  battalion that's kind of where the name earth first for the environmental group
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:07.480]  came from and but then publicly they tell folks oh we're atheist we're agnostic
[1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:09.880]  you're a cook if you believe in spirituality
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:13.400]  but then when you actually read their real writings and and what they really
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:17.640]  push they're totally into the occult absolutely
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:22.520]  steven rockerfella nelson rockerfella's son was one of the architects of the
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:26.920]  of the earth charter he ought to read that it means basically the mind comp
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:31.240]  for what's going on today i mean you mentioned the global biodiversity
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:34.760]  assessment is there it's in the 21 is there the earth
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:39.480]  charter is there by steven rockerfella tells us how we're going to have to
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:44.200]  redistribute the wealth of this country equity over the distribution of wealth
[1:29:44.200 --> 1:29:47.960]  between nations that's why they're shipping our manufacturing our wealth
[1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:52.760]  overseas gotta break gotta break we're on the march

[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.600]  talked about their manifestos micromanaging
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:20.840]  environmental brigades one-child policies the carbon footprint of children
[1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:24.680]  the little carbon monsters as the mainstream news is saying
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:28.680]  what is their true manifesto what will the world look like if they succeed
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:33.000]  dr monteef well if they succeed they're going to kill
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.800]  off at least 90 percent of the world's population
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:39.320]  and that really doesn't make sense logically but then we're not dealing
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.240]  with logical people they have an intense hatred
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:45.880]  of humanity but they're not going to tell you that
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:48.760]  but that's really what the plan is and you can go to the
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:52.040]  a great monument there at elbert and georgia there
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.400]  uh... the georgia guide stones were put up
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:59.080]  by some secret group nobody really knows who it is although we all was
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:02.600]  suspected it was the rose accrucians but there they talk about
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.040]  you know maintaining the world population at 500 million in
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:09.720]  constant balance with nature of course you've done a great job in your
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.880]  dvd on the end game going into the background of the by the way two days
[1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:18.040]  ago that just interrupt and and and back what you're saying two days ago
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:21.320]  the times of london had the headline
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:24.280]  the chief environmental minister for gordon brown said
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:28.840]  they must reduce the uk population by half to 30 million
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:32.120]  and personal you know we saw one of those frightening things recently was
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:36.200]  where baxter you know well-known well-respected
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  a company actually put the h5n1
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:44.040]  virus the bird influenza virus into the vaccine the
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.280]  influenza the the flu vaccine they were shipping out and of course
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:51.960]  ordinarily this doesn't do any harm to people but you start growing it in
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:55.000]  people and it can become pathological that's how you
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.240]  you can take a deadly virus and deadly as far as birds are concerned
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:03.560]  start growing in in human beings and condition it then to become pathological
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:07.800]  in humans why would a company like baxter do that
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:12.120]  well i'll tell you what one of the best fiction novels i ever read was called
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:15.320]  rainbow six by tom clancy and the story of how
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:19.560]  other group of people who wanted to kill off the majority of the world population
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:23.400]  they were patterned after the people in charge right now
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:27.320]  actually created the vaccine actually we're going to create an epidemic and
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:31.240]  then forced people to be vaccinated but in the vaccine was the
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:36.120]  the entity the pathological viruses that would kill off millions of people
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:40.600]  and what they would frighten me you know Alex is that so many people are
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:43.000]  gullible that they don't understand they can put
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:47.080]  terrible things in the vaccines and you never know when you roll your sleeve up
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:50.840]  what they're going to be putting into you we do know that they use the vaccines
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:54.040]  to produce infertility and sterility and women
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:58.680]  certainly in the third world countries we know that they put a cancer
[1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:04.280]  causing vaccine and the polio virus i mean the polio vaccine but cancer causing
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  um virus in the polio vaccine and of course
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:12.520]  most americans do they still carry that that's one reason why the incidence of
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:17.320]  cancer has gone up and they've concealed that but the story is beautifully told in
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:19.720]  a book it was actually authorized by the national
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:22.680]  institute of health called the health century by
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.680]  edward shorter and i hope your listeners will get that book and read it
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.800]  and understand that they knew what they were doing
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:34.920]  and even after it had been exposed that there was a cancer producing virus in
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:39.480]  the polio vaccine they used it all up and the woman who exposed this
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:43.240]  her career was destroyed they punished her for
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:46.520]  saving the lives of millions of people throughout the world
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.880]  we're really dealing with evil people when you understand that
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:52.840]  so much of this makes sense
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.000]  commit their treatments for cancer that are being suppressed today
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:00.840]  that we have never done what was proper to stop the AIDS epidemic
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:05.240]  we have almost 40,000 americans die every year by
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:10.040]  because of AIDS predominantly black because this disease is targeted at black
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:14.680]  but you go into africa you go into Botswana in Botswana today where they
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:19.640]  we do routine testing on every pregnant woman we don't do it to america but
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:23.400]  we do it in Botswana because we want to see what a great job we're doing
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:27.000]  and we get the figures from the world health organization
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.760]  and actually we get them also from the u.s a department of commerce because
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.080]  the department of commerce is over in africa
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:36.120]  checking on what a great job we're doing for the AIDS epidemic
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:40.360]  46% of the pregnant women in the country of Botswana today
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:44.200]  are HIV positive and they're all going to die
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:49.240]  in Zimbabwe today we're of course reinstalled the communist government
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:53.640]  there under macabre back in 1980 they used to have you know the
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:57.800]  average person would live to be about 64 years of AIDS
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:02.520]  today the average man lives to be i believe 36 the average woman
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:06.280]  lives to be 34 thanks to america's
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:11.320]  policies of helping the people we're inoculated all the children in
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:15.080]  africa today with vaccines that have mercury in them
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:18.440]  we've taken the mercury out of the childhood vaccines in the united states
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:22.600]  but we've left it in for the little black children in africa because we're so
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:25.320]  concerned about them and now there's epidemics of
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:29.240]  of course of autism over there and of course what people do not understand
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.520]  is this produces fertility not only infertility
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:37.320]  fell in one generation the next one we got a great talk on this by dr. david
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:40.600]  ayub who analyzed this mercury autism and the
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  global population agenda comes with the cd rom would literally thousands of
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:50.600]  pages of scientific studies showing how toxic mercury is
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:54.360]  and we are financing this in fact bill gates is financing this
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:57.640]  you know all throughout africa we want to help in fact
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:03.000]  in fact we cover that in in-game blueprint for global enslavement bill
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.640]  gates his father uh... is formerly the head of plan
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:09.960]  paranoid he's on the national board uh... gates is a eugenicist we've got
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:12.280]  bill moyer's interviews where he talks about it
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:15.880]  and then of course he's the one spending tens of billions to
[1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:19.400]  basically forcibly inoculate to the local governments by paying them off
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:22.600]  uh... the children and they've been caught in africa as you know adding the
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:25.880]  pathogen well to the tennis pathogen
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:29.240]  adding this key hormone to cause an autoimmune response to that
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:32.760]  not just one case of hundreds and mainstream news and in mainstream
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:36.360]  medical firms did the test and said yes this is a sterilizing
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:40.840]  uh... the women uh... so i mean you openly have eugenicist
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:45.480]  who are running things and and and meanwhile the hp v shots killing
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:49.240]  all these people here in the united states uh... and they just say oh that's
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:52.360]  just the way it is and melamine's in the milk the baby formula
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.040]  they say oh it's good for you now and
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:57.800]  they say oh mercury's not bad for you i mean it's just out in the open these are
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:00.120]  soft kill weapons talk about that
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:03.720]  well we've just got to get the american people to understand
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:06.680]  that they're being lied to the media is controlled
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:11.080]  with i remember forty forty six years ago forty seven years ago when i got
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.320]  started i think the thing that really got to me most was the realization of
[1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:19.320]  the media is controlled and everybody in the media today
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:22.440]  you know the regular media would tell you vaccines are good for you and they're
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:25.000]  not good for you they they actually
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.840]  uh... one reason why we have so much illness in america today
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.160]  or why our health you compare a little longevity for americans with people in
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:37.320]  elsewhere in the world and we do very poorly we're down around forty
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:41.800]  and why is that why because of chris the one thing is the vaccines we're taking
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:45.720]  they have a deleterious effect by the way doctor you're a medical doctor
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:48.760]  yourself for those they always email me saying we're living longer we're
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:51.000]  living an average of seventy four for a man
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.600]  seventy six for a woman but when you look at the numbers
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:57.640]  uh... until the twenties and thirties around
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:00.840]  a third or more of children would die by age ten
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:04.760]  most of them when they were babies but if you made it past that point and take
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:08.920]  out the uh... child death and infant death and of course you're
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.400]  you went to medical school on this you can speak directly to the numbers are
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:14.600]  there uh... if you take those numbers out
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:17.640]  people are actually living to be about eighty two years old
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:21.720]  so yes we are living uh... shorter spans
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:27.000]  and this is what the average american cannot believe that they would actually
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.040]  suppress effective treatments for cancer
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:33.320]  that they would actually create new diseases
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:37.480]  like chronic fatigue like fibromyalgia
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:44.280]  like Lyme disease like AIDS like the gulf war illnesses are already
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:48.280]  these are new diseases in fact with the original young men who went over to
[1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:53.640]  do of the gulf war to fight and you know bleed and suffer and die for our
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:58.520]  country to to protect us this this is back in 1990 1991
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:04.600]  why those 635,000 went over there almost 80,000 have already died these are
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:07.560]  young healthy people they wouldn't die at that age
[1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:11.080]  and you're not getting that these speakers come from the uh... from the
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:14.920]  veterans department we actually have their reports but you're never going to
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.760]  see this mentioned in the controlled media
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:22.600]  so they're really actively killing our people today but
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:26.760]  the average person can't believe that they would be suppressing effective
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:30.360]  treatments that are for cancer available in other countries
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:34.200]  but not available in the united states but when you understand
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:38.200]  the treatment that don't work and then make you miserable and your chemotherapy
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:42.520]  and your I mean you die miserable but you don't live any longer
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:46.920]  because of it and the effective treatments are effectively suppressed
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.400]  absolutely and I mean I remember hearing this from doctors and medical people
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:55.000]  when I was in junior high because my dad's a position and you know he'd have
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.200]  friends over and I remember them go you know look at this
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:01.480]  medical journal you know this HIV is an engineered bioweapon yeah
[1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:04.280]  I talked to a guy over at this center yeah they're aware of that they were in
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:07.000]  the research project I mean I remember being a kid
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.760]  when because I'm only 35 when age was first breaking out in the early 80s
[1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:15.400]  and hearing medical doctors and people talking about how it was a bioweapon
[1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:18.840]  and and this is you know Nobel laureates have come out and said it's a bioweapon
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:22.520]  they've done the studies of young women who've never had sexual intercourse you
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:26.520]  know they've been medically examined uh... but they all have HIV
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.600]  uh... and then they say oh maybe maybe the bbc said oh maybe
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:34.760]  uh... the the inoculators were were were sharing needles
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:38.120]  and that's how it did it but then you look at hiv transmission it's very hard
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:39.160]  to do it
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.480]  uh... you with us you know one-time needle prick that was infected
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:46.120]  uh... and you know in some of these villages as you said they're getting
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:47.480]  eighty ninety percent
[1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:49.720]  forty seven percent overall in the countries
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:52.840]  I mean this is a massive soft kill weapon for those of us don't know what a soft
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:57.160]  kill weapon is speak specifically to hiv
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:01.960]  well basically you go back and you can read what Zygda Bysinski
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:05.480]  wrote about uh... back in uh... in his book with
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:09.640]  uh... between two ages written in nineteen seventy interesting
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:13.720]  uh... uh... the test is to go up in the internet and try to get a copy today
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.800]  they're really quite expensive but
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:19.000]  but this was a six dollar book but there is somewhere
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.920]  I had a footnote between page fifty five and sixty five I can't remember the
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:26.280]  exact one but he talks about how in the future
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:29.320]  we're going to be able to create new chronic diseases
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:33.800]  storms and drought he said thirty years from now we'll be able to create
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:37.640]  new diseases well and that was nineteen seventy was just about a
[1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:41.360]  ten years later when we had uh... this new onset of of
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:44.680]  aids and we have the congressional funding
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.920]  for the army in the navy to develop uh... this weaponized cancer
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:52.280]  uh... program uh... that's autoimmune that matches hiv
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:52.880]  right
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:54.280]  but there's a wonderful
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:56.160]  of book is put out by
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:47:59.800]  a man named don scott if you ever interviewed him but he's up in the
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:03.640]  up in toronto he's seven he's eighty four now he's older than i am but
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:07.040]  his book is the crime beyond belief actually
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:09.800]  but documents the actual formation of this
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:11.080]  they had a special
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:14.040]  virus cancer project the government project
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:15.200]  where they hired
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:16.800]  uh... scientists to create
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:20.000]  new diseases we actually created this disease
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.760]  and he beautifully document this of course
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:26.000]  what they will never tell the american people
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:30.720]  uh... this is a dual disease is not simply the hiv retrovirus
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:32.920]  but there's a microplasm along with that
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:34.600]  which is why of course sometimes
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:36.240]  along
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:40.680]  term antibiotics will help us because you kill the microplast the hiv won't
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:43.640]  i won't destroy you but they're not going to so that's the that's the main
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:46.560]  vector carrier uh... you know interviewing yourself and other
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:49.160]  literally over the years scores of other medical doctors reading government
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:50.560]  research files
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:52.320]  will be where they admit
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:56.080]  uh... that that hiv also they say it's always mutating it's really just a
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:59.040]  cover for a bunch of weaponized
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:01.640]  autoimmune and cancer virus test
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:04.040]  that they're doing all over the planet
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:09.120]  well unfortunately you know people are dying immediately plus lost forty thirty
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:09.960]  or forty
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:14.320]  million people have died unnecessarily throughout the world from aids and
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.480]  countless hundreds of millions more will eventually die
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:22.040]  it's a very low-grade chronic disease but eventually it does
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:25.000]  kill the people because it destroys the immune system
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.480]  but as they say it's a combined disease
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:30.960]  it's a combination of microplasm and hiv
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:34.480]  and they're not telling you that don't the studies also show that that it
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:35.880]  plugs in
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:40.640]  uh... to uh... you know darker skinned people black people's
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:42.920]  jeans that the very couplers
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:46.160]  uh... obviously mainstream news articles admitting that northern europeans very
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:47.880]  hard for him to contract hiv
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:49.520]  absolutely that's why
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:51.080]  here in the united states
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:55.080]  almost half of the people who had come down with the disease are black and yet
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:57.360]  they only make up thirteen percent of the population
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:49:59.800]  this disease is designed specifically
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:01.200]  to destroy blacks
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:04.040]  and but nobody wants to say that there's
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:09.000]  tremendous racism in these wicked and evil people they hate blacks they hate
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:09.760]  Jews
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:13.360]  but then they hate... they hate christians they hate just about everybody
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:14.720]  except for the elite
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:16.920]  who of course worshipped their god
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:20.080]  but if you go to africa today and as i mentioned
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:21.760]  you know that the
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.080]  testing in botswana forty six percent of the pregnant women rates i'd be impacted
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:30.400]  we don't see this very common in white women in the united states today
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:32.600]  but this has a predilection for blacks
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:34.320]  and you're absolutely right
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.760]  they understand the difference in genetic structure and they designed this disease
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:41.000]  uh... to destroy the black population
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:45.560]  we're dealing with organized evil until people understand that nothing makes

[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:49.000]  dynasty the powerful forces that put in the White House and what their
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.720]  influence means for America and separately amount research you have
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:57.280]  Prescott Bush a title of the military industrial complex the main Nazi agent in
[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:04.400]  the United States with the you know large banking combine here and then you
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:08.920]  have him bringing Nixon in as a senator setting him up and then from the
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:13.160]  information that many other historians have brought out like Tarpley who
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:17.880]  against and not a quote right winger he consul for progressive the research that
[2:01:17.880 --> 2:01:23.000]  Nixon got out of control and so they shot him down not saying Nixon's a good
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.480]  guy the point is that was all a huge setup and also to weaken the presidency
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:30.880]  at that time so the national security state could fully take over the
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:37.280]  executive and that's what we really face today so just an amazing book and it is

[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:33.920]  Post a large range of different sorts of publications and I am a reporter and I
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:37.520]  think that there are different books on these subjects some people consider
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:40.560]  themselves scholars some people consider themselves activists I'm
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:45.560]  essentially a reporter and I just follow the facts wherever they go and began
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:49.640]  working on this book about five years ago simply with the question how did a
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:54.240]  guy like George W. Bush become the most powerful person in the world I just found
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:58.280]  that to be a staggering staggering proposition in and of itself and I
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:03.760]  just wondered if there was not more to the story then then then we understood
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:10.480]  there to be and so I began looking into him and this led me to start
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:16.480]  examining his relationship to the people who backed him his relationship to his
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:23.080]  father and I really went down the rabbit's hole Alex I discovered a whole
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:27.200]  new a whole new understanding of American history of the last 50 years and
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.000]  that's really what I hope we have a chance to talk about yeah what were in
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:34.440]  Bernstein with naval intelligence and the Bilderberg group control Washington
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:38.840]  Post they daringly went after Nixon they America learned how to fight back against
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:42.560]  corruption and then meanwhile the shadow government really just got even more
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:47.800]  power and expanded their control so I want to break this down after we come
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:50.760]  back from break but continue in the time we've got left in the segment
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:54.440]  describing the book sure actually what happened was I'd been sent over believe
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:59.320]  it or not by the US government to the former Yugoslavia where I was asked to
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:07.120]  train journalists there in how to question authority and keep their
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:10.600]  government honest and while I was working there we had the run-up to the war in
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:14.560]  Iraq the invasion and people began asking me what about your own government
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:17.200]  how much do you understand about your own government your own president the
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:20.280]  decisions they make there you're teaching us to do this work here what
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:24.280]  about your own country and as I traveled around Europe I just was staggered by
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:28.360]  the extent to which the popularity of the United States had just plummeted and I
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:33.880]  just felt I had to get back and get trying to answer these questions I keep
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:38.280]  going came back in 2004 and began traveling around the country I came
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:41.920]  Austin here it was one of the places I came to and I began just assembling
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:45.320]  groups of people for drinks and just said hey what do you think is behind this
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:50.640]  bush thing is there nothing more than a guy this seemingly untalented and this
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:55.120]  uninterested that he could just get to the top or was there something else going

[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:49.040]  lengthy and the research is amazing go ahead and just run through it sure so
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:53.240]  basically what happened was when I got back in 2004 began traveling around the
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:57.040]  country just asking open-ended questions might what might be what you'd call a
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:00.520]  real authentic intellectual inquiry I had no agenda I didn't know what kind of
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:04.160]  answers I was going to find and that's the way I try to do all of my journalism
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:09.280]  so one thing that I started looking at was George W. Bush's National Guard
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:14.360]  Service and I was intrigued by this because it very clearly I mean it
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:17.240]  appeared that he there were some questions about his record and yet
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:22.040]  somehow they were so effective as a propaganda device the his administration
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:25.480]  his team that they were intimidating the media they were turning this against
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:30.360]  John Kerry who had served in Vietnam and I was fascinated by that so I began
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:34.720]  looking at that out of that came a piece I did for the nation magazine which
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:40.920]  won a deadline club award it basically establishing pretty conclusively that
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.760]  Bush had not finished that he had gone AWOL skip the last two years of his
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:49.040]  military service and that this had all been covered up as I looked at that I
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:53.120]  discovered that his father appeared to be involved in covering this up keep in
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:57.320]  mind his father was the chairman of the Republican Party at the time that he was
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:01.400]  skipping out on his military service in Vietnam nobody ever asked a father what
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:05.480]  did you know about your son's activities and so I began to say what is the
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:09.920]  dynamic between the father and the son and you know we'd all been told that the
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.280]  father and the son were very very different the son was a real Texan you
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:17.040]  know the chewing tobacco wearing cowboy boots you know he was a different kind
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:22.080]  of a guy than the sort of stuff shirt father and I what I discovered was that
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:26.040]  this rift this purported rift between the father and son had been manufactured
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:30.080]  that had been manufactured for the purposes of making the son electable
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:35.280]  because the father as we know was defeated in 1992 and they wanted the son
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:39.960]  to be to appear to be a different kind of a guy in fact what I discovered at
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:43.120]  looking the son was that he'd been involved in a whole bunch of companies
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:46.840]  that have never before been reported on just one of them is called lucky
[2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:50.200]  chance mining these are very very interesting companies somehow these
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:55.120]  have eluded all of the biographers all of the reporters in the Washington Post
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:10:59.140]  New York Times and so on that did stories about George W. Bush and these
[2:10:59.140 --> 2:11:02.720]  companies are very interesting Alex because they they have all the hallmarks
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:07.680]  of being intelligence operations none of the companies make any money they all
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:13.480]  have funds coming in from offshore accounts from Saudis money connected of
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:19.000]  it for Dan Marcos to the South African apartheid regime to the Shah of Iran
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.080]  very very strange outfits and so I thought well what is this guy doing what
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:26.960]  is George W. Bush doing he's in these very strange outfits and this forced me
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:30.000]  then to start looking at his relationship with his father then we have George
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.280]  Herbert Walker Bush so you start out an investigation of Bush and it leads you
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:36.440]  back into the family history I mean where did this guy suppose he never been in
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:41.000]  the CIA the senior and then suddenly he's director of the CIA and then meanwhile
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:47.480]  they have ships named the Barbara and there's a Zipata yet exactly their oil
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:52.360]  company involved in in CIA operations by a pigs but but yeah let's let's get into
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:56.600]  the roots of it because it's just amazing especially the Nixon tie-in right
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:00.440]  right so what I did was I began looking at the father and when I looked at the
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:05.360]  father I wondered why would they make him CIA director in 1976 this is a guy who's
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:09.200]  a purported intelligence virgin a guy who doesn't have any background in
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:12.280]  intel they supposedly put him in because they're claiming they're cleaning up the
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:15.680]  agency Frank Church has his church committee which is investigating all
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:20.480]  kinds of abuses assassinations etc and they bring him in well the answer is a
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:24.640]  poppy bush is the nickname for the father I called I called George the
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:27.960]  younger one W in the book and poppy the father that those are their nicknames
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:31.760]  easier to distinguish between a poppy actually turns out had a background in
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:37.400]  the CIA not just 1976 I've got documents in the book where he's in the CIA in
[2:12:37.400 --> 2:12:41.200]  1963 at the time of the Kennedy assassination and he's in the CIA in
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:47.000]  1953 when he starts a Zapata and Zapata offshore and he begins traveling all
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:50.240]  over the world on business even though he's got this tiny company with almost
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:54.640]  no justification for it he's even putting offices in places like Medellin
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.200]  Columbia which is nowhere near the coast I mean why would you have an offshore
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:04.040]  drilling company that has almost no rigs it with an office in a place like that
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:09.040]  and so I'm digging into the father I discovered that the father basically had
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:14.160]  an entire secret life that is the oil man thing was a cover being a
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:18.200]  congressman was essentially a cover the man he started Zapata with a guy named
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:22.720]  Thomas J. Devine Jr. was a career intelligence officer and he quote unquote
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:27.200]  retired from the agency at the tender age of about 26 after they'd spent
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:31.160]  millions on him to go into the oil business with poppy bush so this is the
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:36.800]  beginning and then in family of secrets I track this through very curious things
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:40.720]  about poppy bush at the time of the Kennedy assassination he by the way has
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:44.360]  publicly said he cannot remember where he was but there's a CIA document that
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:49.880]  has a George H. W. Bush in the CIA and in Texas at the time but they say oh
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:53.760]  that's another bush well it wasn't another bush it was him and I have
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:59.720]  photos of him outside the the schoolbook the depository I mean it's him you can
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:03.520]  look at the photo it's him one of the interesting things is that there are
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:08.960]  several memos there's one from the the day after the assassination in which the
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:14.600]  FBI is giving a briefing to George Bush of the CIA there's another document from
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:19.880]  the day of the assassination where George H. W. Bush clearly him with his
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:25.360]  his address listed in a FBI document he is calling in to say I may know who has
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:29.560]  killed the president and he wants to inform on a fellow he says I don't know
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:33.880]  much about this man what I discover and I document in one of the four chapters of
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:38.200]  new material on the Kennedy assassination in family of secrets is that the man he
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.200]  was ratting out at the very moment he was ratting him out Bush's own assistant
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:47.040]  was going to that man's house to give him an alibi this is very very complex
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:50.480]  stuff very deep stuff very profound stuff well they always in intelligence
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:54.880]  ops just to random crazy things to create a fog and all sorts of rabbit
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.840]  trails I mean that's how they do them in the most slick operations well I encourage
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:04.040]  people to read that chapter very carefully and try to figure out what
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:09.040]  they think is going on I try not to be bombastic I try not to force people to
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:12.920]  conclusions I just lay out facts there are more than a thousand footnotes in
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:15.880]  this book what do you think about the guy that wrote fortunate son ending up dead
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:19.240]  in a hotel bathtub I mean you kind of worried about being because they tell
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:24.840]  people you know all I can tell you is I'm healthy I'm happy and that was
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:28.040]  during the campaign they were really worried about at that time yeah yeah so
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:31.160]  I mean I'm certainly not accident but I told the DC madam that I said they're
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:33.880]  probably gonna try to kill you and then probably she told me I'm getting followed
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:36.840]  in her ass but she's on air she said oh I'm fine I'm not worried and they killed
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:40.360]  her I mean they really do kill people and they're not very nice folks but you
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:44.040]  got a lot of courage right in this book although this original research and it's
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:47.440]  being so well documented let's go back to the beginning of that's really
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:51.720]  intriguing that where does the bush power come from I mean obviously skull and
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:56.960]  bones is the opium dealing cartel they then make opium illegal so they can
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:00.440]  jack up prices I mean that's a separate issue that's on the record but going
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:05.120]  back to Nixon and that whole story sure one of the things that intrigued me was
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:09.240]  basically George W. Bush W would never have been president the United States if
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:12.920]  his father had not been present there's no question on his own he would not have
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:16.800]  made it to the top so what I wanted to know was how is had his father made it
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:19.760]  to the top and the answer was Richard Nixon gave him all of these
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:24.080]  opportunities he was only a freshman congressman when he got on the short
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:29.920]  list to be considered for vice president with Richard Nixon in 1968 1970 he ran
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:34.240]  for U.S. Senate he lost and he was immediately appointed the ambassador to
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:38.120]  United Nations at a very very delicate moment in American relations with China
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:43.120]  and so forth after that he's made the chairman of the Republican Party at the
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:47.000]  height of Watergate and then he sent off his envoy to China when things get too
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  hot on Watergate none of these things but he was qualified for he used to make
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:54.640]  jokes to friends about it they said why are you what do you know about foreign
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:58.080]  relations for to be at the UN he said asked me in two weeks you know he was
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:03.080]  gonna bone up or something anyway the my question was why did Richard Nixon
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.720]  favor Poppy Bush and the answer I had to dig all the way back and Alex what I
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:13.720]  discovered was that in the 1940s when Richard Nixon first became a candidate
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:17.840]  for Congress from Whittier, California that Prescott Bush the grandfather was
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:22.480]  actually in Whittier buying a defense contractor company this is I do not
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:25.440]  believe this has ever been reported before was in they needed their
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:28.080]  representative their man well they needed their man but there was something
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:32.320]  else going on there was a congressman a Democrat named Jerry Voorhees and Jerry
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:36.320]  Voorhees is the guy that Nixon beat now they say that Nick they ran Nixon
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:39.800]  against him because Jerry Voorhees was too liberal on a bunch of issues
[2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:43.800]  including labor unions and so on but the reality is that wasn't what it was
[2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:48.160]  Jerry Voorhees was the number one guy in the House of Representatives who was
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:52.400]  worried about Wall Street and what he was worried about was this was you know
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:55.880]  not that long after the Great Depression and he was afraid that if there was no
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:18:04.280]  regulation and oversight of the both the bankers and the and the the Wall
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:08.760]  Street people that we could have another crisis like that and they were very
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:12.960]  upset about Jerry Voorhees and basically the financiers the group that
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:17.240]  Prescott Bush was part of wanted him out Jerry Voorhees even suspected this and
[2:18:17.240 --> 2:18:21.600]  I found out something he wrote where he said that he had heard that somebody was
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:25.280]  in his district looking for someone to run against him he just didn't know who
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:29.080]  it was and it seems that it was Prescott Bush because he was there buying
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:33.200]  that company in the district right at that moment
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:36.440]  happens every once in a while our connection to the network just broke
[2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:39.640]  but we're back up on the backup okay good please repeat what you just said
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:46.640]  sure so so Nixon basically they wanted him in there in order to beat Jerry
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:50.820]  Voorhees a Prescott Bush and his his buddies were concerned about Jerry
[2:18:50.820 --> 2:18:56.040]  Voorhees's activities trying to regulate these these powerful financial
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:19:03.600]  interests anyway I think what happened was Richard Nixon was basically essentially
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:07.240]  sort of working for these interests throughout his career they pushed
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:10.960]  Eisenhower to run for president they pushed Eisenhower to put Nixon on the
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:15.120]  ticket that's how he became vice president Nixon then had the portfolio for
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:19.320]  covert operations so he was deeply involved in all this stuff against Castro
[2:19:19.320 --> 2:19:25.240]  leading up to the Bay of Pigs then when Kennedy ran of course Nixon was out they
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:30.520]  then stayed involved with him and then when Nixon ran in 1968 they said put
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.560]  Poppy Bush on the ticket with you and Nixon didn't do it and he angered
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:38.360]  Prescott Bush I've got a letter in Family of Secrets or Prescott Bush says
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:43.080]  he made a mistake not putting my son on there and what you see right from the
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:46.600]  beginning of the Nixon administration is efforts and I documented some three
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:52.880]  chapters all new information efforts to remove Richard Nixon from office by these
[2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:57.880]  financial interests oil interests by these people in the intelligence
[2:19:57.880 --> 2:20:03.520]  community and in the military stay there millions of Americans are beginning
[2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:07.440]  to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.

[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:23.160]  again I've done so much research you've done even more and to be reading to the
[2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:27.200]  book while we're on break I just see so many amazing things like the bottlers
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:32.720]  convention with Nixon in Dallas when Kennedy's killed just all the amazing
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:38.040]  photos and documents and letters that you've got in this book please continue
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:42.440]  with your discovery that they were setting up Nixon all along sure I mean
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:47.040]  what intrigued me and and and I have to say by the way that two of the major
[2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:50.800]  revelations in the book one is about the Kennedy assassination and the
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:55.440]  involvement of the intelligence community and organizing it and these
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:01.440]  curious coincidences in which George H. W. Bush keeps showing up in relation to
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:05.280]  that by the way one of those other coincidences is there was a family
[2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:10.120]  friend of George H. W. Bush by the name of George DeMoren Schild and he was a
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:15.120]  white Russian emigre with intelligence ties he also happened to be Lee Harvey
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:18.880]  Oswald's father figure in the year before the assassination this man
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:24.840]  practically organized all aspects of Lee Harvey Oswald's life this is not
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:28.880]  mentioned very widely at all you can find bits and pieces on him in a few
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:32.560]  other books and on the internet but I've gone I have a whole chapter on George
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:37.720]  DeMoren Schild his his nephew was the was a roommate in prep school with
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:44.040]  poppy bush and so this man was so close to to well there's a Howard Hunt who's
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:48.440]  now admitted to running the operation to kill Kennedy I'm sorry go ahead sure
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:52.040]  anyway so this Kennedy stuff we don't have time here to go into all of it
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:57.400]  there are four chapters on the Kennedy assassination with a number of figures
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:03.200]  associated with George H. W. Bush there people who were in the lead car of the
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:09.520]  of the motorcade involved with a very secret military intelligence unit in
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:15.240]  Dallas headed by a man who was essentially Poppy Bush's running mate in
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:23.040]  1963 and the the man who got them to run for office that year who family was
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:28.160]  revealed to be a CIA funded foundation anyway it's very very deep stuff goes on
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:33.200]  and on and on I had always sort of not followed the Kennedy assassination most
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:36.920]  journalists like myself just know that it's just too much of a quagmire so I
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:40.320]  said all right you know maybe Oswald did it alone well I have had to completely
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:44.480]  revise my thinking on that as a result of the research that went into family of
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:49.760]  secrets now Nixon you asked about Nixon it's the same thing I had always assumed
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:53.760]  that Nixon was just this sort of out-of-control president the conventional
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:58.600]  story that he was behind all of these things including the Watergate
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:03.160]  burglary and certainly the cover-up what I discovered in my research and again
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:07.520]  were the fingerprints of Poppy Bush who was the Republican chairman at the time
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:11.040]  at the height of the Watergate scandal and yet he's not mentioned you read
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:14.640]  those books on Watergate Poppy Bush is never mentioned he's not mentioned in
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.640]  books about him and books about Nixon he's like the anti-zellig he just
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:21.920]  doesn't exist how did you get bloomsbury press man I know you're an award-winning
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.840]  journalist but how'd you come to this is an incendiary book and that's a pretty
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:31.520]  good publisher it is a good publisher and I I admire them greatly for for being
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:36.160]  willing to to to show some courage and put out a book like this a lot of my
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:39.000]  friends in the mainstream media they said you will never get this publish
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:42.320]  you'll never get it out what what our challenge is right now Alex is that
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:46.080]  there's a bit of a wall of silence out there the New York Times has not reviewed
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:49.360]  the book even though I have a lot of friends there and I've written for that
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:53.640]  paper there was an attack on it by somebody in the LA Times and but
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:57.240]  generally silence we have not been able to get on to most of the yeah tax are
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:02.160]  better than silence yeah oh absolutely but generally a silence and we there's
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:07.120]  no justification for that this book has as as many of the reviewers people like
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:11.120]  Roger Morris who's been on the National Security Council Gore Vidal they have
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:14.800]  all praised the book they all say you know I mean it's a it's a revelation
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:18.480]  per page stuff that that even people like Roger Morris who's been who wrote a
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:22.880]  an acclaimed book on Nixon and acclaimed book on the Clintons he didn't know any
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:26.600]  of this stuff you know and and with all that really we should be out there with
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:30.320]  a major explosive bestseller but we cannot get the traction so what we're
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:34.520]  doing is we are going out over the airwaves with people like you who have
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:39.120]  the guts to get the story out through the internet through YouTube whatever we
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:42.440]  can do and we're really trying to have a kind of a guerrilla movement to get
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:47.000]  word out because 99.9% of people don't even know. I mean I have to say I've read the reviews of the book I was
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.760]  intending to get it and read it and I'd actually like a few weeks ago given a
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:53.800]  something to my producer a sheet on it saying let's get this we get you know we
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:28:58.040]  forget things and just scanning through it it's just amazing book and we've only
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:03.440]  got one more segment left coming up but start getting into how they destroyed
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:08.600]  Nixon because sure sure well basically what they did was used in the book I
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:14.960]  reveal in the book I reveal a series of different operations that were
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:18.920]  precursors to the Watergate break-in and the break-in by the way was deliberately
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:22.160]  so ham-handed in other words they were doing everything they could to get caught
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:26.400]  and that's why they had these checks and everything that were traceable back to
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:30.360]  to the Republican Party and to the White House they were trying to set up
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:34.120]  Richard Nixon but they were doing things before the Watergate break-in and in
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:38.960]  family of secrets I document those earlier unsuccessful operations to

[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:45.080]  We're gonna go back to that here in just a moment with our guest in the studio.
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:48.760]  We're gonna get to these mass graves are building all over the country. We've had
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:52.800]  emergency managers on, journalists on and the Pentagon admits they're doing it
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:56.520]  and they do it by night. They go in and just put in all these big mass concrete
[2:33:56.520 --> 2:34:00.920]  graves outside large government cemeteries. They're getting ready for World War
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:02.880]  3 or something. Who knows? We're gonna be covering it.
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:11.240]  Photos are up on infowars.com. Also, I've been wanting to do this on air for one of
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:21.000]  our new sponsors folks. I see that shot all the way across the room there but
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.200]  it's not real. It's not real pepper spray. This is just an inert training
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:29.920]  canister. Where's the other one that shoots out all the, I know Burmese on
[2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:33.480]  air did this to Jim Mars and I meant for him to use the one that shot out the
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:40.480]  the vapor. This, oh Burmese used the one that goes the tester but anyways just
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:44.520]  pepper spray.com. Great new sponsor. Incredibly low prices. I thought this was
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:48.600]  the vapor one. I just shot inert goo all over the wall over there. Good thing I
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:54.000]  didn't name it at him and shoot. Oh my gosh. Anyways, we live in an
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:57.360]  unpredictable world and everybody knows I'm all about preparedness. Remember,
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:01.440]  announced prevention is worth a pound of cure. That's why I want you to visit our
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:05.080]  new sponsor pepper spray.com to check out their wide variety of personal security
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.640]  products they have available on their website since 1994. They had the lowest

[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:21.320]  That's 800-908-9988. And you know, I gripe and complain about police
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:25.120]  tasering people for no reason. I'm not against the taser or the firearms
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:27.960]  themselves. So every time I mention this, people go, what do you mean you don't like
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:31.960]  tasers? No, I want my wife with a taser. You know, it's safer in case somebody got
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:35.800]  ahold of it. But it would protect her if somebody was trying to assault her in a
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:39.440]  parking lot and crime is certainly up. They got great deals on tasers, stun guns,
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:45.520]  you name it, pepper spray.com. So be sure and check that out. Okay, going back to
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:49.280]  our guest with the book, Family of Secrets. I'm definitely Russ going to have
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:52.280]  you back on in the near future to start with a phone from New York. I don't want
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:56.240]  to wait till you're back in Austin. This is just too important, just too much
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:35:59.000]  information that's got to be gotten out. Finish up with how they went after
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:02.080]  Nixon specifically. And I know that's only a small part of the book. It's just
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:05.080]  so interesting to me and then cover some of the other things that are in the book
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:09.640]  that you bring up to current times. Sure. What I see a number of things. First
[2:36:09.640 --> 2:36:15.360]  of all, I studied the Nixon tapes. And what's very interesting is most of us
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:19.120]  have not studied the Nixon tapes. And we take the word of several so-called experts.
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:23.040]  I call them gatekeepers who tell us that the tapes implicate Nixon. Well, the
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:26.840]  tapes don't implicate Nixon. If you look at the tapes carefully enough, you see
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:30.040]  that what they show is a guy who's completely befuddled. He has no idea
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:33.520]  what's going on. He doesn't know why in the world they did that burglary. He says,
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:37.400]  holy cow, it looks like somebody's trying to set me up. He does not know what's
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:42.800]  going on. I've heard that and absolutely so. And so what you see is you see a
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:45.640]  whole bunch of people. Again, we don't have time to go into here. It's all in
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:50.120]  the book, Family of Secrets. All of these people around Nixon who were infiltrated
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:54.360]  into the White House who had intelligence ties. And that includes Alexander
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:59.040]  Butterfield, the man who revealed the existence of the tapes. That includes
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:04.480]  Jeb McGruder, who basically framed John Mitchell. That includes a whole bunch of
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:08.760]  these guys. Bob Woodward has a very interesting background. John Dean has a
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:13.280]  very interesting background. His brother-in-law and lawyer had CIA
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:17.760]  connections. This is very, very important. And as I say, I think I break new ground
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:21.560]  here in showing all of these people and their connections to Poppy Bush, who's
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:25.080]  sitting in the catbird seat of intelligence as the head of the Republican
[2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:29.560]  Party at that moment where Nixon is taken down. And they needed to get Nixon out so
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:33.320]  the family could finally, at that point, when they decapitated him politically,
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:37.080]  it would be the Bushes left in total control of the party to then project
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:40.560]  themselves into office. And then he ran against Reagan initially and they
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:44.680]  threatened Reagan. So he put George Herbert Walker Bush on the ticket. Clearly,
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:47.840]  you have the shooter meeting with the family a night before. All those
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:50.960]  intelligence connections getting Reagan under their control. These are some
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:55.600]  nasty people. Well, in fact, you see that they push Agnew out and they bring in
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:59.400]  Gerald Ford who had been on the Warren Commission and had always sort of played
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:02.560]  ball with these guys. And Gerald Ford then brings in a couple of guys you may
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:05.640]  have heard of called Cheney and Rumsfeld. And then they launched the
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:09.760]  continuity of government takeover plan, Rex 84, before it comes out in the 80s,
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:13.080]  in the Iran Contra. And it's all about, we'll take over through national
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:16.680]  security. We'll do a CIA overthrow in the U.S., like we've done in the Third
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:21.280]  World, but in slow motion. And now today it's actually happening. And I have the
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:24.760]  LA Times. Every day I see multiple articles of Marines are running
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:28.160]  checkpoints to stop drugs. Oh, the Army was out at the mass shooting. Oh, there's
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:32.080]  liaison officers in all the police departments. LA Times, Marines embedded
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:37.480]  at LA County Coroner's Office. Sorry, go ahead. Sure. In any case, that whole
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:41.920]  segment, it fascinated me as I dug deeper and deeper. And then, of course, Ford
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:47.080]  comes in, as I say, and then they bring in Poppy Bush as the CIA director in 1976.
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:51.560]  I then discover a bunch of things that happened to Jimmy Carter. And I get into
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:55.360]  this in the book. And this appears to be yet another setup of a president they
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:38:59.400]  were not happy with. He was trying to essentially either reorganize or
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:03.080]  dismantle the CIA as we know it. So they make a deal, just on record because
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:08.040]  they make a deal to have the moulas grab the hostages. They sell them weapons.
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:11.400]  I mean, it's Iran-Contra. There's a lot of interesting stuff about the whole
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:15.320]  Iran connection. And by the way, right in this period, you see money moving
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:21.080]  Iranian money into companies that George W. Bush is involved with, the son. And
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:25.240]  so what I do is that the first half or maybe sort of two-thirds of the book is
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:29.240]  mostly about the father, the grandfather, and this larger apparatus of these
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:33.800]  these wealthy and powerful families that influence policy in this country that
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:38.120]  we really can't talk about, that control resource extraction in this country and
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:41.600]  around the world, which is the source of power in this world. You could say it's
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:45.640]  the entertainment business. You could say it's a Silicon Valley. It isn't. It's
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:49.520]  always going to be until the lights go out. It's going to be the things that keep
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:53.560]  us warm, the things that allow our vehicles to move. Raw material. Raw
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:57.080]  material. And that is what these families and these interests of control, in any
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:00.440]  case, the thrust of the book and bring it up to today and why it's still
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:05.400]  relevant is because these people aren't going away. I interview somebody in the
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:09.160]  book, a Republican official, and he says to me, let me tell you something. The
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:15.040]  intelligence community bring in their people into every White House. They make
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:18.480]  sure they have their people in surrounding every president. And they
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:22.000]  say, don't think that this thing is going away. So whatever you think of the
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:25.480]  new president, whatever you think of what he's trying to do, the reality is that
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:31.960]  he's limited in his movement and he's constrained. He's got to please the
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:35.120]  generals. He's got to please the intelligence community and he's got to
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:41.040]  please all of these interests. And so I think that the lessons in the book are
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:45.800]  very much relevant today. And I would encourage people to go to our website, if
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:51.120]  I may, which is familyofsecrets.com. Get some more information there. You can
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:54.520]  contact me. You can send me an email if you've got tips or information. I think
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:59.160]  we've got a mailing list. I hope people have a chance to read the book. It's a
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:04.520]  work in progress. We have a nonprofit website called whowhatwhy.com. We're
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:07.920]  trying to get this off the ground. We're looking for the public to support us so
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.960]  that we can put trained investigative journalists with serious credentials on
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:15.880]  these sorts of stories that the mainstream media will not touch. Well, you
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:18.400]  are asking for it. You've got a lot of courage. You're a man of your own
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:20.920]  heart. In the few minutes we've got left with you, I just want to invite you
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:23.960]  back the next few weeks for two hours over the phone because this is so
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:28.360]  important. And reading literally hundreds of books, interviewing thousands of
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.640]  guests, trying to find the truth, not left, you know, darkly I look through on a
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:37.280]  right wing, darkly I look through, but really trying to find the truth. It's
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:42.000]  clear Obama is totally controlled by this very same apparatus. And as much of a
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:47.400]  nice guy as he might be, it's a bunch of rhetoric that he put out during the
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:51.920]  campaign. He's now basically doing the opposite and protecting the Bush family
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:55.480]  and protecting the president from the crimes, the lies about WMDs, the
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:58.840]  torture of the police state, all of it. Can you specifically, because you were
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:02.600]  just alluding to that, to who is in the Obama administration right now and the
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:06.800]  fact of however nice we might think Barack Obama is, and I certainly wish
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:10.880]  everything was okay, but it's not. Well, I mean, I don't want to put words in your
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:14.240]  mouth. Basically, where do you stand on Barack Obama and who's in his
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:17.360]  administration now? Because it's the very same players from our research.
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:21.120]  I want to say, first of all, that I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. I
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:25.680]  think it's, I like to give every president the benefit of the doubt. I think
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:31.240]  what he faces is this. I think he's a man who, as he rose, he understood the art
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:35.400]  of compromise. I think he knew how to play ball with the right people. I think
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:38.240]  he's got a mixture of people in his administration. He's got a few people who
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:41.760]  I think are very good people. He's got other people in there who I don't think
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:45.520]  are so good. And I think there's a lot of jockeying going on. There's a lot of
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:51.200]  back and forth. And the question is who's going to prevail on the Wall Street
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:55.520]  bailout, on the kinds of people who chose to run the Treasury Department, kind
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:42:59.600]  of people at the Fed to keep Robert Gates in at the Pentagon. A lot of these
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:04.240]  things, I'm not sure they are encouraging. I am troubled by a lot of them. And I
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:09.760]  think that the best thing that I can do as a journalist is to hope for the
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.920]  best and be prepared for the worst and apply the same sort of scrutiny and
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:17.040]  vigilance that I have to the Bushes.
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:21.440]  Well, Obama is not stupid. He's extremely intelligent. He knows that if he
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:25.040]  doesn't do what the military industrial complex wants, that they're going to
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.640]  destroy him politically or murder him. And so the proof is in the pudding. You
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:33.440]  know, JFK tried to have this mixed cabinet and tried to work with these
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:37.320]  people and look what happened to him. So it was the same thing with Nixon. And
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:40.400]  you know, they said Nixon was paranoid where he kept replacing people. That
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:44.080]  wasn't what it was about. He was trying to do his own thing. He had those in a
[2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:48.400]  back channel secret negotiations trying to break down the Cold War effectively.
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:51.280]  The same thing that turns out Kennedy was trying to do. And a lot of
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:54.960]  interest do not want this to happen. I mean, this country has such a huge
[2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:59.120]  military industrial complex. It's so much larger percentage wise than any
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:02.960]  other developed country in the world. And the amounts being spent and the
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:07.600]  fortunes being made every day on this stuff, they cannot afford to have a
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:12.760]  president who presides over a global peace. And so it is a real challenge for
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:17.480]  a guy like Obama. He may be a great guy. He may be an intelligent guy. But the
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:20.800]  reality is that the president of the United States, no president in the
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:26.720]  United States, is able to do whatever he wants. He has got to be realistic about
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:30.880]  these things. And he's hemmed in to a large extent.
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:38.880]  Well, you're absolutely right. In closing, I bought into the propaganda that
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:43.080]  Nixon was the quintessential devil until over a decade ago, actually
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:46.960]  researched what happened to him. He was obviously a flawed, power-hungry person.
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:50.000]  But compared to many other presidents, he was actually trying to be the
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:54.400]  president. And he tried to actually do a lot of good things. And it shows that
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:59.000]  the shadow government, the national security state, didn't like that. And
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  so they wanted to make sure that the presidency was a kept position. And I
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.840]  just feel so sorry for the control left. It's almost like a religious
[2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:12.560]  sacrament bashing Nixon in the cartoons and movies and culture. And it's sad
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:16.240]  that they're just being completely conned and are missing the real power
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:20.400]  elite and the real evil. Yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate that people of any
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:26.280]  ideological stripe are not open to facts, are not open to new information. And I
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:30.520]  mean, I think that the most compelling thing about Family of Secrets, I am
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:35.240]  told by people, is that I don't come in with an agenda. And I'm open to being
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:39.960]  persuaded that what I thought and what I understood, one of my friends, a
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:42.680]  journalist, when he looked at the book, he said, you know, you should call this
[2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:48.200]  book. You should call this book. Everything you know is wrong. And I was
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:52.080]  willing to accept the fact that the way that I understood the Kennedy
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:54.840]  assassination, the way I understood Watergate, the way I understood Jimmy
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:59.720]  Carter, Ford, George W. Bush, that all of these things were wrong. And I think
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:02.800]  what we've got to do is really open up a dialogue in this country where we're
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:06.280]  willing to just look at these facts. If somebody wants to come to me and point
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:09.400]  out that they're wrong, they're a few small errors in the book. People have
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:12.880]  contacted me about, I said, somebody went to Yale and he went to Harvard. But
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:17.640]  nobody has challenged the core most important facts, the documents that are
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:21.080]  in there. That's right. In my film, The Obama Deception, you know, we get
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:26.600]  busy and we say Richard M. Haas, head of the CFR, Richard N. Haas. But the
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:30.480]  main facts are accurate. And I've done the research and going through the book,
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:34.160]  scanning and everything I see in here is spot on from deep research that I and
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:37.520]  many others have done. And so you just put it all together in one place
[2:46:37.520 --> 2:46:43.480]  instead of in 10 or 15 books. So people will get it. But in the final
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:47.280]  equation, and I cut you off earlier, and I want you to finish up with this,
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:51.520]  you're saying, hey, these people aren't going away. Specifics on that?
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:56.080]  Well, first of all, I think it's kind of funny. We like to think that as we
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:46:59.560]  live, we do live in a great country. But we're a little bit naive about
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:02.640]  thinking that it's perfect. And we like to think that in this country,
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:06.600]  democracy works in every other country, you know, that we talk about banana
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:11.280]  republics, all these other countries have oligarchies and forces that tend
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:15.640]  to dominate the political situation. But it's naive to think that that
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:18.960]  doesn't happen in this country. The reason we think it doesn't happen is
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:23.560]  because you can't talk about it in a weird way. The press self-sensors
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:27.640]  itself. And so we can't have these conversations. It's just not okay to
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:30.640]  talk about this. Because we're America and we're the good guys. And don't
[2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:34.880]  you say, we've got a corrupt oligarchy or a shadow government or elite. Now
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:38.880]  they're openly out in the open setting up a classic tyranny. They've always
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:42.560]  had the velvet glove on and kind of allowed the common masses to have
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:46.560]  basic freedoms. But now they are eroding and getting rid of that. I think
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:49.920]  because of the internet culture, they know that they've lost their illusion
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:55.160]  that America is perfect and only good guys are running it. And so I think
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:59.480]  we see a massive struggle now coming to a head. And I'm very optimistic that
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:03.680]  things to book, you know, books like Family of Secrets and films and things
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  that are out there that we are starting to turn the corner. I think that's why
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:10.480]  we see this thrashing by the establishment, threatening everybody in
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:13.760]  an attempt to create a chilling effect. I mean, we had in the private
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:16.920]  Federal Reserve rallies all over the country. And we got the Army document
[2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:20.640]  called the Army and they confirmed it. And they had the Army anti-terrorism
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:25.080]  squad watching us at all 38 locations, including Ron Paul in Houston. And I
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:29.200]  mean, that is Third World. That is Nazi Germany. That is Russia. And that's
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:32.720]  happened to peace groups for a long time, but now it's much wider. And
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:37.200]  there's the secret police all over the place. We can't let that shell us. We've
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:41.320]  got to have the courage. I agree. And I think that is there are some
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:45.080]  exciting opportunities. The internet, all of these things, podcasts and so on.
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:48.720]  The fact that I can come on here and talk about Family of Secrets. I think
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:51.800]  all of these things, I think the equation is shifting. And I think people
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:56.240]  that have traditionally held control, certainly the Bushes, and I go into
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:01.480]  this to some extent in the book that the Bushes go way back. The great
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:04.600]  grandfather was working for two different branches of the Rockefeller
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:09.440]  family at the turn of the 19th century. I mean, it's mind-blowing stuff. This
[2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:14.640]  continuity of influence and power is absolutely there. We need to talk about
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:18.200]  these kinds of things. We need to assert ourselves. If we live in a true
[2:49:18.200 --> 2:49:22.440]  democracy, we have to be able to do something about that and have a
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:25.720]  vigorous debate, get the facts out there. Getting the facts out there, that's the
[2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:28.760]  first thing. Well, we're going to have you back on in a few weeks if you'll do it,
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:32.000]  and go through the book in more detail. But folks should get it, Russ Baker,
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:37.560]  Family of Secrets, just an amazing treatise. And I can't wait to read the
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:42.480]  whole thing because just everything I scan is just amazing information. The way
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.920]  it puts it all together in a historical perspective and brings us up to current
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:52.040]  times. Fire out both the websites again for folks. Yeah, FamilyOfSecrets.com
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:57.600]  information about the book or to contact us. And then our nonprofit investigative
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:05.240]  reporting site, WhoWhatWhy.com. We are hoping that the public will
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:10.000]  support us. What we eventually want to do is get some thousands of people to
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:13.360]  support us with a small donation each month. So we get a crack team of
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:17.440]  investigative reporters there. We are willing to look at any story, folks.
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.000]  Anything out there we are willing to investigate using classical journalistic
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:25.680]  techniques documenting everything. Yeah, this is the rise of the true alternative
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:29.800]  media and the establishment is moving to try to regulate the web. In fact, it's
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:34.040]  being reported. YouTube is saying that China has completely blocked YouTube for
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:38.000]  two days. And then they have a huge list of countries that have banned most
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:41.520]  western-based sites and similar things with Internet too. We're now coming in
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:44.360]  here to end that neutrality and other things as the New York Times said,
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:49.440]  gatekeepers in a kindler, gentler, controlled Internet for our own good.
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.760]  All right. Well, again, the book is Family of Secrets. Russ Baker, thanks for
[2:50:53.760 --> 2:50:58.240]  being with us. My pleasure. Thanks, pal. We'll be right back with the mass graves.
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:01.000]  Stay with us.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:06.280]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high
[2:51:06.280 --> 2:51:10.400]  cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:14.720]  there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and
[2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:18.640]  irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:23.280]  is wrong. Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:28.160]  of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has
[2:51:28.160 --> 2:51:32.040]  totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm

[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:10.960]  tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:16.640]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception
[2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:20.800]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[2:52:20.800 --> 2:52:25.560]  American people. While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[2:52:25.560 --> 2:52:29.320]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:34.800]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:40.040]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:45.840]  one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,

[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:13.560]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, we're going to have a very brave person,
[2:54:13.560 --> 2:54:18.880]  Shepard Ambulus, joining us from Arizona. The story is military industrial
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:22.360]  complex prepares mass graves for US citizens. We're getting all these emails
[2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:26.520]  pouring in from around the country saying, hey, they've got these in my town,
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:31.160]  Abilene in other areas. And it goes with all the plastic FEMA coffins, other
[2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:36.040]  reports that have been in the news where they're in Indiana, Illinois. FEMA says
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:39.360]  we need to prepare for mass graves. Is it for bird flu? Are they ready for World
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:47.720]  War III? This is being set up at a military cemetery in Phoenix. Let's go
[2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:50.320]  ahead and bring the man up. He's been out there taking photos and interviewing
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:55.120]  people. We've been putting calls in all day to the head of the cemetery. He
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:00.840]  hasn't called us back yet, but let's go ahead and go to Shepard Ambulus.
[2:55:00.840 --> 2:55:05.520]  Shepard, thanks for coming on with us. Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. How's it going?
[2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:10.160]  Good. Tell us how you first discovered this. What's going on there? We have
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:15.800]  the photos. We have the satellite photos. I mean, you caught them
[2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:18.960]  doing this deep into their operation. There's a bunch of other areas where they've
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:24.400]  buried these crypts. Yes, absolutely. Well, my friend alerted me to this
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:29.680]  originally. He said, what do you make of this? I told him right away,
[2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:35.080]  because I'm familiar with the FEMA coffins and also some concrete
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:42.960]  caskets in a cemetery in LA. Basically, we went over and investigated it, took
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:49.160]  some pictures. One of my friends ended up interviewing a truck driver that was
[2:55:49.160 --> 2:55:54.800]  part of the operation and basically gathered from the truck driver after
[2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:59.360]  about 10 minutes of the truck driver kind of beating around the bush. He
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:07.120]  basically said, look, these are for US military and four caskets fit
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:14.520]  in each one of these burial vaults. Basically went on to stay.
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:21.800]  He got paid an awful lot of money to do his job. It sounds like a
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:26.160]  little bit of a bribe to me. I just want to explain to people, then we're
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:30.280]  going to pick your brain on this. Explain to folks, this is the way
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:36.600]  regular military cemeteries work. It's one coffin, one crypt, and then there's
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:40.520]  space around the graves. They're going in digging in 10 feet, as
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:44.200]  you said. We have the photos of this putting in all of these crypts right
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:48.080]  up against each other. I guess this wouldn't be properly marked graves.
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.200]  This is not the way it's ever been done. They're doing it at night, which is
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:55.640]  very, very secretive, and then it dovetails in with the FEMA plastic
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:59.920]  coffins all over the country. Georgia and other areas confirmed from the company
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:04.400]  that sold it to FEMA centers for disease control, massing these. I mean, this
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:08.840]  is like 28 days later or something. This is very fine.
[2:57:08.840 --> 2:57:13.880]  Absolutely. I kind of got this two guys a little bit late.
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:18.000]  I've been working on this, but absolutely, they've been working on it over the
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:23.840]  last 30 plus days. It's a large-scale operation. I mean, semi-trucks literally
[2:57:23.840 --> 2:57:29.240]  every morning, you know, they start during, it's still dark, you know, they start
[2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:34.360]  real early, then they start lining up, literally bringing these things in and
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:41.160]  just unloading them all day long, stacking them in tightly together. The
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:47.600]  interesting observation I made was they actually went ahead and laid down what's
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:53.960]  called ABC or some kind of rock that's, you know, probably one to two inches in
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:59.680]  diameter on the whole base of this thing. And now I've done a little bit of
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:03.760]  research about mass graves in Germany and whatnot, and I thought this could be,
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:10.000]  you know, aid with the decomposition process, but basically is what I'm
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:16.200]  thinking is it's some kind of drainage system or bedding that was installed.
[2:58:16.200 --> 2:58:19.440]  Yeah, stay there, and I wasn't criticizing you for getting into the project late. I
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:24.400]  meant you discovered it late in the projects, so they're burying them
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:28.320]  empty and putting a layer over it. You can see that from the aerial photographs.
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:33.840]  It's just huge, complex, and just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. We'll
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:38.680]  continue with our eyewitness citizen reporter in 70 seconds. When we start,

[2:58:50.800 --> 2:58:55.120]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[2:58:55.120 --> 2:58:58.360]  to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[2:58:58.360 --> 2:59:01.960]  independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a
[2:59:01.960 --> 2:59:05.200]  bread line until you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the super
[2:59:05.200 --> 2:59:09.040]  dough, and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:59:09.040 --> 2:59:12.560]  simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:16.400]  between you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's

[2:59:51.120 --> 3:00:00.680]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:07.680 --> 3:00:13.560]  Jason Douglas, just got news. He just talked to Ellis, the director of the
[3:00:13.560 --> 3:00:18.240]  Phoenix Department of Veterans Affairs National Memorial Cemetery in Phoenix
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:25.160]  Arizona, 225-acre facility. Now, we know how they dig the graves. They're single
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:30.520]  person crypts. They put the coffins in their space. You've seen Arlington
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:34.080]  Cemetery, you've seen it all. These are being buried. They never do that.
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:40.920]  Beforehand, covered up, and they're then setting them right next to each other.
[3:00:40.920 --> 3:00:44.840]  And these are crypts that can hold four coffins, or if you don't put people in
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:50.000]  coffins, it can hold even more than that. And our guest has done the math on this,
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:54.720]  Shepard Ambulus. And Shepard, we're going to go to you in just a moment, but I
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:58.840]  wanted to go to Jason Douglas, who does graphics, video editing, and producing
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:02.600]  for the Jason Burma Show and this show, one with Rob Do. Doing a great job. You
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:07.000]  finally got a hold of the director of the National Memorial Cemetery there in
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:11.200]  Phoenix. What did he tell you? Well, he basically just said that this is
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:15.160]  completely commonplace, that they dig these graves ahead of time. They only
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:19.800]  get two days' notice once they know who's going to be interred. But I asked
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:23.720]  him if he could comment on who was actually going to be put into those
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:28.480]  graves, or if he knew anything about the content of the graves. He wouldn't make a
[3:01:28.480 --> 3:01:32.360]  comment on that. He seemed like he had this pretty well prepared speech. He
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:37.800]  didn't. That's just, I mean, it's just normal to have 4,000 graves, just what
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:40.760]  we can count on the surface. That's supposedly normal. Right. Supposedly
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:44.680]  normal. He said everything was above board. I mean, supposedly only 4,500
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:48.200]  troops have died in Iraq. So, I mean, suddenly they just need all these
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:51.800]  graves. Yeah. At just one summit, and we're getting reports, they're building
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:55.160]  these at military cemeteries everywhere. Right. Yeah, we've also had reports in
[3:01:55.160 --> 3:02:00.800]  Abilene, Texas. We're asking people to write in online. I've posted some videos
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:05.400]  and shown the pictures online. People are making comments, so hopefully we'll get
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:09.720]  some more reports of other mass graves. Yeah, because if we find more and
[3:02:09.720 --> 3:02:13.960]  confirm it, and it goes into the tens of thousands, going back to Shepherd,
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:16.800]  Shepherd, you did some math here, and you talked to some of the construction
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:20.960]  workers there, some of the excavators, about how many people can fit in just
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:25.840]  the graves that you saw, just the, just the crypts that you saw. Absolutely.
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:31.520]  Well, like you said, we know that according to what the official reports
[3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:34.440]  are, which are obviously a little bit few, but they're reporting, you know,
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:41.560]  like 4,500 troops have died in Iraq and whatnot. It's highly suspect that you got
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:51.520]  graves enough here for 4,000 people just in Arizona. You know, if caskets weren't
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:57.200]  used in these graves, you could probably fit 30 to 40 bodies in each one. So if you
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.240]  run the math times that by at least a thousand that I know are there, you know,
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:08.040]  you have anywhere from 4,000 bodies to possibly 40,000 bodies just in this one
[3:03:08.040 --> 3:03:12.360]  location. And then what are the millions of FEMA coffins all over the country?
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:16.680]  A couple hundred thousand just in Georgia alone at one site. And then we go up,
[3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:20.000]  there's the name of the company, you call them, it is a plastic casket, and
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:23.920]  they're just staging them for the CDC. That's obviously for mass plague. And then
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:29.600]  we've had government officials on, you know, Inside Source Reveals FEMA and DHS
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:33.440]  Preparing for Mass Graves and Marshall Law Nurse Chicago Daily Newscaster. That
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:38.120]  was a month ago. Yes, absolutely. Let me tell you also, Alex, there's a video that
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:43.560]  surfaced from another plastic company. I can't think of the name of it offhand,
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:49.480]  but you could probably find it on YouTube. It happened to be in Canada, just
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:53.400]  north of the Washington border. Yeah, I've seen all those videos. Wendy Curtin
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:57.080]  Nemo doing a fabulous job to do, put it all together. You know, grab the Daily
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:01.240]  Newscaster article, which he's already done, grab the plastic FEMA. Somebody's
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:05.520]  got to dig up. It's six or seven years ago, so it's hard to find. Headline, Rocky
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:10.920]  Mountain News, Governor, you know, Discusses or Governor says, Mass
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:15.160]  Incinerators and Graves ready for 15,000 a day. I think it's the headline. I mean,
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:19.840]  I've read that on air. We need to find that. Go ahead. Yeah. And you know, like I
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:23.280]  said, this is just kind of suspect. I have a feeling it's going on all around the
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:27.520]  country. And you know, this is where we need to call for the listeners to really
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:30.520]  do some investigative research and look and let's see where these things are
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:35.440]  turning up all because if there is a big terror attack or something of bird flu
[3:04:35.440 --> 3:04:39.600]  or a nuke, how come they were getting all these graves ready? Yes. And another
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:45.240]  point I have is actually if we could track down the locations of the that
[3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:48.480]  they're all over, then we kind of know that they're setting up for something.
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:53.360]  If there are just certain locations, you know, what that means as well. Stay there.
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:58.280]  More key questions and answers on the other side and Webster Tarpoli. Stay with
[3:04:58.280 --> 3:05:05.960]  us. Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has
[3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:09.440]  just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and
[3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:12.840]  herbs. It's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant
[3:05:12.840 --> 3:05:15.880]  growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under
[3:05:15.880 --> 3:05:19.240]  practically any soil and light conditions. Now, here's the best part for
[3:05:19.240 --> 3:05:22.520]  our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Proto grow's unique blend of
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:26.320]  sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set,
[3:05:26.320 --> 3:05:30.080]  creating maximum plant growth in minimum time. Proto grow works by providing
[3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:33.240]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for
[3:05:33.240 --> 3:05:36.600]  nutritional uptake in plants. Proto grow's full spectrum plant fertility means
[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:39.360]  fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste, enough to 10 times the
[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:42.600]  nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:46.520]  wheatgrass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hygrids,
[3:05:46.520 --> 3:05:50.160]  it's now easy. GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit
[3:05:50.160 --> 3:05:55.280]  the proto grow website at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com or
[3:05:55.280 --> 3:06:03.920]  call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. In the new world order's war against
[3:06:03.920 --> 3:06:09.200]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:14.480]  national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well
[3:06:14.480 --> 3:06:19.720]  funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:23.800]  for the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging,
[3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:27.800]  he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:32.480]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:38.280]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not
[3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:43.000]  about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:49.440]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[3:07:19.480 --> 3:07:23.360]  additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches,

[3:08:10.280 --> 3:08:14.760]  Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:15.760 --> 3:08:20.880]  Shepard Ambulus is our guest. He took the photos and wrote the story that we broke
[3:08:20.880 --> 3:08:25.320]  at infoawards.com. We appreciate him getting us that information. Send any
[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:32.820]  other photos of mass graves, plastic coffin liners being masked, mainstream news
[3:08:32.820 --> 3:08:36.760]  articles where they say they're getting ready for all of this. It just goes on
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:41.120]  and on and on. Continuing Shepard with other points that need to be made here.
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:47.800]  Well, you know, another thing that's noted is, you know, just the sheer size of the
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:53.040]  operation. There's there's several of these sections that were visible to me
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:58.320]  over the last 30 days. I know they've already covered up multiple sections
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:02.640]  and they've already put the earth over it and it and it looks just like nothing's
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:08.360]  there. There was about three of these sections exposed. You know, I would
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:12.520]  estimate that the sections are like something around like 800 or 1000 feet
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:18.760]  by a thousand feet just packed in there. The way they were excavated is just
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:26.560]  perfect cut down a straight wall. I mean, everything's just to a T. That's not
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:32.200]  how they build National Cemetery graves. They're single. The single coffins are
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:37.360]  crypts and they have space in between the little white crosses. I mean, this is
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:43.240]  this is just unbelievable and then going back to Jason Douglas. Jason, again, you
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:47.600]  talked to the director of it. You said it sounded like it was all prepared. He
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:51.120]  just didn't seem like it was out of ordinary that I was asking these
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:58.040]  questions at all. It definitely seemed like a prepared statement. Yeah, I
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:01.720]  wouldn't doubt it. And you know, obviously they're gearing up for
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:05.560]  something. We know what New World Order is up to and you know, thanks to shows
[3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:09.520]  like the Alec Stone Show. You know, everything's starting to get exposed
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:14.080]  and hopefully these criminals won't be able to continue with their
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:18.280]  plan. Now we're looking at some video here. I know this video was coming in. Is
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:26.800]  this is this... Oh, this is trucks delivering coffins or is this
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:32.080]  Shepard's video? What is this we're putting on screen right now? Okay, Rob
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:37.400]  do just send it to us. Yeah, this is... Yeah, this is the... Is this the video you
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:43.760]  sent us? That's probably my video, Alex. That's the first footage I had. We were
[3:10:43.760 --> 3:10:48.160]  just driving around through there. No, it's good. This is very... No, this is
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:50.920]  great footage. Don't apologize for anything. You're doing a great job. Now we
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:57.640]  now see the mass graves side by side, the containers. This is just incredible.
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:03.560]  Please continue with any other points. You know, I mean, they have... I've seen
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:08.360]  numbers spray painted on these things up to like 800. Obviously, there's over a
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:16.880]  thousand. Like I said, just you know, also, you know, it just... I wanted to
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:20.200]  let you know someone. I went to... You know, I'm highly aware of the New World Order.
[3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:25.600]  I listen to your show every day. You know, you're a big inspiration for me.
[3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:31.320]  Being conditioned to all this and then going and actually filming it, I wanted
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:35.880]  the listeners to know that when I was actually filming it, afterwards, I
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:42.480]  actually threw up because it was so gut-wrenching to view this and just to
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:48.520]  know what it is and just to know what they're up to. No, it is... It is disgusting
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:53.440]  and I've gotten nauseous before as well to realize... Like, I got nauseous. I didn't
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:56.320]  throw up during Bohemian Grove because it was just a play, but that's what
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:11:59.760]  religion comes from, is the stylized ritual. And I was, you know, in the crowd
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:04.120]  like at church and the preachers are up there on stage, but the old man going,
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:10.640]  hey... Around me, this was religious rapture and it was a horrible vibe.
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:14.160]  And I know what you're talking about, just to realize, my God, there's things I
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:17.440]  didn't know about in this world. This world is a lot stranger than people know.
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:23.920]  Absolutely, Alex. Yes, that's true. Yeah, and I mean, it just really hit me hard
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:29.680]  and I decided, you know, I got it. I got it exposed and, you know, I'm working on
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:35.120]  another story and I'll let you guys know as soon as I get it more done,
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:40.960]  but this other thing's even more compelling than this and I hope to get
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:45.520]  that to you guys as well. Oh man, now I've really... You've picked my interest. Can
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:50.040]  you give us a hint? Well, let's just say it has to do with United States post
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:54.800]  offices. Well, we know those are going to be used as mass inoculation centers.
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:59.680]  That's been in mainstream news. Is that what it deals with? Absolutely, and, you
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:05.000]  know, let me just give you a little hint. Listers can go around and check this out
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:09.640]  for themselves. I've been checking out various post offices in the Phoenix
[3:13:09.640 --> 3:13:13.520]  natural area and let me tell you something. I came up with some
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:19.120]  startling discoveries that the barbed wire fences on these post offices point
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:23.000]  inward, just like concentration camps. Well, that's what Congress has admitted,
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:26.720]  is that they'll use existing federal locations and they'll use Walmart
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:31.000]  distribution centers as FEMA camps. That's come out mainstream news. We reported
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:33.400]  it back when it was secret and then a few years later it came out. Oh, they're
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:36.960]  prepared for mass inoculations and this will be a staging area for you and now
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:41.400]  they admit, oh, we've got FEMA camps, but it's to take care of you. We love you.
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:45.760]  And then, I mean, look at this article. Marines embedded at LA County Coroner's
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:48.480]  Office. See, it's always, oh, they're helping at drunk driver checkpoints in
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:51.600]  Southern California. Oh, there was a mass shooting. The Army was there helping.
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:55.800]  Regular Army. Oh, they're taking over the public schools and making them a military
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:14:01.040]  academies. Oh, it says the Marines are going to be embedded in groups in the LA
[3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:04.920]  County Coroner's Office, but just to learn about dead bodies. See, it's just, oh,
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:09.640]  they're just liaison officers in the police intelligence bureaus. What is it
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:13.120]  like, Jason, since you've been working here a few months because, I mean, you
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:16.560]  weren't too aware of the work we did here. I guess you were someone I forget, but
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:20.000]  the point is, is it now really living it where you see it every day? I mean, we're
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:24.880]  not making this up, are we? No, none of this is made up. It's just crazy to see
[3:14:24.880 --> 3:14:28.920]  because you hear one isolated story, maybe two isolated stories, but when you
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.120]  start seeing the master plan forming together, that's when things really take
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:37.520]  shape and you realize, you know, this isn't normal. And every time you talk to
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:41.680]  someone, that's, that's all they want to play off. This is absolutely normal. We
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:45.560]  do this all the time. Yeah, I mean, the armies in Iowa are going to do a door to
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:48.360]  door gun confiscation drill. The citizens are happy. We're going to practice
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:52.480]  locking the town of Arcadia down and going after guns. I mean, and business as
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:55.920]  usual, the governor of Illinois announced the military is going to do gun
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:59.400]  sweeps door to door all over the state. It's normal. I mean, you know, oh, yeah,
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:03.120]  you know, the Phoenix newspaper admits the police say we're ready to work with
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:05.920]  the troops against the American people. You know, that was in the Phoenix
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:09.320]  business journal. It's just hundreds of these reports and the Army War College
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:12.640]  says our new missions fighting the American people. Me, all in the nightly
[3:15:12.640 --> 3:15:15.080]  news, it's the troops are going to fight all kind of the troops will be on the
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:18.320]  streets to fight all kind of or they introduce Obama's takeover as oh,
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:21.640]  soup kitchens. Then you read the thing. It's his law enforcement, you know, seven
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:26.240]  million person army. Jason Douglas, thank you for being with us and thank you
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:30.880]  for working on this report. It was great having your thank you. You bet. And I
[3:15:30.880 --> 3:15:36.560]  want to thank you for what you're doing, Shepard Ambulus, and we'll talk to you
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:39.880]  in the near future as this develops. We'll also post the video you just sent us
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:42.840]  in the article that Kurt Nemo posted that you wrote and we're going to add
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:46.800]  some of the plastic coffin videos and some of the others to it. Anything else
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:51.640]  you'd like to say in closing? Not really, you know, just I encourage the listeners
[3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:57.440]  to do a little bit of investigating in their local areas and let's see what
[3:15:57.440 --> 3:16:01.000]  we can come up with. And I'd like to give out an email address if I could. So
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  people could also forward tips or information to me on this subject.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:10.480]  All right, good to hear from you. We'll talk to you in the near future. Be safe.
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:15.160]  Okay, thank you. You're about to go with God. Okay, I apologize to Webster
[3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:20.320]  Tarple getting him on 15 minutes late. Always appreciate him coming on the show
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:25.040]  every few weeks to break down the latest Obama activities, you know. A year ago,
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:30.000]  plus when Tarpley, I really respect as a historian and researcher, pioneering
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:35.040]  researcher said Obama is going to totally roll out with national drafts and
[3:16:35.040 --> 3:16:38.840]  youth squads and a private army immediately. I was like, yeah, I know they
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:42.040]  want to do that, but it's going to be hard. And when he talked about how they
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:45.120]  were going to hype things up, you know, with Russia and move troops in, I was
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:49.400]  like, oh, come on, and it happened. You know, he said months before 888, he
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:53.520]  said Brzezinski and the Obama people are already in control of the Bush
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:56.640]  administration. They're going to attack Russia and it happened. You know, all of
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:17:00.320]  this and now they've passed in the House and Senate. They've got to bring it
[3:17:00.320 --> 3:17:03.680]  into conference now and complete it, but it's been passing by, you know, two
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:11.280]  thirds majorities, you know, 300 plus to 175 to 14 or 74 to 14 in the Senate. And
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:15.240]  it says compulsory service. I mean, and then when it's in the New York Times,
[3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:18.560]  they just say, oh, expanding AmeriCorps, like it's no big deal. You've got to
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:24.000]  read the bill to find this out. They're openly announcing trillions more for
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:27.040]  the bankers. A bank of the world will pay our carbon taxes to everything
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:32.760]  tarply. Who's the main figure? You know, there's Jesse Ventura and KRS one and
[3:17:32.760 --> 3:17:38.360]  Professor Griff and George Humphrey and Gerald Salente in the film. But the
[3:17:38.360 --> 3:17:44.200]  main voice is Webster Tarply. And the film is supernova. It's the number one
[3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:48.160]  film on the web bar none. There's a few clips of bikini girls that are getting
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:50.840]  over all more visits, you know, five minute things. But for films, it's number
[3:17:50.840 --> 3:17:55.360]  one out there. We've done reports on that and the Obama deception. So I want to get
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:58.440]  him on now that he's seen it to give you his review of the Obama deception, but
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:01.920]  also talk about the issues I just covered. So first, Webster, you were right.
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:04.920]  You were 100% right. In fact, it's worse than what you said, which is hard to
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:10.360]  believe. Comment on what's currently happening and where you see this going
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:14.320]  in the future. Well, let me say, first of all, I have to congratulate you for the
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:18.600]  Obama deception. You and your team have put together what is nothing short of a
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:22.240]  masterpiece. It's the best political documentary to come out of the United
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:28.960]  States in many years, maybe many decades. And I say that having seen quite a
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:33.880]  few of them. It is a tremendous piece of work. And I think it's just what was
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:39.800]  needed to crystallize a kind of vague unease that a lot of people have who
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:43.720]  don't really follow politics or economics. But it's a tremendous
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:47.840]  achievement. And if it's gone viral, then more power to you. And that's a
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:52.160]  that's a big turning point because we're what are we about two thirds of the way
[3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:56.280]  through the hundred days. I think the key thing with Obama is to just to
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:19:00.680]  checkmate him. It's to stop him, right? To bog him down. Don't let him get this
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:05.440]  cap and trade of attacks of $700 billion on production, because that's what
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:09.440]  this comes down to. Cap and trade means we're going to let the financiers run
[3:19:09.440 --> 3:19:14.080]  wild, but we're going to impose this extra burden on any kind of production,
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:18.440]  any farmer who runs a tractor, anybody who commutes to work, the whole realm of
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:23.200]  physical economy as distinct from the crazy. This is the this is the paper
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:28.680]  casino economy, waging war on what's left of the real economy. Right. It's
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:33.040]  counteract your draining your blood so that the derivatives can live and the
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:36.840]  any kind of production and therefore human life can die. So we've got we've
[3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:40.320]  got that entire thing and then of course we've got this this sort of fascist
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:47.760]  or neo-fascist compulsory labor core and and national services they call it
[3:19:47.760 --> 3:19:51.160]  national service, but they take a Wall Street because that's that's who you're
[3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:55.720]  going to be. Stay there and we pay our carbon taxes now admitted in hundreds of
[3:19:55.720 --> 3:19:57.840]  papers to the bankers who engineered all this.
[3:19:57.840 --> 3:20:02.640]  Webster Tarpley, stay there. Obama starting to bog down. Hello, this is Steve
[3:20:02.640 --> 3:20:06.280]  Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:09.800]  decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food. If
[3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:13.720]  you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct. If you
[3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:17.880]  agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:22.240]  climatologists who know the earth is cooling, don't call eFoods direct. If you
[3:20:22.240 --> 3:20:26.120]  think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food. If you
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:29.200]  think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:32.960]  yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct. If you believe the
[3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:37.160]  official report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings on the
[3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:41.400]  Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct. For the rest of you, go

[3:20:57.600 --> 3:21:07.120]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:12.440]  spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:16.840]  think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[3:21:16.840 --> 3:21:20.800]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. Well,
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:25.440]  Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:29.600]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[3:21:29.600 --> 3:21:34.800]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:41.320]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:47.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:53.160]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:58.640]  download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception, the
[3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:05.160]  people strike back. Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources. March 25, 2009.
[3:22:05.160 --> 3:22:10.360]  Gold opened at 92170. A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 94829,
[3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:17.360]  47415 for the half ounce and 23727 for the quarter ounce. That's 94829, 47415,
[3:22:17.360 --> 3:22:22.960]  and 23727. How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric,
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:26.760]  engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit,
[3:22:26.760 --> 3:22:30.520]  then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at
[3:22:30.520 --> 3:22:34.600]  interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt? Is this capitalism or
[3:22:34.600 --> 3:22:38.680]  was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:42.040]  a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:22:42.040 --> 3:22:45.960]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how
[3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:51.480]  the monetary system works. Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.

[3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:06.120]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's
[3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:11.400]  been in over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[3:23:11.400 --> 3:23:16.000]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:20.960]  these difficult and trying times. You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:26.200]  spray available at MrDefense.com. DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market

[3:24:00.600 --> 3:24:20.600]  All right, Webster Tartley is our guest. When you get the Obama deception,
[3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:25.280]  infowars.com. We've got both his books on Obama for sale with it. Discounted at
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:28.600]  infowars.com. When you call his whole free number, be sure to ask about those
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:35.600]  discounts. You can get those there as well in the Combo. 888-253-3139. You see,
[3:24:35.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  if you attack Obama from a right-wing perspective, Rush Limbaugh stuff, that's
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:44.360]  all discredited. That actually makes his supporters support him more in the false
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:47.440]  left-right paradigm. But if you go after him as an elitist, notice he always
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:51.400]  frames himself as he's fighting Wall Street. He's fighting corruption. He's
[3:24:51.400 --> 3:24:55.720]  fighting special interest. He needs his 13 million goons and a 7 million army.
[3:24:55.720 --> 3:24:59.040]  That's now in the New York Times to go out and intimidate Congress and the
[3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:03.800]  governors and the states. And we see, depending on the poll, 15 to 22-point
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:09.040]  drops now in the first two months or less of his administration. Exactly what
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:13.120]  Webster said was key to stopping. But then we know, and I can see this on all the
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:17.360]  cards, to get things going again, a new war or a staged terror attack so you can
[3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:21.000]  grandstand. And I know you're, and Tartley, you said this a year ago, we'd
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:24.240]  hear about austerity and how great it was. And we've got a sacrifice that went
[3:25:24.240 --> 3:25:27.880]  from hope and change to, I'm gonna take it out of your hide for the bankers. So
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:33.160]  please speak to those points. Well, Obama met with the Washington Post editorial
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:37.040]  board on the Thursday before the inauguration, and he said, well, the
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:41.360]  slogans now are going to be sacrifice, duty, and responsibility. And that means
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:47.600]  that you, as an individual, are required to sacrifice your health care, your
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:53.240]  economic rights, to prop up 1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble and to
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:57.800]  keep these zombie bankers in business. I mean, you look at Wall Street, right?
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:03.200]  You've got Blank Fine of Goldman Sachs, Pandit of Citibank, Diamond of JP Morgan
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.760]  Chase, Lewis of Bank of America, Mack of Morgan Stanley. Those are the big five.
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:13.280]  And they've got a very large part of the world derivatives bubble, the
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:18.400]  derivatives black hole. And if you're gonna slap a $660 billion
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:22.560]  tax on production, because that's what it means. Or, you know, even just
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:28.520]  a lawnmower, a car, anything that you're gonna drive, your commute, that's
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:33.600]  gonna go directly to these leeches and lampreys in Wall Street. Those are, by
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:38.240]  the way, the same people who bid up the price of gas last summer. When gas was
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:43.240]  at $450 to $5, you were paying $1 to Blank Fine of Goldman Sachs and Mack
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:47.120]  of Morgan Stanley. Just the two of them were getting a dollar for every gallon
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:51.000]  that you were buying. So now we've got cap and trade. Now, a lot of people have
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:54.680]  noted this has been one of the most severe winters in the Northern Hemisphere
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:26:59.680]  in a long time, but these fanatics are undeterred. These are Malthusian zero
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:06.520]  growth genocidal lunatics. I want to cite an advisor to Obama's mentor, Gordon
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:10.560]  Brown, right, the British Prime Minister. There's an advisor to the British
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:15.120]  government who says, 60 billion people in the British Isles is too much. We're
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:19.880]  gonna cut that in half to 30 million. Yeah, that was the times of London.
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:24.880]  Two days ago, we're seeing headlines in the U.S. and foreign press. Babies are
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:29.760]  carbon monsters and there needs to be a tax on having children. That's what the
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:34.280]  U.N. and others in the Malthusian eugenicists funded China to do in 75
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:39.440]  first attacks. Then in 1981, it became law. They are now pushing, as we cover an
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:45.120]  end game, the one child policy. And on top of that, White House to hunt for new
[3:27:45.120 --> 3:27:49.240]  tax revenues, Wall Street Journal, and they admit they're gonna get rid of for
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:55.400]  even low income, not $250,000 with two people in the house, $125,000 and up. But
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:00.800]  everybody, they're gonna take away basically all or reduce all of the tax
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:07.120]  write-offs. So, I mean, he promised no new taxes. Boy, is he a liar? Yeah, the
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:12.320]  carbon, the cap and trade, carbon tax, it's the same thing, is essentially, he
[3:28:12.320 --> 3:28:15.520]  says it's gonna be two-thirds of a trillion, probably gonna be more like a
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:18.720]  trillion when you get done with it. A tax on production. So, we have this
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:24.840]  situation where $10 trillion, supported by Obama, supported by Geithner, Bernanke,
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:30.540]  and Geithner is the key link between the Bush regime and Paulson and the
[3:28:30.540 --> 3:28:35.680]  current one. So, $8 trillion, $8 to $9 trillion from the Fed, $1 to $2 trillion
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:40.480]  and counting from the Treasury. So, $10 trillion as a subsidy for the derivatives
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:46.160]  bubble and the zombie bankers. And by my count, the actual useful spending, which
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:51.160]  is mostly in the emergency relief area, there's some infrastructure, but not
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:56.440]  very much. It's about $300 billion. So, it's about 30 to 1. $30 for the
[3:28:56.440 --> 3:29:01.040]  bankers, for every $1 of crumbs that falls to us here below the table. And I
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:04.560]  want to congratulate you on what you said about the Limbaugh critique.
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:09.800]  Obama loves the Limbaugh critique. He can't get enough of it. He wants more. He
[3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:14.200]  wants Limbaugh to attack him more. Limbaugh this afternoon had a woman on
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:19.040]  his show. She said, I can't live on less than $750,000 here in New York, because I
[3:29:19.040 --> 3:29:23.640]  got four kids in private school. And how dare you take away my money from the
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:28.320]  derivatives merchant, right? So, this Obama loves, because the poor, poor person
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:33.520]  who's living on 20 or 30,000 minimum wage jobs. Here's that. It creates class
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:36.640]  in between the middle class and the working class, never realizing the elite.
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:42.240]  And Obama memos have come out that they are running against Rush Limbaugh.
[3:29:42.240 --> 3:29:45.680]  Long segment coming up. Stay there, Webster. Let's talk about how we further
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:51.120]  derail and shoot down this Malthusian agenda.
[3:29:51.120 --> 3:30:00.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:06.320]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in

[3:31:00.680 --> 3:31:06.320]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of
[3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:10.920]  the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[3:31:10.920 --> 3:31:16.920]  powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[3:31:16.920 --> 3:31:20.760]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[3:31:20.760 --> 3:31:26.000]  people. While Obama's already fudging, yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:30.360]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who
[3:31:30.360 --> 3:31:35.680]  is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:31:35.680 --> 3:31:40.600]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:31:40.600 --> 3:31:47.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:18.800]  Webster Tarpoli is our guest. We're gonna go right back to him in just a
[3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:26.080]  moment. But before I do that, I wanted to tell you about a few of the sponsors
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:29.600]  that make this radio show possible. Obviously, when you buy the books and
[3:33:29.600 --> 3:33:33.440]  videos and materials off my site, not just the films and books I've made or

[3:33:36.320 --> 3:33:40.080]  activists out there and researchers and true journalists like Webster Tarpoli.
[3:33:40.080 --> 3:33:43.960]  Please get the Obama deception and I'm gonna get Webster in his own words. I
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:46.800]  don't know what he's gonna say, but he's got great ideas how to get it out to
[3:33:46.800 --> 3:33:51.960]  people to have viewing parties, show at the library or school. This film is
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:56.360]  deprogramming Obama zombies, so the Obama deception and info wars.com. Also
[3:33:56.360 --> 3:34:00.960]  survivalseedbank.com. In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the

[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:07.160]  ones. There have been times in American history, pilgrim, for example, when seeds
[3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:11.000]  had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold. There's a war on
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:15.240]  against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:19.600]  controlling the food supply. Governments are storing seeds. The UN is storing
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:23.320]  seeds. Globals of every stripe are storing seeds in the Arctic Circle. Why do
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:26.720]  you think they're doing this? You know why control. Solutions from science is
[3:34:26.720 --> 3:34:30.640]  trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands into the hands of the people. One

[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:06.560]  endorsing that I've used and believe in. All right, going back to Webster
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:12.440]  Tarpley. Webster, earlier I made the point, and I was able to make the call on 9-11.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:16.720]  You've made a lot of other calls. Just integrating the propaganda, the balance
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:20.800]  of power, how their agenda is working. He tried to get 13 million people out on
[3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:23.720]  the streets. He only got about 4 million. That was called a failure. That's still
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:27.560]  very dangerous because they're trying to double that number. Now they're moving.
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:30.560]  As you know, they just passed. It's going into conference now, but the House
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:36.680]  and Senate have both passed it. Total draft of everybody, basically. Military for 18-25.
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:42.200]  Unspeakable level. The liberal press. New York Times. No one's reporting it. They
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:49.400]  just say, oh, a new volunteer thing. Isn't it great? But it says mandatory. That's
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:57.720]  happening. So he is slowing. The juggernaut is slowing. The diversion of 165 million
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:37:03.880]  to AIG is a diversion, but it still showed that he'd written the executive order for
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:09.440]  the loopholes for all the companies, tens of billions in bonuses, and that the guy
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:17.240]  whose wife works in a big company for AIG, Senator Dodd, was saying he was against the
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:22.720]  bailout money being used for bonuses when he actually wrote the clause to Mirror Obama.
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:25.320]  Then they started turning against each other saying, well, you told me to. Well, you told
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:30.680]  me to. So speak to that. So speak to false flag terror and the big scandals of the public's
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:37.960]  mad at 165 million, what about 10 trillion? And how we further get the word out and derail
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:38.960]  this guy?
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:46.160]  Yeah, maybe we can start with this AIG. Obama has a glass jaw. If you're attacking him from
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:51.640]  the left, and that's the key. When Obama had a healthcare summit, he wanted to ban the
[3:37:51.640 --> 3:37:56.120]  people who were going to advocate a single payer, basically Medicare for all or Medicare
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:38:01.000]  for anybody who wants it. And they threatened to picket him. And he said, oh, no, I can't
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:04.400]  do that. I've got to let you in. He didn't let them speak, but he let them in. Then
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:09.880]  on AIG, we had Bernanke in the Congress, the Senate hearing saying, I won't tell you who
[3:38:09.880 --> 3:38:16.080]  got the AIG money. This means the big money, the tens of billions. And then you had Cohen,
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:21.480]  KOHM, this guy who's Bernanke's deputy, a couple of days later at the Dodd-Shellby committee,
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:26.880]  and he wouldn't tell who got the money. And that then exploded. And Obama had to cave on
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:27.880]  that one.
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:34.280]  So now we find that the big money of AIG, not the 160 million or 200 million of bonuses,
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:42.040]  bad as that is, but the 160 billion of derivatives bailout. Remember, this is the AIG London
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:46.840]  branch, their hedge fund, their financial products division, working with derivatives,
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:51.440]  derivatives, credit default swaps, and other derivatives, collateralized debt obligations,
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:56.200]  three trillion of those, more than the gross national product of France and any number
[3:38:56.200 --> 3:39:01.280]  of other countries. And out of that money, we find that 10 or 12 billion went to Goldman
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:07.920]  Sachs, always high on the list of beneficiaries, 10 billion to Barclays Bank in Britain, 10
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:14.080]  billion to Deutsche Bank in Berlin and Frankfurt, and 10 billion to Société Générale of France.
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:21.000]  So foreign bankers that we know of, get 30 to 35 billion of U.S. taxpayer funds in order
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:26.600]  to bail out their derivatives holdings. Now you'd have to say, if Gordon Brown and Sarkozy
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:33.200]  and Madame Merkel are so concerned about these banks in their countries, why don't they bail
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:39.080]  them out and let the U.S. alone on this? But you see, these are globalized investment
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:44.200]  bankers and that's how they operate. So AIG, the business with the bonuses is really a
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:48.480]  diversion, but it's also the fact that the culture, I think, is changing. And this has
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:53.240]  been, I think, in many ways, a watershed for Obama that people are beginning to sense.
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:56.720]  Some of the smarter people are sensing that Obama is a tool of wall speed. I'll give
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:02.600]  you some examples. Paul Krugman, okay? Princeton Nobel Prize. He says, the zombie ideas have
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:09.600]  won and Obama is going with a cash for trash program. This is the Geithner bailout, the
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:16.560]  second trillion announced earlier this week by Geithner. So zombie ideas, cash for trash,
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:22.440]  and it's all the same stuff from Paul Krugman, recycled now for the third time, says Krugman.
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:29.120]  Galbraith at the University of Texas, he says, this is a massively corrupted banking system
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:35.040]  and he basically says, seize the zombie banks and put them out of existence. And he says,
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:38.640]  increase social security pensions by one third. Now that's a step in the right direction.
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:43.280]  I would say double social security pensions because you're not going to have a 401k and
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:47.280]  you're not going to have anything else. So that's already something. And by the way,
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:53.600]  the 10 trillion bucks, and Bloomberg's reported this, would pay off 90% of the mortgages, massively
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:41:00.040]  increased social security because of inflation. So we always hear on the fake right wing radio,
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:04.200]  oh, it's all about welfare. That's where all the money goes. That's a tiny percent. Everything
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:09.880]  is going to the offshore, new world order banks who literally, as you said, are sucking
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:16.680]  the entire world dry and trying to put carbon taxes on industry to further enslave them paid
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:21.680]  directly to the bankers. I mean, this is such an outrageous plan. How will they get away
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:27.800]  with it as it's already stalling without staging terror attacks? Webster, I feel one,
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:31.720]  I feel one. I did talk about that. I think they're about to hit us hard.
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:35.640]  Well, we're going to have this, we're going to have a 20 to 30 foot fireball here at the
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:42.320]  Key Bridge across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. this afternoon now. I don't know whether
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:47.240]  this has gone off yet or not, but they say it's for a film, but people driving along,
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:50.480]  you know, the George Washington Parkway on one side of the White Horse Freeway on the
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:56.040]  other here in D.C., they're going to see a 30 foot fireball in the middle of the Potomac.
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:00.960]  It's supposed to be some ships, some small boats, and one of them blows up as part of
[3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:06.640]  a movie, I think, for CBS. Yes, that's very, very much in the air. Anyway, these left liberals,
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:11.120]  Krugman, Galbraith, Greider, Greider of Rolling Stone, typical left liberal.
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:14.480]  He wrote a book attacking us. He wrote a book last year attacking us saying there's no new
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:18.440]  world order. Now he writes a thing called The Big Takeover and says it's a power takeover
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:20.880]  by the banks. What is that flip-flop?
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:25.800]  Well, what they're trying to do, of course, many of these people, Greider, I think, is
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:29.520]  a good example. He's trying to have a fake opposition that will be controlled, so there
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:35.280]  won't be a real opposition. You can also look at Madame Stasanopoulos Huffington, the rich
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:41.240]  elitist oligarch out there in California with her Huffington Post website. She's attempting
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:49.120]  to become the fake controlled opposition to the Obama regime. I guess there are various
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:54.840]  Air America personalities in the same ballpark. Frank Richard, The New York Times, says that
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:43:00.840]  AIG is Obama's Katrina. So you see the idea. Yes, I think there is a great danger. We know
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:07.320]  that with Obama in office, the door to false flag is now wide open, and you've got, for
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:15.240]  example, they're meddling in Sudan. They have indicted General Bashir of Sudan for crimes
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:22.360]  against humanity, basically genocide, and you've got this venomous vampire, Susan Rice,
[3:43:22.360 --> 3:43:29.320]  at the United Nations. This is an apostle of extermination. This is a woman who was implicated
[3:43:29.320 --> 3:43:36.040]  in the great genocide in the Rwanda Burundi and Congo, Uganda area in the mid-90s, and
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:40.360]  now she's back. She's very influential with Obama, and she's leading the charge in the
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:46.040]  United Nations to overthrow the regime in Sudan. And you predicted that a year ago. You predicted
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:49.960]  that they knew that blackface to go into Africa. Going back to false flag terror and continue
[3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:55.760]  with your analysis, we get the word out about false flag terror. I mean, what are your ideas
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:43:59.920]  to counter this? Because clearly they need this to continue the agenda, and every time
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:02.040]  their agenda stalls, they stage terror attacks.
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:09.600]  Yeah, look at the question of Sudan. What I think is likely is that the next round, whenever
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:15.120]  that is, will come equipped with different targets, naturally. I think Sudan is a pretty
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:16.120]  big target right now.
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:21.120]  We see the Pentagon already saying that African terrorists are going to hit our bases in Africa
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:25.040]  or the Middle East or the U.S. So I agree with you. I see them saying, now we've got
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:28.120]  to invade Africa. The terrorist hit us.
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:34.320]  And of course, the secret is that China gets 6, 7, 8% of their oil supply from Sudan, and
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:38.880]  that's the reason. It's got nothing to do with humanitarian stuff. You also have to
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:43.120]  remember the reason that the genocide, there is undoubtedly genocide in the Sahel region
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:47.880]  of Africa all across the southern edge of the Sahara, but that's because there's a world
[3:44:47.880 --> 3:44:49.400]  economic depression.
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:53.860]  What do you think happened to those guys when the price of gasoline went to $150, or a boil
[3:44:53.860 --> 3:44:58.280]  went to $150 a gallon? I mean, they've got to have gasoline there, too, right? If their
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:02.840]  tractors and trucks run on the same thing as tractors or trucks anywhere else. So the
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:07.840]  depression, and I think that's also got something to do with Mexico, the internal collapse of
[3:45:07.840 --> 3:45:14.400]  Mexico, is also a feature of a world economic breakdown crisis and global economic collapse,
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:16.800]  which is going on and on, and it's not influenced by...
[3:45:16.800 --> 3:45:20.720]  Well, we've seen Iceland fall. We've seen Argentina fall. We've seen three nations
[3:45:20.720 --> 3:45:26.080]  fall or partially fall in Eastern Europe. Are you seeing that accelerate?
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:30.520]  Well, I think so. And the problem is we don't know. I mean, the average pretend the last
[3:45:30.520 --> 3:45:37.040]  10 years is that 40,000 people die in the third world every day of malnutrition starvation
[3:45:37.040 --> 3:45:40.480]  and diseases like diarrhea that can be cured for about $0.50.
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:44.120]  And the carbon tax they admit will double that.
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:50.520]  Yeah. You can... I saw an item on the internet lately where somebody said, if you try to
[3:45:50.520 --> 3:45:55.480]  bring Africa up to a US or European standard of living, what would that mean? And some
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:58.560]  journalists said, well, you can't do that. That would be bad for the planet. In other
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:04.080]  words, you simply can't have development in Africa and South Asia if you're going to
[3:46:04.080 --> 3:46:09.920]  have this lunatic obsession with global warming, which, of course, is a pseudo-scientific fraud
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:15.280]  developed by Al Gore, not even by Al Gore, but by these circles around Prince Charles.
[3:46:15.280 --> 3:46:22.000]  We're back on them. Yes, exactly. Club of Rome and all that. This guy Holdren. I want
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:25.920]  to point to somebody that he deserves more attention than he's getting. He's the White
[3:46:25.920 --> 3:46:33.600]  House science advisor to Obama. And he talks about something called de-development. In
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:39.280]  other words, countries that have reached the level of industrial society have to go backward.
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:44.440]  And if you're talking about taking an industrial society and pitching it back into a post-industrial
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:49.520]  or non-industrial one, which is what is largely happening and has happened in the United States,
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:54.160]  the implications of this are genocide because you get a situation in technical terms where
[3:46:54.160 --> 3:46:59.040]  the relative potential population density of the country falls below the population.
[3:46:59.040 --> 3:47:04.000]  So it means there's an overhang that can't be sustained, of people, of us, the rest of us.
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:09.440]  Holdren talks de-development. There's an interesting article in Forbes where they talk about the
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:14.640]  Central Valley of California. It's one of the greatest agricultural production areas
[3:47:14.640 --> 3:47:20.000]  in the world. If you've ever been down there at the Imperial Valley, El Centro, California,
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:24.320]  Palm Springs, California. And they say one degree in temperature increase will wipe
[3:47:24.320 --> 3:47:29.680]  all that out when all the studies actually show it'll increase yield. Yeah, then this is making
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:35.840]  the desert blue, making the desert into just a tremendously valuable area of agricultural
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:41.520]  production. The commitment of the environmental fanatics and Malthusian elitists and basically
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:47.920]  genocidalists in the Obama regime is to shut down agriculture in the Central Valley of California.
[3:47:47.920 --> 3:47:51.760]  Because when the banks bankrupt everything, they get to consolidate power.
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:57.920]  Right. And in addition to the banking, which is the main thing, of course, that's what holds
[3:47:57.920 --> 3:48:03.120]  this whole thing together, there's also the element of a fanatical anti-human ideology,
[3:48:03.120 --> 3:48:10.320]  that is to say, as you quoted before, a baby is a carbon machine that is a human being is nothing
[3:48:10.320 --> 3:48:15.760]  but a source of carbon pollution. I mean, that gets you into the area of high crimes against
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:21.360]  humanity, the Nuremberg Code, and all the issues of... Well, did you see the other environmental
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:26.720]  minister in England say, your water footprint's too big? And so we're going to restrict everybody's
[3:48:26.720 --> 3:48:31.680]  water when everybody knows England is one of the most water-rich countries in the world and have
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:38.720]  never even charged people for their water usage because it's such a wet aisle. It's just... Take...
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:45.040]  Here's a microcosm. Nine years ago, eight years ago, Enron documents came out later. They in some
[3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:49.920]  days will make a billion dollars in overcharging. They had fake energy trading boards. They would
[3:48:49.920 --> 3:48:55.040]  show the congressmen that would come through on tours and they said in their memos, we've got to
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:49:02.480]  double and triple prices just to have profits. So we will turn the power off an hour a day to create
[3:49:02.480 --> 3:49:07.680]  the illusion of artificial scarcity so they'll accept the jacking up prices and now they're doing
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:11.760]  that with water in California. The environmental groups have shut off all the reservoirs for,
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:17.920]  you know, some fish or darter, some made-up snail, some kangaroo rat, and listen, I've been to
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:23.440]  smart growth conferences, Webster. They brag there. It's a scam. They... I would even call them fanatics.
[3:49:23.440 --> 3:49:29.840]  These are just criminals. Absolutely. But it's an anti-human ideology and I think people have
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:36.640]  got to get down to very basic things. Are you in favor of human civilization and human society?
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:42.880]  Yes or no? If the answer is yes, then other things become less important. But if you really think
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:47.680]  that the human society has to be run for the alleged benefit of polar bears, snail daughters,
[3:49:47.680 --> 3:49:55.040]  horned owls, and indeed wolves, or God knows what, sharks even, then you really put yourself
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:50:00.640]  beyond the pale and, again, you're in the area of the Nuremberg Code because to deny any population
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:05.840]  group essential food, shelter, clothing, medical care, this is a high crime against humanity.
[3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:11.120]  This was the issue at Nuremberg in 19... And now the UN has said they will vote for caribou and
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:17.520]  roaches and so it's really about people outvoting the general public saying they represent animals
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:22.160]  Meanwhile, there's all sorts of real environmental degradation that they use the phony environmental
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:28.400]  movement as a smoke screen for. Yeah, naturally, questions of pollution are, of course, are real
[3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:34.480]  and they're questions of real toxic pollution in many parts of the world, including in the US.
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:40.400]  But the question of clean water and clean air for human beings is not what these people are about.
[3:50:40.400 --> 3:50:46.720]  They're essentially about the idea of turning the clock back to the dark ages. They say neo-futilism
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:50.080]  surfed them and Tarpoli's done his separate research, found the same findings. I've done
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:50:54.400]  separate research, found the findings. Dr. Montee, I mean, this is the truth we're telling you.
[3:50:54.400 --> 3:51:18.400]  The final segment with Webster Tarpoli straight ahead. Stay the course. We'll be right back infowars.com.
[3:51:24.400 --> 3:51:34.400]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpoli.
[3:51:54.400 --> 3:52:13.120]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:18.560]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:27.840]  the best interest of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:52:27.840 --> 3:52:34.320]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[3:52:34.320 --> 3:52:41.760]  oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:49.440]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy
[3:52:49.440 --> 3:52:56.880]  of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv,
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:53:04.400]  the Obama deception. The people strike back. More than 700 chemicals have been found in our
[3:53:04.400 --> 3:53:08.560]  drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:12.960]  hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[3:53:12.960 --> 3:53:18.560]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:24.000]  hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:29.760]  the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:35.040]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:40.240]  facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you?
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:46.720]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:27.920]  Those of us that love freedom, human decency, creativity, honor, we have to stand against
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:31.360]  the evil, as Thomas Jefferson said, because all the evil men and
[3:54:31.360 --> 3:54:38.560]  tirelessly to flourish is that good men and women do nothing. That's why I'm turning the heat up.
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:42.640]  I'm going to make a whole nother Obama film in the next two and a half months. It's going to come
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:48.960]  out July 4th, ladies and gentlemen. Say the name of the film next week and the tales I've already
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:55.520]  written the film, collating the latest data into it. Get the Obama deception today. The Obama
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:55:00.400]  deception. I want to close the show out here because on the phone you've just been ranting and
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:03.840]  raving about it and I'm really pleased. You usually just hand out compliments like this
[3:55:03.840 --> 3:55:09.840]  and I respect your view. You also consulted and are in the film and I've heard your own radio
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:13.920]  show a few Saturdays ago. You were going over it in the last few minutes. How important is the
[3:55:13.920 --> 3:55:18.240]  Obama deception? How effective because it doesn't come from a left wing or right wing. It shows
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:23.680]  the big picture as you called it reality, reality-based information, which is so rare today.
[3:55:23.680 --> 3:55:28.160]  How effective is the film? How should it be used? What should people be doing mobilizing with the
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:34.000]  Obama deception and then passing along your books as well as documentation? Well, again,
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:38.320]  it's a masterpiece. It's the best political documentary. They come out of the United States
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:45.360]  in, well, decades, I guess. And right now it's also timely. In other words, this is the moment
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:50.000]  to lose these illusions because you've got these opinion leaders, right, the various
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:54.720]  Crogman's Galbraiths. And it ties him to the bankers. It shows he's establishment, not
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:55:59.840]  anti-establishment. He is. He's not the New Deal. He's the anti-New Deal. He's not Roosevelt. He's
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:04.640]  the anti-Rosevelt. He is a puppet of these characters, blank fine of Goldman Sachs,
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:09.840]  Mac of Morgan Stanley, Diamond of J.P. Morgan Chase, Lewis of Bank of America,
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:16.400]  and the American people. But he needs to be attacked by the right wing. That empowers him.
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:20.960]  Right. That gives him left cover. What is changing now is that the crimes of Bush were
[3:56:20.960 --> 3:56:27.280]  conducted under right-wing cover. 9-11, war on terror, bring it on, all the rest of this nonsense.
[3:56:27.840 --> 3:56:35.360]  Now with Obama, it's not any of that. I'm Obama the savior. I'm the Messiah. I have left cover.
[3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:40.720]  And, for example, he's a much more effective union buster. One of the things he's been talking
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:45.520]  about lately is busting the teachers' union here in Washington, D.C. in New York and Chicago.
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:50.560]  He's got this union buster, Arnie Duncan, as Secretary of Education. That guy's going to try
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:53.840]  to destroy every teacher's union in the U.S. because they're determined to destroy the
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:57.440]  bank. Well, this is what corporate leaders do. All their new taxes are going to destroy the
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:03.920]  mill, the real economy, the middle class. The bankers know that. They want a fire sale. They
[3:57:03.920 --> 3:57:08.960]  want, just like they go into corporations and use naked shorts to drive them down to buy them up.
[3:57:08.960 --> 3:57:14.720]  These guys are piratical wreckers. Right. And the idea is that they're in the
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:19.760]  well-advanced into destroying the UAW. So we're going to go from the traditional American economy
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:25.120]  is a high-wage economy. And that's exactly what you want. Skilled labor, high-quality,
[3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:30.080]  high-value-added, energy-intensive... Complex economy. Well, in closing specifically,
[3:57:30.080 --> 3:57:35.360]  what should folks do with the Obama deception? Well, obviously, buy it, distribute it according
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:42.160]  to the conditions of sale, right, and get it out, and try to build this into a backlash,
[3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:48.480]  because Obama's getting bogged down. I wanted to mention that the group of 20 next week,
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:53.280]  right, there's the summit of the group of 20, it's time to ban derivatives, to shut down the
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:58.160]  zombie banks, and to deprive Obama of his left cover. The thing that occurred to me, Alex,
[3:57:58.160 --> 3:58:03.840]  is we have the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival,
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:07.600]  with the Golden Palm, the Golden Lion, the Golden Bear, and I'm sure other parts of the
[3:58:07.600 --> 3:58:12.640]  world, too. It seems to me that this has a world dimension. In other words, there's a world...
[3:58:12.640 --> 3:58:16.800]  Yes, the film is going on worldwide. Webster, we're out of time, but Webster's going to be
[3:58:16.800 --> 3:58:21.680]  in studio with me this Sunday evening in town for the second Obama film here with shooting,
[3:58:21.680 --> 3:58:27.760]  and in studio Monday co-hosting with me before he goes back to DC. So, Webster, I will see you
[3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:32.800]  this weekend, my friend. Congratulations again on the Obama deception and everybody should buy it.
[3:58:33.360 --> 3:58:37.840]  Thank you, Webster. Let me say bye to you as the show ends. Retransmission with a ton of the guest
[3:58:37.840 --> 3:58:41.360]  starts right now. The mass grave stories, I'll be up in the show. Stay with us.

[3:58:51.760 --> 3:58:55.680]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:58:55.680 --> 3:58:59.920]  self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent, and food
[3:58:59.920 --> 3:59:04.160]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[3:59:04.160 --> 3:59:08.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:59:08.000 --> 3:59:11.920]  in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family
[3:59:11.920 --> 3:59:15.840]  in the final equation, but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
