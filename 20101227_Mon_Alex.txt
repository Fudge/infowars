[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.920 --> 00:31.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.600 --> 00:42.080]  live my friends live and worldwide it is the 27th day of December 2010 and the
[00:42.080 --> 00:51.720]  last final sands in the hourglass for this year 2010 are now making their way
[00:51.720 --> 01:00.160]  down through the hourglass 2010 is almost over extremely long in the tooth
[01:00.160 --> 01:08.240]  with a long flowing white beard as we accelerate into 2011 2012 and beyond
[01:08.240 --> 01:17.200]  every time I take off a full week which is very rare maybe every two years a lot
[01:17.200 --> 01:20.440]  of times I take off two three days here and there on spring break or something
[01:20.440 --> 01:29.560]  like that but it takes a week for me to really get relaxed and re-centered but
[01:29.560 --> 01:38.280]  it's also very creepy to take off time because when I actually take off a week
[01:39.440 --> 01:49.160]  I have time to get refocused re-centered and really cogitate deeply and meditate
[01:49.160 --> 01:59.400]  on the state of the world and in the last few days I wrote 20 30 pages of notes
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.200]  I was out of town my wife and children of course but in the suitcase and some
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.160]  reason last night couldn't find it but I want to try to go over these thoughts
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.480]  and ideas a lot of it we've covered here before but with a deeper view of
[02:15.480 --> 02:25.200]  understanding of just what we're facing but to simplify it a matrix is being
[02:25.200 --> 02:35.800]  built a artificial habitat for humanity an artificial system is being built and
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.320]  it's a system designed to destroy the human order as it has always been and
[02:41.320 --> 02:46.800]  to basically turn us into nothing more than biological androids and this is the
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.960]  globalist own statement this is not some new revelation but it's when I do take
[02:52.960 --> 03:00.040]  off time and then I just pick up periodicals or news articles it completely
[03:00.040 --> 03:06.760]  blows me away I saw this on a newsstand National Geographic merging of man and
[03:06.760 --> 03:14.000]  machine and I read the issue cover to cover and the entire thing is pure
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.600]  eugenics written in a very seductive fashion to introduce you to it and they
[03:21.600 --> 03:28.800]  talk about how great the authoritarian nation of Singapore is and how it is
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.880]  socially engineered and a form of corporate communism run by a communist
[03:34.880 --> 03:43.920]  a top globalist making billions of dollars for the ministers that's what
[03:43.920 --> 03:50.240]  communism is it's big fat cats making you a slave getting you dependent through
[03:50.240 --> 03:57.840]  total control of resources and they admit in the article that the end goal is to
[03:57.840 --> 04:06.800]  kill the Singaporeans to get rid of them that their population is plummeting you
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.120]  know I talked to a top computer programmer who's high up in the
[04:11.120 --> 04:14.200]  Republican Party I'll leave it at that he agreed to come on he's been on the
[04:14.200 --> 04:19.280]  show many years ago but a few years ago he agreed to come on about Singapore and
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.120]  then got scared and refused and when I pushed him he got very angry on the
[04:23.120 --> 04:29.240]  phone and threatening but he was gonna come on and talk about Singapore how
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.840]  they drug different water supplies in different neighborhoods how they test
[04:32.840 --> 04:42.240]  everything there but later if I have time I'll get into this it's just so
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.880]  horrible and National Geographic endorses it all in a very sick and twisted
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.360]  way you're very subtle but this is where we stand we'll be right back stay
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.200]  with us ladies and gentlemen a lot of news coming up

[06:02.880 --> 06:07.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.200 --> 06:11.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.400 --> 06:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.760 --> 06:32.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.760 --> 06:39.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.960 --> 06:43.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:02.240 --> 08:09.880]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:24.840 --> 08:30.080]  we don't have any guests scheduled today because I've been out of town the
[08:30.080 --> 08:36.080]  last week and I have now returned to our central Texas command center in the
[08:36.080 --> 08:40.480]  information war against the globalist and I want to hear from you throughout
[08:40.480 --> 08:45.920]  the full broadcast we also have all of this incredible news last night I
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.840]  probably spent an hour re researching and and rediscovering the Romanian
[08:51.840 --> 09:01.840]  Revolution of 1989 and I did that because over the weekend I had seen the
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.000]  video the Newark Daily News has it we have it linked as well from Russia today
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.440]  and CBS up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and one of the
[09:13.440 --> 09:21.280]  state-run TV technicians who works there in the parliament he got up on about a
[09:21.280 --> 09:25.840]  50-foot balcony and he said you've destroyed our future you destroyed our
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.280]  children's future you've sold out the foreign banks and he jumped off and
[09:30.280 --> 09:38.080]  smashed head first getting incredible injuries into the parliamentary chairs
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.480]  and computers below powerful message similar to people lighting themselves on
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.880]  fire I don't think it's good to jump off balconies or good to set yourself on
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.480]  fire but it's always a thousand times more powerful than going out and
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.200]  shooting a cop in the head I'm not first going around shooting police in the
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.040]  head either unless they're trying to take you to a camp to be raped and that is
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.240]  the type of system we're going into everyone has a inalienable grassroots
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.080]  organic right to defend themselves but I'm not for offensively going out I
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.880]  would rather reach out to police and military and the enforcers and try to
[10:18.880 --> 10:26.600]  get them to realize historically what's happening is bonafide grade a five
[10:26.600 --> 10:34.360]  star super weaponized tyranny I mean it's lowdown it's scientific it means
[10:34.360 --> 10:41.320]  business and so we're going to be going over the situation in Romania today they
[10:41.320 --> 10:51.320]  traded out communist oppression and Soviet satellite oppression for banker
[10:51.320 --> 10:57.280]  oppression we'll get into the incredibly cold temperatures gripping Europe
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.280]  Russia the United States Canada and meanwhile the New York Times says this
[11:02.280 --> 11:05.480]  is global warming they actually have that headline that let me give you the
[11:05.480 --> 11:13.640]  actual headline storm wreaks havoc on travel wall street journal east coast
[11:13.640 --> 11:20.480]  storm strands travelers vexes drivers blizzard paralyzes New York City Boston
[11:20.480 --> 11:25.520]  bundle up it's global warming that's the New York Times and they say the earth
[11:25.520 --> 11:28.840]  continues to get warmer yet it's feeling a lot colder outside that's an
[11:28.840 --> 11:34.280]  actual first line of the article up is down down is up black is white we've
[11:34.280 --> 11:38.640]  never been at war with East Asia we've always been at war with East Asia I'm
[11:38.640 --> 11:46.400]  living in 1984 so are you to a great extent they put their whole grid in
[11:46.400 --> 11:49.840]  place now they're moving to start curtailing the internet and free speech
[11:49.840 --> 11:53.840]  in this country the system is also more and more taking the gloves off and going
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.920]  yeah we're listening to everything you do we're surveilling everybody and if you
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.200]  don't like it that's just the way it is I'm gonna talk about that some today and
[12:02.200 --> 12:08.200]  I've just got page after page of notes here that I wrote when I was on so-called
[12:08.200 --> 12:13.120]  vacation I was able to gather together some of the notes I wrote up by in the
[12:13.120 --> 12:19.000]  last week a bunch of them I can't find I also recorded us some audio blogs when
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.640]  I was a little more reflective in the last week that we're gonna be posting to
[12:22.640 --> 12:26.880]  prison planet dot TV and the info wars dot com prison punnet dot com coming up
[12:26.880 --> 12:33.240]  the next few days I've got a lot of energy and I'm really refocused and I
[12:33.240 --> 12:39.280]  think it's good for all of us to take some time off occasionally because I I
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.840]  tend everyone else tends to get in the heat of the moment where you're just
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.680]  constantly show immersed in whatever your job is whatever you're focused on
[12:49.680 --> 12:59.280]  that you begin to not see the forest for the trees but taking off a week a full
[12:59.280 --> 13:11.960]  week something I rarely do it only intensified my complete certainty that
[13:11.960 --> 13:20.360]  we are facing the greatest crisis in human history and I'm gonna talk more
[13:20.360 --> 13:29.360]  about that throughout the transmission the broadcast today and when you know
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.360]  this information when you really know what the score is when you know what
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.600]  the social engineers are really planning and you've got all their writings and
[13:37.600 --> 13:45.600]  all their admissions and you're 100% sure of it it just completely changes
[13:45.600 --> 13:52.920]  your perspective on life I've never been a very vain person but I remember when I
[13:52.920 --> 13:56.760]  was about 20 something years old started having some of my hair fall out I was
[13:56.760 --> 14:05.720]  concerned about it now I could care less or as I get wrinkles or sunspots on my
[14:05.720 --> 14:11.600]  face I could care less when somebody tells me about the football game coming
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.040]  up you know hey some good games tonight I could really care less I mean it
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.840]  really helps you focus in on what matters and it's the human species our
[14:20.840 --> 14:26.600]  society our progeny's future the goals of humanity and and if folks get
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.920]  anything from this broadcast it's that there is a war on for your mind
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.680]  decisions are being made for you that are classically oppressive and not in
[14:36.680 --> 14:43.000]  your interest and it's sad to see so many people under a mesmerized mind
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  controlled spell marching like lemmings off the societal cliff and I just want
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.360]  to see people empowered and involved and challenging the great challenges the
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.280]  great obstacles of our day which are the greatest that human species has ever
[15:01.280 --> 15:09.840]  faced in the some equation it's this humans for all of our development in
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.640]  our long history it was always about survival enough to eat not being enslaved
[15:15.640 --> 15:22.960]  by the neighboring tribe being honorable being strong that was always what
[15:22.960 --> 15:29.560]  was considered to be good and now because we've had our needs for food and
[15:29.560 --> 15:36.760]  shelter basically taken care of the poorest of us in many respects is more
[15:36.760 --> 15:42.240]  wealthy than kings and queens and more healthy and has access to more
[15:42.240 --> 15:49.760]  information than kings and queens of 500 a thousand years ago but it's because
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.040]  there's this glut of food and water and shelter and information people don't
[15:55.040 --> 16:01.680]  appreciate it anymore and that allows the system to come in and to begin
[16:01.680 --> 16:06.480]  destroying fundamental things that have always been the basis of our strength
[16:06.480 --> 16:12.240]  things that are the basis and bedrock and cornerstone of our humanity things
[16:12.240 --> 16:18.000]  like the family things like our perception of reality we're having an
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.840]  electronic prison built around us Janet Napolitano the creepy head of
[16:25.840 --> 16:33.520]  Homeland Security was on seeing an end this weekend and she made quite a few
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.680]  announcements we have the video clips up on info wars.com and prisonpana.com
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.640]  we'll probably play some of them later today to analyze it but the point is it's
[16:42.640 --> 16:46.480]  hard to listen to it's hard to look at her if you want to go see it we have the
[16:46.480 --> 16:51.240]  transcripts posted as well and she said the the pat downs the grope downs the
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.320]  rape downs are going to continue your slave training that that you're bad and
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.160]  the government's good and you're a prisoner and they're going to put their
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.680]  hands on you this is prison induction training this is your bad government's
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.000]  good and she said it's going to continue and she went on to say it's not big
[17:07.000 --> 17:14.240]  brother that now first 800 then 9000 it's always exponentially expanding giant
[17:14.240 --> 17:17.680]  tele screens going in all over the country they know you're not listening to
[17:17.680 --> 17:20.640]  government announcements they know you're ignoring government billboards they
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.440]  know that you at least fundamentally know they're a pack of lion crooks
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.080]  Congress has the lowest approval rating in history closing the books on the
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.680]  worst Congress in history according to Gallup poll the examiner and others
[17:34.680 --> 17:39.200]  believe me they know you know and so they're going to force their way into
[17:39.200 --> 17:44.200]  your life they're going to make you listen to them they're going to have more
[17:44.200 --> 17:48.000]  government announcements and more break-ins on TV and radio through FCC
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.760]  control boxes in all broadcast systems the EAS system
[17:56.200 --> 18:03.840]  they're going to put the 9000 tele screens in every shop in every mall in
[18:03.840 --> 18:09.000]  in in every sports stadium they're going to sit there and tell you we are your
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.800]  saviors we are the people that make your life possible we are your protectors
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.400]  because they know that you know that they're the crooks they're the murderers
[18:18.400 --> 18:22.480]  they're the trash they're the filth
[18:23.600 --> 18:34.920]  now I got back into town last night I was driving home and my dad called me and
[18:34.920 --> 18:42.120]  I can't get into the whole story because of doctor patient you know privileged
[18:42.120 --> 18:44.400]  stuff
[18:47.520 --> 18:53.200]  but it's so bad ladies and gentlemen that homeland security through a long time
[18:53.200 --> 19:00.440]  patient of my father's a dentist a guy he's been treating for more than 15 years
[19:00.440 --> 19:07.200]  came to him and tried to recruit my dad to spy on people to spy on his
[19:07.200 --> 19:11.360]  neighbors and then my dad was telling dr. King at their dental office about it
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.120]  dr. King said hey two weeks ago they came to my door in the neighbor this is
[19:16.120 --> 19:20.680]  your middle-class neighborhoods and asked dr. King he's a friend of mine nice
[19:20.680 --> 19:26.040]  guys wife listens every day want to say hi to her you know how widespread this
[19:26.040 --> 19:30.520]  is ladies and gentlemen they're everywhere they aren't they are getting ready for
[19:30.520 --> 19:36.040]  something big okay you better know I mean they've stolen the country blind
[19:36.040 --> 19:41.320]  they're bringing us into depression and these are some low-down crooks and the
[19:41.320 --> 19:45.040]  infraguard the clergy response teams you think they're gonna stop it recruiting

[24:28.360 --> 24:33.880]  checked I mean I really want this to sink in for folks think of the magnitude
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.160]  that in Austin Texas we know about the spy brigades we know about the Secure
[24:39.160 --> 24:46.000]  Corps going back eight nine years ago associated press reporting on taking the
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.880]  Boy Scouts and youth groups and training them in warrant apprehension
[24:53.880 --> 25:02.360]  checkpoints spying nine years ago they had ads on TV in Austin saying report
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.600]  your parents it's in my film road to tyranny the kids are given ID cards and
[25:06.600 --> 25:12.040]  $200 bonuses turning in family members are the biggest bonus I mean this is
[25:12.040 --> 25:19.280]  brazen over-the-top corruption meanwhile when government aircraft crash
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.840]  routinely full of pure drugs coming from the source it's a non-news item nobody
[25:23.840 --> 25:27.920]  gets in trouble when foreign banks steal trillions of dollars Congress can't
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.080]  even find out where it went when it comes out in congressional hearings the
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.720]  Dine Corps is running giant child kidnapping rings and it's even in the
[25:35.720 --> 25:41.920]  BBC in Chicago Tribune nobody gets in trouble and the public's under mind
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.520]  control you tell an average cop about this they start laughing at you even if
[25:45.520 --> 25:51.800]  you show in the news articles they're they're they're trained at a subconscious
[25:51.800 --> 25:56.600]  level to have a an emotional response to any type of quote authority figure
[25:56.600 --> 26:00.960]  doing something wrong that that's a joke and and really what it is deep down is
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.080]  their cowards they're afraid of bucking the system they just want to go up in
[26:05.080 --> 26:14.200]  their bureaucracy but it shook me up it shook me up even though I know all this
[26:14.200 --> 26:19.000]  is happening intellectually and it came out last week in the news that the ACL
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.280]  use being spied on by Homeland Security that Ron Paul's being spied on by
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.800]  Homeland Security you know mainstream news all over the US we broke that
[26:28.800 --> 26:35.520]  almost two years ago but now here it is in the news we were sent others were sent
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.840]  internally from the army with patriots inside that at the end the Fed rallies
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.320]  they have US Army there in plain clothes and it said in the memo watch out don't
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.880]  let them know there aren't that your army they may try to kill you I mean what
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.160]  type of brainwashing is that you've got citizens out there saying foreign banks
[26:53.160 --> 27:00.760]  are robbing us we want to audit the Fed and they tell the army don't let them
[27:00.760 --> 27:08.000]  know your army they may try to kill you I mean this is this is the army in Texas
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.680]  and then it came out in Pennsylvania and it came out in in Maryland and I know
[27:15.680 --> 27:18.880]  all of that intellectually I was sent five years ago the secret Homeland
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.800]  Security documents hundreds of pages we posted them on info wars people couldn't
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.680]  believe it clergy response teams preachers in America secretly being paid
[27:27.680 --> 27:30.960]  it was 50,000 back then I don't know what it is now they were doubling it each
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.600]  year it's got to be in the hundreds of thousands now and they're on these
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.200]  power trips you go rent a car they're asking you questions for Homeland
[27:39.200 --> 27:48.320]  Security admittedly your preachers are spying on you and they all get off on it
[27:49.960 --> 27:56.720]  they the most horrible part about this is they take all these minimum wage
[27:56.720 --> 28:02.400]  people who have no creativity who have no future who are dumbed-down fluoride
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.640]  heads and they give them these positions of unconstitutional power and
[28:07.640 --> 28:18.760]  they're completely drunk on it and to know that my father last week someone in
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.720]  Homeland Security tried to recruit him and said oh yeah you'll even get paid
[28:22.720 --> 28:32.600]  money and even told him well our public thing is disaster preparedness but
[28:32.600 --> 28:39.520]  really you know we need folks to be eyes and ears and then my dad is telling the
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.600]  other dentist in his office about he goes oh yeah a couple weeks ago they
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.640]  visited me at my house other people I mean just as a sample of the population
[28:47.640 --> 28:52.160]  this is everywhere and then you just search it you know Homeland Security
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.080]  training neighborhood watch and there are all the news articles there are the
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.920]  memos Paul Watson covered this last week we have the Texas memo going back to
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.880]  2005 where it says is he a nice guy does he lock his desk at work does he wear
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.360]  Levi's do they have scuba equipment do they have cell phones go ahead and
[29:12.360 --> 29:21.320]  report them it's so wide as to basically say everybody's a suspect but then when a
[29:21.320 --> 29:30.680]  pilot last week shot video of the fact that the security's all of fraud and that
[29:30.680 --> 29:37.240]  all the other airport workers and and and people that are involved in non
[29:37.240 --> 29:44.200]  commercial aviation private aviation that there's no security the feds then
[29:44.200 --> 29:49.760]  raid him under national security we'll be right back

[35:24.400 --> 35:31.520]  black hole to have no bid contracts who will shoot little kids up with live
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.440]  polio live syphilis radiate us foster children nerve gas our own troops I mean
[35:37.440 --> 35:42.560]  the people running things are hardcore psychopathic killers on record just

[35:52.800 --> 35:57.920]  of declassified chemical biological radiological testing on the US public
[35:57.920 --> 36:03.360]  alone just mass murdered death killing case closed pure evil okay these are
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.040]  eugenicists they believe in social Darwinism total social engineering total
[36:08.040 --> 36:13.560]  control total domination the final revolution is what they call it against
[36:13.560 --> 36:24.760]  humanity this is real and it's out in the open and they have done everything
[36:24.760 --> 36:28.200]  they can to shut down the farms and ranches to break up the families to get
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.400]  people dependent to get people on welfare and social security to get part of
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.280]  your paycheck for decades and then hold you hostage through it they've done a
[36:36.280 --> 36:41.720]  good job of that and to give you entertainment and mindless bread and
[36:41.720 --> 36:48.240]  circus and diversions and to give people false icons and heroes which focus
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.760]  people on issues of little or no significance I mean this is mind control
[36:53.760 --> 37:04.720]  and to have it come home to me that just in my town of Austin they are going out
[37:04.720 --> 37:12.120]  to every professional people with two degrees and they are asking them to join
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.200]  Homeland Security and the average person just takes the bait is on a total
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.360]  power trip they get their little card they're told oh you signed a national
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.160]  security letter so now they can't ever tell people what they're involved in and
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.320]  then the government can go out and psychologically profile and test these
[37:31.320 --> 37:36.280]  people and find out who will plant things on you who will set you up who will
[37:36.280 --> 37:41.000]  spy on you who will bear false witness on you because all these people have
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.560]  watched all the different shows about Homeland Security and Jack Bauer and 24
[37:45.560 --> 37:50.680]  and how sexy torture is and and this is their new status this is their new
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.560]  their members of the secret police people are scared of them see the globalist
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.680]  this is a dual message for the dumb down masses it's oh great everybody spies on
[38:01.680 --> 38:06.320]  each other this is the new freedom but for those of us that are awake which is
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.960]  close to half the population it's meant to scare us look it doesn't scare me it
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.920]  makes me focused it makes me angry and it lets me understand just how real this
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.440]  is and I've been a hundred percent right in fact it's much worse in fact in a
[38:19.440 --> 38:23.400]  way I've been wrong it's much worse than I ever even historically was able to
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.920]  analyze I mean this thing is big it's like an iceberg you only see the very
[38:27.920 --> 38:31.400]  tip of it ninety plus percent of it's under the water but more and more that
[38:31.400 --> 38:35.400]  icebergs surfacing and we're seeing twists and curves of this thing that I
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.960]  can't even believe right now but I'm getting chills right now
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.640]  I had some other weird stuff happen while I was on vacation too
[38:49.640 --> 38:57.120]  you know you take off a week and you can really get reflective and and I wish I
[38:57.120 --> 39:02.880]  was wrong and it's really horrifying it's it's frustrating it's it's
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.400]  disgusting to just have grown men and check out lines go hey you're gonna
[39:07.400 --> 39:10.680]  watch the game tonight it's gonna be a really good one you just look at him and
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.480]  you just want to warn him hey there's so many really big things happening the
[39:15.480 --> 39:19.840]  banks the implosion of the economy the dollar devaluation historically we know
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.880]  what this leads to and if you try to talk to one of these brain dead sheep
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.840]  they'll come back with hey you heard the mega millions is above 200 million
[39:27.840 --> 39:35.880]  right now you're just looking at them because all this facade of the movies
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.680]  and the entertainment and the sports it's all still there all this big make
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.040]  believe land but meanwhile in the real world this criminal illegitimate
[39:46.040 --> 39:50.640]  corporate government and it's the same model continuity of agenda worldwide is
[39:50.640 --> 39:58.040]  massing huge paramilitary forces spy forces weather modification chemicals in
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.880]  the water they're now announcing yes it's to make you calm I've got all these
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.320]  mainstream news articles I remember 12 years ago being sent by engineers
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.800]  internal trade publications not secret but not widely distributed how all the
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.440]  new appliances would spy on you in your house how they were gonna have cameras
[40:16.440 --> 40:22.280]  on all computers watching and listening how the lights in your house would
[40:22.280 --> 40:33.400]  surveil you I have mainstream news today I told you two years ago that the main
[40:33.400 --> 40:37.240]  everything they do is a multifaceted attack it's to train you to be body
[40:37.240 --> 40:41.200]  scanned it's to it's to set the precedent to radiate you outside of the
[40:41.200 --> 40:46.840]  radiation compliance laws that they're above the law it's about getting a 360
[40:46.840 --> 40:51.360]  biometric scan of your body and now that's market watch Wall Street Journal
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.320]  it's a biometric scan I know them okay this is all I do when I go to bed at
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.360]  night I have dreams for eight hours about it nightmares last night it's all
[41:01.360 --> 41:05.720]  it's it's everything because it's reality
[41:05.720 --> 41:12.640]  ceiling lights in Minnesota send coded internet data boom now they don't tell
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.960]  you here about the patents and how they use the the let the electricity lines in
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.600]  your house to tie into your smart refrigerator your dishwasher your
[41:21.600 --> 41:28.960]  computer the light sockets these things are so incredible that just temperature
[41:28.960 --> 41:35.600]  differentials in a light socket now the new light sockets going in with the
[41:35.600 --> 41:43.000]  wiring is able to listen to you in your house all the patents are there
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.880]  ladies and gentlemen the patents are all public I've had Dr. Nick Baggachan to
[41:46.880 --> 41:50.560]  cover the patent numbers but I remember the Baltimore Sun a decade ago about
[41:50.560 --> 41:58.920]  DARPA testing soothing mine control towers by the way I've got the patents
[41:58.920 --> 42:03.960]  this system is a multifaceted data transmission flicker rate mine control
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.000]  system oh you're not gonna watch the high-def mine control TV they don't care
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.680]  the government buildings are now putting in flicker systems that are
[42:12.680 --> 42:16.920]  unperceptible to the human eye and when I went and looked it up it's the exact
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.040]  flicker rate for total mine control folks you think the public is already in a
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.800]  zombie state you ain't seen nothing yet I'm telling you we're living in a
[42:25.800 --> 42:31.480]  science fiction horror show you know why a lot of the public can't get upset by
[42:31.480 --> 42:34.960]  telescreens going in and their kids being trained to spy on them and in
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.280]  Pennsylvania the government comes out and says we're watching you through the
[42:38.280 --> 42:44.160]  government laptops we give your kids in their beds in their showers they told
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.640]  on themselves it's a psych warfare test and see I have all this background data
[42:51.640 --> 42:58.600]  I read something like this National Geographic article about the minister
[42:58.600 --> 43:12.680]  mentor communist trained in British Ivy League schools about how Singapore is
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.120]  the model for the world how many times I told you it's the Singapore model and
[43:17.120 --> 43:23.120]  they admitted in here but they sell pure evil as if it's good and it just goes
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.640]  into total social engineering they call it social Darwinism and they at the end
[43:27.640 --> 43:32.240]  of the article they say that the Singaporeans are dying they have a 1.2
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.400]  population replacement I mean they just tell you there's the model this system
[43:37.400 --> 43:42.120]  is designed to be cannibalistic to destroy humanity and they just sell it
[43:42.120 --> 43:52.120]  like it's wonderful but but my point is when I read about the minister mentor
[43:52.120 --> 44:01.880]  since 1960 and how he was a communist trained at Oxford of course and how
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.680]  it's a total police state and how they kill you if you criticize the government
[44:06.680 --> 44:10.040]  and the article kind of says well it's it's really worked well it's a great
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.240]  country but then you read how they're dying they're not having children it's
[44:14.240 --> 44:17.760]  horribly oppressive they have incredibly high levels of suicide the
[44:17.760 --> 44:24.600]  countries run by psychiatrist and they say that the communist trained in England
[44:24.600 --> 44:29.440]  overthrew the British that's the British declassified model to claim they
[44:29.440 --> 44:32.880]  pull out and then to put their corporate people in and they use it as an
[44:32.880 --> 44:38.120]  island to test the mind control and then I even know insiders who admit
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.700]  they're putting stuff in the water there per neighborhood to test and this is
[44:43.700 --> 44:49.560]  the model here it doesn't matter how many scientists I have on how many top
[44:49.560 --> 44:54.200]  doctors I know there's a percentage of people out there laughing when I tell
[44:54.200 --> 44:57.680]  them that sodium fluoride in the water at one par per million more than doubles
[44:57.680 --> 45:06.840]  bone cancer in men and women it more than quadruples it in young boys and
[45:06.840 --> 45:13.960]  that's just one little micron and I know the cops are laughing they like it
[45:13.960 --> 45:19.680]  because they got a uniform they got a monkey suit they're on a power trip I'm
[45:19.680 --> 45:24.640]  trying to save them but you think cops are bad they're angels compared to the
[45:24.640 --> 45:30.480]  general public I'm gonna say this right now okay they at least come from a
[45:30.480 --> 45:33.160]  school of thought that had to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.400]  they've removed most of it and they've quietly in the last 20 years made it
[45:36.400 --> 45:39.720]  where if you have over a hundred IQ you can't be a cop that's admit there's been
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.840]  lawsuits over it they don't want people that can think too much but you think
[45:44.840 --> 45:50.840]  they're bad they at least have to follow some of the Constitution for now they
[45:50.840 --> 45:58.520]  are hiring every control freak goon who couldn't get a job in the real world to
[45:58.520 --> 46:03.120]  literally run around spying on everyone and and you know the big backstory is oh
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.560]  turban men stop them and then when you actually go to the training we have the
[46:06.560 --> 46:09.960]  video of the training the training manuals I've got it from every angle of
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.960]  law enforcement who are awake and know what's happening every angle it's five
[46:15.960 --> 46:21.360]  minutes on al-qaeda it's six months on spy on your neighbor are they
[46:21.360 --> 46:26.200]  criticizing the government are they spanking their kids I mean do you realize
[46:26.200 --> 46:38.280]  how creepy this is how overtly bad out of a dental office of four dentist my
[46:38.280 --> 46:41.960]  dad hadn't talked to the other two he talked to dr. King his friend who's
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.520]  been there for many years my dad is approached and said we want to hire you
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.720]  to secretly work for homeland security and then he's back in the in the doctors
[46:51.720 --> 46:55.920]  lounge and he goes man you know this guy's trying to get me into homeland
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.160]  security and dr. King says yeah they came to my house two weeks ago different
[47:00.160 --> 47:06.080]  people and we're trying to get me to be involved spying in the neighborhood they
[47:06.080 --> 47:11.880]  want professionals folks okay they want them and they and and it's so sick when
[47:11.880 --> 47:19.080]  you know al-qaeda CIA when you know 99% of this stuff is staged when you know
[47:19.080 --> 47:22.720]  it's for the American people when we have all the internal documents where it's
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.220]  for gun owners conservatives landowners you can skin a buck you can run a trot
[47:27.220 --> 47:34.360]  line you are number one enemy you're double tough they don't like you you got
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.520]  guts they don't like you they profiled you they know you're red-blooded they
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.160]  know you're not a coward they know you're not a scumbag they hate you look at the
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.520]  new world order look at all the government ministers they're a bunch of
[47:45.520 --> 47:52.960]  weak hunchback potbellied just just scum they hate love they hate strength they
[47:52.960 --> 47:59.200]  hate everything honorable and they are hiring giant armies of toilet attendants
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.880]  who then command the doctors and the preachers and I've done my own analysis
[48:03.880 --> 48:07.480]  of this but talking to people who've been who they've attempted to recruit who've
[48:07.480 --> 48:17.600]  been approached that's how it's described as just total dirtball losers can you
[48:17.600 --> 48:28.240]  imagine taking a dirtball loser who can't even zip their front fly properly with
[48:28.240 --> 48:32.840]  their shirts hanging out you've all seen it and I'm not up here claiming I got
[48:32.840 --> 48:38.240]  some spree to court the point is these people are a joke and they get all the
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.640]  status they get to be the new kings of society the new commas are is the
[48:41.640 --> 48:49.640]  humiliation the anti-americanism the anti-liberty movement it is so horrible
[48:49.640 --> 49:07.600]  and then as I said earlier this airline pilot a week ago is tired of having his
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.040]  privates grabbed he's tired of having to go through the radiation scanner he's
[49:12.040 --> 49:20.740]  flying a giant aircraft that's a huge missile in fact I forget how much is a
[49:20.740 --> 49:25.880]  747 way how many tons is that pull it up for me please this giant missile but
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.400]  he's got to have this done to him by minimum wage goons with their shirts
[49:30.400 --> 49:35.360]  hanging out so the pilot videotapes what I've pointed out a thousand times what
[49:35.360 --> 49:39.200]  anyone with common sense you drive right up to the airport if you're in any

[56:14.280 --> 56:18.880]  and the and the flight attendants and what is homeland security do they raid
[56:18.880 --> 56:24.520]  his house instead of just calling him in and take back his government issued
[56:24.520 --> 56:28.320]  firearm because he went through the hoops to carry a firearm in the cockpit
[56:28.320 --> 56:35.560]  to protect the plane and the message is you don't show the hypocrisy it's all a

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:22.520]  says it was the government went in and told YouTube to take his videos down so
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:29.600]  here's the headline TSA probes pilot critical of airport security federal
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.000]  authorities are investigating a pilot though they got a different one up on
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.160]  screen I'm reading one off my computer if folks are confused my headline is TSA
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.800]  probes pilot critical of airport security federal authorities are
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.960]  investigating a pilot who posted videos on YouTube that were critical of
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.840]  security at San Francisco International Airport the pilots attorney said Friday
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.880]  Don Werner of the Santa Fe based law firm Werner and associates of the
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.800]  transportation security administration is looking into whether his client
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:04.280]  revealed sensitive information yeah oh yes they want to keep you safe when
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.040]  they're not having the State Department get the underwear bomber drugged out of
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.720]  his gourd onto an aircraft then we have the witnesses on the show the Haskells
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.960]  who saw it all happen the FBI comes to their office and tells them shut up
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.480]  basically and then it comes out it was all true and then the boss of the
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.680]  underwear drughead the mind control zombie is admittedly secretly working at
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.320]  the Pentagon hanging out secretly and we're all a lucky but let's just ignore
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.560]  all that let's all have telescreens in Walmart and spy on our neighbors and all
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:44.560]  get scared the pilot remains anonymous with a major airline but he has been
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.120]  drawn from a program that trains flight crews to help prevent hijackings after
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.000]  authorities confiscated his federally issued firearm Werner said he declined
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.520]  to release the pilot's name signing concerns about the man's job the TSA
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.680]  wouldn't answer questions but said in a statement it is responding to the
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.040]  situation and is confident that the security at San Francisco International
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.960]  Airport as to access control at San Francisco Airport the TSA is confident
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.360]  in the tools the airport has implemented and reminds passengers they are
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.960]  security measures in place that are both seen and unseen yes like your

[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.440]  without undergoing any screening he notes in the footage the pilots undergo
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.240]  intense screening but then have access to acts like weapons that are stored in
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:54.040]  the cockpit in case of emergencies well you better raid this guy my gosh he may

[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.640]  and a lot of people walk away you want to be a slave go ahead I'm you know it's
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.920]  your children all chances are they've already been recruited by Homeland
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:54.280]  Security think about the average low attention span low IQ low self-image and
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.920]  they get approached by Homeland Security man and they're given a little
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.760]  tattletale card it's over I mean they can't wait to run home and tattle on
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:06.200]  their husband for talking bad about Obama I'm serious I mean these people
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:12.160]  are gone exactly you realize they have built a horde of the dumb-down people
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.040]  you see in the streets they've built an army of these people they certainly have
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.920]  and they're more the conditioning that goes on and on like every year the
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.960]  Kentucky Derby we got the military or what's next there's something new every
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.360]  year and by the way we were talking about that for about eight years now they
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.440]  run out with 45 sidearms and tackle people that jump on the field after the
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.880]  winning they don't send police they don't send state police they send the
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.240]  army and the message is the army does security in America yeah the security of
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.000]  the bankers when they rob you I mean look can't you see how they're gearing up
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.560]  for this and everything is accelerating towards the collapse exactly and if you
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.680]  look at them the wrong way you can be tackling or rested your suspected
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.160]  terrorist it's giving the wrong look like you said earlier it's getting a lot
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.880]  worse it's not getting any better people you got to start waking up well we've
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.880]  turned into a sycophantic bootlicking country that is a large section of the
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.880]  population and if good people if intelligent people don't stand up and
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.760]  get really aggressive back in their face it's over the good news is I've got a
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:22.520]  article in my stack about the lobbyist literally going into overdrive the
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.320]  biggest amount of lobbying money ever spent for the naked body scanners and
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.480]  they admit in the article it's because of the backlash and so they know they're
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.440]  in trouble okay so so we're actually starting to clean their clocks they've
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.640]  gone too far we're gonna get this country back Chris we don't have a choice
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.240]  Chris what else is on your mind I just want to say that you're absolutely right
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.800]  that's why they're going to continue to keep pulling these false flag tears in
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.040]  order oh another incident and just keep going with this until they eventually
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.560]  try to get these body scanners in public schools sporting events or even
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.600]  possibly a church held down I mean they're I'm not gonna fall for this
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:01.720]  anymore folks just this this is just BS anymore I'm gonna keep going with this
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.440]  and I'm gonna wake up and I'm going to the county clerk's for people talk to
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.480]  some people there I'm just that set up Alex now you got to get aggressive you
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.840]  got to speak to the city council you've got a we don't have to do what the fellow
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.640]  did in Romania jumping off the balcony to get their attention we need to go and
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.440]  speak out and point out and say the collapse is coming it's been designed
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.400]  that's why they put the police state grid in place ahead of it and we've so
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.680]  that as this unfolds our credibility will only rise that's already happening
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.920]  but to anyone out there that can understand what I'm saying to them please
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.400]  make the choice what side you're on I mean this is the great challenge what's
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.160]  happening right now this is it this is maker to break it let's talk to John and
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.640]  Ohio than Joseph Fred Mike and others go ahead John hey Alex greetings from

[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:24.440]  Detroit for an upcoming film on eugenics and depopulation and it looked like
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.400]  something out of the Omega man or the last man on earth I mean it looked like
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:36.800]  a post-apocalyptic doom stay there we're gonna come back to John and Ohio then
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.960]  Joseph Fred Mike and everybody else folks we know where tyranny leads it

[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:25.440]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.360]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.480]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.440]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems

[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  It is an Info War, a war on for your mind. I'm very excited to see more and more well-spoken, focused individuals getting involved in top radio, posting incredible reports to different video sites.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  I've seen a lot of people really start to get it and I'm seeing the nomenclature and the terms that I've coined being used everywhere.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  That's very exciting because I've been worried for a long time that people were only getting part of it.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Now people are really starting to get the full magnitude of what we're facing.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  And look, I care about these little control freak people at hotels and malls and banks that have been trained to spy on you.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  I care about the doctors and the lawyers and the pastors that are being hired and paid by Homeland Security to spy on people.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  They just don't have any sense. They're ignorant. They think America is about worshiping authority and it's not. It's the opposite.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  It's we the people and our founders were 180 degrees the opposite direction of what's being set up.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  So if you claim you love America and you care about the Star Spangled Banner, but then you support all this, you're double-minded.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  You're double-minded. Okay, I want to try to go quickly through calls. Finish up your point, John, about the deindustrialization.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Yeah, well, just like I was saying, everything up here has been so deindustrialized.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  My family came from the south in the 60s to work up here. And now you can't go back to either place because either place you're going to go is a living hell.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  But remember, they promised that you were going to have service jobs and now those are gone.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  I mean, they promised that having the big banks run things would be wonderful. I mean, they love us.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Yeah, but Alex, why have you here? I just want to say, if you bring this point up, like as I post on the Internet, you got Democrats now that Obama's in there.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  They talk like the Republicans. They say, well, everything is your fault. It's all your fault that you're going through this.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  It's because you're stupid. You're uneducated and you just don't have any momentum.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  And then when the Republicans were in there, it was the Republicans like the Hatties were saying the same thing.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  But now they're saying because card check is in here. Now Glenn Beck's harping on card check. You can see it.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Well, the labor unions are going to take over the world and everybody's going to have to belong to a labor union.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  And I keep screaming when I hear this because I say, you dummy, this is what they did in Soviet Union.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  Wait a minute. You mean weeks after we covered that TSA is now controlling the unions where you have to get approval to have a job?
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  He's now covering that?
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Yeah. Well, here's what he says. Glenn Beck said card check.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Okay. The unions are going to take over Walmart. Everything. The Teamsters Union is going to run wild. Now, my father is a Teamster.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  And I can tell you the Teamsters Union has lost cloud in this country.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  No, no, no, it's been taken over by the government. It's not the unions are taking over.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  But you're exactly right. But I mean, going over this, what they're doing is whether it's unions or mega corporations, it doesn't matter.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  They've all got the inside track with government, but that's only done so the government can then control all those employees.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  It's just like 500 plus last time I checked major mega corporations have been given waivers where they don't have to get the government health care.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  They don't have to pay for it, but their competition does.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  I wanted to ask you while I had you on here.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  While I was off over this Christmas break, I've been watching a lot of interesting things on YouTube and I watched an interview with a man I believe called George.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  I believe he was called George Green. He was a former insider was on project Camelot.com.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  And he said something about on there that he'd been in the government since the 60s doing things and he said something about the 2012 about these bases and these underground things that there's all this stuff.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  He says, you think the government's building all these weapons stuff that they're not going to use them.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  He said, this is the time we are living in right now. And I thought about this. Everybody keeps talking about this 2012 thing.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  I'm not worried about it being a natural disaster, but I'm thinking to myself, wouldn't the government impose disaster be a lot more efficient?
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  If you know what I mean, sir, you're absolutely right. Listen, how did we know months and months before the swine flu outbreak last year that it was going to happen?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  Because we got the confirmed intel and the documents from Indiana, New York and other major states that they were going to all the police departments and fire departments and saying there will be millions dead from flu this year.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  There will be martial law. There will be a million people buried in your county in Indiana from Chicago to get the cops to all freak out, go international security control and harden their facilities against the general public.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Now, when it came, it was a hoax and we exposed that, but it doesn't matter. They've done all this to get this grid in place.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  I mean, how many people they're recruiting? We don't know. We see the public drives the CIA ads on TV to, you know, go join the CIA.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  We know the CIA is operating locally. That's mainstream news, even though it's illegal.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  I mean, my dad calls me up yesterday and says Homeland Security, one of my patients tried to recruit me for Homeland Security.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  And then he went and talked to his other buddy, the dentist, and the doctor said, yeah, they came to my house two weeks ago.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  I mean, they're just everywhere. They're getting ready for something big. And we're the target. We have the documents. We know that. It's outrageous.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  And they don't want to spook people yet. They're still using the, oh, it's the foreigners. You know, oh, my gosh, they're so scary.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  But in all their internal stuff, it's always been about the American people. And now they're slowly announcing that, hey, don't trust your neighbor.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Hey, watch your neighbor. Hey, are they gun owners? Hey, are they criticizing the government?
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  We got a bad case of crooks running things. And this must be what it's like to go to the doctor and have them tell you you got cancer.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  I mean, that's what I feel like. I got children. I got a wife. I wish every minute this wasn't real. It's so real.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  And you've got the cattle out there, the sheeple who who are going to get hurt really bad along with the rest of us.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  I prayed a lot yesterday. I prayed for hours when I was driving. I was driving for four hours.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  And I probably prayed quietly silently for two hours. I really got close to God yesterday. And then I had all these ideas and all these thoughts.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  I want to articulate all these notes I wrote and I get on air and I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  You're all going to find out those of you in denial out there. You're going to find out and those of you that are hired to attack me and lie about me to divert people off the information I cover.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  You're going to find out. I just can't handle it anymore, folks. I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  You know, it makes me sick that Glenn Beck copies everything I do, though he's come a long way because the public's woken up so much that because they want to control the opposition,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  they allow him to operate so that they can have him flip flop later. I know that's what's happening.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  But I really do cry. I really do cry. And yesterday driving home for probably an hour and I was embarrassed of it for some reason.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And I had my sunglasses on. My wife didn't really notice. I had tears just running down my face. Not where you're sobbing, not where you're crying.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  It was almost like meditating, but I was just had tears just coming out because it's going to get bad.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  And now everybody I know, all they talk about is getting out of the country.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  And last week, you know, I went and visited a few places to leave the country. I'm going to be honest with listeners.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  I won't leave, but I may get my family out of the country and they were just the same or worse.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  There's nowhere to run, man. It's world. It's like Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia all rolled into one with super high tech control.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  And all of these dumb cops and dumb hotel people and dumb doctors and dumb lawyers, all of them have no idea.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Do you think I get up here and tell you they're poisoning their water and it isn't true?
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  We've got an hour long top toxicologist scientist interview up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  The Dr. Conn interview for everybody right up there on the site where he lays it all out.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  They know full well where is your survival instinct for the average enforcer who's on a power trip working for this system that you're under assault every day.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  And I know why you don't break your conditioning because at a subconscious level, you are scared to death.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  At a subconscious level, you know this is all real. Everybody's smart. Everybody's smart.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  Some are smarter than others, but everybody's smart in different ways, but even a child out of the mouths of babes, even a five year old knows.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  And the globalist are master tacticians of psychological warfare. They've studied anthropology, sociology, they created it.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  They know deep down you're all scared. They know deep down you feel the ominous threat, the chill.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  You're six cents mobilizing you to resist and stand up your common sense, your gut.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  And so they take that natural concern you've got to mobilize yourself to defend your family and they say, oh, it's the man with the turban.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  That's why you feel like this. They know you know.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  You understand what I'm saying? So they take all of your gut instinct of concern. Everybody's freaked out.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  People know stuff's wrong. They know we're in trouble.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  And they take that and say, yeah, be scared. We're going to protect you when they're the ones. They're the abusers. They're the bad guys.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  John, great points from Ohio. God bless you. Joseph in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  Hello, Alex. First of all, I just wanted to thank you, your staff and all your guest speakers for helping us to stop the New World Order.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  I appreciate you helping to wake me up. I've been listening to you now for about maybe six months.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  I agree with everything you're saying 100%. I stopped watching TV before I was watching you on Prison Planet TV.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  And it's so true what you're saying about people being brainwashed. It was like getting off of a drug.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  It's so addictive to stop watching TV. It took me about 30 days of not watching TV before I finally felt this sense of relief.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  Well, it is a drug. It's admittedly changes brain chemistry and actually causes Alzheimer's, major studies. In fact, just search the term Alzheimer's TV, guys, and show them some headlines.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  It literally lowers your brainwave level to a sleeping, waking, mesmerized sleepwalking stage.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  Exactly. And the messages go straight through into your subconscious so you don't have a chance to object or analyze what's being put into your brain.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  It's like they're just downloading the information into your brain. I tell people, you know, I stop watching TV and they look at me like I'm crazy, like I don't want to have indoor plumbing in my house almost like that kind of a sense.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  Like, how could you not watch TV? You have to watch TV. It's insane. And I try to tell them you're being brainwashed. You need to shut that damn thing off.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  I mean, it's not a game. I mean, we are being brainwashed. And the incredible studies, we just put one up about Alzheimer's and television, massive increases.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Now, young people are getting what they call Alzheimer-like diseases, that video games are even worse.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  And people are like, oh, no, my games aren't bad. When you really get focused on a video game and with the flicker rate, and now they've got all this new Microsoft video games that scan your face and your voice while you play,
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  it's total surveillance. You're inviting it in. And these people, we shouldn't get mad at them. In fact, that was one of the main things I wanted to say to people is that it really, I realize that it's wrong that I call people blobs.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  And I don't mean that physically. I mean, spiritual blobs, they're in bondage. They're under mind control. We're all under mind control to a certain extent.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  I mean, this is high tech stuff we're up against. You can't blame these people. They are literally under MKUltra high tech mind control through the television, through the chemicals, through the food, through the water.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  These are victims. These are sad, sad people. And that was the main thing in the last week that I focused on and realized. I feel so sorry for all these little petty control freaks who are under mind control, but also on a power trip.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  I feel sorry. But what outrages me is these demonic controllers who know exactly what they're doing. And they just, they're so easy to defeat the minute we realize what they are.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  But until we do that, we don't have a chance. And it's about to get a lot worse, folks. You don't know what's coming. It's so horrible. They plan on killing most of us. They've sworn to do it.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  I'm sorry. Go ahead, Joseph. Anything else?
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  I agree with you 100%. And that's why I do everything I can to spread the word about tell people to get a prison planet subscription so that they can get informed. I pass out your movies to everybody I know.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  Anybody that I tell that acts like, well, you know, that's crazy stuff. Just like you said, I forget about them and I move on to somebody else because they don't want to know. They want to keep their head in the sand.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  So if that's the way they want to go, if they want to perish, you know, that's their problem. But I'm going to keep on spreading the word.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  I'm telling everybody I know I will never fly again until all those body scanners have been removed and the TSA has been abolished. I've sent emails to all the major airlines telling them that I will never fly again.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Al Gore rates women and the women that try to explode and get drugged through the mud. I mean, I'm over here in San Diego. We have listening devices all over the neighborhoods. At first when I saw those things, I thought they were cell phone receptors to help you know.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  No, no, no, no. Oh, by the way, I forgot. They've announced that every mail carrier is now a spy and they're going to fit them with antennas to steal all your wireless transmission and with microphones.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I remember 13 years ago when they put microphones up all over Austin, call them gunshot detectors. Then this year they want to have more honest and said, no, we're listening to you.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  They've got laser couplers that shoot at your window, invisible lasers that listen to everything in your house because the laser hits the window and it creates like a membrane, you know, just like a microphone and they listen.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  I mean, it's just pure crime. It's illegal, but they do it. They are such scum. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  And again, I figured this out a long time ago, but it really hit me this week while I was focused. The globalist rationalized that I'm on the air and that I actually helped them.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  They believe that. They believe that you're cowards. They believe that my hardcore approach, which isn't hardcore. It's a realist approach is going to scare you.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  They think you're beaten. They think you're broke back. They think you're weak and they think here in hardcore truth that you're going to get scared and go into your shell.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Humans are different than other creatures on this planet. All the major studies show a certain percentage of us. You can't train us to have learned helplessness.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  You can't train us to submit and there's a certain percentage of people who can't be broken and it's up to us to go out and unlock the other people that are under hardcore mind control.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  Listen, I know a lot of you are scared. A lot of you are concerned. You got to take that energy. You got to put it into resistance because I'm looking in the globalist eyes.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  I can see their soul and I'm here to tell you they're getting scared. They're not invincible.

[01:53:46.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls and a bunch of news, but more and more I realize we've proven all the information. We've covered how crazy and draconian all this is.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  I mean, I couldn't believe 13 years ago when I learned in the engineering publications that were not even classified that the government worldwide, the global government, the corporate government was moving to all the new appliances, the smart appliances.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  See if they can say what kind of toilet you have, what type of light bulb you have. They can then make all the new appliances have these smart chips in them where the appliances are accessed not by a wireless box out on the side of the road with these new smart meters that control the temperature in your house.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Remember just five years ago they laugh at you talking about that now from New York to Texas to California it's going in. They came and put one on our office a few months ago or I guess earlier in the year and didn't even ask us. I mean, we now are controlled by the government.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  I mean, we don't get to control the thermostat if they want. I mean, this isn't freedom.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  I told people years ago the government was planning to have tracker switches in all your cars to tax you by the mile. Now the Department of Transportation has announced that's their plan and has pilot programs going and more than 10,000 Austinites are doing a trial right where I live.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  Oh, and I first read them proposing it. People laughed at me. The laughing is over.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  If you read this AP article, people say, well, that doesn't say what you said. I'm giving you the whole backstory. Just like when I told you they're getting a biometric scan with these scanners two years ago, now it's AP.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  Same thing here. Ceiling lights in Minnesota send coded internet data. I'm going to cover more of this next hour.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  Now, they don't tell you here that it's through the power data transmission over power lines, but that's in all the real literature and the patents.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  They don't tell you this flicker rate is for mind control, but it's all patented. They admit it's a flicker rate too fast for the eye to see to perceive the eye sees it. You just don't perceive it.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  How do you hypnotize somebody with a flash and light? It's all there. This is so diabolical. Where are they testing it? Government buildings.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  Where did they test the smart meters? Government buildings.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Now, this is incredible. The Drudge Report gets bolder and bolder. We want to salute Matt Rudge. I didn't see it. Jaren saw it at his parents' house over Christmas and confirmed, went to another computer.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Drudge of all his links. They were all green on Christmas, but Alex Jones and infowars.com. Those were green and red. I guess a Christmas present for Matt Rudge.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Matt, we appreciate your stand for liberty. Of course, DrudgeReport.com. Right now, the only red link on the Drudge Report is to Napolitano announces expansion of Gestapo zones from airports to malls and hotels.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  So now, not just hundreds of thousands, but millions of people will see that article. Good job, Curt and Emma, getting that out this morning as well.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  By the way, Curt, I know you point out that we predicted all of this, but add those to the bottom and the videos. You can get stuff eight years old.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  Problem is, I don't have the crew to sit there and mark every prediction I make. People are very upset by how accurate my predictions are.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  So they try to twist what my predictions are. They try to lie about my predictions. How many of you have heard me for eight years say they were going to take over every corner of society in a 10th Amendment violation?
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  And again, I'm not tooting my horn. I saw Ridge on C-SPAN say it.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  By the way, you heard a caller talk about PrisonPlanet.tv. We've got a special running until the end of the year where you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  All my films, the live stream of this show, the video, but forget that. You don't need to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  We're now taking the big hour and two hour long special exclusive video interviews and posting them on our YouTube channel, The Info Warrior.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  So you can go to the main Alex Jones channel and find that link. So much key intel spread.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Well, I've been pretty wound up being out of town. And we're taking a few calls here today. I'm going to try to go to more of them right now.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  By the way, I've sent Rob, Do, and Jason Douglas out to the public roads by the airport.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  This pilot, of course, has been raided by the feds for daring to show video that most of the airport workers can just walk or drive right onto the airport, but pilots are groped.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  So, since they're trying to censor that video, I just sent the guys out to get video. The truck's pulling up and just swiping a card and driving right on to the tarmac.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  I'm sure Austin cops will probably pull up and flip out. Oh my gosh, you don't do that in America. You don't show the airport that any moron can drive up and videotape.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  We're going to videotape you and listen to you with all this surveillance and have the CIA running around in your town, but you don't show that the security's all a hoax.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  And they're to train you to be a slave. Fred in Ohio, Mike, Ben, Shepard, Justin, we're going to your calls. Fred in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  What are you doing this morning? I'm pretty wound up, brother.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  Anyway, I want to remind all the people in the military that your tanks, your planes, your broadleys, your weapons, all of them belong to the American people and should never be used against the American people.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  They are used to protect. And I also know that the Army and the Marines are asked if they're fired on their own.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  And if I would have been given such an order when I was in service, I would have turned my weapon around and shot the guy that was given the order.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  Plus, I would have ran up the chain of command. And that's the way it is.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  Well, sir, what do you think as a veteran? What do you think of what's happening? I mean, I mean, back in the military, even 20 years ago, they taught everything that's happening today was what bad guys do.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  This is just ridiculous. But I also want to ask them one more question. And what the hell kind of a country do you want for your kids?
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  If you in the military do not stand up with the patriots of this country, what kind of country do you want for your kids?
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Because we will go into slavery and we will be broke. And you better wake up now.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  Well, the good news is I've seen the major studies in polls. The military is pretty much awake and very upset and knows what's going on.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  And there's a lot of bases around here. I talk to troops all the time, including officers. They're really starting to wake up. They were always somewhat awake.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  That's why the government's recruiting goons. They're recruiting people literally who couldn't work at McDonald's.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  And that's what Hitler and Stalin did. Did you hear me read the article earlier where the army is now hiring criminals to be led into the military, but also to work, quote, during disasters?
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  And why would Monsanto, a seed company, need three bases of black water, which is mercenaries? And then why did Bill Clinton put barricades up at the White House? Because they were scared.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Well, go back to Chalcescu in 89. It was the military. Finally, the public, just at a rally, cops beat up a few people. The crowd decided to fight back.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  It turned and the military joined them. And in a matter of hours, Chalcescu had been tried and executed. And the problem here is we don't have a Chalcescu, a real dictator.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  We have an offshore corporate dictatorship. We have to take our states back, take the federal government back. They'll pull out all the stops to create crises to try to sell us that we need them.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Then once we have our government back, then, then through the law, we can hunt these people down and bring them to justice. And that's going to need to be done.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  But it has to be done through the courts, but we have to get the country back and then we can bring these Kenley, Bernie Madoff types to justice.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  And like a house of cards, they can fall. God bless you. I appreciate your call. Great to hear from you.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  More calls straight ahead. Good hearing from Fred, Mike, Ben, Shepard, Justin and others. 800-259-9231.

[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  Not worried about them moving itself, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow. I'm looking for America.

[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America 3.com.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  Alright, let's see if I can actually take some phone calls here. Mike and DC, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  Hello.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  Hello, sir.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  Quoting. I did learn from Mr. Stat Miller and from several folks in Texas at Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  I appreciate your call, sir. I'm not going to have any people that are jealous of us stirring up trouble on our broadcast.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  Let's go ahead and, I mean, the whole new world is coming down on us. You've got all these people and all these minions obsessed with Alex Jones.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  Not going to happen here, okay? Let's go ahead and that's why people aren't as successful as we are. We're on mission.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  Warm the people. Wake them up. Get them involved. Stand up against globalism. Audit the Fed. Abolish the Fed. Cut the taxes. Get state sovereignty back.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Take over our towns and cities through the peaceful political process.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  It's very suspect. A lot of people are just camp followers and useful idiots, but very suspect how much time is spent making up stuff about us.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben and Indiana. Ben, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex. I'm a huge info war supporter and a Prison Planet TV member. I want to thank you for that service and all the new interviews that you posted to Prison Planet TV.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  I just wanted to run a couple of articles by you and get your take. I rarely miss the show, so if you've already covered it, I apologize.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  This first article is out of Forbes. The headline is, Soros warns U.S. could be on verge of dictatorial democracy, slams Fox and Glenn Beck.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  And that came out December 7th.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  Well, you got to love it. The controlled corporate left openly, all the major media groups that Soros publicly funds, it also came out as being given stimulus money.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  And so you'll have the control left claim the control rights going to set up a dictatorship.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  Remember how the Democrats would talk about the Patriot Act and torture and police state and NAFTA and GATT and how it was all horrible when Bush was in.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  Now the Democrats all love it and Republicans are suddenly all against it.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  And so, no, I didn't see that story, but I mean, Soros is always posing as this humanitarian when he admittedly helped the Nazis rob and round up Jews when he's Jewish.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  And then if you talk bad about him, the ADL comes out and says you're anti-Semitic. I mean, it's cuckoo for cocoa puffs. I mean, it's insane.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  I'm sorry, go ahead. That was your first article.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  Yeah, you're right. It's in media matters. All those guys are absurd.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  But it says that because of the Tea Party and because of the Americans' ability to fantasize unrealistically about the political system, and he uses 1984 as an example of how we're using all these fantasies to describe the political system.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Oh, we have this fantasy of liberty and this fantasy of not having austerity to pay all our money into the central banks.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  It's just terrible. We have this fantasy.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  Once they lied to us and told us globalism would be great, now people know that was a fraud.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  We know globalism is just what the big banks do to third world countries, but in the first world.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  And so people are waking up and so he's saying it's a fantasy.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  Let's pull that article up. Soros on, uh, Soros, U.S. on verge of democratic, uh, uh, what's the headline?
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  Uh, Soros warns U.S. could be on verge of dictatorial democracy.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  He said we're implementing some sort of dictatorial democracy because...
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  Oh, yeah. See, it's dictatorial if the American people take the states back and kick the bankers out.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  Uh, it's dictatorial if the Russians, uh, kick the oligarchs out.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  It's dictatorial if you don't run around licking their boots. Yeah, there it is.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Soros warns U.S. could be on verge of dictatorial democracy.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  Slam's Fox, Glenn Beck. Oh, yes. And we have Jay Rockefeller and all these other people running around saying that they want to openly censor the Internet.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  They are so scared of it and they go after big targets like Beck because if they can censor Beck or if they can censor WikiLeaks, they can censor anybody.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  Go ahead.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  Absolutely. This next one is New York Times and it says, uh, this is November 13th.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  NATO, the headline is NATO Seeks Afghan Police in the South. And in the first paragraph, it says, uh, General Petraeus is going to, um, start employing the help of former Mujahideen commanders to recruit them, to recruit, uh, police forces.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  It's always, they set these people up in 1979. I didn't like the Soviet Russians, but the truth is, and Brzezinski's written two books on it bragging now.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  He already knew it, but now he's admitted it, that in 79, they created the Mujahideen slash Al Qaeda. They had them attack the Russians over the border of Afghanistan and to other countries.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  They got the Russians to come in and take the bait. They didn't set it up with Charlie Wilson in 1983. I mean, it's just total lies.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  Right. So we got the group that Al Qaeda supposedly developed from and now we're employing them too.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  Never been at war with East Asia. Always been at war with East Asia. Never been at war with East Asia.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  Exactly. I got one. I got two more, really. Um, CBS News, you guys covered this, but I don't know if you got this exact article. It says experts.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  Did UN troops give Haitians cholera? And it says that, um, the UN and the CDC said that, uh, it would not be investigating further because to find out where the, uh, uh, cholera came from.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  Although, uh, experts have said it's, uh, novel to the area and it's a very, uh, violent strain previously unknown to the Western Hemisphere.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  And all the Haitians are believing it came in from the United Nations.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  And now we've got the CDC and World Health Organization saying, oh, we don't need to know where it came from.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  We don't need to investigate this because it would just, it's like, uh, it's like Cheney saying we can't investigate 9-11.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  Exactly. It's very suspicious. But look, during a total collapse of a society, I mean, their capital building collapsed, most of the government buildings collapsed.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They already basically were a lawless, uh, uh, society collapsed. Uh, I mean, you're going to have things like cholera when they don't have clean drinking water.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  And you've got all these UN troops coming in from other third world countries in Africa where cholera is rampant.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Uh, where we do know the UN is involved in, in these operations is Africa, Asia, uh, and, uh, other areas where they've been caught every year for decades,
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  giving people weaponized live polio, claiming it's a vaccine or giving them, you know, live, uh, syphilis or other, uh, infectious diseases.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  I mean, this is all on record. So I like to stick to where they're just on record doing it premeditatedly.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  Uh, but yeah, yeah, I mean, they probably did. I mean, my gut tells me they're probably there spreading it.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  Uh, but who knows? Uh, great points. Appreciate your call, Ben.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Shepard in Oregon. Shepard, you're on the air.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  Hey, Alex. It's Shepard with the intelhub.com. I also exposed the mass grave on your show on March 25th.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  I remember. Yeah, you've been a guest. What's on your mind?
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  Oh, man, just, uh, well, first of all, I wanted to tell you things, man. You guys are just dominating with this resistance against the new world order, doing a great job.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  But this down in Houston, uh, the city of Houston shuts down two radioactive water wells.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  Uh, I don't know if you caught that, uh, these wells feed Jersey village.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Well, I know that they're trying to put a cover story out and yes, I've seen that about a month ago or now five weeks ago.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  It was, oh my gosh, all over Texas and other states, there's been a 20 plus year coverup of high levels of radioactive isotopes in drinking water.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  We don't know where it came from, but the government covered it up. Uh, that's a cover story.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  We know that we know the phosphate mines, which is where most of sodium fluoride comes from is filled with radium and different isotopes of uranium.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  And so we know that that is what is, I mean, I had, I've had doctors and scientists on with the reports again over 10 years ago about this before it ever even came out.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  So that's how they spend it. Oh, oh, the water wells just had it in naturally. We're going to fix it. Oh, we're sorry.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  Oh, yeah. Hey, one other thing. Well, a couple other things. There's also these tall light poles. When I lived down in Phoenix, I noticed this.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  They were going, they were installing these light poles along all the freeway systems. Um, I happen to be an electrician.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  So, you know, I noticed this, but there's these awful tall light poles and they have most light poles will come on with a photo cell.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  It would be like the cheapest way to do it. They wouldn't turn on these lights with a radio transmitter on every pole where there's this big,
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  uh, 360 degree like radar looking dish on top of every pole with an antenna.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  And I've, I've had some other people send us some information at the info hub.com on this. No, no, no, that's a that's an acoustic device, sir.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  And I appreciate your call. We covered that again, 13 years ago. I put it in my film now 11 years ago, police state 2000.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  It was in the paper. They announced, oh, federal grant Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the senator, got it for us 1998.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  Uh, but they already put some in as a test in 97 and they are microphones, a shotgun microphones that can hear you hundreds of yards away.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  They've got passive face scanners. Uh, they've got license plate readers. And this is now all just been announced.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  So yes, people need to know what's going on. Appreciate your call, shepherd.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  Let's talk to Justin in Missouri, trying to move quick here now. Go ahead, Justin.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  Hey, how are you guys doing? Um, first of all, I want to say thank you guys for everything you're doing all listeners as well.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  But I just have a cool question. You know, how do I, uh, spread awareness? How do I get as many people as I can to actually open their eyes?
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  I actually had somebody tell me that they didn't care and radio friendly terms.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  Well, you need to move away from people that don't care. People, you don't have to get even the majority.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  There's always been a outraged focus minority that changes things for good or for bad.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  And it's a tiny group of globalists running all of this. You have rights. You have liberties.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  Here's an example in the city of Austin. And I know you're calling from Missouri.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  We've gotten the reports from the city. They buy it out of Florida.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  There are hundreds of chemicals in the so called fluoride that they buy it out of the water.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  Now they may sell some people that fluorides good for you and have that fake argument.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  But lead, mercury, arsenic, isotopes of radium, uranium and lead, you name it.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  And it depends on the city where they're buying it from. A lot of it comes from China and they don't even test what's in it.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  You simply have to do four years for that information. You have to then get it and then sue the city over it.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  I mean, we have to get aggressive here. Start an access TV show. If it's not in your town, it may be in a town 20 miles away.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Put my films on. Do your own show. Start your own news website. Call in to talk radio. Start your own blog.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  Do your own YouTube videos. Reach out. Go find a church where they're concerned about what's happening.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Organize. Get involved. You see something hypocrisy filled?
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  Stay there. I want to come back and talk more about solutions or ideas of what you can do, Justin.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  And remember, you don't have to save the world by yourself.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  It's simply pick a few issues, get involved, take action and know that millions of other people are doing similar things.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  And together, the globalist can't stop us. We'll be right back.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  This is an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  And remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been evaluating.
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver. They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000. The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169. Get all your questions answered before your money is worth a zero.

[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Alley C.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  Why Alley C? Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria and fungi.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  Alley C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity and duration of common colds.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  Studies show Alley C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal and viral infections. One tablet of Alley C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  Alley C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  We're in folks, tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists because we have an audience of listeners that are activists, that are informed and care about liberty.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  I would just tell Justin to form a tyranny response team. There's no organization, it's just a term.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  We are change, a info wars study group. You can give it kind of an innocuous name and then just get members, get organizations, go out and have demonstrations, go out and get involved.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  I mean, here's a quick example and we've got the hotline open right now if they have a problem.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  There's my camera guys all over the country. Police will just walk up on the side of a sidewalk in a city or a town and say,
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  camera's off, you got to have our permission to videotape in America. But sometimes the cops aren't thugs and understand the bill of rights and, you know, don't use the rubric of terrorism or security.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  But right now, Rob Do and Jason Douglas are outside the airport. I'm going to have them shoot video showing the hypocrisy of the airport workers, people in general aviation, driving right on with no ID or by swiping a card.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  Right onto the tarmac, right onto the airport. Meanwhile, the airline pilots who actually fly the giant aircraft that are incredible weapons.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  They're trusted to take off and land and do all of this. They've got IQ is probably 40 points higher on average than the people in the TSA.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  But they've got to have their genitals grope and this pilot a few weeks ago put videos out showing how there's almost no security for everybody.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  But the general public flying commercially and the airline pilots and flight attendants and now the government is investigating him and raided his house.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  I mean, is that not East Germany? And the message is, and he was told, we don't like you criticizing us. We're going to try to get you fired.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  You don't show people that the emperor is not wearing any clothes. You don't call shenanigans.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  See, as more and more people point out the common sense fraud that's going on here, the globalists don't have a leg to stand on what they're doing is outrageous classical certified tyranny with a high tech icing.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  And it's right there for anybody who has two brain cells rubbed together.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  And it's complete with the bank stealing trillions of imploding economy cameras going up everywhere citizen spies.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  I mean, you want to live in 1984. We're going over the edge of the cliff right now.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights is the parachute and we can climb our way back out of this if we don't break our neck or legs on the bottom.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  But I've sent the guys out to just show how because they had YouTube ban these videos.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  They had YouTube take down the videos until AP and others carried it, then they kind of backed off of this airline pilot shooting with his camera phone.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  The hypocrisy of the airline workers bypassing security.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  Well, we're just any idiot. I've pointed this out for years.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  Anybody can drive by an airport and watch people pulling up at the front and the cops all out there in uniforms and acting all suspicious.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  The giant perimeters wide open. There's dozens of entrances with people just driving in.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  You got guys with turbines on their head loading the stuff on the plane.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  And I'm not saying they're bad because they got turbines on their head.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  My point is, is that we're told to be afraid of it. Be very afraid.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  So you ask, what is a solution? There's lots of ways to counter this.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  How was Chilchescu brought down in the months before he fell in 89 in Romania?
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  People started posting posters of him homemade with hand drawings of him as a Nazi,
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  him as a vampire, him as a piece of trash.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  People went out at night organically as they're putting up their own signs.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  They defiled him. They pulled him down to what he is, a piece of garbage.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  No longer the big God up there.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  And everything looked like he had total control, but it's like a house full of termites.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  You just peel the pane away and it's all rotten and the whole house just collapses.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  We don't want that to happen because it's very messy.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  We want to take our government back like drug addicts, get off the government at a moderate speed,
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  phase people like East Germany got phased into a more of a free society,
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  phase us back towards the Republic, back towards liberty.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  But to do that, you're going to have to get involved and you're going to have to be bold.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  So there's a million things you can do, Justin.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  There's a million different solutions and positive things that can be done.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  But does that answer your question?
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  Well, thank you. Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  No, you know, just kind of getting sick of seeing the government do this and people turn their heads.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  It's getting old.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  Well, it's all illegitimate. It's all illegitimate, Justin.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  I mean, it's totally illegitimate. I mean, I appreciate your call.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  Again, I saw a Time Magazine article today with a woman writer who had her child grabbed.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  She's angry.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  Time Magazine, most of their people aren't government agents.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  Sure, their old editor, that was the editor of Newsweek,
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  people like strobe Talbot openly call for world government.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  But most of their people are kind of fellow travelers.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  They just buy into the mindset.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  But I've seen New York Times, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine,
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  hundreds of articles where the reporters are being violated so they're saying they're dying.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  Look.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  We're on the march.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N-150.com.
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  We've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  They're asking for more matches.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:12.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Well, Rob Do called up one of our great camera men and video editors.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  He's out there with Jason Douglas at the Austin International Airport,
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  where a lady with a pacemaker who's a sexual assault victim, rape victim,
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  refused to let the woman grab her breast so they manhandled her,
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  slammed her on the ground and drug her away to jail.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  And she's banned from the airport.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  Now TSA's announced they're going to take over the roadways, the shopping malls.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  They're going to invade all the public spaces with huge telescreens,
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  giving you orders to spy just where you're being forced to hear their announcements.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  And this is how we're acclimated.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  Rob Do's like, oh, they were pretty nice.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  They pulled up and we said, aren't we on a public road?
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  They were not on the property of the airport.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  And the cops said, yes, give me your IDs.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  They ran them, of course, put them in a database,
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  all part of being secret police.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  Probably rapes and robberies going on about a mile away, but who cares?
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  And they told them, well, cops will probably be back later.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  You better call the airport and ask permission to be out here.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  But they said, well, we don't need permission.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  So there's your land of the free home of the brave.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  Then the cops went on, they said, what are you here for?
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  They said, we're here with Alex Jones.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  We're here.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  He has an internet TV show, local TV show, local radio.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  And we're here to cover all of that.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  And we're here to show that a lot of the airport employees don't have to go through the TSA screening.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  So in America, you know, it's normal to have cops ask, what are you doing?
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  Where are you going?
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  Unless you're criminal banks, unless you're big corrupt governments,
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  unless you're Dyncor running giant child kidnapping rings,
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  then, oh, it's admitted they run those.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  Let's not rate them.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  No one dare do that.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  So that's how they operate.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  That's what they're up to.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  Let's continue here with your phone calls.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  A lot of big guests coming up by the way during this week,
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  but I wanted to just open the phones up today and cover news and rant because I've been gone for a week.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in New York.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  Sean, you're on the air.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  Hello.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  I've been listening now for, I don't know, a couple of weeks with my wife.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  And just realized that you might be the guy to call with a question I have.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  Sure.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  I'm actually an army medic currently.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  And I recently tried to go ahead and get a religious exemption for immunizations.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  And my chain of command just straight up pulled me into their office
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  and told me that if I go ahead and push forward with this
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  and deny their quote unquote lawful orders to go ahead and get immunized,
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  then they're threatening me with universal code of military justice.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  They're going to take rank and money and so on and so forth.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  How many shots a year do they try to give you?
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  I can't even keep track of all of them anymore, honestly.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  And I'm the guy that gives the shots.
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  Like I said, I'm a medic.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  It's getting tough to keep track of how many they want to give anymore.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  You need to do the research on this with just a search engine.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  They've had large groups of army doctors, not just army medics in the last 15 years.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  Over and over again, say no to the anthrax shots.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  It was a big fight in Colorado.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  Turned out the anthrax shots were causing autoimmune responses in the ventricles of the heart
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  and were causing a lot of deaths from heart attacks.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  That was confirmed and the shots were suspended.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  But listen, there's another big wrinkle to this.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  They can claim that you've waived your rights and will take all inoculations if they're non-experimental.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  But most of the shots you're given, and you're not told this,
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  that a lot of the generals and people have sweetheart deals
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  and former generals have sweetheart deals with drug developers.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  And so they're in the final testing after animals, they're doing it on troops.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  You know, you don't have foster kids to do it to.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  They're favorite black foster kids.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  You know, why not the troops for their quote, animal testing?
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  That's what Henry Kissinger called you, was dumb animals.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  And so to give you an idea how ruthless they are, you go back to the field manuals,
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  85, 89, 91, 96.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  The army admitted DU, totally deadly, not just radioactive, but deadly poison.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  You inhale even a certain micro amount.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  It will reduce your life massively.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  It will end up killing you.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  Now they just say, no problem, no, no, decon-needed, no, guys, enjoy.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  Use it everywhere.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.000]  They serve it out to, you know, more and more munitions.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  It's the same thing with the vaccines.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  I've seen reports of some troops being given over 100 vaccines in a year.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  Now, obviously they'll go, well, I only got 55 shots.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  What do you mean 100?
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  Well, some of those shots, as you know, medic, have three, four things in them.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  And they're doing all these new DNA vaccine tests.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  That's in Wired Magazine and Reuters the last few months.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  So they're testing things on you.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  I had one of Rick Perry's staff, I've seen the guy on TV, he's in his press group,
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  come to in-game premiere three and a half years ago.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  And he admitted, he said, yeah, we had troops come down to the medical installation in San Antonio,
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  this is before he worked for the governor, before he was governor.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  And he said, we gave them all shots.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  We were told to give it to them and they all died.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Then we were told to put on decon suits, clean out the area.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  And the guy just said, but I want you to know, Rick Perry is still a good man.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  Rick Perry wasn't involved in the killing of him.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  The point was, that's what he said.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  Yes, what you say in this film is true.
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  And he told me the story.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  So it's just all kind of out in the open that, well, that's what we do.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  So then you'll remember in 2003, they tried to force all police, all firefighters,
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  all medical workers, all military, all first responders to take smallpox.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  It too caused brain inflammation and seizures and a whole host of neurological disorders.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  This was all over the news at the time.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  They tried the new Freedom Initiative, excuse me, the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act initiative
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  to try to get first responders trained for forced inoculation of the public.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  That was mainstream news, but the enforcers wouldn't do it.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  I saw an LA Times report that 99 plus percent out of 400,000 plus first responders, less than 1%, went along with it.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  It just came out to a few thousand.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  You can pull up that LA Times article.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  But the final equation issue here is, A, they're giving you experimental shots,
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  and they don't want you to read the law and Army regulations that they're not even supposed to give anybody an experimental shot
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  unless you sign a waiver form.
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  That's A.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  B, they've had whole groups of doctors and a colonel and an air base.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  There are so many cases of it, just pull them up.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  Say no.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  And so they will try to corner you because you're seen as a leader.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  But I haven't pulled it up lately, but I believe they're supposed to honor religious exemption.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  Then they have this lie that if you aren't immune, others won't be immune.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  But if they've all been given the shot, aren't they supposedly immune?
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  They don't want you to know that the Canadian and British government did study last year,
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  showing that it reduced your immunity by more than 50% to take the H1N1 shot.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  It both reduced immunity for the swine flu and for the regular seasonal flu.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  And there's more news of that today I'm about to cover.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  I'm glad you brought that up to remind me.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  But it's all a culture of color of law and intimidation.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  They don't even really teach that you don't have to follow an unlawful order.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  It's kind of a footnote now.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  But they can burn you.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  They can throw you under the bus.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  I mean, I wouldn't be arrogant, obviously.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  You sound like a smart, calm guy.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  I would print up a report, a two-page summary, and I would put it in nice binders
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  with all the mainstream news articles and where they had to suspend the anthrax and smallpox.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  Remember, they gave just a few thousand reporters the smallpox and a bunch of them died?
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  I mean, this is some hardcore stuff.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  And so I would just print those reports up and I would go to them,
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  but I would also just search the term military religious exemption from vaccines.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  Look, I can do that right now.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  Here, let me say military religious exemption.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  I mean, they grow a lot of these vaccines in pig parts.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  I'll guarantee pig kidneys.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  I'll guarantee that Muslims don't have to do it.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  Military religious exemption.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  And it appears that there is, oh, look here, military.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  Military is trying to change the religious exemption and get rid of it.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  Let me see.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  Military changes religious rights.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  I'd have to read over this, but in the past there has been a religious exemption.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  But does that answer your question?
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  Well, the thing is, I already have the regulation for the army.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  It's Army Regulation 40-562.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  You can find it right on Google.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  It's entitled Immunizations and Chemo Prophylaxis.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  But there's an old section in there about different types of exemption, medical exemption,
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  and administrative exemptions.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  Yeah, so you have an exemption.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  I mean, I know last time I checked it was there.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  So you're saying you do have that, but they're just saying we're going to bust you if you don't.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  Exactly.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  Man, well, I mean, that's the same criminal tactic of coercion.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  And we need to recognize it as criminal that they told the nurses and the police and the firemen in 2003 with a smallpox in 1999 with the anthrax.
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  It's the same thing.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  They tried in 1991 with the anthrax.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  It's the same thing they did last year where they told all the medical workers and people, you've got to take these shots or you'll be fired.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  When they finally stood up, they didn't fire them because they know there's liability.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  So that's outrageous.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  They're telling you, you've got to take whatever we say.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  What I say is you put it on the line, this is tyranny.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  You're a soldier supposedly for the Republic.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  I would quietly organize people with their rights.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  It's your right to print off the exemption and then say, I wanted you guys to know this is there.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  And I'm being told, I mean, look, even on a British Navy ship, they couldn't order the crew to slit their wrist.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  You know, I mean, these are deadly vaccines.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  It's your right.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  Congress has put the exemption in there.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  And you notice I didn't just tell you there was an exemption because I wanted to double check it was still there.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  But you gave me the 40-562.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  We'll pull that up.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  But I mean, there it is.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  But I'll bet on top of it, they're trying to push experimental vaccines and it's illegal.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  It's a felony.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  If the commanding medical officer, at least it was a few years ago, tries to make you take an experimental shot and doesn't tell you that.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  I mean, that's criminal.
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  You're being used like Joseph Mengele used people in Nazi Germany.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  So what do you say to that?
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  I mean, so you go to him and say, I have this exemption.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  They just say, look, we're going to bust you, buddy.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  We're going to bust you down a couple of ranks here.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  And honestly, that's fine by me.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  If they bust me, they bust me.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000]  If they kick me out, they kick me out.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  I'd rather not be part of the system that is going to cause so much pain and suffering in the people that are supposed to be defending the Americans.
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  Let me ask you about adverse reactions since you're the guy pumping everybody full of those shots.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  What type of adverse reactions you're seeing?
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  Well, the most common adverse reaction to the quote unquote flu vaccine is the flu.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  Of course, you get sick from the live nasal shot.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  The biggest problem I've had, actually, was with smallpox shots right before we deployed the late 06 into early 07.
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  We were forced to give out smallpox vaccines.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  Between the cankerous sore that rises up from the inoculation site to the extremely high, dangerously high fever,
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  I was actually surprised that I never heard of anybody in the Army dying.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  No, they died in 2003 and 2006.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  And notice they backed off in 03, but then came racing back again later.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  That's what they do.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  Well, then again, last year, while I was in Afghanistan, the whole H1N1 thing kicked up.
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  Of course, World Health Organization, everybody forgot to tell everybody,
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  was that the only people that were actually dying from H1N1 were people that already had autoimmune deficiencies.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  They were failing to put that information out there because, let's be honest,
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  there's no money in a cure, but there is plenty of money in treatment.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  But that's only one angle. They finance the tyranny with our money.
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  But the overall end game is the eugenics.
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  Listen, it's your right as the medic to hand out all the medical literature to those soldiers.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  It's your job, and you give them the exemptions, you give them the adverse reaction sheets,
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:18.000]  adverse reactions like cancer, guion beret, narcolepsy, permanent epilepsy.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  Just think about how cold-blooded that is that they don't tell you that.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  I know people involved in medical trials, people involved at big pharma companies,
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  and they just sit around and brag about it.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  The number one guinea pig group is U.S. troops, and they just do whatever they want.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  Good to hear from you, Sean. God bless you. I would hand out all that literature,
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  and I would stand up. I mean, that's what it's going to take. I would stand up.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Because the sick thing is I've read the reports where the officers aren't taking those shots.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  They know. Well, in fact, I'll pull it up for you right now.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  Guys, pull up German military not taking H1N1.
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  First, we learned that Merkel and others weren't taking it, then we learned the German troops weren't taking it,
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  then we learned the NATO troops wouldn't take it, and then the media spun it.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  Well, they're being given a safe vaccine now. They offered them another one.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  I mean, they won't even, in Europe, they won't even give this to their troops.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  By the way, here's a natural news report. Again, he has links to all the different mainstream news articles on this.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  It's up at infowars.com.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  Swine flu pandemic outbreak sweeping through Britain, even though 70% were vaccinated last year.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  Yeah, Americans at record numbers refuse the shots, but the vast majority of the Brits, it's like a religion now to roll over to rape.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  And it says a swine flu pandemic is sleeping through Britain, despite the fact that 70% of Britons over 65 population was vaccinated against swine flu last year.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  This year, that number is nearly the same, 68.5, but flu vaccine proponents insist that until everyone is vaccinated, the flu will continue to infect people.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  See, see, and it's reported then that a lot of these people were vaccinated.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  Well, the major government study showed, now there's the headline, German soldiers receive different swine flu vaccine than German people.
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  Sorry, that it massively reduces your immunity to other flues when you take this. Even the Canadian government study showed that.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  What these vaccine advocates absolutely will not admit, however, is how many of those who are sick with the flu this year also got vaccinated last year.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  This little detail is left out of every mainstream media report on vaccines and the flu.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  I simply refuse to mention this at all. This all important number, leaving readers to leap the conclusion that only those who were not vaccinated get sick from the flu.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  Most infected patients were previously vaccinated, and it goes on to all the mainstream media links that confirm that.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  Now, let me go further here. If you don't know about Project Shad, if you want to know soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, what the globalists think of you.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  Henry Kissinger calls you dumb animals. They've done thousands and thousands of declassified tests, including hundreds and hundreds that were fatal by design, murdering you.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  They shoot you up with stuff. No one is going to kill you. Now, that's who runs our country. Project Shad, the list goes on and on.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  You know about the government shooting up black people and then Guatemalan children and others with syphilis.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  You know about the polio, the UN being caught, the UN being caught sterilizing women. Okay, why do any of us trust the government anyway?
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  They've been caught committing crime upon crime upon bloodthirsty murderous crime, tens of thousands of top Nazis brought to the U.S. to run every facet from NASA to the Centers for Disease Control, top eugenicists everywhere.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  But, oh, let's trust the government. Janet Napolitano, she cares about me.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  Right back, stay with us, other key intel straight ahead.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?

[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  When I first joined, I was being sued. So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program of its kind.

[02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:32.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.

[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  Sharon has a good little analogy or parable. It's the peanut example. If you gave 300 million Americans a bag of peanuts and had them eat it, thousands would die. Hundreds of thousands would get sick.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  By the way, we didn't have as many of these allergies until we started eating GMO crops, and that's been directly linked to it. Same with the vaccines. It screws up your immune system. It makes you, I mean, that's admitted with many allergies.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  The more allergies you get, the more things it then triggers for your body to then become allergic to. But if you give 300 million Americans a bag of peanuts and have them eat it, thousands are going to die on the spot. Tens of thousands are going to get ill.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  It's the same thing with vaccines. You give it to millions of people. You're going to have problems, even if it was mother's milk. But it's not.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  That's why in the 70s, they had to pass the multi-billion-dollar taxpayer-funded vaccine damage fund, where you secretly waive your rights and sign an agreement, and then you get a paltry sum of money.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  And now they're trying to put other drugs under that same liability protection. So we pay for the drugs that kill us, and then we pay for taxes for the liability of the problems it causes.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  It's incredible. I'm almost out of time. Let's try to ram in as many calls as possible. Jericho in Texas here on the air.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  I just want to say thank you for whatever you're doing right now, and thank you, your crew. You guys woke me up about six months ago, and I've been trying to warn people that I know what's coming.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  And last week, I tried to have a viewing of Jesse Ventura's police data episode, and I know I had it recorded because I watched it previously. And when I tried to show it to him, I couldn't watch it.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  Was it in your TVO?
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  Well, you know TVO remotely accesses and controls your box and monitors what you watch and what you do, and I've seen the reports. We are changed, in fact, in an analysis of it, that TVO has been in other DVRs remotely erasing it.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  So they do not want that. I mean, you heard Ventura on here two weeks ago. He said, yes, government pressure shut down the re-airing of that, and other powerful shows aren't re-airing or airing as much.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  And that's probably it for the show. It actually got a big audience, had an effect, and then the government shut it down.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  Wow.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  Yeah, wow. I have another quick question for you. I mean, say somebody who's like me, I'm in my mid-twenties, like, what do I do in a situation like this? As far as getting prepared for what's coming?
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  Well, it's not coming. It's already here. Remember that. And it's just what increment? We're like a frog in a pot that's about to boil, and we're kind of getting sleepy.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  We need to realize that this is not a hot tub. It's getting hotter. We're going to pass out, jump out of the pot. Turn the television off unless you use it as a way to deprogram people who are already in a trance state.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  What's so effective is you show them my films via the Mind Control device. It can unlock them. That's why the films, which I haven't even really plugged today, are the most powerful weapon we've got.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  Hundreds of millions of people have seen my films. They're online at prisonplanet.tv. You can go to the Alex Jones channel and see the videos.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  Your computer screen doesn't have the same flicker rate as a television, so it isn't as effective as a deprogramming system. But that's why most people we've woken up heard about the show through films.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  So get the DVDs, burn copies, devo can't erase that. That's why they want to go to pure digital with everything, and they admit have all the different programs and things built in with a kill switch where they can remote access and wipe stuff out and memory-hole it.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  Jericho, I'm out of time. Resistance is victory, Jericho. And the bigger issue is realizing that all of these goofballs, all these government minions, all these corporate people, they're just dumb-down fools like everybody else.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  I was once as dumb as dirt. I'm still dumb as dirt on many issues. It's that striving for knowledge. It's that relearning history. It's that taking action.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:44.000]  Great job, crew. Retransmission starts now at FullWars.com.
