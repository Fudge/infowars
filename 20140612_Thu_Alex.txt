[02:36.760 --> 02:46.200]  have the all mainstream news they are now publicly shipping illegals to bases
[02:46.200 --> 02:54.160]  all over the United States in Massachusetts in Washington in Tennessee
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.440]  is the New York Times is reporting that they're not letting any media in well
[02:59.440 --> 03:03.960]  guess what we just went on the base yesterday and I can't come up with a
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.760]  headline sensational enough to match reality but here's the headline

[11:28.120 --> 11:36.000]  be frank with everybody it's not just everything the globalists are doing is
[11:36.000 --> 11:43.280]  over the top it's that the establishment in plain view engaged in a giant con
[11:43.280 --> 11:51.560]  artist game sits up there inverting reality I was watching CNN MSNBC this
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.640]  morning I was on a elliptical this is gonna be so angry I can go for like an
[11:55.640 --> 12:03.120]  hour fast watching it it's better than listening to rock and roll but it makes
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.200]  me angry I was really angry after I got off I think I shouldn't have watched it
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.680]  I realized I've been real angry lately because I've been watching the enemy in
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.320]  the morning to analyze them and they're just so sick so narcissistic so
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.320]  dishonored it's just hell would be being locked in the room with MSNBC crew
[12:20.320 --> 12:29.080]  for eternity I mean I just that just is just the the miscreant Craven
[12:30.640 --> 12:38.960]  stunted will to power that these people engage in and they're unbowed
[12:38.960 --> 12:48.240]  fascism oh I'm having flashbacks but that's up to this morning and then we're
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.120]  going ah the tea party's just credited they're done they're dead it's all over
[12:54.120 --> 13:03.440]  for them they you know just elected this new tea partier or or just he just
[13:03.440 --> 13:10.080]  won the primary David Bratt in Virginia you know bringing down canner oh my
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.000]  gosh can you believe how ridiculous all this is I mean these people are real
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.160]  cooks boy this is gonna discredit the Republicans forever when they're all in
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.000]  their eyes scared to death this is exactly what the Republican and
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.360]  Democratic leadership have circled the wagons the last few years giving more
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.560]  money collectively than Republicans and Democrats spend to fight each other to
[13:34.560 --> 13:38.440]  kill the libertarian takeover the Republican Party we've always said we
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.720]  need a third party but as Ron Paul pointed out the best strategies to take
[13:42.720 --> 13:48.360]  over a major party and that's happening so there's a race to the finish here and
[13:48.360 --> 13:54.120]  the system knows that so they're busy auditing everybody in the tea party
[13:54.120 --> 13:57.120]  harassing everyone
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.840]  sending the FBI to people's houses arresting filmmakers arresting governors
[14:01.840 --> 14:05.840]  for no reason a reign of Soviet-style terror that makes Richard Nixon look like
[14:05.840 --> 14:22.840]  an angel all of this is going on and you've got the dinosaur media up there
[14:22.840 --> 14:30.440]  implying that the tea parties destroyed and discredited and you know another
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.400]  having headlines like well we thought they were dead but are they again the
[14:34.400 --> 14:39.600]  tea party is the hottest thing in the United States and worldwide they have
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.840]  tea party style groups taking over areas of France England winning all the major
[14:44.840 --> 14:50.480]  local EU and country-wide elections set within another election to take Europe
[14:50.480 --> 14:56.960]  and turn off the EU set within another two-year cycle election to take the UK
[14:56.960 --> 15:03.760]  they have tea party style groups in Ireland in Scotland declaring independence
[15:03.760 --> 15:13.320]  they've got them in Arikjavec Iceland Spain Greece Italy everywhere they've
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.640]  got tea party members of Parliament in Italy going to Bilderberg meetings and
[15:17.640 --> 15:23.240]  getting beaten up and then the state police respond by coming in and backing
[15:23.240 --> 15:26.600]  them up and letting them go in and threatening start arresting people in
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.000]  the hotel and then Bilderberg group members the next morning on Saturday
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.040]  never before helicopters were flying them out because the police at the state
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.240]  level turned against them in Switzerland we were there I mean we're
[15:38.240 --> 15:45.560]  getting close ladies and gentlemen you know the story of William Tell in the
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.080]  Swiss it's a true story the apple the whole nine yards the Swiss are like the
[15:51.080 --> 16:02.600]  Texans of Europe and ladies and gentlemen the police two years ago now
[16:02.600 --> 16:09.720]  three years ago in Switzerland Paul Watson was there covering it in HD when
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.880]  the Bilderberg security beat up the member of the Italian Parliament and
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.000]  marched in there the state police showed up and marched in and said we'll start
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.960]  arresting you and said you will talk to this delegation and we had a whole
[16:21.960 --> 16:26.400]  bunch of the Canton leaders from all over the country the state leaders who
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.900]  actually run Switzerland their federal government's week states run at the
[16:29.900 --> 16:36.760]  cantons marched in and the Bilderberg people have started evacuating and it
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.120]  was so epic it took me a few days to figure out what had just happened my
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.000]  point is it can be like Chalcescu in Romania these people could fall in
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.720]  hours if we want them to I'm not saying they're gonna fall in hours today it's a
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.960]  figure of speech there will come times when tyrants fall in hours when babble
[16:54.960 --> 16:58.120]  on the great falls in an hour
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.880]  and the merchants of the earth who trafficked and men's souls will beat
[17:05.880 --> 17:11.520]  themselves on their breasts and say Babylon Babylon the great has fallen in
[17:11.520 --> 17:18.840]  one hour these worldly people are the losers ladies and gentlemen not the
[17:18.840 --> 17:25.720]  winners it's easy to cheat and get ahead until the termites eat through the
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.480]  foundation and everything collapses it's easy for cancer to grow and take over
[17:29.480 --> 17:40.400]  the body and think it's winning until it kills the host so epic and it hit me
[17:40.400 --> 17:44.920]  like a ton of bricks today I mean I know we've been saying but it hit me so
[17:44.920 --> 17:54.480]  strong it's real they are imploding the entire border and advertising in
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.800]  Mexican newspapers and on NPR doing a story on this right now NPR has had a
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.840]  show the last week they've been airing where they raise money to send money to
[18:04.840 --> 18:11.040]  think tanks in Mexico to give the kids money playing tickets and bags and in
[18:11.040 --> 18:18.400]  sack lunches to fly them to the United States and to bust them to the border and
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.240]  stage them where the illegals are just pouring across whole hog and
[18:24.240 --> 18:32.200]  effectively like a blitzkrieg Nazi invasion of France we are completely
[18:32.200 --> 18:39.040]  overrun I mean we are witnessing dizzying treason I mean treason isn't
[18:39.040 --> 18:43.480]  even a strong enough word and no one in history has had traders inside their
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.080]  government do something like this there's never been a war like this this is
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.640]  so high-tech and sophisticated as the power plants are turned off as the
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.240]  Obamacare shuts down the small businesses and bankrupts the blue collar
[18:55.240 --> 18:59.760]  workers with payroll taxes increases and it's all called liberal because it's a
[18:59.760 --> 19:05.000]  supposed black guy's the figurehead and Obama announces on CBS News I just got
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.440]  chills two nights ago that he wants to look at executive orders for Australian
[19:09.440 --> 19:19.200]  gun bans of everything down to single-shot I mean whoa whoa whoa and then

[25:09.640 --> 25:14.400]  in a blackout of actual photos and real journalism they're just spinning it like
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.000]  how sweet Obama is taking care of the illegal kids or the immigrant children
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.120]  and then NPR we got a report coming out on this this afternoon has a promo going
[25:27.120 --> 25:33.000]  on all its shows to raise money taxpayer funded radio to ship the kids from all
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.560]  over the world here as America implodes and veterans are living on the streets
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.920]  everywhere I'm talking about veterans that don't have drug problems that's
[25:45.920 --> 25:54.960]  going on but the illegals the teenagers are just pouring in and then Obama could
[25:54.960 --> 25:58.760]  say their children in fact he came out and said this is part of our new Dream
[25:58.760 --> 26:06.120]  Act come to El Norte no one has ever done this this is the federal government
[26:06.120 --> 26:11.920]  directly encouraging and helping ship in teenagers to be put directly on the
[26:11.920 --> 26:17.400]  federal welfare breast the federal mammary gland with taxpayer money to then
[26:17.400 --> 26:25.200]  be obedient servants to ban guns at the voting booth I mean it's here and this
[26:25.200 --> 26:28.960]  is just the beginning so many tens of thousands are pouring across a day we've
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.200]  had border patrol agents send us reports that have been published that drudges
[26:32.200 --> 26:36.520]  carried and others that this is the beginning this is just the breakdown of
[26:36.520 --> 26:42.000]  the border once it fully collapses collapsed failed Mexico can fully
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  collapse the U.S. clowered and piven agenda 21 will be complete total

[26:58.920 --> 27:03.520]  get government contracts and fiat money like H.E.B. and Walmart so they'll make
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.960]  money feeding the mass as we go from 50 plus percent not working and being
[27:07.960 --> 27:14.720]  dependent to 70 80 percent they will then vote to take the 20 percent middle

[27:41.880 --> 27:45.080]  came out that I'm reporting on this in the late 90s that later years later came
[27:45.080 --> 27:48.720]  out it was a secret plan to let Tony Blair secret plan to bring any legals
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.760]  to bring any legals by the millions over his was it eight nine years of
[27:54.760 --> 28:02.480]  tenure and the French would stage it with the UN at the train stations load
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.240]  the trains and then the border patrol at the outside of the tunnel would turn
[28:07.240 --> 28:12.680]  their backs videos of this as the people yelling and celebrating as invading

[33:50.680 --> 33:56.160]  now Al Qaeda is taking Fallujah to Crete and they're saying oh we may have to
[33:56.160 --> 34:04.120]  send back US troops to fight Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda was put there by NATO oh
[34:04.120 --> 34:07.280]  our troops will fight and die and the contractors will fight and die real
[34:07.280 --> 34:12.680]  Al Qaeda they'll really be killing them but they're funded and trained and the
[34:12.680 --> 34:15.680]  door is opened by the criminals that run our government that's what I'm
[34:15.680 --> 34:20.160]  explaining to everybody ladies and gentlemen there's the headline Iraq
[34:20.160 --> 34:28.480]  gives Obama green light to commence kinetic support against Al Qaeda and how
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.560]  do you explain to the public that it's on record that those bases were set up
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.360]  three plus years ago by three known actual Al Qaeda groups one of them even
[34:38.360 --> 34:44.280]  calls himself on their black flag the bin Laden Brigade and they set up bases
[34:44.280 --> 34:49.080]  in Turkey forum as well and they launched chemical attacks to blame Assad and
[34:49.080 --> 34:55.520]  got caught and now it's mainstream news that large parts of Iraq are falling to
[34:55.520 --> 35:00.560]  them because the Iraqi government didn't go along after the quote liberation 10
[35:00.560 --> 35:05.040]  plus years later sort of doing things the way they wanted to run to set up a
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.840]  secular government again no no you don't Saudi Arabia runs the Middle East
[35:09.840 --> 35:16.880]  they like Wahhabist they're gonna put Al Qaeda in charge and then people go
[35:16.880 --> 35:26.440]  well Alex you don't want Iran taken over Iraq see how crazy that is Iran's
[35:26.440 --> 35:30.760]  taken over some western areas with their infiltrators but that's why'd you get
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.600]  rid of Saddam so that would happen see the globalists create the problem and
[35:34.600 --> 35:38.480]  then they sit there and go well we got a wink wink put Al Qaeda in because they're
[35:38.480 --> 35:45.360]  fighting Iran what what and then the public doesn't even know the players
[35:45.360 --> 35:54.200]  Shiite Wahhabist and then I checked it's in the news these illegal aliens when
[35:54.200 --> 35:57.760]  they get off these planes don't even go through customs they're just taken
[35:57.760 --> 36:01.600]  directly by bus and given sack lunches to bases because they're honored guest I
[36:01.600 --> 36:09.320]  mean the federal government their NPR this is breaking today runs a PR program
[36:11.160 --> 36:17.280]  to raise money to give the kids the plane tickets to come here I mean this
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.120]  is incredible if you're an old person old lady whatever and you don't pay your
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.600]  property taxes you don't pay the income taxes they will come and if you hold up
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.200]  in your house they will send a SWAT team in to shoot you people we got to be
[36:30.200 --> 36:34.720]  loving you let the kids come here pay for it oh really they'll kill Americans I
[36:34.720 --> 36:38.440]  don't care what color you are if you don't pay their fake taxes to pay for
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.720]  these illegals but then they use our big heart and say come on let's advertise
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.120]  that everybody in the world can come here now they're going legalize all the
[36:47.120 --> 36:55.920]  illegals and let them come in or more just going to come illegally what do you
[36:55.920 --> 37:03.920]  think legalizing 30 million illegal aliens is going to do ladies and gentlemen
[37:03.920 --> 37:09.040]  what do you think that's going to do when they say they can then bring their
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.080]  other family members here and they're an anchor to bring them in it's going to
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.160]  accelerate people pouring in and that's exactly what's happened since Obama
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.520]  start stopped enforcing immigration law and started stopping the deporting of
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.520]  people now there's an even bigger flood and it turns out the criminal occupied
[37:25.520 --> 37:30.360]  mercilessly wicked federal government is orchestrating and running the whole
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.000]  thing and not letting the media in well our people went in staff sergeant Joe

[37:58.080 --> 38:02.160]  the New York Times here admitting that they're deploying them to military
[38:02.160 --> 38:07.800]  bases from Massachusetts to Washington state I mean they are flying them
[38:07.800 --> 38:11.320]  everywhere and they're staying they're getting lawyers and everybody else that's
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.520]  coming staying until this country goes completely bankrupt which is the official
[38:15.520 --> 38:21.160]  clowered and pivot plan and they are going to be given driver's license most
[38:21.160 --> 38:23.640]  of them are 16 or older and they're going to vote and they're going to take
[38:23.640 --> 38:30.320]  our guns and Obama is in Reuters and RT we wrote about this days ago when he
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.320]  first said it Mikhail Thelan did and then RT and Reuters have picked it up
[38:33.320 --> 38:39.840]  Obama sites Australia's gun confiscation program as an example for the U.S. right
[38:39.840 --> 38:47.000]  here and then we played the clip I mean that this is this is here this is
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.520]  happening the time for denials over ladies and gentlemen this is an illegitimate
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.240]  government and they want to call me a terrorist for saying that fine you
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.120]  people are violating every law up one side down the other I'm not funding
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.600]  al-Qaeda I'm not paying to bring illegal aliens here and house them at bases to
[39:06.600 --> 39:12.320]  then be fenced out the local la rasa groups I am not shipping narcotics in
[39:12.320 --> 39:15.480]  like this giant mule operation that's definitely what it is it I mean our
[39:15.480 --> 39:20.960]  country folks is being it's called being overrun to use a military term we are
[39:20.960 --> 39:26.240]  completely overrun and it's all over Latin America the planes are loading
[39:26.240 --> 39:35.840]  with the children I put a tweet out today on real Alex Jones that I think says
[39:35.840 --> 39:44.560]  it all if you go to real Alex Jones scroll down for me guys thank you I said
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.960]  George Washington launched our Republic and Obama's killing it we have come
[39:47.960 --> 39:56.080]  full circle Obama is a great man he is the America slayer always Stalin was a
[39:56.080 --> 39:59.840]  great man great at being evil but he was great
[39:59.840 --> 40:06.240]  Genghis Khan was great Adolf Hitler was great great doesn't mean good just means
[40:06.240 --> 40:10.320]  they were big they did it big
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.120]  Obama is a great man as you can say whatever he want he was the figurehead
[40:17.120 --> 40:19.760]  when you can say they brought this country down I want to read the other
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.720]  little quote I came up with and put out intercourse in Mexico leads to the
[40:25.720 --> 40:31.520]  birth of a new American citizen intercourse the United States leads to
[40:31.520 --> 40:41.680]  another abortion the state is God we're told our children born in this country
[40:41.680 --> 40:48.480]  or trash yuppies are told a middle class are told kill that baby I mean you
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.280]  think about what I mean the globalist hate this country I mean we we are being
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.440]  destroyed right now and guess what they get away with this sky's the limit I
[40:58.440 --> 41:02.240]  keep saying it notice each each level gets ten times worse and then it's gonna
[41:02.240 --> 41:05.560]  get ten times worse and ten times worse and Obama they're gonna stage some
[41:05.560 --> 41:08.560]  mass shooting in a school guaranteed and they're gonna announce I'm sorry I'm
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.760]  signing an executive order effective immediately all semi-autos will be
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.800]  turned in within one month your local Homeland Security Center those not
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.080]  complying will be arrested and they're gonna send armored vehicles out folks
[41:20.080 --> 41:26.600]  and the Civil War is going to explode like a fiery mushroom cloud and then
[41:26.600 --> 41:32.240]  they're gonna blame the people that don't turn their guns in the 1776ers for
[41:32.240 --> 41:35.960]  the Civil War these criminals have started and then they're gonna use the
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.560]  illegal alien hordes fully as Mexico collapses in a global depression to just
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.360]  wash in by the tens of millions and they've openly announced they're gonna
[41:45.360 --> 41:48.840]  start arming them as the new national security force that'll be just as big
[41:48.840 --> 41:52.560]  and just as strong as our military close quote fact Obama said just again
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.200]  yesterday these new children will be our dreamers for our military and they're
[41:58.200 --> 42:04.480]  just taking them right in you're the new military I mean I this is so
[42:04.480 --> 42:14.360]  incredible Obama our future rest on the success of dream kids I mean ladies and
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.720]  gentlemen if I went to Mexico with my wife and said I'm here she's not much
[42:17.720 --> 42:23.440]  pregnant she just broke her water pay for it they would literally laugh at you
[42:23.440 --> 42:29.040]  anyone else would in the world not us folks we are the biggest chumps that
[42:29.040 --> 42:32.640]  will put up with anything Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you
[42:32.640 --> 42:39.920]  will be under is the level you put up with there is no limit there is no
[42:39.920 --> 42:44.920]  limit when you get evil people in charge because when you don't restrain evil the
[42:44.920 --> 42:50.000]  very worst evil will take over in a survival of the fittest social Darwin
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.520]  system they will take over you will get the most vicious the worst king rat will
[42:55.520 --> 43:03.440]  rule they will gut everything because it's what they do exactly the kind of
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.320]  people we would want in this country they work hard they love their country
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.720]  they want to be school teachers they want to serve in the military they want
[43:10.720 --> 43:16.360]  to run businesses they have innovative ideas they are the best that we have and
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.040]  the president's frustration with the fact that he couldn't get Congress to act
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.920]  on the dream act just got to the point where he said I'm gonna have to do what
[43:24.920 --> 43:29.080]  I can do now it's not a solution it's a stopgap measure they're not on a path to
[43:29.080 --> 43:33.880]  citizenship they can stay here every two years they have to reapply so it's not
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.320]  the solution but you cannot look into the hearts of these young people and say
[43:38.320 --> 43:40.960]  there's nothing we can do when we actually did have the power to do
[43:40.960 --> 43:48.240]  something and that's who's running the federal government right there Valerie

[47:45.040 --> 47:48.360]  bad for him I mean there's a right way and a wrong way to go through the
[47:48.360 --> 47:52.120]  immigration process and this is not the right way you know like you said earlier
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.680]  any other country we go to we would be kicked out immediately you know once our
[47:55.680 --> 47:58.680]  visas ran out we would be kicked out immediately and yet we're just bringing
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.240]  all these guys and we're spending two billion dollars to feed them to shelter
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.640]  them they've got soccer goals out there and balls they've got H.E.B. trucks and if
[48:08.640 --> 48:12.520]  you're not from Texas H.E.B. is a grocery store and they had these huge
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.120]  refrigerated vans out there in a compound center with satellite dish on top you

[48:22.880 --> 48:27.080]  don't have anywhere to go you know this money is not allotted to help these
[48:27.080 --> 48:30.120]  homeless veterans out if these kids can stay there why can't they bring these
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.760]  homeless vets in and let them stay there give them a cot you know senator Jim
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.280]  Einhoff the ranking member of the Senate House committee thinks that this will
[48:38.280 --> 48:41.400]  only encourage more illegal immigrants to flood into the country and threaten our
[48:41.400 --> 48:46.840]  national security well I mean it's like feeding pigeons in your backyard you're

[49:09.640 --> 49:15.080]  on the border patrol by fiat this is a false flag by the globalist to fully
[49:15.080 --> 49:18.560]  gut the border and that's what the border patrol union ed is saying this is on
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.240]  purpose to implode the border so now we got Tony Benegas he's the consul of
[49:23.240 --> 49:26.440]  Honduras in Arizona and he said that the kids aren't happy with the burritos

[54:47.480 --> 54:53.440]  that run the major sex operations they're involved in hardcore crime
[54:53.440 --> 55:00.120]  globally it's the big mega banks and if they got us to sign on to 1.5
[55:00.120 --> 55:05.040]  quadrillion of their debt why shouldn't they overrun us with illegal aliens
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.520]  that will vote to take our guns and give them driver's license in 10 different
[55:08.520 --> 55:16.360]  states I mean why shouldn't they Americans are chumps that will put up
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.080]  with anything a large portion of them those of us that are awake and going man
[55:20.080 --> 55:24.200]  this is crazy we're actually pretty pathetic for putting up with it and
[55:24.200 --> 55:28.920]  not doing more I myself included we're jellyfish compared to our ancestors but
[55:28.920 --> 55:35.640]  we are the terrorists we are the enemy homeland securities for us I just can't
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.080]  believe how far we've fallen that they won't let any media on these bases so we
[55:41.080 --> 55:44.840]  had to go on even though the PAO refused to talk to us we were still able to get
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.400]  on the base and great job staff sergeant Joe Biggs everybody else if you go to
[55:49.400 --> 55:53.960]  the article up on info wars calm immigration shelter photos we've added
[55:53.960 --> 56:00.600]  more video still shots if you're a radio listener and you can see through the
[56:00.600 --> 56:06.440]  cracks in the fence you know the kids the catering all the miners it looks like a
[56:06.440 --> 56:14.400]  big you know camp or something looks like they've set up a summer camp and no
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.040]  expenses being paid they're saying 250 plus dollars a day per child when
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.200]  there's Americans out there living on $25 a day a lot of them and again they
[56:26.200 --> 56:31.040]  suck as they care about the illegals folks they want to bankrupt everything
[56:31.040 --> 56:39.240]  these are precious voters and staff sergeant Biggs we have some photos of
[56:39.240 --> 56:44.280]  homeless vets I've run into homeless vets in Austin who were not drunks who
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.080]  were in great shape but you can talk to them obviously they've got some PTSD or
[56:49.080 --> 56:51.680]  something you talk to them a lot they go yeah I was in a lot of heavy you know
[56:51.680 --> 56:55.920]  combat son such nobody will hire me and I can't seem to get credit but I'm
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.240]  working on it and and I run into a lot of them and it usually seems to be like
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.680]  heavy combat vets or they've had a slight brain injury or whatever and then
[57:04.680 --> 57:08.280]  now they've been listed by the Pentagon is having a problem so no one will hire
[57:08.280 --> 57:13.040]  them and I just see them all over the place nobody's given them a free place
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.320]  to stay bro it's ridiculous I mean these guys are we're hard-working they
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.720]  they serve their country they were promised benefits they're not getting
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.400]  them you know they they're laying out there on the streets but we're sheltering
[57:25.400 --> 57:29.480]  these kids it just blows my mind you know a government that fell to secure its
[57:29.480 --> 57:33.200]  borders is guilty of their election of duty a government that fails to take
[57:33.200 --> 57:36.760]  care of its men and women on the front lines is guilty of malpractice a
[57:36.760 --> 57:40.960]  government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above US veterans for
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.880]  political gains should be persecuted for criminal or prosecuted for criminal
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.880]  neglect bordering on treason I just think that is said that there was an
[57:49.880 --> 57:56.200]  article that I got from on townhole.com townhome townhome.com about US
[57:56.200 --> 58:00.200]  veterans that were homeless but beyond that it's it doesn't border on treason
[58:00.200 --> 58:05.440]  this is the when you lower your borders to foreign groups and pay them to come
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.920]  in to politically overthrow your enemies that's called an invasion this is
[58:09.920 --> 58:13.720]  classical warfare. I mean right now we have troops from other countries in
[58:13.720 --> 58:18.520]  Canada and in Mexico where this hand right here America is in the middle and
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.160]  we've got troops Russian troops in Canada and Chinese in the bottom and
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.240]  there's closing in you know we're letting our borders open right now.
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.120]  Now this is the takedown of America and they admit the illegals are being
[58:30.120 --> 58:33.360]  allowed to do this to implode the border well that's what the border patrol
[58:33.360 --> 58:36.880]  agents have been saying there's all sorts of al-qaeda you name it just pouring
[58:36.880 --> 58:46.880]  across the border we'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[59:51.240 --> 01:00:01.760]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:13.600]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.880]  Jones. You know we should add to this is Lackland Air Force Base that has at least
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.200]  two thousand illegal alien children from Latin America there and New York Times
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.560]  admits they're moving them all over the country to cover it up even the New York
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.600]  Times admits that and it's all because they do catch and release I mean of
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.000]  course everybody's gonna pour in when if you get here now you're legal and you
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.320]  get welfare immediately you can sit on your butt for the rest of your life as
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.520]  long as you vote to take my guns. Yeah one of the things I noticed when we got
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.440]  to Lackland Air Force Base was the heightened security you know usually
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.960]  well for the Air Force they have what's called security forces versus MPs but
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.880]  these guys were strapping M4s over the chest you know that's usually we've got
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.800]  like a nine or something like that a barrette on the side these guys heightened security
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.960]  M4s around the chest ready to go you know coming through I thought that was
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.680]  kind of odd. Is that because they were guarding gods? Yeah they're guarding
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.880]  America's new dreamers apparently. Other observations? Well we took a
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.080]  little bit to find it we stopped and talked to a few airmen some contract
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.160]  workers and found our way over there to the area and as we pulled in it's
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.840]  actually right on the edge of one of the the gate should go through and on the
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.040]  other side there was a hotel we actually went up on that hotel and got some
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.160]  that inside footage in looking in but they have these fences up all around it
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.080]  they've got contracted people there taking out trash they're buying really
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.880]  nice water too it was a nice brand of water not a cheap you know 50 cent
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.120]  bottles it's probably more of you know your $3 bottle water. But the military
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.360]  sat there for four days under orders at Katrina and didn't give water to people
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.480]  they were ordered to not give it out that came out in the news but the
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.720]  illegals they get everything. Oh they get everything I mean they're probably
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.800]  eating lobster tails right now you know I mean they were out there singing
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.440]  songs playing soccer I mean having a better time that I have I mean it's
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.960]  just it's a misappropriation of funds we're spending all this money and it
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.560]  shouldn't be going to them I mean we've got people we've got problems right here
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.640]  in America we can't even fix and we're dumping all this money into that. Well
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:32.600]  these are the future voters. I just don't get it we got 529,000. Do you imagine
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.320]  Mexico saying get here Americans and you're legal and we'll pay for everything?
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:43.520]  I can't imagine that at all. You know right now we got 529,000 to 840,000
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.120]  veterans homeless right now on a given day without a place to stay without
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.960]  anything at all and no one does anything for them nothing at all. Homeland
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.160]  Security says veterans are the number one terror threat they're the enemy you
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.760]  don't give the enemy any help. Yeah it's I just don't know what our government's
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.000]  coming to nowadays it's you know like I said when I when I joined I joined with
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.640]  a pure thought that I was gonna be serving my country you know and that I
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.040]  was gonna get my college paid for and have these benefits when I got out you
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.160]  know then you get out and you realize it's just a big scam you know we're
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.400]  dumping all this money and it looks like a FEMA camp proving ground. Well that's
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.320]  the angle nobody's looked at yet they had a plan to legitimize FEMA camps and
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.400]  they said we'll use a wave of immigrants from Latin America as the
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.800]  pretext to roll out these bases and then during an economic collapse they'll
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.320]  already be there and the ideal will be sold. So see how we're kind of saying
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.400]  hey our vets need help like this that's actually kind of the plan. Oh you will
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.680]  get the help now. I mean Fort AP Hills got that you know military base it's
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.520]  trained to fight people here and then you got these camps I mean it's all
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.200]  coming together full circle. I've got the article here in my stack let me see if
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.560]  I can find it with the New York Times admits today that they're flying the
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.880]  illegals in all over the country. Here's Joe Biden US needs consistent
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:12.160]  unrelenting stream of immigrants. Yeah but not ones with leprosy or that have no
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.600]  job or bankrupt. Homeland Security Chief J Johnson admits for need for border
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  reform which means more open borders. Border sheriff lichens influx of
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.200]  illegal immigrants to Hurricane Katrina and then here in one of my articles I'm
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.480]  gonna find it in just a second. They literally has the New York Times
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.720]  admitting there's a cover-up of how many are here and where they're going and
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.520]  that the media is not allowed to go into it and meanwhile I have this article
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.960]  out of Reuters and also RT's reporting it. Obama sites Australian gun
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.720]  confiscation program is example for US. I mean that that should be hard attack
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.280]  level announcement. He's saying I may use an executive order outside of law. He's
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.840]  already doing this with the illegals. We're gonna have more on the nightly news
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.280]  tonight. More of the HD footage up on info wars.com. Good job. A chemical spill
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.160]  contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties. This year alone
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.080]  over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate. What
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.000]  are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water? It's force
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  medical treatment without the consent of residents. My friends water filtration
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.360]  is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.800]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water. On average the
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.240]  county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week. Few filters cut out
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.400]  the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides,
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.600]  herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.960]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste. It is our
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.560]  responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not gonna do it.

[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.040]  the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.720]  every day. But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.320]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.000]  even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.760]  chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.600]  United States. Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.280]  numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.960]  with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.560]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.160]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.840]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the

[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:09.480]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:20.200]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with the lies and disinformation. Dan Bon
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:26.520]  Gino, who I would call a true patriot Tea Party-type candidate not running from
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:35.760]  that label, is just absolutely you know 99 to 1 against his opponent and is you
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.880]  know barring any plane crashes or whatever and believe me Obama doesn't
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.800]  like him so that's a serious issue. Dan Bon Gino's probably ended up being in
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.800]  Congress and it's because he doesn't run from liberty and he doesn't sit there
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.000]  and mention words that he's so popular and of course he was the top Secret
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.080]  Service agent on the foreign details and was a rising star in the whole
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:00.840]  operation but had to resign because he could not be part. He's told the story
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.520]  many times so I'm just recapping it. He can put it in his own words if he wants
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.080]  to. He would not compromise and he said he was hearing things and seeing things
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.960]  working for Obama that were so immoral and so bad and so anti-American that he
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.800]  couldn't sleep at night. Since he left a few years ago he's been broken into his
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.160]  office, you name it, his car has been messed with, he's been harassed, he's been
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.720]  threatened. They might arrest him like Dinesha Susan. They might arrest him like
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.480]  the governor, you know former governor of Virginia. I mean folks this isn't a game
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:36.240]  okay you got a crooked toenail they're gonna arrest you and I'm not going off
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.640]  at that angle here you know to try to be melodramatic. This is happening ladies
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.640]  and gentlemen and I'm not gonna get into the stuff that goes on around here but
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.720]  I mean it's Creepville okay. Fed's going and talking to people that know me, family
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.080]  you name it, trying to intimidate them, trying to freak them out. Obama is doing
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.520]  things that have never been done. I mean it makes Nixon who did you know had a
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.920]  list of a hundred people just a list of their income tax and he had to step down
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.080]  finally because of that. We're talking about auditing and harassing the Tea
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.320]  Party, pro-life groups. I mean this is a criminal takeover and we've got Dan
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.200]  Bongino to the bottom of the hour running for Congress and he needs more
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.200]  support because the electronic voting machines you name it. I've talked to all
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.960]  the electronic voting machine experts like Bev Harris and others who's got the
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.760]  HBO special Hacking Democracy and she said it's landslides that the vote fraud
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.960]  people can't beat. So Bongino should win with 90% because the backlash is so big
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.840]  he'll probably win with 60% so we've got to have like 50 points on the board just
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.080]  to win the football game. We've got to have 50 extra points because they're
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.680]  going to cheat so much. You understand? It's an uphill battle but we can win it.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.480]  Sometimes it's easier to win an uphill battle than a downhill battle. That's
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.760]  what makes us stronger as Nietzsche said. So I wanted to cover the waterfront with
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.240]  him and as a former federal law enforcement officer what does he make
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.240]  of telling illegals we're going to release you even aggravated felons,
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.960]  child rapist, bank robbers you name it, sixty-something thousand the last two
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.320]  months, cutting almost all the deportations, red carpeting to hundreds of
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.720]  thousands of illegal kids, thousands per military base, the border has imploded,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.880]  the head of the board patrol union came out again today, soninfolwars.com and
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.600]  said this is designed to implode the border. Well of course it does. It is in
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.680]  a humanitarian crisis, it is a takeover and I want to see what Dan Bongino with
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.920]  his highly informed former New York cop as well for becoming a secret service
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.000]  agent what he sees from his perspective of what this is because
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.520]  saying our military's under NATO funding al-Qaeda attacks Syria now they're
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.840]  taking over Iraq with the weapons that's on record. Fast and furious not
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.640]  getting in trouble for that. I mean I'm living in a twilight zone here what is
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:59.680]  happening Dan? Yeah Alex it's not as I said in a previous interview I had done
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.000]  it is I think it's worse than people really know now your audience is pretty
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.600]  informed I you know I knock on a lot of doors and especially out in Western
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.480]  Maryland you have a big support base out there a lot of folks don't me out from
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.800]  your show out there but you know not many are there are a lot of other
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.720]  folks out there that really don't understand the level of Wallace that's
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.000]  going on it is absolutely unprecedented. I mean we have liberal Jonathan
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.720]  Curley a liberal professor absolutely supports liberal priorities and
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.280]  legislation saying you know this is the president that Nixon always wanted to be
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.720]  you know it's like there's so many leaks in the house you're running out of
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.440]  fingers to plug the leaks with and no one knows where to start it's so bad
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.720]  Alex that the two liberal senators here in in democratic very blue Maryland very
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.160]  liberal centers McColski and Cardin they just had a statement one of my
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.120]  ideas Cardin put out where the citizens of Baltimore City pretty liberal city by
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.840]  anyone standard came out and said no we can't take these the illegals here
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.800]  they're trying to put them up in an empty building in Baltimore City and
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.720]  they're saying we can't even take care of our own city this isn't some kind of a
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.800]  hotel over here folks we have to clean up our own neighborhoods first take care
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.680]  of our own problems I mean that's how out of control is they're even losing not
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.080]  just Democrats they're even losing liberals I mean if that doesn't speak to
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.720]  a level of unprecedented intentional legislative chaos then I don't know what
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.200]  else thought though we're in a dangerous time and you're right I'm glad you said
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.080]  that this isn't melodram because people are don't be melodramatic no no be
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.200]  melodramatic folks I'm telling you I saw a lot of this stuff on the inside the
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.520]  wheeling is dealing and both of these parties selling you know one party
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.560]  selling you out the big business the other one selling you out the big
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.280]  government you know who it's like a horse train you know who can who's gonna
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.440]  cut us the bigger check when we vote this way I mean it is really time to get
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.080]  out there at the at these voting booths and vote for Liberty candidates who walk
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.640]  the walk and everybody talks to talk but we actually get out there walk the
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.560]  walk what does it say though to the establishment that everyone's running
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.600]  away from Obama but at the same time he's doing everything he wants acting as
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.840]  a dictator as many constitutional lawyers have said I'm not saying again
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.240]  he's gonna stay in office and that he will be a de facto dictator forever I'm
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.800]  saying the bureaucracy the Democratic Party is acting in a dictatorial lawless
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.520]  way whether it's I mean they admit it violated dozens of federal laws to just
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.280]  release prisoners without the 30-day hearings with Congress I mean they're
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:38.120]  just doing whatever they want on every front and the precedents being said what
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.200]  do you think the battle plan is with Obama because I've got to say this he's
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.640]  much worse than I thought it would be and for the first time in my life Mr.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.720]  Bongino I'm beyond scared I am more shell shocked right now that this is so
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.320]  over-the-top I mean I guess it's like finding out your neighbors got 30 dead
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:02.200]  bodies in their backyard it's just it's a normal person I don't think I know why
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.080]  the public doesn't know what to do because I don't know what to do it's
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.600]  faced with this level of just foaming at the mouth criminality what do you think
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.840]  we should do and what are they thinking as they as there's a total resistance
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.240]  forming against them well listen if I had a battle plan you're right a lot of
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.880]  people don't know what to do and it's no fault that it was just so much you're
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.720]  being hit on 30 different fronts you know to steal lines from the left they're
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.080]  30 front war and they do this intentionally you know the clowered
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.560]  pivot model just overload the system here's what you do number one we have
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.360]  to build public pressure I say that a lot because I get to the question all the
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.200]  time you know do you support Obama's impeachment I tell people frankly no you
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.600]  haven't won the public case don't you and people say what do you think he hasn't
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.720]  broken laws no that's not what I'm saying what I'm trying to tell you folks we
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:56.320]  have not built the public case yet you were talking about a process a legal
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.440]  process it's like an indictment that's what impeachment is it's like an indictment
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.280]  for the president you then have to try the case you don't indict a case you're
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.080]  not going to win you don't we haven't built the public pressure that's number
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.080]  one how do we do that so here's the battle plan we have got to find more
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.440]  whistleblowers we have to find people on the inside like me willing to speak out
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.840]  and say hey folks this is not right and right now what I don't understand Alex
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:28.040]  is where are the people in the DOJ or the FBI agents within the DOJ
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.240]  administrative staff coming out and saying hey this IRS thing we were
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.440]  sending you know they were sending confidential voter excuse me donor
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.000]  information to the DOJ where's the person saying hey I was the one who had
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.440]  sent this isn't right we got to change it where are the IRS agents speaking out
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.840]  saying hey I you know we might when I swore my oath Alex it was to the Constitution
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.040]  not to anything else you know where are these folks you know and the third part
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.240]  of this process so a public pressure you know getting people on the inside to
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.280]  speak out but the third part is we have to build an electoral presence to it's
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.400]  not just good enough anymore to vote for Republicans frankly it's useful it's
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.720]  almost destroying the cause because we get these squishes in there they don't
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.880]  do anything and then they tarnish the brand to make it even worse it's time
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.640]  to start voting for Liberty oriented candidates who you hold to account don't
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.040]  put it there don't make a golden calf out of anyone we hold to account but you
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.480]  can at least trust that they can talk to talk and walk the walk you know when
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.920]  they get out there and they shake your hand they can look you in the eye and
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.700]  you believe these people they understand what's going on with the Fed they
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.840]  understand you know cloward pivot they understand what's going on with why the
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.560]  Constitution was written as a document of negative powers by the government what
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.040]  they can't do to you you know that's the kind of folks we get through that three
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.360]  step process eventually will have something to do but but you know you
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.120]  can't just say oh we got impeached the president okay you're gonna lose just like
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.640]  you did with Clinton and then you know what happens you make them more powerful
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.600]  I mean we have to do we have to have an actual tactical battle plan going forward
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.240]  and just throwing out stuff like that without an actual plan to implement it
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:03.560]  is just sure sure I agree with you and you're actually technically right as
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.360]  you know the house indicts the president the Senate and rising and so you've got
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.000]  to actually go after him with more than just a intern they wanted to go after him
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.200]  on the intern because it was isolated to just lying to a grand jury it was
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.600]  isolated to only one issue that protected the political class the truth is
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.200]  if the Republican leadership wanted to go after him for Cylindra or wanted to
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.880]  go after him for Benghazi or Fast and Furious or any of it they could prove
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.840]  it and bring them down but there's not there's not the moral will because it's
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.040]  a bunch of establishment rhinos but as they get replaced as we're about to see
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:48.360]  in this midterm election as we just saw this amazing primary win by David Bratt
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:54.040]  yeah I'd like you to speak to that because bottom line the Democrats are
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:59.960]  going for the full takeover right now what a what's your take on Bratt be and
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.560]  Republicans winning primaries all over the place as well what do you think the
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.360]  establishment's going to do to try to counter that oh let me tell you something
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.080]  Bratt was a wake-up call not just for for our side the grassroots Liberty
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.760]  Lovers out there but you don't think they're going to take this lying down
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.560]  this is like a UFC match where you think you're going to kick the guys butt all
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.680]  the sudden he he wallops you in the face and you're like oh boy isn't going to be
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.600]  as easy a fight as I thought the establishment I'm listening I'm in DC
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.560]  all the time meeting with grassroots warriors over there doing that doing
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.960]  that doing God's work they know for a fact that the establishment is now
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.200]  re-arming again they're not going to be let me give you a quote from one of
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.000]  they're not going to be surprised again so they are understanding that the
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.400]  people knocking on the doors and waving the signs are not with them so they're
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.120]  going to go out they're going to try and do what they always do they're going to
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.800]  try to buy elections they're going to try and put people like me down they're
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:59.000]  going to try and put Chris McDaniel down you know it's a junk car in Tennessee
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.520]  they're going to try and put folks down they're going to try to suppress them
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.360]  because that's what they do that's all they can do Alex they lost the people a
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.640]  long time ago you know there's there's an insurrection going on in the
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.640]  Republican Party right now and it's just hysterical to how like the left you
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.160]  know they just go along with their candidate randomly I can put a D in
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.440]  front of their name and oh it's all good they matter what they stand for and
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.560]  the and the media isn't such a tizzy because they can't believe the fact
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.440]  that there are liberty-loving folks out there that actually care about liberty
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.160]  they're like what do you mean they didn't elect Eric Cantor that's a
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.480]  surprise he was their leader I am my leader I'm not what he's I don't
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.480]  subscribe to what he I don't worship golden calf okay he did not stand up for
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.440]  the people he's not out there shaking the hand he was not standing for the cause
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.320]  of liberty and people didn't get behind them I don't know why the media is so
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.520]  surprised I think they're surprised because they don't have the values we do
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.960]  and they don't understand that liberty actually matters because they believe in
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.240]  a redistributionist state run by the bureaucratic elite who sit there with
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.880]  their bow ties and tell us all what to do why we all go broke and they enrich
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.360]  themselves at our expense well but not no more those days are over I'm not
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.000]  subscribing to that one more day well that brings me to my next point we saw
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.840]  the tragic two police officers and a citizen killed and if you believe the
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.480]  official story because who knows with the establishment these days you got a guy
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.000]  with crazy Joker videos it was completely mentally ill into death cults with
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.600]  his girlfriend just like you've got these other kids stabbing you know little
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.120]  girls to death because you know there's another comic book character they like
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.520]  and they're trying to blame Ronald Reagan and Rand Paul and me and saying
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.560]  we're responsible when all I ever say is we don't want a violent revolution we
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:43.000]  want a peaceful restoration and I'm really concerned that Obama came out it
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.320]  was on CBS two days ago but here's the headline Obama cites Australia's gun
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:55.720]  confiscation program as example for us and now now now if they actually try to
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:02.040]  have an executive order on some type of gun confiscation say of semi-autos and
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:05.280]  if they try to send out armored vehicles like they're doing in California to
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:12.480]  confiscate guns I mean this is a powder keg and I think if I was Obama and I
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.960]  wanted to take over I would try to stir up the libertarian constitutional
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.920]  movement and try to push people into a corner and we see these headlines about
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.720]  veterans are the number one terror threat with no evidence of that no crime
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.360]  statistics to show that well what I'm getting at is it looks like they're
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.520]  trying to start some kind of civil war well remember the only way to get you in
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.920]  America which is generally a country of good people generally I mean we've been
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.520]  the most philanthropic country in the history of earth you know to really hate
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.880]  their neighbor and to vote against us to demonize them and put them in the box
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.680]  it's union non-union black white Hispanic immigrant man woman moron women
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.520]  that's what the left does remember the Republican Party generally at least a
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.680]  good one that it they don't do that they run on let's cut your taxes let's defeat
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.120]  Obamacare that kind of stuff the left doesn't do that the left runs on this
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:08.040]  agenda of this guy's not you therefore you should not like him vote for me I'll
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:12.200]  keep the not you away they vote on class warfare they vote on division they vote
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.240]  on racial stripes they are not liberals I mean I've got to say it I mean the
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.520]  Democratic Party is a pack of mentally ill criminals now I'm not talking about
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.040]  their their their grassroots people a lot of them mean well but I've got to say
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.600]  when you look at MSNBC and these people they know exactly what they're doing
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.360]  yeah I'm glad you said because I knock on a lot of doors out there and I knock
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.040]  on Democrats with high voter scores people show up and a lot believe me a
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.800]  lot of them are frustrated to the Democrats because their parents are I
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.040]  mean my mother's a Democrat and she I'll never vote Democrat again she was a
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.880]  JFK Democrat you know those days are over but you know you brought up an
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.240]  interesting point too about them you know pinpointing people like yourself and
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.560]  other talk radio is all look what you guys did but keep a mind out they
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:58.160]  give it this is the hypocritical fraud these people in the media are they
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.840]  never mentioned Floyd Corkin you know Floyd Corkin who who uh who shot up the
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.320]  Family Research Council and and he said he did it because of the Southern
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.440]  Poverty Law Center exactly I mean it clear as if the Southern Poverty Law
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.760]  the biggest leftist crooks you've ever seen who if you say anything about any
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.760]  that if you are pro-life of you're a hate group according to these nuts this
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.840]  guy said I read about the Family Research Council misdanced on on gay
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.160]  marriage and I didn't like so he basically shot the place up the media
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.280]  almost completely ignores the story and yet you get these two psychopaths in
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.480]  Nevada who apparently were even kicked off that ranch we were too nutty for the
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.520]  ranch out there too and all of a sudden every conservative who's ever
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.840]  preached liberty and low taxes is somehow related I mean think about the
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.240]  the utter stupidity of that but that's the media and I'll tell you what it's
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.040]  gonna I just ignore it I I know it's hard because you they don't like you
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.720]  because you do something that that scares them and that command attention they
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.520]  don't want that to the media wants to monopolize the megaphone and you got
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.880]  this guy coming up behind them say wait I can do that too and they don't like
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.840]  that so they have to say oh be careful they're dangerous don't look at these
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.600]  guys but they don't admit their own role with Corkin you know Jared Lee
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.880]  Loeffner you know even going back to Oswald Oswald was a leftist well I mean
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.520]  Dan they're even trying now in the news like I'm looking for the article right
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:30.480]  here to basically say that David Bratt is weird because he says Hitler could
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.720]  happen again well I mean of course tyranny can happen again it happens
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.240]  most the time so so I mean again it's like Obama saying and and Biden and all
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.720]  these speeches and Kerry come back to government believe in it again like it's
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.840]  a religion trust it it's the answer don't listen to people that warn about
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.840]  tyranny well that's what America is all about yeah no they'll pick Brad apart
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.760]  anything he said because they are so desperate to make this story go away
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.240]  because what bothers them Alice more than anything more than anything we've
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.360]  spoken about in this phone call is a grassroots insurrection against big
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.800]  government Republicans and Democrats that drives them nuts because they the
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.920]  fact is and you know this as well as I do there's some people in a Republican
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.800]  party their friends the big government Democrats oh yeah they all fell out to
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.360]  the John Boehner yeah these people are not leaders they just they just fell
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.000]  out to a different golden cap they knew before either way you've sold out
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.560]  they're not bedrocked in real values the fact that a grassroots rebellion in
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.120]  Virginia 7 could unseat the second most powerful man in Congress think about
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.520]  that with no money nothing peanuts a tip in a restaurant in donation terms of
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:50.800]  fundraising that they could unseat him by double digits these guys are running in
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:55.560]  fear they will do anything anything to discredit Brad you're gonna see these
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.000]  stories every day you know Brad pulled a girl's hair once in eighth grade you're
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.400]  gonna see it every day just remember the Democrats with Rand Paul when he won
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.320]  the primary they went out and dressed up as hayseeds and said racist things on
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.600]  TV and it turned out they actually work for the Democratic Party oh it's all
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.240]  that I mean that's all they have though they don't have anything you know what
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.120]  bothers him most about Brad he gets up there and he actually understands how
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.280]  that you know the biggest form of taxation this country's ever seen as
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.120]  the Fed he goes up there and explains hey folks if you have a dollar and I tax
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.640]  you 25 cents I've taken 25 cents you have 75 cents left but if I go out there
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.640]  and I give you a dollar right and I tax away the value of it be inflation and
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.440]  you only get it's only worth 10 cents I've taxed you 90 cents whether you know
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.080]  what or not and he explains this in common sense economic terms the left is
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.680]  like wait wait wait we can't have that information out there folks information
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.560]  is dangerous unless we can lie to people about it well Dan I gotta say it I
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.320]  mean you're super articulate you're a smart guy your books already a best
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.760]  seller I mean you you would be perfect in Congress and I don't want to have to
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.640]  knock on wood here but I mean you were telling me during the break when first
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.720]  got you on it things are going really well but they can pull a lot of tricks
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.600]  people need to get behind you in Maryland they need to get behind every
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.160]  other true liberty-based candidate and people could just hear what you're
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.840]  speaking you're a whistleblower you exposed Obama how you've gone through a
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.520]  lot of harassment people need to pray for you and your family have you gotten
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.720]  any more harassment yeah it's always you know one of our security cameras
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.400]  next to it's always something yeah it's always there and I just roll with it you
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.000]  know we all have to make sacrifices that yeah I'm a believer in the second
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.080]  creation and you pay your dues here so I'm not worried about it to fight the
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.920]  fight people of us no one's as powerful as you know George the third right so
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.200]  I'm not that worried about it you know it's funny that I go through some
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.160]  harassment as well and you'd like I don't know what is you don't like to talk
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.840]  about it it's just kind of like yeah it's going on it's like you don't even
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.560]  want to give it attention that they're doing it but it's important to show what
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.240]  scum these people are you know what it is and I don't want because I think it
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.080]  incentivizes more of it and I have two daughters but secondly you know I'm six

[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:08.480]  You know, I tend to get almost hysterical on air. And it's because I'm sitting here
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:13.440]  looking at what's happening. And it's not even my own analysis. The globalist admit
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.760]  what they're doing. They've done it in other countries before, but never as spectacular
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:24.880]  as they're doing it here. They are telling illegal aliens to come here and they can
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.000]  just stay in me given free welfare. And the border is just collapsing and border
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.240]  patroller on record saying they're collapsing it. They're not letting the
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:43.520]  media in. Obama is saying on CBS News quote Obama sites Australia's gun
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.800]  confiscation program as example for us says he's preparing to act with
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.640]  executive order. I mean, that is ominous off the chart. I was talking about
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.520]  getting Larry Pratt back on this Sunday because I'm always getting Larry Pratt
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.840]  on it seems on Sunday. Maybe we should just get him on tomorrow because that
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.000]  can't wait. The head of gun owners of America. I mean, this is just making me
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:11.080]  sick at my stomach. I don't want to have to leave the US. I don't want to be in
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.480]  the middle of a civil war. I mean, are we really going to let him destroy our
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:24.240]  prosperity? Raise tax the point everybody goes bankrupt. I mean, really kill the
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:30.760]  country? Really? Really? Total NSA spying on the Liberty Movement.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:36.760]  Criminals run free. Big banks launder the drug money. The brainwashing of our
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.280]  children everywhere. Social engineering. A giant political class out of control.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.760]  Paramilitary police everywhere. Pointed at the general public working for the
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:55.200]  criminal class and remember police and military. You are the ones that are
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:03.320]  going to enforce for this scum. What a nightmare situation and I'm not being
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:09.400]  negative. I'm trying to protect what's good in this world by being honest about
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:18.600]  what's happening in it. And it's not just rhetoric. It's not just we have a lot
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:25.680]  of proof. It's now flagrantly obvious they're doing everything they can to
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:33.880]  destroy this country out of pure hatred of what America once stood for. Ideals.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:44.920]  Is that what Napolitano was talking about years ago? Ideals that were
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:54.280]  never fully realized but ideals that scare them. You can point all the
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:58.960]  problems of America. The issue is the ideals were revolutionary. The ideals
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.640]  were the renaissance. The ideals were human empowerment. The ideals are
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.880]  dangerous to tyrants who want to run things through gangs and thugster
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.600]  gangsterism not through the free market of having the better ideas. Being the
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.480]  more talented. Being the more interesting. And you've had a lot of
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.520]  corruptions in the world but that went on for a long time because they
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.880]  corrupt just wanted to run things but they wanted prosperity because that gave
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:32.120]  them a bigger system to be proud of. A bigger cash cow that they liked
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:39.640]  because it was their system. The globalists are the worst folks. They hate
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:47.600]  manly men on record. They hate feminine women. They hate beauty. They hate power.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:54.360]  They hate true honor. They hate people that are innately strong because they're
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.080]  a bunch of creepy globalists that got into power by being spiders folks and
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:05.600]  they don't like those of us that aren't scum. And they want to bring us down
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.360]  because they're scared of us and they should be because historically
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.600]  ancestrally it is the good guys that bring them down every time and they
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:20.560]  have a race memory to that. The criminal, the control freak and its genetic line
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:25.680]  that's in all racist colors and creeds has a memory. It has an instinct of how
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.720]  to beat us and it thinks that it can hide behind the complexity of the world,
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:40.280]  hide by the bigness of it and hide behind the vestigial prosperity that's
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:47.760]  left over from freedom. And also they hide behind acting weak and liberal and
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.000]  supine and they want to help you and let's be friendly or you should be
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.840]  guilty. You should prove you're nice. You should be altruistic. You should
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.560]  pay for the tens of millions of illegals and give them free everything or
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:15.960]  you're not a good host. They use our goodness against us and then you study
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:22.160]  the elite and the stuff they're into. It just runs from bad to worse and you
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.440]  realize they are just these incredibly evil people who are epically bad. You
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.400]  look at Bill Clinton, epically bad. Hillary Clinton, epically bad. You look at
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.840]  the stuff the Rothschilds are into, epically bad. You look at the Rockefellers,
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.440]  just to talk about a demonic energy to do bad and to screw up societies and do
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:46.320]  horrible things. They're involved in everything, everything. You look at George
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:52.560]  Soros in his life and he is epically bad. I mean, you actually marvel like John
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.960]  on the Isle of Patmos marveling at the Antichrist. You actually respect it and
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.840]  go, God, that's 80-something years of just from 14 years old on just wrecking and
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:09.640]  hurting and doing horrible things and just persecuting and overthrowing and
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:16.800]  just and being remorseless and proud of it. You imagine going on 60 minutes. You
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.200]  pull it up on YouTube. They're always expunging it, but folks are always
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.680]  re-uploading it. If somebody hasn't sent this to us, I couldn't find it again a
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.200]  month ago. He did a 60 minutes interview. I think I'm like 99 and he goes,
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.840]  yeah, I helped brown up Jews all over Romania and I'm not ashamed of it. I
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:40.640]  just do what I need to do. Yeah, big deal. Leslie Stahl interviewed him and the
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.080]  reason I mentioned that is this is a guy coming after me. His, his groups, he
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:48.880]  funds are calling for me to be arrested or investigated. And I mean, it's like,
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.960]  how weird is that? And I know I just keep bringing that up. It's just, it's so
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:02.880]  weird to have that sack of, oh man, I'll tell you, just it's over the top that he
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.480]  could operate in this country. That, that, that this slime ball isn't in the
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:14.680]  prison and he wants me destroyed. And you know what? He might win folks. America
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:31.000]  might be that pathetic. I just don't even know what to say anymore. I mean, what
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.920]  have we become? I should be positive that we see pro-liberty anti-fellow reserve
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.480]  Ron Paul types like David Bratt winning primaries when his competitors spent
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.200]  millions of millions and he spent 150,000. And you better believe the Justice
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.680]  Department is going over every donation. If they find a nickel that was
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:42:01.880]  improperly given, he'll go to prison. Even though he has no criminal record. They
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.120]  don't care if you're as clean as a whistle. Folks, they'll find something. And
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:11.080]  that's why we've now reached the point of anyone promoting liberty. If they
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.520]  haven't committed a crime against innocence, I don't care how much proof
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:25.960]  they've got. I'm done. This is a lawless group of scum. They are committing the
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:32.800]  crimes wholesale in front of everyone. And I'm sticking together with
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.520]  libertarians and paleo conservatives and constitutionalists because the
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:40.080]  Republican Party has been an evil, anathema of blue blood scum just as
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.320]  bad as a Democrats for decades. But under Obama and the Clintons, they're making
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.160]  their move to get rid of all checks and balances, all opposition. So I would
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:55.680]  support an inanimate fire hydrant against the Democrats as the choice.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:02.480]  A lot of people think that we're less safe today than we were a week ago
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.400]  because these five guys are out. These five guys are not a threat to the United
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.640]  States. The point is is that it was illegal what you did and that's admitted
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.240]  and so if you don't stop doing it or get in trouble, you're a dictator. That's
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.880]  the whole point. John, you popped my ear earlier and I kind of miss what you
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.000]  were saying. Yeah, I was just thinking back yesterday about how when I was just
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.040]  a listener, you were talking to, I believe it was Lindsey Williams about
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.080]  Napolitano who had told her friend to prepare the next three years for a
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.760]  gigantic natural disaster. Well, I think we're here. I think this is it. And that
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:42.400]  was in Arizona and she said it'll hit Arizona and none of us knew what it meant
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.680]  and the natural disaster is the inflow inviting Latin America up and then going
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.720]  we've got to be sweet. It could be millions, not hundreds of thousands and
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:58.760]  then the public so dumbed down, they'll probably blame Rand Paul or me for the
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:05.000]  15 million X3 Legals. Yeah. You know, I was thinking we've got to go get the
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.520]  Oliver North clips from the Rex 84 Iran Contra hearings because if you read the
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:17.360]  Miami Herald about Rex 84 at the time in 86 when they had those hearings 87, it
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.160]  says they would use an immigrant inflow emergency to bring in martial law and I
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:29.280]  never understood how they would do that. And now I think Obama has pulled Rex 84
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.520]  off the shelf. Of course, we've said a thousand times here. No exaggeration that
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.000]  they would use the illegals to prime the pump of the FEMA camps first mentioning
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.880]  Rex 84. But no, I think you're right. I think we're now seeing it. Let's pull up
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.520]  with the Napolitano article outgoing DHS Secretary Janet Apolitano warns of
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:56.760]  serious cyber attack, unprecedented natural disaster. And it was Lindsey
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:04.360]  Williams, two years before she said that, said that she met with a Congresswoman.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.800]  And I guess I've kind of given it away now. I was saying the state. I can't keep
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.360]  track. All the same. Right. And they had lunch. Yeah, they had lunch. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:19.320]  And she said prepare. Man, I'm just so sick of these people. And again, all I
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:24.280]  want is to have a free country, due process checks and balances, right to be
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.200]  a father, right to have my basic rights, right to private property, right to
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:38.680]  Second Amendment. And I've got you've got that all the veterans have got. I mean,
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.920]  let's talk about who they're targeting. Returning veterans, the number one
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:50.040]  enemy public. And they're not running that movies and sitcoms and dramas along
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:55.440]  with actual news for nothing. They're planning to come after you. And then
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:06.280]  they mentioned libertarians, constitutionalist Christians. And they
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:12.360]  don't mean establishment mega church, Glitterbug, Pharisee, cult Christians.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.720]  They mean real Christians who aren't going to put chips in their kids. And by
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.240]  the way, that's all being announced. Like it's no big deal now. That's not
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.600]  the thing. I tell people about plans to chip the public 18, 19 years ago and
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.960]  people thought I was nuts. Now it's like, yeah, when will kids start getting
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.640]  chips to help them learn? I mean, it's just, well, we're going to help the
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:37.120]  troops that are depressed with brain chips, AP. There's just massive drug
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.560]  shootings, killings all over the border, 70 plus thousand dead in Mexico,
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.800]  thousands dead on the US border. But when Oh, but, but you know, when a couple
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.720]  board patrol gets shot, it's just the back of the paper. But then when some
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:54.360]  clowns reportedly go kill some people. Oh my gosh, it's Alex Jones's fault. He
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.000]  caused it because he says the Liberty Movement don't go out and shoot cops
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.560]  offensively. Try to wake them up. Don't, don't be part of this. The media is
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.160]  pushing this narrative that the Liberty Movement is going to kill cops to hope
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.400]  that that gets in your mind as a way to resist. You heard Bongino former high
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:14.840]  level Secret Service agent say, yeah, I'm getting a lot of harassment, but I
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.600]  think it encourages it to admit it's going on and validates it. What was the
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.800]  term he used? He said encourage. We said the equivalent of that. He said it
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:31.200]  validates it and encourages it. And that's one on one. I mean, you don't have
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:35.360]  sitcoms, dramas, cartoons, the Liberty Movement is going to kill cops and drape
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.080]  them in flags. And then it magically happens. And like I said, it was staged
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.160]  either by the media promoting it to create a copycat off of a non existent
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:47.760]  event or it was staged and they cut that up to have me saying it is totally
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:53.160]  staged by Harry Reid. They'll probably play that clip because they're running
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.120]  an enemy operation. I mean, look, when they were given the authorization to
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.280]  come out and say that I was behind the Boston bombing and that and that I
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:07.560]  quote and deeply racist close quote in the same sentence. That was off a
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.720]  teleprompter folks. That was authorized by the highest levels of the White
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.960]  House. They would never do that a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:25.320]  That means they're going all out. They will do anything to start this civil
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:33.960]  war, to shame the Tea Party. A new Oklahoma City to say, oh my gosh, he was
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.520]  a listener of Alex Jones. Remember, it remembered McVeigh did it for Rush
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:49.880]  Limbaugh. Remember that? That was USA Today in New York Times, April 21st 1995.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:57.680]  I remember seeing it on the news. Folks can look it up. Rush Limbaugh, the day
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.960]  after that was in the paper the day after that, the day after Oklahoma City,
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:08.000]  Bill Clinton came out, there's audio of it, and said Rush Limbaugh and other
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:23.480]  talk radio with no proof. See how that works? And they did it. That's hands
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:27.120]  down. No, no, no. We know who put the bombs in the building. So you better
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  believe that I suspect this Justice Department now, run by the very same
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  person who was really running it back then. Janet Reno was such a drug addict
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.800]  when she was a prosecutor. You can look up the Florida papers, and I'm not
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.240]  going to repeat all of it here. If you want to look at it, Janet Reno, it's
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:55.000]  incredible. Totally insane. Child molester. Oh, by the way, yeah, the deputy
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.520]  attorney general was running things. That was the guy that was the attorney
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:04.440]  general today, Eric Holder. We are our Las Vegas affiliate. Other affiliates are
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.280]  saying, yeah, we're getting clearly organized calls to take you off the

[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.800]  That's what they do. They can't intimidate me. So they're going to try to
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:33.560]  intimidate you. But this show is getting more affiliates. We just got another
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:43.240]  affiliate. 50,000 Y in Boston. It was in the Boston newspaper last week. We're
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.680]  getting big affiliates all over the country every few days now. They're
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.600]  freaking out. And what are you going to do? Put a bullet in me and make me a
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:55.320]  martyr? You scum? Don't you get it? I'm committed. I'm not afraid of you. I'm

[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.840]  are not prepared. The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:21.080]  the US. Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and droughts are happening with greater
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:25.120]  magnitude and frequency. If you are choosing to rely on the government to

[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:04.360]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:08.760]  potential for hood situation? The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:14.320]  the crowd. Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films or
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.480]  the nightly news. Infall wars is the tip of the spear. Is this another false-flight
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:21.440]  stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security?
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.240]  I'm sticking a hand down my pants on the streets. It's up to us to set brush fires
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:29.440]  in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prisonplanet.tv is
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:34.680]  designed to do. You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:39.600]  using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels. What we see now is a
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.080]  war against reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever that
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.360]  supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:53.360]  membership with up to 11 friends and family. Visit infowarsnews.com today.

[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.640]  level.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.640]  For whom the bells hoist.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  Last night I was doing some business in downtown. It was a bell tower down by the river
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:50.640]  and it was striking. 7 o'clock. I sat there and listened to the ominous boom.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  Man, I tell you, the folks that are going to get caught flat-footed by all this
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:03.640]  craziness, they have no idea what's about to hit this country. People are like
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:09.640]  about to hit. We're already getting hit. This is only the vanguard. This is only
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:17.640]  the enemy scout operation. When they drop the hammer. They're crazy enough to do it
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:24.640]  too. I know this though. The Secret Service almost to a person absolutely
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.640]  hates Obama because they've seen all the stuff he's up to and I haven't been told
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:32.640]  because I don't want to be killed and these guys are smart enough not to talk
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.640]  about it. Bongino won't talk about it. I've talked to other Secret Service
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:45.640]  current ones, you name it. They just say they've never heard of anything like
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:51.640]  what's going on because there's like a crazy psychopathic criminal thing going
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.640]  on where they, when psychos and criminals aren't getting caught or in trouble,
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.640]  they act out to try to get caught. That's basic criminology and that's what
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.640]  they're doing. Remember the FBI agent who they're now auditing and stuff.
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.640]  I forget his name. We've had him on the show years ago. I want to get him back
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:09.640]  on the Western Journalism Center supporting him. Farah talked about him.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.640]  He's got the Patrick Henry Center. I think it's what it's called. He got the
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:18.640]  photos out of the crack pipes and mousey tongue stuff they put on the White House
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  Christmas tree. What type of mental patient gets off on defacing a Christmas tree
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:29.640]  like, ooh, it's nasty, it's dirty. I put crack pipes on the Christmas tree and
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:33.640]  Communist leaders like Karl Marx and mousey tongue. These are mentally ill
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:37.640]  people, the type of folks that, you know, play with their crap. I mean, I'm sorry
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:43.640]  to have to talk like that, but these are sick freaks, folks. And the Secret Service
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:49.640]  and the FBI has to sit around. I mean, if Hillary Clinton was putting crack pipes
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:56.640]  on the Christmas tree in 1995, what do you think they're doing now? I mean,
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.640]  the Christmas tree is pretty regardless. What makes you want to go deface it?
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:18.640]  Why? Why? They're sick freaks. Oh, they want to rule us. They want, why does a
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.640]  psychopath want to grab a woman and tire up a torture for a month? Because they
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:28.640]  like to dominate people. They're bad. They're bad. Now, how else am I supposed
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:34.640]  to explain this to you? They're evil. Like the Communists and the Nazis.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:38.640]  Before I end the shower, we need your financial support. We sell great products.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.640]  M4slife.com's got the X2, nasa, and iodine. It's just blown my mind and my body
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.640]  was done. You can read all the health information in M4slife.com, see videos
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:51.640]  and more. It's truly this type of iodine is a new discovery with the deep
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:55.640]  Earth crystals. See the videos at M4slife.com. And don't forget, there's a
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.640]  business-based company owned by service disabled U.S. Air Force veteran that
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  we've gotten great reviews. They've been a sponsor for two years, made in the
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  U.S.A., used by defense contractors in Afghanistan, police all over the U.S.A.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:10.640]  and by civilians who want to be prepared when the, you know, what hits the fan.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:15.640]  Armor is still legal. Get it now. Very well priced for what you get.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:25.640]  InfidelBodyArmor.com. InfidelBodyArmor.com or 888-608-6605. InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  InfidelBodyArmor.com. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm firing myself up for a
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  news blitz. I'm going to give the number out and take a few of your phone calls.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:43.640]  And never before heard, J.R. Coken on the New World Order.
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:48.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:17.640]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:21.640]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:26.640]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:30.640]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape,
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.640]  but that we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:39.640]  and manufactured in the U.S.A. The New Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.640]  convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:49.640]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:18.640]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:30.640]  Alright, there is part of a speech, part of an interview that J.R.R. Tolkien gave,
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:36.640]  that no one's heard. We're going to air a few clips of it, and then it will be doled out of the next few weeks,
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:41.640]  coming up in about 20 minutes, and actually have the quote here of what he
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:54.640]  says, and it's extremely interesting. He said, I look east and west, and I look north and south, and I do not see a shore on.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:01.640]  But I see very many descendants of Saruman, and I think we hobbits now have a lot of
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:11.640]  magic weapons against them, and yet, dear general hobbits, may I conclude by giving you this toast? Very interesting.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:15.640]  And then there's more coming out. That's a smart way to do it, so people get interested in it,
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:22.640]  because, you know, his speeches are pretty rare, you know, likening the manipulators of society to shore on.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:32.640]  So we'll learn more about this interview. J.R.R. Tolkien explains Lord of the Rings and Legendary Recording,
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:39.640]  and we're going to be getting into some of that coming up with an interesting individual.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:42.640]  What do you think of Canter being kicked out, and the total history of the
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:52.640]  Democrats I'm seeing in MSNBC going, big defeat for Republicans who are really discredited now?
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:57.640]  I feel like if you won the lottery, you're really discredited, just won the lottery.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:04.640]  Yeah, Ted Cruz is, you know, surging in the polls, he's discredited, ran poll, even number one front run over the Republicans.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:14.640]  Whatever you do, don't talk about liberty in George Washington. That's, you know, Alex Jones exploding in the ratings,
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.640]  loved all over the world, you know, just, you know, he's discredited.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:29.640]  Our ratings are imploding, his are exploding, he's discredited. And they just sit there with these smiles, these congas.
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:39.640]  Yeah, we're doing real good. I mean, it's just, I'm so sick of looking at these people.
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:56.640]  We're ruled by a bunch of just pathetic camp following, gibbering, sell out, candy-budded, nerds.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.640]  And I don't even mean that in the classical sense of a nerd that likes mathematics. I mean, I admire real nerds.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:11.640]  I mean, a political class of mealy, mouth-sneaky scam artists that have preyed on good men and women for too long.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.640]  And America hadn't been perfect, but it has been exceptional because we didn't trust the system, we kept things local,
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.640]  we didn't bow to bureaucrats, so we had prosperity. Everybody wanted to come here.
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:27.640]  Now we act like everybody else, but we always do things bigger and better, so we're going to be the most disgusting,
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:33.640]  most out of control, most filthy, most degenerate system the world's ever seen.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:42.640]  We do things bigger here in America. And I've never seen anything in history as crazy, as dysfunctional, as politically weird,
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:51.640]  because there is a eugenicist, anti-human control freak system that they call liberal, that's the opposite of liberal,
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:58.640]  that is the driving glue that holds all this together, these different special interests and combines,
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:08.640]  that if they get controlled fully, it's like industrial level Jeffrey Dahmer or something.
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:15.640]  I mean, if they get what they want, everywhere they've got a captive audience, they torture and kill people and just do unspeakable things.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:24.640]  I mean, they are a wall of evil. Psychopaths with sociopaths working for them in mercenaries.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:36.640]  And then one of the warrior nerds who are waging war on patriots and who want overwhelming odds and stealth to defeat us,
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.640]  like it's a game or something, it's like World of Warcraft, but it's government against us in corporations.
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:48.640]  Like, how many people can they screw over like that helps them somehow, even though it's destroying their own nest?
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:56.640]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy. These people have it out for us. They really do.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.640]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:08.640]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:18.640]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:23.640]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.

[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:06.640]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.640]  We think, just let me think.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:13.640]  Even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.640]  It's chances that...
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.640]  Damn it.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640]  Why?
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.640]  Attention may be used, lieu of conversation. Words will always retain their power.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.640]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:33.640]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:36.640]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television end longer.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.640]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:50.640]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and surveying your submachine.
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:51.640]  We need cameras.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:54.640]  How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.640]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:05.640]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:13.640]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease?
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:19.640]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:26.640]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:39.640]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:47.640]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:52.640]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:10:03.640]  It's a very positive sign that David Bratt just dominated in the primary against the number two Republican in the House of Representatives, the majority leader, Cantor.
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:08.640]  Every time I saw him, I literally got angry at the slick, fake lawyer crud.
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:18.640]  Let me tell you, we get secret service agents selected, doctors, engineers like Bratt, veterans.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:27.640]  Congress is like 80% lawyers, and I'm not against lawyers in general, but you know what? We don't need 80% of them up there with all their baloney.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:36.640]  We need people that care about being honorable, and that's resonating with the people. We're sick of fake lawyers.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:47.640]  So it's very positive that's happening. And I told you, the longest serving Republican in modern house history just got kicked out in the primary in Texas.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:56.640]  It's happening. I saw some of the numbers. Over 90% of Republican incumbents are losing in primaries right now.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:03.640]  I'm talking across the board, state house, Congress. People are done.
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:09.640]  A Democrat should be throwing establishment Democrats out as well.
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:18.640]  And it's landslides. It's landslides, so the election fraud isn't working as well. And that's good. And I'm going to tell you something, and I'm going to give the phone number out.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:22.640]  The little phone, but let's take four or five calls for this guest comes on.
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.640]  The establishment's not monolithic. I've never said it's totally controlled. We don't have any hope.
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:30.640]  Oh, everything's orchestrated. Everything's a conspiracy. No.
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:37.640]  The globalists are trying to build a world government. They're trying to run everything. They're trying to surveil everything.
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:43.640]  They're trying to get rid of other elites. There is no special interest for the middle class. There's a special interest for the Second Amendment.
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.640]  That's why we've still got it because we got together on it.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  Because there was a citizen's rights group that Christians started at the end of the Civil War in 1868.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.640]  Christians had gotten abolition passed.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:08.640]  It's mainline history. And they said, and we need to train northerners how to shoot.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.640]  And they said, we're going to arm the black people with the NRA.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:23.640]  And it's the reason it's one of the only special interest groups for Americans.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:32.640]  And Fox Sports and CNN and MSNBC say that it was founded by the Ku Klux Klan because they hate you and they think you're stupid.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:41.640]  Just like they tell your kids, two plus two equals five in official Common Core. They hate you. They hate logic. They hate truth.
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:47.640]  They're not liberals, folks. They're fascist scum.
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:54.640]  John McCain is scum.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:13:02.640]  Harry Reid is scum. Of course, Harry Reid's got people trying to harass the Las Vegas radio station we're on to take us off.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.640]  Our listeners only to call up and support the sponsors and become sponsors.
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:13.640]  We've talked to station folks. They love the show. We're fine. But they should be rewarded for being patriots.
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.640]  You know how freaked out Harry Reid is sitting in Vegas when I blank at the city?
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:25.640]  You think they like it that my show's on in Washington, D.C. on AM? You think they like that, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:30.640]  Huh? You think it makes them happy? I want to take a few phone calls right now.
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:35.640]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:41.640]  But we need to see more. We need to really see people get aggressive with the First Amendment.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:48.640]  And we need to see banners hung up all over the country like we did for Obama the Joker when they tried to ban that for First Amendment.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:55.640]  And like we saw in other cases with the flu shot thing that made so much sense, we need to come up with banners.
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:05.640]  Everybody hangs up in your area in public commons areas saying the Democrats are preparing to stage terror attacks.
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:11.640]  Keep your eyes open. Document everything in the area. So they know we're watching them.
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:23.640]  And then when they attack me and say, oh, I'm crazy, I'll just show Glenn Beck reading Democrat memos where they said we're going to have a new Oklahoma City and blame it on Glenn Beck.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.640]  You know what they send letters to the radio station Glenn Beck and I are on and others.
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:33.640]  They say, when there's a new Oklahoma City, you're going to be blamed. Better take them off. Better take Alex Jones off.
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.640]  And then internal fundraising memos that are public. It's been on Fox News.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:41.640]  They say there's going to be a big attack. Don't worry fundraisers, keep giving us money.
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.640]  You know, you're going to get money, you know, you're going to get a good buy for giving us money.
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:48.640]  Don't worry, we're going to get in just because we're unpopular in the polls that matter.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:53.640]  There's going to be a big terror attack. I mean, these people are, they think you're so stupid.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:59.640]  They're operating in plain view. We got ahead of them all at the pass.
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.640]  Who stands a game from a terror attack? I mean, any moron out there knows this.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:08.640]  I want to ask the police this. You're not morons. On average, are you? No.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  Who would stand a game from a new Oklahoma City?
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.640]  We need the Jeopardy music.
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:20.640]  Who? Who? Who?
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:26.640]  Well, the Democratic memos in the financial times of London, Shapiro, one of Obama's supporters,
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.640]  Robert Shapiro says, we need a new Oklahoma City to get our agenda through.
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.640]  Or 9 11.
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:39.640]  And that's telegraphing to people.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.640]  But see, the little baby birds, the Democratic Party are begging for some food.
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:47.640]  Cheap, cheap. Why aren't you false flagging? Cheap, cheap.
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:51.640]  We could be the heroes and even our enemies. Cheap, cheap.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:56.640]  But mama doesn't want, or daddy doesn't want to vomit all the aborted babies in, you know, to feed them
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:01.640]  or what it was that are in the tummy. That's what they live off of, you know.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:05.640]  That's an allegory for the New York Times for they say, I actually believe that.
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.640]  Because they know we're all watching. See, we caught them with the underwear bomber being drugged
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:13.640]  and put on the plane by the CIA and later came out in Congress.
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:21.640]  See, we, we expose your stage chemical attack against Assad to blame on him.
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:29.640]  We know your games, dummy. We have your playbook now.
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:37.640]  You want to go watch the video? Glenn Beck says, government will stage false flag terror attack to this credit opposition.
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:45.640]  And you know what station owners have told us? They're getting Democrat seminar callers calling them up saying, get Alex Jones off.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.640]  But they're having people call saying, Glenn Beck's criticizing Alex Jones. Take him off.
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:57.640]  Well, that's really weird, isn't it? That's what the Vegas station told us.
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.640]  I mean, does Glenn Beck not think, no, they're going to come after him after they get rid of me?
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:08.640]  Scott in Wisconsin. What do you think about all this?
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:17.640]  Very interesting, Scott. All right, I guess Scott in there. Kelly in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:27.640]  Yeah, hi. How you doing, Alex? I'm calling your show today. And it may be worth the subject matter, but I have listened to many of your shows.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:35.640]  In particular, I've seen one of your shows with Dr. John Hall is from San Diego, Texas, regarding targeted individuals.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:45.640]  Sure. Ma'am, ma'am, listen, here's the deal. I don't really screen calls, but I said I wanted to hear from people about the shift in the country with the Tea Party.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:51.640]  I appreciate your call. People walk all over the show because we don't screen calls like everybody else. And I'm not mad at you. It's just, it's going to end now.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:55.640]  Let's talk to Terry in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:18:01.640]  Hey, Alex. Actually, it's a trade, but it's all right.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.640]  What the hell? I just said it. Go ahead.
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:12.640]  What you're talking about, I was actually tuning in at MSNBC, which I rarely do, but I was listening to it. And what they were saying, I think it's the Edge Show.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.640]  I don't ever watch it, but they were attacking you.
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:19.640]  Yeah, it looks like a giant, fat, force-fed woodchuck.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:31.640]  Yeah, that's right. He does, you know, and the way they talk, it's crazy. You know, just over and over the same thing repeatedly. And it's, it's, it is, it's, it's an open attack on the Tea Party, but you can see across.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:37.640]  Yeah, I mean, that's actually run by the White House officially. So what were they saying?
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:47.640]  He was talking about, there was a picture of you on the screen and they put a tinfoil hat on you talking about how...
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:52.640]  I can't remember, it's like a piece of his program and you were the highlight of it.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:19:00.640]  But the way I looked at it, Alex is a, you know, it's, it's like a, the girl said in Wolf of Wall Street when he was getting angry about the Forbes article.
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:09.640]  She told him, there's no, no such thing as bad publicity. And that's the truth, you know, I'm glad that they're doing that because now they're getting your name out there on mainstream news.
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:13.640]  Here's the problem with it. They don't have a big audience.
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:22.640]  So I agree with you that, and their audience is so brainwashed and so stupid that they won't listen anyways. Okay.
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  I mean, they use their audience like a toilet. I mean, they just give them the worst info around total disinformation and lies.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:33.640]  But the why it's dangerous is it signifies because their White House run on record.
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.640]  They take direct media matters, talking points from the White House, load it in their teleprompters.
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:45.640]  That it's kind of creepy to have Sauron, a.k.a. Obama with his red eye looking at me. Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:56.640]  Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's happening all across the board now, you know, and the, the worst part about it is, is, um, I actually, when I was at,
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.640]  Don't talk bad about the woodchuck. I gotta go, brother. Thank you.

[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:29.640]  It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners, and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:52.640]  And nine. Nine rings were gifted to the race of men who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:25:12.640]  In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:26.640]  One ring to rule them all.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:43.640]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your life.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:18.640]  And it was an allegory to a lot of the way politics in the world really worked. He was obviously a really smart guy. I've forgotten quite a bit of it, read the lore of it a lot of years ago.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:28.640]  But clearly that's why it's powerful. And then I was sent some of the quotes that haven't been released yet. But I guess we do an article about it. We can break some of this down.
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:38.640]  So some of this is quotes by Tolkien. They're remastering the audio recorded in the 50s right now. We do have some never before heard clips today. And then hopefully the next few weeks we can release the really juicy clip.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:54.640]  The cold-hearted wizards in their quest for knowledge and power were only good at destroying things. In his final salute to the assembly of hobbit lovers, Tolkien said that Sauron is gone, but the descendants of the hateful, shire, polluting, wizard Saruman are everywhere.
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:27:10.640]  The hobbits of the world have no magic weapons left to fight them. We have that quote. But he adds with a robust and hopeful declaration, and yet the gentle hobbits, may I conclude, by giving you a toast, the hobbits, and they may outlast all the wizards.
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:21.640]  Tolkien never again attended anything like this in his honor. So a pretty reclusive guy, and most of the audio and things have been sat on by the family, which is a fine, that's the family.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:33.640]  But this is an interesting little giblet for Tolkienites out there. I wouldn't call myself one of those, but I find it interesting. I like a lot of literature, but fiction and nonfiction, certainly well written.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:43.640]  And I wouldn't call myself a crazed fan of it, but I like it. The big thing is it can reach out to the hundreds of millions of Tolkien fans out there, and it's very exciting.
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:53.640]  So I'm glad that we're going to be able to break some of this down. We have our guest on Skype. We're going to get him back here in a moment and talk to him a little bit about it.
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:28:03.640]  And we have some of that audio that we're going to play here today. But just always interesting, the type of stuff that comes through this radio broadcast.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:19.640]  And my association with occasionally talking about the allegory of the New World Order, the All-Sing-I, the All-Sing-I, the Illuminati, the All-Sing-I on the dollar bill, the New World Order led us to Vega Mortensen, who's a listener of the show and came on and is a frequent listener.
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:26.640]  And the guy that plays Gimli, he's been on, he's a listener. What's his name? Famous actor. He's been on the show through that.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:38.640]  And so, John, I appreciate you coming on the broadcast. John DeBortola, thank you so much. This is a brief segment, long segment coming up.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:50.640]  And I sure they're smoking your Hobbit pipe right now. So tell us about how you came along into this and when we're going to get to hear the whole really cool final speech he gave.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:29:00.640]  Right. Well, thank you, Alex. Thank you for bringing me on. It's a great honor to be on here today. I really love that you played the Conan, the barbarian theme before the segment here.
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:07.640]  And it made me get my sword in hand to wage war on the orcs today. So once again, thank you. I really appreciate you.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:14.640]  That was a Texan came up with Conan, a champion boxer, and then his mother died so he committed suicide. Who was that? Robert E. Howard, I think?
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:24.640]  Robert E. Howard. Very good. Yes. Absolutely a Texan. So yeah, the tape, really, it's a miraculous story how this all came to be.
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:35.640]  A fellow by the name of Rene van Rosenberg, a friend of ours who runs the Tolkien shop in Holland. He was doing research for a white paper he was creating for the Tolkien society.
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:42.640]  Stay there. We're just wetting their appetite. This is a really exciting story because a full interview. I mean, Tolkien was against the New World Order.
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.640]  I think it's clear. We'll be right back. This is going to be newsworthy. Stay with us.

[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:23.640]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:27.640]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:42.640]  New filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:49.640]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it. It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:40.640]  John D. Bartola is our guest at MiddleEarthNetwork.com, one of the most successful literary fiction franchises of all time.
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:48.640]  It's up in the top three or four on record, one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. The Lord of the Rings, the Hobbits, the world of Middle Earth.
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:54.640]  And when you study politics and the power behind the throne, the all shing-a-di-luminati, clear archetypes.
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:06.640]  So it was probably 15 years ago, I started reading some of the books that had fragments of the Tolkien interviews and things where he did liken it to World War I, World War II,
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:14.640]  different powers, the way political systems work, tyranny versus liberty. And you could clearly see that he knew a lot as a top linguist and more.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:23.640]  Our guest has done a lot of studying, helped ferret out folks that had this rare interview that's going to be doled out, I guess, over the next few months.
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:40.640]  We're going to air a first little clip here today. But John, break it down. Again, how you ran into this, and from your deep research, where J.R.R. Tolkien stands from his political view way back when this was recorded.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:50.640]  What year in 1950? It was recorded. The public recording was made in 1958 at what was called a Hobbit's Dinner.
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:35:01.640]  This was the first time. What's amazing about this tape, too, it's so many firsts. This is the first time that Tolkien went out of the country for a quote-unquote fan dinner like this.
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:18.640]  It's a first in many ways, and it's a complete recording from beginning to end. Out on the internet, you'll find fragmentary recordings of Tolkien and interviews, but never have we heard him before in a natural setting where he's able to deliver a speech from beginning to end.
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:31.640]  That's what really makes this tape unique, but my friend Rene von Rassenberg from Holland, and this all happened really through the Tolkien Society, the British Tolkien Society. We're all friends together.
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:39.640]  Rene von Rassenberg was doing research for a white paper he was going to deliver at a celebration at the Tolkien Society.
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:49.640]  He knew about this speech that Tolkien had delivered at this Hobbit's Dinner in 1958 in Rotterdam, so he went to Rotterdam to research the speech.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:59.640]  In his research interviewing people that were still surviving, that were at the dinner, he came across the family of the man who actually was a hobbius, a tape hobbius.
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:11.640]  Remember, this is 1958. Reel to Reel is fairly new, so this guy would record all the speeches at these events, and the family said, oh, we've got this tape. You can have it.
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:24.640]  So as a Tolkien fan, Rene was literally beside himself. He didn't know what was going to be on the tape. Brings the tape back, plays it, and nearly falls on the floor because you've got this entire speech from JRR Tolkien.
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:33.640]  And in the speech, like I said before, we're hearing Tolkien like we've never heard it before. He's emotional. He's jovial. He's joking.
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:45.640]  But at the same time, he's very serious. He's talking about the direct meaning of the Lord of the Rings in a way that we've never heard him say before, even in his letters, in such a definitive way.
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:48.640]  And there's just priceless quotes.
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:37:02.640]  Well, I would call myself a novice Tolkien fan, not one who's really had the time to get into it deeply, but I've resonated with it. You obviously have done a lot of research into this, heading up one of the big societies out there that's been very successful at digging out a lot of lore.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:09.640]  Tell us a little bit about this really interesting man, because the more I read about him, he was really an interesting person.
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:31.640]  Well, like you said earlier in the introduction, he fought in the trench warfare of World War I. Most of his friends, his school friends, his college friends, I think only one of his friends made it through World War I, and he himself was sick in the war, but he survived through.
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:48.640]  And obviously, the trench warfare had an immense and great effect on Tolkien himself. Now, he wasn't writing direct allegory, and you'll hear many scholars say this, and Tolkien himself said it very many times, that he was not a great fan of direct allegory.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  He would like the themes to be taken up in the story himself. Someone like his friends, C.S. Lewis, was very interested in direct allegory.
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.640]  This is an indirect allegory. It's not like the screw tape letters that's direct.
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:10.640]  He would call it applicability. He would say what he was writing, you could make it very applicable, specifically the ring. The ring would be a symbol for power.
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:26.640]  And if you read through his letters, and I would highly recommend anybody who's interested in not only the Lord of the Rings and the fantasy stuff, but just Tolkien as a man and a lot of maybe his politics and his beliefs to read his letters, because most of his letters have been published in full.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:38.640]  And I brought a bunch of quotes from him today. One of my favorite quotes from him, and I think this will really appeal to you, and your fan base, is his summation of evil in the world.
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:46.640]  And this is back in 1969. He talks about what he calls the Hydra's heads, and I'll read the quote verbatim from him.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:39:00.640]  He says, the spirit of wickedness in high places is now so powerful and so many headed in its incarnations, there seems nothing more to do personally than to refuse to worship any of the Hydra's heads.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:07.640]  The world, he thought, seemed little better than a new Tower of Babel, all noise and confusion.
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:20.640]  So even back in 1969, and way before that in the 30s and the 40s, he was writing about the level of corruption that had reached what he would call, quote unquote, the central planners.
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.640]  And he just described the New World Order so eloquently.
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:36.640]  Right, exactly. And I think I've heard you say before, these people who he would call whiskered men with bombs, they're playing multi-level chess.
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:41.640]  Right, and the public is barely playing checkers.
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:49.640]  So, right, the level of corruption at many levels is that many headed Hydra.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:59.640]  Listen, I've had billionaires and globalists literally up in the top of big buildings, just like Gandalf going into Dr. Saruman, literally say you must join with the New World Order.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:07.640]  I mean, and that's why I went and saw the movie. I remember reading that book 20 years ago, and it's like, that's really how they act. I've been given that speech.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.640]  And so I guess Tolkien is a high-level professor and others, he'd run into that, surely.
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.640]  I mean, they're literally selling you on how evil's the way to go.
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.640]  And so, you know, he says it's not direct allegory, and I'm not comparing myself to Gandalf.
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:26.640]  I'm just saying, that's the speech they give you is that, you know, I am Saruman of many colors.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:31.640]  You don't have to have a balance. Join with Lucifer. Join with the Great Eye.
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:35.640]  The power of Isengard is now at your command.
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:49.640]  Right, exactly. And, you know, I think the disconnect for the average person is, the average person, they see a person with a nice suit on, and they cannot ever even fathom that that person might actually be evil.
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:41:06.640]  There's a great disconnect in modern society, and that's why Tolkien is so brilliant, because he shows in a fantasy novel how deep evil can go, and it can affect the smallest person as well as the highest person in the world.
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:15.640]  And let me ask you a question. Who came up with the battle armor of Sauron that was in the film that came out over a decade ago?
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:26.640]  And then in the new one, when he walks out of the flame, interdimensionally at that fortress, when he defeats Gandalf, I know it's described in the book, but not that way.
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.640]  Who came up with that battle armor?
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:38.640]  Well, that would probably be one of the set designers, or the armor designers. There was a lot of great armor and weapons designers working on the film.
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:47.640]  I think that Archtypoli, in a lot of Illuminati research I did, that's one of the highest level initiations. That's how Lucifer is described when he manifest.
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:56.640]  All right. Well, there's definitely, definitely a great similarity between the, what I would call these Sauronic characters in Tolkien's Legendary.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:04.640]  Well, I mean, there's a god, and there's these higher angels. Sauron's one of those. He defeats, tries to destroy the creation and rebellion. It is a Christian allegory, is it not?
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:15.640]  Yeah, well, when you go deeper into the mythology and read the Silmarillion, which the Silmarillion is the back legends, the history, so to speak, that lays behind the Lord of the Rings in the Hobbit.
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:29.640]  It's actually Morgoth, or Melkor, who is the satanic figure behind Sauron. So Sauron is not the ultimate evil figure in the mythology. It's actually Melkor who is controlling things from behind the scenes.
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:35.640]  Well, that's right. I mean, doesn't Melkor fall to earth and gets destroyed, and then out of it, it's kind of a reincarnation of Sauron?
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:45.640]  Right, exactly. Melkor is chained behind the door of night, and then the angels, the higher powers, they give him pardon and let him out again, and he once again, he wreaks havoc.
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:58.640]  He's not redeemable. There's no repentance for Morgoth. He's an absolutely true evil character, and that's what's so brilliant about Tolkien. He represents evil in such a pure and well-described way.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:12.640]  And notice, just like the cell phones really track everybody, they give us the technology, but with the back doors in it, they're giving us all the tech, but it's ruled by the One Ring. I mean, he's telling you how the wizards run everything in the allegory.
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:24.640]  Exactly, and Tolkien himself was, he was extremely frightened and discouraged, really, at the level that machinery itself was taking over the world.
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:28.640]  He predicted little computer gadgets would dehumanize us. Talk about that.
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:40.640]  Absolutely. As a matter of fact, another great quote from his letters, and again, I would highly recommend people, everyone, you, Alex Jones, go and read Tolkien's letters. It's an absolute lesson in this whole area.
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:53.640]  There's a quote where he talks about the war of the machines that has already begun, and maybe think of Terminator when I read this quote, the war of the machines, and he says, well, the first war of the machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter.
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:44:04.640]  Speaking about World War II, leaving alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed, millions dead, and only one thing triumphant, the machines.
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:14.640]  As the servants of the machine are becoming a privileged class, the machines are going to be enormously more powerful. What's their next move?
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:17.640]  So, I mean, he's personifying the machines.
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:19.640]  Tolkien was a total visionary.
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:30.640]  And that's part of my mission. And the Middle Earth Network's mission is to make people see that it just wasn't about the story of the Lord of the Rings.
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.640]  Now, a lot of this is tied up in the story of the Lord of the Rings, but this was a brilliant man.
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:47.640]  And the Middle Earth Network is also one of the co-founders of the Mythgard Institute, which is the very first online college allowing a master's degree in what we call Tolkien studies.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:53.640]  Studying all the peripheral stuff that Tolkien himself loved and studied, and enriching people.
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:59.640]  Wow. Well, you're a great interview. I want to have you back for a full hour soon. This is amazing. I'm glad you contacted us.
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:05.640]  I want to play one of these clips, and I know you're saying that has to be remastered because it's like listening to LBJ tapes from the 60s.
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:08.640]  They're fucking loop, loop sound.
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:15.640]  Yeah, exactly. And that's part of me coming on here today, is to let people know about this tape.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:20.640]  And that we're on a mission to get this thing restored. I considered a miracle that it even came to us.
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:27.640]  The thing about the Middle Earth Network is we're a fan group. We're a collection of fans. We're a collection of people who love JRR Tolkien.
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:35.640]  And I thank God that this tape came to us, and not some big corporation, or maybe even a private investor who would have just bought it and buried it from the world.
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:37.640]  Because this is a really important message.
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:47.640]  Listen, I know nothing about this compared to you, but what I've picked up trying to find out about Tolkien over the years is, so much of his stuff has been held and sat on.
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:52.640]  Is that gut level analysis correct or is it wrong?
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:46:03.640]  A lot of it has been sat on. Who knows how much is actually out there. I mean, this tape was virtually unknown until my friend Rene discovered it in the early 90s,
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:08.640]  and he kept it just because he's just such an avid collector and wasn't really even sure what to do with it.
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:15.640]  And really, it came to us through a mutual friend, a beautiful Tolkien artist, Jay Johnstone, brought it to our attention.
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:29.640]  And really, they were happy to release it through us, a fan group, because they knew we would really respect and be good stewards and wardens of the tape itself and not do it in an overly commercial way.
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:34.640]  We're going to play this clip now. How long is the total speech and when are we going to get to hear the whole thing?
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:42.640]  Total speech is approximately 20 minutes long. Right now we are in the process of restoring the tape.
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:46.640]  We have done one level of restoration. We got it as a wave file originally.
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:58.640]  So Rene still has the real to real, the physical real to real, but we actually do have a notification that the BBC is very interested in restoring the actual real to real.
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:03.640]  And that is kind of like a forensic process that they have to go through, baking the tape and all this stuff.
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:10.640]  Sure, because for those that don't know, I mean, if you don't, it literally has static. It has a looping sound.
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:17.640]  And we were able, with a computer just today, to take some of the background hiss out of this particular clip.
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:23.640]  And then when we come back from break, I want you to tell us some quotes, if you can, of some of the other stuff in context.
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:30.640]  But describe this first virgin airing of a short clip of him talking about the wizards manipulating society.
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:36.640]  Absolutely. He saw the wizards really as the masters of the machine.
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:47.640]  And the machine to him was about coercive power, right? Changing the natural world, changing natural abilities and to coerce whole populations with power.
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.640]  And that's why he makes reference to the wizards the way he does in this quote.
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:58.640]  I'm actually going to set up the clip with a little bit that precedes the actual clip where we're going to play.
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:00.640]  So it makes a little bit more sense.
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:05.640]  He says, towards the end of this 20 minute speech that he delivered to the Hobbit Center, he says,
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:14.640]  20 years have flowed away down the Long River, but never in my life will return for me from the sea.
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:23.640]  Years in which, looking far away, I saw ages long past when still trees bloomed free in a wide country.
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:30.640]  Alas, for now all begins to wither in the breath of cold-hearted wizards.
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:33.640]  To know things, they break them.
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:39.640]  And their stern lordship, they establish through the fear of death.
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.640]  And that's the preceding quote right before the clip we're going to play.
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:47.640]  I mean, that is like poetry on the Olimonati on the New World War.
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:49.640]  To me, it's prophetic, really.
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.640]  Tolkien would probably laugh at my summation of that.
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:59.640]  But to me, to be writing this stuff in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, to me is just amazing.
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:02.640]  We're just talking about this stuff now.
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:14.640]  Let's go ahead and roll the clip. Here it is.
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:45.640]  Well, I can't wait to hear the whole 20-minute speech and the parts that preceded it,
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:49.640]  and the parts that come, of course, in front of it.
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:52.640]  What did he say after he finished the quote?
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:57.640]  That was it. That was the final toast that he gives.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:03.640]  And then the introducer, the host of the dinner, closes out.
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:07.640]  And we do have that recorded as well, the closing comments of the host.
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.640]  Well, that's hard introing. It's even more powerful. That's just amazing.
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:13.640]  I look east and west. I look north and south.
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:17.640]  And I do not see a Sauron, but I see very many descendants of Saruman.
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:21.640]  And I think we hobbits now have no magic weapons against them.
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:25.640]  And yet, dear general hobbits, may I conclude by giving you a toast to the hobbits.
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:27.640]  I mean, they outlast all the wizards.
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:32.640]  And the point is, the simple good people that are just as smart as the wizards,
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.640]  but don't want to dominate and control. Simply amazing.
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:39.640]  We're going to come back. We're going to come back with a final segment with you,
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:42.640]  and then get you back in the future when more clips come out for a full hour.
[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:45.640]  But certainly, in context with his other published stuff,
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:51.640]  and the transcript of what you just read previously, it's clear he was a visionary.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:55.640]  J.R.R. Tolkien. All right. We'll be right back with our guest.
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:57.640]  I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com.
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:22.640]  And check out John's site, middle-earthnetwork.com.
[02:51:27.640 --> 02:51:30.640]  This is 2005. Goberky.com.
[02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:03.640]  To have a fighting chance against cold and flu bugs,
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:06.640]  get the world's best garlic extract, Allison Plus C.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:10.640]  Fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi with Allison Plus C.
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:13.640]  Scientifically proven and double-blind studies using low doses

[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:21.640]  Allison Plus C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized Allison,
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:23.640]  the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:28.640]  Studies show Allison Plus C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:32.640]  One tablet of Allison Plus C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.640]  Allison Plus C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:39.640]  and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:44.640]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.

[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:32.640]  And again, I always read a few quotes to Tolkien, read his books.
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:36.640]  I think I read The Simerillian, like I know I did, back in college.
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:39.640]  And I'm like, man, this guy really knew about how the world worked.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.640]  But he never stated it outright.
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:44.640]  He did it at kind of the oblique allegories.
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:48.640]  But now we've got somebody on who's really researched it and brought up amazing quotes.
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:55.640]  I've never heard and played that clip, but I can't wait to get the remastered previous clip to his final toast.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:57.640]  That was extremely powerful.
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:01.640]  John, any other little tidbits you'd like to throw out there to the audience?
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:07.640]  Yeah, I'd like to actually have a direct reply from Tolkien himself to your statement of allegory.
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:08.640]  I think this is really cool.
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:13.640]  Speaking about the ring, it's almost as if he was in the conversation with us.
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:17.640]  He says, you can make the ring an allegory of our own time if you like.
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:25.640]  An allegory of the inevitable fate that awaits all attempts to defeat evil power by power.
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:31.640]  But that is only because all magical power or mechanical does always so work.
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:38.640]  So again, just absolutely brilliant summation of the corrupting power of the machine.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  If the Soviets are staging terror attacks to mobilize their people, you can't stage terror attacks on America to mobilize our people.
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:48.640]  It always turns to evil.
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:51.640]  You can't do evil things and have it turn into something good.
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:53.640]  It always comes back to bite you in the butt.
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:55.640]  And wisdom knows that.
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:59.640]  Cold-blooded wizard knowledge would tell them they can get away with it.
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:00.640]  Exactly.
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:03.640]  And if I can, I'd like to read another quote.
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:09.640]  The news today about atomic bombs, this is right after the Hiroshima thing or right before Hiroshima.
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:13.640]  The news today about atomic bombs is so horrifying, one is stunned.
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:23.640]  The utter folly of these lunatic physicists to do such work for war purposes calmly, calmly plotting the destruction of the world.
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:30.640]  Such explosives in men's hands while their moral and their intellectual status is declining,
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:37.640]  is about as useful as giving out firearms to all inmates of a prison and then saying, hope this will ensure peace.
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:43.640]  But one good thing may rise out of it, I suppose, if the write-ups are not overheated. Japan might cave in.
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:50.640]  We're all in God's hands now, but he does not look kindly on the Babel builders.
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:52.640]  Wow.
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:56.640]  Yeah, and that's why I try to motivate people to read Tolkien's letters,
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:00.640]  because literally almost every letter is chock-full of quotes like this.
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:02.640]  Just an absolutely brilliant man.
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:07.640]  I personally as a Tolkien fan love his letters almost as much as I do his fiction.
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:10.640]  Well, I was about to say I'm a fan, but I'm really a fan now.
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.640]  I mean, I've read some of those letters online. Where do you find all the letters?
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:15.640]  I guess they sell books of them?
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:22.640]  Yeah, you could buy the published letters of JRR Tolkien that was a recently updated version a few years ago,
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:29.640]  and there's hundreds, hundreds of letters published, many that are still unpublished and show up once in a while through private collectors.
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:32.640]  But I would highly recommend – it's called the Letters of JRR Tolkien.
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:37.640]  I would highly recommend any fans or non-fans who want to get into Tolkien to start with the letters.
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:44.640]  It's just a wonderful way as well as joining groups like the Tolkien Society and go to Tolkiensociety.org
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.640]  or the Middle Earth Network. We have a great group of people.
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:52.640]  We host a lot of artists. That's another thing I wanted to mention is independent culture.
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:58.640]  I remember you had an interview with Viggo Mortensen, one of my favorite interviews that you did with Viggo Mortensen.
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:01.640]  And he talked a lot about what he called independent culture.
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:03.640]  And that's one of the ways –
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:07.640]  We have to make our own art outside of their paradigm like Tolkien did.
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:12.640]  We have the culture jam by not putting out what they give us, but by creating our own systems.
[02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:17.640]  That's the true peaceful revolution for the magic against the machines.
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:21.640]  Right. The revolution – it's not to – someone else said on one of your shows once –
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:26.640]  we don't want to die for the revolution. We want to live for the revolution.
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:31.640]  It's about living. It's about doing good things, creating a world that is beautiful.
[02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:34.640]  And that's the way it's going to be done.
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:36.640]  Amazing, sir. I'm impressed. Thank you so much.
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:38.640]  I look forward to having you back on soon.
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:40.640]  Nightly News tonight at 7. I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:58:40.640 --> 02:58:44.640]  Great job with the crew. You killed all the folks getting this together.
[02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:47.640]  Love the sword, brother. That's a great interview. That guy's awesome.
[02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:57.640]  I'm back on. All right.
[02:59:17.640 --> 02:59:27.640]  Thank you.
[02:59:47.640 --> 02:59:50.640]  Live life healthy.
