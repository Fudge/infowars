[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:33.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.840]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us yet again on this 30th
[00:38.840 --> 00:46.760]  day of July 2013 coming up today we're obviously going to cover all of the
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.260]  very important news taking place here in the US North America and around the
[00:51.260 --> 00:54.760]  world we'll get an update from a young lady who's been joining us off and on
[00:54.760 --> 01:01.940]  since early last year Syrian girl a refugee from Syria and of course her
[01:01.940 --> 01:06.800]  family was formerly part of the ruling government was anti Assad that makes
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.560]  it even more credible exposing the rebels that have been injected by the
[01:11.560 --> 01:15.720]  West and everything she ended up telling us a year and a half ago is now
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.600]  unfortunately being proven correct and is now all in living color so she'll
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.040]  give us an update for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour and then Marty
[01:25.040 --> 01:34.200]  Hahn as in Han Solo gotta love that name Marty Hahn the evil magician being
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.280]  sarcastic who the federal government was going to make him get a disaster
[01:38.280 --> 01:43.920]  preparedness plan and insurance and all this stuff to continue to have magic
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.440]  shows at birthday parties and things well he fought it and now the federal
[01:48.440 --> 01:51.880]  government's backing off which is shows you have to fight the insanity that's in
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.640]  the Washington Post today we set him up last week perfect timing to have him on
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.880]  today because it was just announced that USDA holds off on disaster plan
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.840]  required for animal exhibitors until of course opposition goes away so
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.160]  opposition must never go away and it reminded me of two years ago when they
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.760]  said we're gonna have to we're gonna ban child labor on farms and then we're
[02:13.760 --> 02:18.960]  gonna ban kids carrying the trash out I mean farms wouldn't run in this country
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.160]  and you wouldn't have what's left of family farming and it ain't much if you
[02:23.160 --> 02:28.600]  weren't made when you're you know nine years old to go out and melt the cows at
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.240]  5 a.m. I mean that's just a horrible idea to have your own family sending out
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.320]  to milk the cows really get up at 5 a.m. have breakfast go out milk the cows or
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.560]  feed the chickens or throw some hay and range cubes to the cows if it's the
[02:43.560 --> 02:46.760]  wintertime and the cows are gonna starve you don't drive out in the pasture and
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.080]  feed them I mean that's that's that that's how you learn how to do it and
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.800]  then you end up learning how to work and then when you get a job you're not a
[02:53.800 --> 02:59.560]  lazy jellyfish like all these TV ads see I'm already digressing and ranting
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.720]  obviously we await the fate of Bradley Manning I was just watching him be
[03:02.720 --> 03:09.880]  marched into the Pentagon Tribunal Pentagon courtroom in a weird black
[03:09.880 --> 03:13.160]  uniform they had all these giant meat heads that look like they'd had gallons
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.240]  of steroids injected into them standing around with machine guns just you know
[03:17.240 --> 03:26.280]  always displaying for everyone out there just the idea of having paramilitary
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.480]  forces everywhere like a little bit of third-world country it's all part of
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.600]  conditioning but whistleblower or trader Bradley Manning to learn fate well I
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.880]  think he's a hero ladies and gentlemen he said sitting there as a drone
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.760]  operator it was like watching children burn ants with a magnifying glass and
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.560]  they've had other drone operators testify who've done over 400 attacks
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.560]  including the attacks that have killed large groups of innocent people that it's
[03:51.560 --> 03:58.840]  like a video game and they give the medals above the Purple Heart that my
[03:58.840 --> 04:05.000]  grandfather got multiple Purple Hearts in World War II got one during a German
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.160]  air raid on their on their air base in North Africa and they got another one
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.720]  injured while in the air and I guess I guess he didn't have as much valor as
[04:19.720 --> 04:28.400]  some guy in Virginia or some guy in Utah or somebody in Arizona sitting in an
[04:28.400 --> 04:33.640]  air-conditioned trailer dropping bombs illegally on countries that Congress is
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.520]  not authorized military operations against them and I'm sorry and by the
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.200]  way it won't be human soon so let's just get past that let's give them the
[04:41.200 --> 04:44.440]  Congressional Medal of Honor and forget Audie Murphy give these guys
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.440]  Congressional Medal of Honor because it'll be autonomous drones are already
[04:49.440 --> 04:53.920]  in the air as of two years ago okay so you won't humans won't be doing this
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.280]  they're using humans to train the computers right now that's on record

[08:25.600 --> 08:28.200]  people call in on particular subject because I really want to get your take
[08:28.200 --> 08:32.560]  on it I think it's thought-provoking and important do you think Bradley Manning
[08:32.560 --> 08:40.280]  is a whistleblower a hero or a traitor do you think Snowden is a whistle-blowing
[08:40.280 --> 08:45.480]  hero or a traitor and why do you think the Pentagon came out I've been talking
[08:45.480 --> 08:54.120]  about this since Sunday in a landmark case of candidness the head of DOD
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.680]  public relations and psyops with all the head civilian and military counterparts
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.800]  hundreds of them in an auditorium there at Fort Meade Maryland at the NSA
[09:03.800 --> 09:08.040]  headquarters that is a military base saying the public doesn't believe us
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.160]  we've lost their confidence we've got to stop lying to everyone and then they
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.400]  let officers get up and say I don't want to lie anymore it was amazing some
[09:17.400 --> 09:20.120]  people could say well that was just meant to get our confidence again now
[09:20.120 --> 09:24.040]  the media didn't cover this this was meant to get the confidence of the
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.480]  military personnel there that hey we're not the bad guys because the military's
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.560]  now woken up that foreign criminal interests have gotten control of most
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.920]  the government and there is now massive whistle-blowing going on that never
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.920]  hits the light of day because no media even knows how to handle it I mean I'll
[09:44.920 --> 09:50.600]  be honest with you I get stuff that I just say sticking at the shredder because
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.920]  even I've talked to constitutional lawyers you name it I don't even know
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.120]  how to vet or figure this stuff out I know our whole office is under
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.720]  surveillance all of our email is as well and I am just completely overwhelmed I
[10:04.720 --> 10:14.160]  mean I was given some whistle-blowing stuff hand delivered last week and I this
[10:14.160 --> 10:21.680]  this is the crisis of conscience going on right now in government and in
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.960]  corporate America the private sector that will decide the future of our
[10:25.960 --> 10:32.760]  society and it was an astounding press conference last Thursday that got no
[10:32.760 --> 10:36.840]  attention press conference press briefing but there was a bunch of press
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.000]  there and that just means that some higher-up power that be had the kibosh
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.240]  put on it and and does that mean that somebody organized this press event and
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.240]  then it got that basically vetoed by a honcho higher-up I don't know but it's a
[10:55.240 --> 11:02.720]  big deal there's no need to recap that info wars.com I covered it Sunday
[11:02.720 --> 11:08.520]  morning because we saw it on Drudge Drudge just just linked to the Pentagon
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.840]  and their their transcript and their video and the Pentagon obviously didn't
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.240]  come out and say Drudge is incredible like the lighthouse says they said no
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.960]  it's credible basically and it's scooping us over and over again and then went on
[11:21.960 --> 11:29.800]  to say Drudge is now the acronym or the byword for real media that isn't state
[11:29.800 --> 11:35.320]  run and when you talk about state run again this is a chicken or an egg
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.960]  scenario and I and I want to you know telegraph this to people so it's easily
[11:40.960 --> 11:47.080]  understood but the real world is also complex it's kind of like National
[11:47.080 --> 11:55.040]  Review had a hit piece a few weeks ago on me and said Alex Jones is incoherent
[11:55.040 --> 12:05.600]  and none of it makes any sense and so why is he so popular and well I guess it
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.440]  shows we're still a free country because a lunatic like him can be on the radio
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.720]  all over the country and I thought about it I don't think that
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.720]  compartmentalized writer was saying I was incoherent because they were being
[12:20.720 --> 12:25.240]  deceptive I think I am incoherent to people like that and they're not gonna
[12:25.240 --> 12:29.120]  understand what I'm saying they're not gonna understand what I'm doing I mean
[12:29.120 --> 12:32.480]  here's an example because I heard part of the rebroadcast last night it was
[12:32.480 --> 12:35.960]  about 11 o'clock I was laying in bed and I decided to tune in for five minutes
[12:35.960 --> 12:40.800]  to spot check my show and I was talking about Delta Force bribing police
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.560]  chiefs mayors and others with hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece and how
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.320]  we'd first discovered that and then it had been in the Associated Press back in
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.200]  1998 and then I'd gone to investigate further and an interviews with police
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.080]  chiefs all over Texas including the San Antonio police chief and that full
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.640]  interview in video is online on YouTube years later we uploaded it and put it
[13:02.640 --> 13:10.680]  there but I aired that on the radio at the time and when I've been with mainline
[13:10.680 --> 13:15.000]  reporters and I tell them something like that they go Delta Force special Army
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.880]  special operations most elite group paying off police chiefs you're crazy
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.440]  because it does sound like Martians are landing or something it just they're
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.560]  like what why would they be paying off mayors and police chiefs and I go well
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.920]  they just make the initial deal to compromise them so they can then be
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.120]  blackmailed the officials and then then they could carry out covert military
[13:36.120 --> 13:43.760]  operations and recruit members of the police department for murder for higher
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.920]  operations narcotics trafficking and then the reporter will always push back
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.280]  from the table and say you're insane and then I'll sit there and go do you have
[13:53.280 --> 13:59.000]  Lexis Nexus on your laptop they go yeah I do well here let's look up Thompson
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.720]  Reuters or Lexis Nexus or even Google and they go oh my goodness it is an AP
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.320]  article about bribery and the police chief in Delta Force and wait you're in
[14:07.320 --> 14:15.000]  the article and you did interview all these police chiefs and break this and
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.840]  they go well what does it mean and I go okay well it starts with Hitler and they
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.640]  go what does that mean well Hitler didn't really conquer France he paid off
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.680]  pretty much the entire French general staff and their field marshals in a
[14:31.680 --> 14:34.880]  five-year program before infiltrating them and promising them that they could
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.800]  run the government which they did and it's called Vici France and then they
[14:38.800 --> 14:42.200]  go oh I do remember that they go what's that have to do with this and I go it's
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.840]  the same program but they've already covertly bought off all the police and
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.720]  mayors and and even city council people some of them are getting up to half a
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.520]  million dollars a year from the Department of Defense and I go here
[14:56.520 --> 15:02.120]  let's search 20 billion 40 billion 64 billion a hundred billion in the last
[15:02.120 --> 15:08.840]  decade of the Iraq war tens of billions flown in on pallets every year of cash
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.600]  to the local governments and the local resistance they don't fight them they
[15:14.600 --> 15:21.480]  pay them off and they go oh I get it there's been a covert coup by the US
[15:21.480 --> 15:29.320]  military but I go ah it's a private coup private corporate interest have hijacked
[15:29.320 --> 15:36.880]  the government and now they command the government and are using the military
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.800]  because they're the only ones trained to go in under force multiplication and
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.040]  infiltration designed to stop communism and to go in and buy off communist
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.160]  officials are socialists who are on the verge of going full communist in the
[15:50.160 --> 15:56.840]  eastern block or Vietnam South Korea this was supposedly used to stop
[15:56.840 --> 16:03.440]  Bolshevik infiltration Marxist Leninist Stalinist depending on the variety oh
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.920]  they're gonna come offer women drugs money power we've got to fight fire with
[16:08.920 --> 16:14.200]  fire so the US military became experts even before World War two at this kind
[16:14.200 --> 16:20.040]  of stuff but afterwards really got into it and the argument is if we don't deal
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.480]  the drugs the Soviets will they'll control the drug trade so it was
[16:23.480 --> 16:29.920]  authorized by 1947 to have the CIA officially as a covert act of Congress
[16:29.920 --> 16:33.880]  run the narcotics I mean folks that's how long we've been under it and again
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.440]  I've had family involved in it so stop being so naive ladies and gentlemen
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.760]  stop being so stupid the biggest business in this country's narcotics
[16:44.760 --> 16:49.640]  trafficking saying I've had family involved in the CIA that witnessed it
[16:49.640 --> 16:55.600]  is like saying I had family that work for for for Disney or Frito lay or Ford
[16:55.600 --> 16:59.960]  Motor Company I mean it's no big deal it's not all sexy and cool it's
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.000]  embarrassing the people that have told me about it are embarrassed about it it's
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.080]  not some sexy thing because television shows you government agents as being
[17:09.080 --> 17:15.160]  wonderful cool great people it doesn't it isn't like that and so their national
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.120]  review you say I'm incoherent about the military infiltrating America I just
[17:19.120 --> 17:24.240]  explained what happened but but when I say there's been a military coup it's
[17:24.240 --> 17:30.760]  not a military coup it is a private corporate offshore infiltration using
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.840]  the organs of government to illegally and unlawfully convert the country into
[17:36.840 --> 17:46.480]  a corporate dictatorship and presidents can come presidents can go but the the
[17:46.480 --> 17:50.600]  corrupt oligarchy stays in place and now they've gotten greedy they go well
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.640]  we'll just break up the family we'll just make everybody take vaccines if we
[17:53.640 --> 17:57.680]  want that are deadly to dumb them down and to make profits and then when they
[17:57.680 --> 18:01.480]  get sick we'll make money off the treatments and we'll open the borders
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.040]  up and we'll pay 101 million people free food stamps and welfare to bankrupt the
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.240]  country and we'll create trillions of derivatives and sign you on to it and
[18:09.240 --> 18:13.240]  we'll ship General Motors of China with your taxpayer money and we'll devalue the
[18:13.240 --> 18:17.080]  dollar and we'll we'll come in with a jenna 21 and say everybody but us can't
[18:17.080 --> 18:20.600]  build on their own property now and we'll tell the police and anybody that
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.600]  resist this is a terrorist and we'll train to take your guns openly and put
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.720]  in army manuals that gun owners are terrorists to be rounded up and put in
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.880]  reeducation camps this is all public
[18:34.320 --> 18:40.400]  because we allowed corruption to take hold and now 60 plus years later the
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.560]  very worst elements in the corporate slash government combine that's what it
[18:45.560 --> 18:51.240]  is what they call it a combine they're in control and Hollywood knows this you
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.920]  see a movie like the shooter where the old guys laughing on you can't kill me
[18:54.920 --> 18:59.840]  and stop this we're a combine we're an entire system you cut one head off more
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.360]  grows that's the problem it's like cancer ladies and gentlemen but America knows
[19:04.360 --> 19:09.240]  the answer record gun purchases people digging in anybody that's got a head on
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.120]  their shoulders is working to try to fix things politically while arming to the
[19:13.120 --> 19:15.520]  teeth and getting ready because let me tell you something when these things
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.680]  implode like this it'll implode so bad that the globalist won't even be able
[19:19.680 --> 19:22.960]  to ship in food and stuff for themselves they're gonna then go into
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.440]  predatory phase and literally put us in forced labor camps and they know that
[19:28.440 --> 19:32.160]  and are preparing for that when things collapse you're not gonna ride around a

[24:28.560 --> 24:32.960]  gonna be popping up at 30 minutes then Marty Hawn who of course was told he had
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.080]  to have a devout disaster preparedness plan insurance all sorts of stuff to
[24:37.080 --> 24:41.840]  have a public rabbit shows magic trick shows there's been a federal

[24:57.320 --> 25:03.840]  runner-ups for second place and then to announce second place today I want to be
[25:03.840 --> 25:07.360]  clear when I start you know getting on air and talking about what's happened you
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.480]  notice Bill Clinton came in and this real takeover program with the Delta
[25:11.480 --> 25:17.240]  force and buying off local police began and that's when they really use the CIA
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.240]  to infiltrate local government really try to internationalize it not even
[25:21.240 --> 25:27.680]  federalize it so the coups been accelerating it continued under Bush but
[25:27.680 --> 25:30.960]  actually kind of slowed down a little bit because they were mainly focused
[25:30.960 --> 25:34.080]  outward but they did set up Homeland Security but that was still focused
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.360]  outward as soon as Obama got in it flipped to gun owners conservatives
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.880]  libertarians returning veterans are the new terror threat and then big sis when
[25:43.880 --> 25:47.400]  we released that document that Homeland Security sources gave us we broke all
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.440]  that four and a half years ago if you remember the Mayak and Homeland Security
[25:52.440 --> 25:55.960]  reports she came out and shocked everyone said no that's true it is the
[25:55.960 --> 25:59.920]  veterans it is the gun owners they are the number one terror threat people went
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.720]  wow you weren't lying what do you think I get up here and lie on purpose I make
[26:03.720 --> 26:10.520]  mistakes every once in a while and we correct them I don't make that up I've
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.400]  received hundreds of Homeland Security documents that we've put on air only a
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.440]  few of them have gone viral usually because drudge report picks it up or
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.600]  because our listeners figure out it's important to get it out to everybody but
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.200]  I mean you know Army manual says they're gonna put gun owners in reeducation
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.840]  camps and a lot of people go well I better shut up not be involved no you
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.160]  better be involved in fact people don't believe it put it on screen I'll get in
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.400]  the number the FM number she type in army reeducation camp manual and it says
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.160]  for America how will process our families how they're gonna reeducate us I
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.840]  mean that's a Soviet term and I know I keep repeating that folks the government
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.880]  is out of its mind illegitimate and hijacked and they're commanding the
[26:54.880 --> 27:00.680]  military and police now okay this giant unconstitutional NSA spy grids secret
[27:00.680 --> 27:06.320]  police grid we set up it's FM 3-39.40 internment resettlement operations
[27:06.320 --> 27:12.520]  February 2010 they're telling them okay it's for America now get your briefing
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.200]  on how we may go after Christians you know the state police earlier this year
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.520]  just one example had a federal briefing they had to go to this federal training
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.120]  to get federal funds in Colorado and they called in literally hundreds of
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.080]  senior state police in the meeting that was in the Denver Post and other papers
[27:28.080 --> 27:31.760]  and they said yeah we're gonna run over the fact we may have to confiscate guns
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.840]  from Christians and they went over how that's a targeted group of extremist
[27:37.840 --> 27:41.720]  Christians period we believe will resist during what's coming and the state
[27:41.720 --> 27:44.400]  police extra to getting up saying what are you talking about what is this a
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.760]  Soviet Union and went public that's what you're supposed to do but see they
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.600]  were there marking that down to see who was awakened who wasn't and then they
[27:52.600 --> 28:00.080]  were removed and then others that agreed to it socialist and communist and again
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.200]  it's not a communist conspiracy it's communists that fit into this plan that
[28:03.200 --> 28:08.040]  only the state should be armed they're then rotated forward then they start
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.800]  opening a ticket on it if the state wants money and that was make sure they
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.120]  control the command on the state police to then you get written up you get
[28:15.120 --> 28:20.080]  removed over the next few years and imagine they go into the meeting and
[28:20.080 --> 28:24.280]  they say veterans and are the main group and then also born again Christians
[28:24.280 --> 28:27.440]  they believe in a second coming of Christ remember Janet Reno said that
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.920]  anyone who believes in the second coming of Christ is a cult member on 60
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.000]  minutes and everybody freaked out and what like 1998 and if you're a new
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.880]  listener folks I'm not making this up okay that's why when you watch the film
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.680]  Purge that's one of the entries on the Paul Revere site info wars dot com
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.920]  for slash Paul about 95% of that film has actually already happened when you see
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.760]  it and they're giving them briefing saying veterans Christians are the enemy
[28:57.760 --> 29:03.160]  that actually goes on and they actually have clipboards we have the videos I
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.640]  was given by a state police in one case another by firefighters or made to go
[29:07.640 --> 29:13.280]  in Kansas City just type into YouTube FEMA teaches police that founding
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.520]  fathers or terrorists and they actually bad mouth towards Washington and they
[29:16.520 --> 29:20.600]  got one guy doing it with another guy with a clipboard watching them and
[29:20.600 --> 29:24.440]  they're not there to see who's crazy and hate stores Washington there they're
[29:24.440 --> 29:28.160]  promoting who whoever hates stores Washington I mean it's just they're

[33:09.920 --> 33:17.040]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[33:17.040 --> 33:33.840]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson ladies and gentlemen we are
[33:33.840 --> 33:39.520]  back live the toll-free number to join us your take on why the army Psyops head
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.000]  well DOD Psyops head came out and admitted they've got to stop lying to
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.520]  the public and they've lost credibility and that the mainstream media is dying
[33:46.520 --> 33:51.480]  why would they do that what do you think of Bradley Manning should he be found
[33:51.480 --> 33:58.240]  guilty obviously not from my perspective 800 25 992 31 Obama has
[33:58.240 --> 34:05.720]  prosecuted more members of the press for espionage for exposing crimes and more
[34:05.720 --> 34:14.360]  whistleblowers for exposing crimes than all presidents before him combined and
[34:14.360 --> 34:20.880]  we're supposed to find out in the next hour and a half by 1 o'clock Eastern so
[34:20.880 --> 34:24.440]  I guess that's really in about 30 minutes we're supposed to find out
[34:24.440 --> 34:31.400]  sometime after sometime after 1 Eastern I guess it's 1134 central 1234 Eastern so
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.760]  anytime the next 30 minutes to an hour is usually announced a little bit later
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.480]  than they say I will be able to tell you in the next hour or so exactly what's
[34:39.480 --> 34:46.840]  going on with that but I want your take on it 800 259 9231 and we'll go to your
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.080]  go to your phone calls there but again I specifically from the listeners want to
[34:52.080 --> 35:00.160]  get your take on that question now separately I'm gonna be honest I do
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.960]  this at red lights and I've noticed that it's still causing me to be
[35:03.960 --> 35:10.400]  distracted but I see people almost running into me every day in Austin Texas
[35:10.400 --> 35:20.800]  who are driving while texting and while watching television I see people with
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.120]  televisions on next to them in the passenger seat flipped down in the
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.560]  visor watching it while they drive one time I saw a gas truck down by the
[35:30.560 --> 35:33.320]  coast we were going to family vacation a few years ago actually called the
[35:33.320 --> 35:36.760]  company on them before I call the police I didn't call the police as the
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.360]  company answered and this guy was in a gas truck in a two-lane road going over
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.800]  bridges coming all the way out of his lane and over I thought he was having a
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.280]  stroke or something I pulled up beside him and he was watching television on a
[35:50.280 --> 35:57.000]  iPhone as he drove a truck full of natural gas that would have gone off like
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.600]  50 pounds of TNT if it would have come over and exploded and texting while
[36:03.600 --> 36:06.600]  driving kills more teens annually than drinking and driving yeah the last
[36:06.600 --> 36:10.520]  number I saw is texting while driving with distracted driving is five times
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.320]  more dangerous statistically than drinking while driving oh but you drink
[36:15.320 --> 36:19.840]  one beer they'll take you to jail that didn't do anything but your tech and
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.440]  they give the police waivers I see cops all the time driving while they're
[36:23.440 --> 36:26.920]  looking at their computer they got well they're trained to do it nobody's
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.160]  trained to do it that's why you see record numbers of cops rear-ending
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.680]  people now they're on their computers looking up you know that good-looking
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.120]  chick over there let me run her plates and so I can find everything about her
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.560]  it's all instant they just select okay I've already read her plates the plate
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.240]  readers already have read everybody let me just activate and you know run her and
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.480]  then boom oh okay I see what she does or maybe I'll pull her over and that
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.040]  happens a lot and what's happening is we're going into a
[36:59.040 --> 37:05.920]  technocracy and children's brains on record are being rewired their IQs in
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.720]  most cases are actually being restricted because they're on computers not
[37:09.720 --> 37:16.160]  just watching television all day and people are not developing human skills
[37:16.160 --> 37:23.320]  the language is shrinking the nomenclature is shrinking the the type of
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.040]  words people use are simplifying young people will speak to you in text speak
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.880]  they'll say K so you're gonna be able to do that work for me later today you're
[37:33.880 --> 37:41.400]  able to get that done K and so what you have is people becoming wire heads and
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.000]  this whole transhumanist thing is not empowering us it's destroying our real
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.160]  perceptive humanity and I'm not anti-computer in and of itself it's a
[37:50.160 --> 37:53.520]  double-edged sword it does a lot of good things but it's also doing destructive
[37:53.520 --> 37:56.880]  things like all the major studies you can pull them up show listening to radio
[37:56.880 --> 38:01.880]  increases IQ and cognitive ability because you have to image if I say the
[38:01.880 --> 38:06.440]  name Bradley Manning right now and you're listening on the radio you have to
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.400]  then image what Bradley Manning looks like and that makes you connect synapses
[38:11.400 --> 38:16.800]  and develops your mind reading increases cognitive function and neural
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.120]  connections and IQ on average and maintains people's cognitive abilities
[38:22.120 --> 38:26.840]  later in life because you have to image and you tend to associate what you read
[38:26.840 --> 38:30.680]  with experiences you've had to then personalize it that's why reading is
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.960]  so much more intense when you're reading about something horrible that's
[38:35.960 --> 38:39.280]  happened then almost even seeing it because you're having to image it that
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.560]  makes it that much more real but when you're passively watching something it's
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.160]  very very destructive lowers IQ lowers cognitive ability just type in
[38:49.160 --> 38:54.320]  television viewing Alzheimer's you'll get over a hundred studies last time I
[38:54.320 --> 38:59.160]  checked BBC articles you name it guys just type in TV Alzheimer's and show
[38:59.160 --> 39:06.200]  viewers that's why my radio show slash TV show the radio side boost IQ and
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.560]  factoid awareness and connects things to different issues I take an article and
[39:11.560 --> 39:15.880]  then multifaceted connected to other similar things but also disparate
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.840]  things to get people thinking on purpose see they use media that's dumb
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.200]  down to dumb you down by dumbing down the media it dumps you down garbage in
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.880]  garbage out I try to upgrade the info to the highest levels I'm able to even
[39:30.880 --> 39:37.040]  though it's a feeble attempt sometimes and you know attempt to get you to widen
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.540]  your horizons there's the Daily Mail can TV lead to Alzheimer's and then it goes
[39:41.540 --> 39:49.040]  over the studies saying yes it can okay continuing here what am I getting at
[39:49.040 --> 39:52.720]  ladies and gentlemen humanity is devolving we're degenerating every
[39:52.720 --> 39:59.080]  metric shows that the globalist society is is is is is engineering these
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.280]  singularity towards a societal collapse and towards really the destruction to a
[40:05.280 --> 40:11.200]  great extent of the human family that they believe they will transcend in this
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.400]  great crisis to become God men but all the common sense all the history shows
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.840]  that's not going to happen they're really degenerates that have created a
[40:19.840 --> 40:29.320]  rationale cosmology to to validate the homicidal control freak bloodthirsty
[40:29.320 --> 40:36.760]  vicious jealous envious selfishness that they're engaged in and so I want to
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.880]  say to everybody stop watching as much television stop surfing mindless
[40:41.880 --> 40:47.360]  celebrity crap on the internet if you're going to be on the internet try to make
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.280]  it edifying try to make it multifaceted try to look at things that you don't
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.960]  agree with to to expand your awareness and to see other perspectives don't stay
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.680]  just in your own little niche that's what the system wants that's what Google
[41:02.680 --> 41:06.720]  admits they're trying to do by by giving you search results that they think you
[41:06.720 --> 41:18.000]  want tailoring it to you to actually keep you on a digital reservation the
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.320]  singularity is coming it is real and they are writing it towards a very
[41:24.320 --> 41:31.320]  selfish end that will not go well for anyone and towards the fact that I see
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.440]  people in large transportation constantly distracted and of course the
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.880]  government will use this now to have computers that monitor you Mercedes and
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.680]  Lexus already have this so that when you do distracted driving enough times it
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.160]  calls the police on you so see their answer will be let all this happen and
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.040]  then bring in total control as the answer and then have the robots drive the
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.480]  car Google's already announcing that we're only like five years away from
[41:57.480 --> 42:00.800]  them trying to force this we're okay you can drive yourself but you've got to be
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.640]  monitored by a robot that takes control if you haven't been a good driver and
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.320]  you've got to pay extra and then pretty soon it's robots driving you regardless
[42:10.320 --> 42:16.800]  and again the robot is the car computer itself just like the Google cars are
[42:16.800 --> 42:24.000]  already operating all 50 states without humans in them just like you have the
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.960]  smart meter that's really a surveillance robot to control your life sure it
[42:27.960 --> 42:34.040]  doesn't have legs yet they're designing the future not to be wondrous and
[42:34.040 --> 42:37.640]  empowering but to be dehumanizing and controlling because they've already
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.240]  decided you're an ugly dumb animal who wouldn't want to transcend because they
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.080]  are ugly dumb animals that run things they don't want to transcend the
[42:46.080 --> 42:49.680]  decisions been made to have an ugly future and I don't want that to happen
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.600]  and I want to have a real debate about this now but everybody serving the
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.040]  system needs to understand just being aware of this and then joining it
[42:58.040 --> 43:03.040]  doesn't mean you're winning it means you're a fool the greatest fool of all
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.280]  knows the trap goes into it thinking that they're in control because they
[43:07.280 --> 43:13.360]  know it is a cultural technological bear trap knowing of the trap and then
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.160]  figuring out a way to get out of the trap is the answer and you're not going
[43:18.160 --> 43:24.240]  to karmically and I don't mean that in the sense of the Hindus or the Buddhists
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.920]  I mean just in a reap what you so term you're not going to know of a trap build
[43:28.920 --> 43:33.760]  it and then get out of it and then let others go into it and not have that come
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.280]  back on you it does not work that way that is a fundamental law of the
[43:38.280 --> 43:44.240]  universe I'm sure of your father the devil many of you that serve evil whether
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.680]  you believe the devil or not the archetype of dominance total control
[43:47.680 --> 43:54.440]  total selfishness murderous power you worship like a moth to flame the dark
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.920]  majesty of evil but it will burn you and then finally before I go to your phone
[43:59.920 --> 44:04.720]  calls Spain train driver on phone at time of deadly crash this is just out
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.640]  via the BBC train driver in last week's crash in Spain was talking on the phone
[44:09.640 --> 44:13.360]  when derailed investigators say the train was traveling a hundred ninety two
[44:13.360 --> 44:16.680]  kilometers a hundred ninety miles an hour at the time investigators at the
[44:16.680 --> 44:25.200]  court of justice said Francisco Jose guards on ammo or ammo was speaking to
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.840]  members of the staff the state on railway company crash investigators have
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.480]  opened the trains black box data recorder to find the cause of the crash
[44:33.480 --> 44:40.240]  which was 79 people dead mr. cards on is expected and of reckless homicide but
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.800]  he has not yet been formally charged yeah he reportedly just kept driving into a
[44:43.800 --> 44:48.200]  turn that he knew he was supposed to slow down but wasn't thinking because
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.720]  people watch violence on television all day they watch Rex all day on TV they
[44:52.720 --> 44:56.040]  don't understand that it could happen to them they don't understand
[44:56.040 --> 45:00.560]  consequences I found and study show this with computers people will send violent
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.640]  emails to people are threatening emails to their boss because it's an email they
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.160]  wouldn't do it to somebody's face but they'll do it via email see you don't
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.200]  understand the danger you're in 30 years ago they didn't let reactors leak all
[45:14.200 --> 45:20.200]  over the world now from France to Japan to the US they 91% of reactors are
[45:20.200 --> 45:25.440]  leaking deadly radiation that's federal government's own numbers atomic energy
[45:25.440 --> 45:31.000]  agencies numbers the nuclear regulatory agencies numbers look it up they just
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.880]  go oh we just turned the alarms off in southern California yeah the reactors
[45:34.880 --> 45:38.240]  leak now we just don't have the alarms go off because it you know we don't want
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.400]  to scare people oh we didn't used to let the troops use DU because we knew it
[45:43.400 --> 45:48.160]  would kill them until 1990 but now we just don't care we say it's okay yeah we
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.680]  know that hundreds of millions of Americans were given cancer in the
[45:52.680 --> 45:55.840]  polio shots alone and it was done on purpose that's federal government's
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.880]  own documents it's admitted just look it up as in the news yesterday again it's
[45:59.880 --> 46:02.320]  like so what you know just what what's the big deal your mom and dad died we
[46:02.320 --> 46:06.680]  killed him but oh isn't it scary a terrorist might blow you up oh let's
[46:06.680 --> 46:09.840]  take all your rights even though honeybees kill three times more people
[46:09.840 --> 46:16.920]  each year than terrorists do there's a headline 48 nuke sites in the US leak
[46:16.920 --> 46:24.800]  leaking that's AP now that's old now the latest number is if you type in over
[46:24.800 --> 46:30.920]  90% of reactors leaking worldwide there's like 420 something official reactors
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.960]  hundreds of experimental reactors there's two experimentals in Austin I have
[46:34.960 --> 46:37.960]  yuppies walking to me and go there's no reactor in Austin because they don't want
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.480]  to believe there is okay there isn't there's one under UT downtown another
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.080]  north Austin the JJ Pickle Center they have a public website it's not
[46:45.080 --> 46:50.000]  debatable but doesn't exist see because you have magical powers if you say
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.240]  there's no army manual that says they're building FEMA camps for you and your
[46:53.240 --> 46:56.840]  family then there's no FEMA camp and Glenn Beck will tell you there isn't so
[46:56.840 --> 47:00.400]  it must be true and they tell you there's no reactor you know it's fine
[47:00.400 --> 47:05.480]  there's not all right I'm gonna tell you about some amazing products here that
[47:05.480 --> 47:11.440]  also fund the broadcast and then we are gonna go to your phone calls here and

[47:37.120 --> 47:42.680]  all fly around on the big ocean liner in the sky and wave 800 pounds and can't
[47:42.680 --> 47:46.360]  talk and have robots bringing his slurpees that's not how it's going to
[47:46.360 --> 47:49.600]  end ladies and gentlemen they're just gonna release a bio weapon and wipe us

[54:26.520 --> 54:31.400]  here on the syndicated radio broadcast but my bottom line is this the world is
[54:31.400 --> 54:36.520]  changing the globalist controllers have decided that you're dumb spoiled scum
[54:36.520 --> 54:40.800]  and that they're just gonna weaponize media and dumb you down and make you a
[54:40.800 --> 54:46.600]  bunch of emasculated self-centered chicken necks so that you'll just basically
[54:46.600 --> 54:53.120]  fade off into the compact compact city kill grid we're going into the
[54:53.120 --> 54:58.800]  process of dehumanization right now and we're losing our humanity and it's very
[54:58.800 --> 55:03.800]  very sad and I hope that we can have a real debate about this let's go to calls
[55:03.800 --> 55:09.960]  here let's go ahead and talk to Brendan in Wisconsin I go ahead you're on the
[55:09.960 --> 55:16.720]  ear I was just wondering if you what you thought about the the major media
[55:16.720 --> 55:22.880]  coverage of Snowden and now that things have somewhat died down and and whether
[55:22.880 --> 55:28.600]  or not they there was an agenda there kind of like a contingency planning or
[55:28.600 --> 55:36.040]  beta testing the public reaction oh I agree look look they make lemonade out
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.680]  of lemons when things come out they they weaponize it and learn how to gauge how
[55:40.680 --> 55:45.040]  we respond and how to spin it to be able to see how to deal with the public more
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.520]  later and they mainly use the NSA for industrial espionage against independent
[55:49.520 --> 55:54.640]  companies individuals but then also to predict mass movement future behavior I
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.760]  told you that over a decade ago now it's admitted it was in MIT stuff before
[55:58.760 --> 56:04.160]  that but more importantly it's about gauging if you're buying their propaganda
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.360]  and tweaking it but organically at a point no matter how fancy the
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.560]  propaganda or how fancy the brain damaging is from all the chemicals in
[56:13.560 --> 56:18.920]  the food and water if you don't brain damage somebody to the point of not
[56:18.920 --> 56:23.960]  being able to talk they even their lower brain can still operate no bad people
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.520]  are in control so they have the decision wreck humanity where we can't even feed
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.160]  ourselves while trying to build their robot computer takeover system see they
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.160]  still need us to finish the computer robot takeover before they kill
[56:37.160 --> 56:41.560]  everybody but if they if we wake up the tech back control before they do that
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.960]  then they're unable to go ahead and kill everybody because then it won't be able
[56:46.960 --> 56:51.280]  to be fully finished so they have a program they've got to follow do you
[56:51.280 --> 56:57.360]  see what I'm saying yeah and I and that dovetails perfectly into my other
[56:57.360 --> 57:03.120]  question which was I just read about some new mind control techniques that are
[57:03.120 --> 57:09.520]  coming out of some research universities out of Arizona I sent that to JB and
[57:09.520 --> 57:14.720]  David yesterday and I wondered if I think that there's a race on I think that
[57:14.720 --> 57:21.880]  they're trying to effectively get some of the mass mind control technologies in
[57:21.880 --> 57:28.280]  place as fast as they can and draw out the the economic implosion as long as
[57:28.280 --> 57:31.840]  they can there's always money to be made in turbulence in the market so no
[57:31.840 --> 57:35.680]  exactly they are gaming the crises they create they openly say everything you're
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.960]  saying they're racing in a global Manhattan project to have the super
[57:39.960 --> 57:45.680]  weapons the super technologies the super propaganda and but they've used it on
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.560]  their own population to keep control of us so we're so dysfunctional their own
[57:51.560 --> 57:56.240]  military can't carry out operations anymore and are just killing themselves
[57:56.240 --> 58:01.400]  because they have humanity left in them before the robot Skynet is in place to
[58:01.400 --> 58:05.480]  carry out the next phase so things aren't going well for them and I just
[58:05.480 --> 58:09.560]  wish the public tuning in realized this isn't science fiction what we just
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.880]  talked about this is what we really are going through what do you think's gonna
[58:13.880 --> 58:18.440]  end up happening Brendan do you think they're behind schedule I think that
[58:18.440 --> 58:21.800]  they're behind schedule because they're always hiccups and new technologies
[58:21.800 --> 58:29.080]  like that and it goes back to Gulf War one a lot of people just say I have I
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.800]  used to date someone in the company and and have a lot of friends in the
[58:33.800 --> 58:37.680]  Madison area that have discussed this but I want to hear more about this yeah

[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:10.720]  calls I was just talking to a caller in Wisconsin Brendan and he dropped off I
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.120]  wanted to hold him over because he was talking about dating somebody that work
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.920]  for the CIA and you know openly bragging about the weaponized media
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.520]  technology they have I just hope all these people that work for the system you
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.760]  do understand that you're the most brainwashed most compartmentalized and
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.440]  all this evil being done is going to come back on you and your family you
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.360]  understand this is a compartmentalized incremental shutdown of world civilization
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.200]  towards an exterminous program and some of these bio weapons developers and
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.400]  people that I've talked to like a doctor well what's the doctor at UT he'll pop
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.400]  my head in a minute that came out and said release airborne Ebola to kill 90
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.240]  percent of the world population we dr. Pionka you know I've had his graduate
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.160]  students that are now working in bio weapons send me threatening emails and
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.840]  things saying he only wants to kill 90 percent many of us believe all humans
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.520]  must be exterminated and we await the great day and then I look up who they
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.440]  are and their PhD and that they aren't a white lab cutter to bio weapons system
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.920]  I mean you know they are in control and at least they're honest about how they
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.560]  believe humans are evil want to kill everybody but really you look at them
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.360]  they're always wild-eyed on just the ultimate power trip of we're going to
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.040]  organize the killing of humanity and the general public is so dumb down under
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.400]  this technology that you know they hear this show and they go man this guy's
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.440]  whacked out no I'm not whacked out authoritarians are whacked out and we're
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.280]  dealing with a new world order on steroids here let's go to John and
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.120]  California we'll go to Jack and Chad and Luke and Frank everybody else go ahead
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.440]  you're on the air hey Alex hey buddy my own yeah you are hey Alex I was now I
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.240]  wanted to call and talk about you know obviously government is our problem the
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.440]  very existence of government is Thomas Jefferson and our founders told us you
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.920]  know Thomas Jefferson was a menarchist you know wanted minimal government and
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.920]  obviously that hasn't worked I'm wondering if you would do a show on and
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.840]  narco capitalism which is you know eliminating rulers eliminating
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.240]  government and just having unfettered pre-markets run the shell everything
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.520]  being competition which is a worked-out system basically worked out by Murray
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:26.880]  Rothbard and you know etc etc but some great books on that topic there's also
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.920]  a great you're talking about the dehumanization of dehumanization of
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.520]  the human race or what have you there's a great article that listeners probably
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.760]  would enjoy and you would enjoy as well it's called Jesus is a manarchist it's
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.720]  not particularly it it's just about the Bible as whatever you want to take it is
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.160]  literature whatever but how the more the messages of the Bible being that
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.520]  government on earth is the domain of Satan which is what you're saying
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.400]  frequently and by the way clearly the whole Bible's about rebelling against
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.240]  corrupt government and then they twist it to say the Bible's about submitting to
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:08.920]  it absolute pure bull go ahead yeah so anyway I was wondering if you would you
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.600]  know consider having a show if you I don't know how well informed you are or
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.440]  well-read you are on the concept of an arco capitalism but it's I think it's
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.880]  our way out if we have to educate the public you know to consider this is a
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:27.240]  very real and intelligent humane logical solution it is very humane and
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.440]  logical and and and and if we had a nation of George Washington's and
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.040]  Thomas Jefferson's we could do it the problem is the general public is so
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.280]  spoiled so greedy so lazy so evil and the government's made up of those people
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:48.280]  that that I mean literally they would die by the billions if we weren't there
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.720]  wiping their noses and then you come full circle back to the globalist
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.080]  argument of see there a bunch of scum kill them yeah but you helped make them
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.240]  scum see it's just amazing

[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:29.640]  Alex Jones alright ladies and gentlemen seconds ago they announced that Bradley
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.320]  Manning was found not guilty of the main charge but found guilty of 15 lesser
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.280]  charges and we'll give you those details as the transcript comes out I don't want
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.840]  to get it wrong and was just watching it on Fox News out there in the studio but
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:54.960]  we will continue once we get the actual details for everyone here on air but not
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:02.480]  guilty of the main charges but found guilty of 15 lesser charges and to
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.040]  start serving his sentence tomorrow and they do that because they know it looks
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.480]  bad to persecute this guy so they'll just throw him in jail for a couple
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.720]  decades instead of for life but we'll give you all the details is the text of
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.720]  it has not been released yet as that unfolds we're gonna go back to your phone
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:27.280]  calls right now and then I'm going to get into more of what's happening in the
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.960]  Obama administration as his entire agenda goes off the rails from Obamacare to
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.120]  tax increases you name it what type of tricks do we expect them to pull and how
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.600]  and how they're getting Hillary Clinton ready with all these made for TV
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.000]  government funded propaganda and telling us what a wonderful woman she is
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.760]  versus who she really is and plus I've had a lot of people ask me about Rush
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.920]  Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and the fact that rumors of their demise are
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.040]  greatly exaggerated I'm briefly at the bottom of the hour I'll give you the
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.720]  inside scoop on what's going on with Clear Channel and Cumulus and X him as
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.520]  well in fact I've never seen a news article maybe it's out now but a few
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.080]  months ago I learned about this and didn't want to be the one breaking it
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.600]  just because I don't want to get in the middle of what all these big radio
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.880]  giants are doing because I'm like a guy that works in the cracks on the mom and
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.920]  pop stations and on local stations and independently owned stations because I
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.440]  know how radio really works it's all really three big companies that own
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.360]  most of the stations and there's a few thousand out there they don't own and
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.160]  those are mom and pops they're trying to buy up that have survived the top of
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:48.080]  stations I'm on the Genesis is on and so you talk about 40 stations with
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.640]  Cumulus I mean big deal they want more money they want more of the ads and the
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.480]  radio is losing a lot of money at the national level right now so Cumulus is
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.640]  saying no and then they make it in the media in the controlled White House
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:08.600]  media like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are in trouble no it's that radio
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.600]  itself because the economy is in trouble is in trouble and this is just a
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.640]  squabble you know it's kind of like XM is moving to basically get rid of all
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.200]  clear channel programming and I knew that two months ago and then no one
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.280]  else is talking about in fact it's supposed to already be off in like a
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:33.680]  week maybe two weeks but but also not just clear channel basically all
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.560]  conservative our libertarian talk is supposedly going to be off including
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:46.400]  our show and Genesis shows and again I happen to know and they didn't even say
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.880]  it was secret I happen to know basically a bunch of the details of this and then
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.600]  when the media reports on it they don't even know what's happening with it I'm
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.440]  not even trying to know about all this stuff and I and I was told months ago
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.560]  that Kimulus was gonna kick clear channel stuff off of it because of a you
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.840]  know because clear channel wants more ads more money and that clear channel
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.200]  all clear channel programming is going to go off XM and then I don't want to be
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.680]  the one coming out and reporting it is it's almost like whoever brings the bad
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:23.200]  news gets their head cut off I'm quite frankly I think it's so complex I don't
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:29.280]  even want to get into it it's just that and I heard other talk show hosts this
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.440]  morning who aren't associated with a clear channel or Kimulus going we need
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.840]  the lobby to get on these Kimulus stations oh yeah that's gonna happen what
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.200]  are you gonna do pay him $50 million a year to get on there I mean well how do
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:50.440]  you think you get on these big marquee main stations in these cities the
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.960]  advertising and money is being paid unbelievable just just I just the
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:04.120]  naivete of even radio host of how radio works absolutely blows my mind and
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.120]  that's why I've always targeted the internet and FM stations come they go
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:16.320]  we've grown we're over 150 stations that's a big deal but we are dominant on
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.040]  the internet over Hannity over everyone over limbaugh I mean our numbers dwarf
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:27.040]  them 500 600,000 on podcast 300 plus thousand a day tuning in on streams
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.560]  tens of millions a week watching us on YouTube millions a week listening to us
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.480]  on terrestrial radio and and of course they've had talkers and other groups go
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.840]  and look at those numbers and show that but I realized how fractured and
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.960]  compartmentalized and really how media is moving towards a singularity I get the
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.840]  big deal to have a million viewers on Discovery channel our history channel
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.240]  show it's really big to have 3 million it's huge to have 12 million like the
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.040]  Bible it's huge the Super Bowl 65 million that's that's you know huge and
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.120]  the old days a news show would have 30 you know the nightly news would have 30
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.640]  million viewers one channel now CNN used to have 10 million viewers on Larry King
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.400]  live back in the mid-1990s now they've got at 300,000 400,000 in the same time
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.860]  slot with the Redco and but everybody still thinks it's the media it's the
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:24.840]  dominant thing and it's not and so there are shake-ups and radio going on and
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.400]  Politico and media matters saying oh Rush Limbaugh has fallen Rush Limbaugh has
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.520]  fallen and talk show hosts celebrating we need all these Rush Limbaugh stations
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.440]  Rush Limbaugh has got 600 plus radio stations 40 cumulus go they just go to
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.560]  the next station and have just as many listeners the next week and again I'm
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.440]  in direct competition with Rush Limbaugh but I will not sit up here and have some
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.360]  fake victory dance over Rush Limbaugh's dead body when that is not what's
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.000]  happened I just cannot believe how stupid people are I just I'm sorry I just
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.400]  it marvels the mind marvels the mind ladies and gentlemen as the rest of
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.760]  radio implodes big radio is only going to get bigger profits may not be as big
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.120]  all the time but they're guaranteed to have bigger share as ever is all the
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.880]  little guys die as all the little systems implode I've tried to explain this
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.400]  to people there is a singularity happening in media as it fractures
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:27.040]  everyone sinks but the most competitive within the system get bigger
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.120]  you understand drudge report gets bigger info wars.com gets bigger drudge
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.960]  report.com gets bigger Limbaugh stays the same or gets bigger because it's
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.400]  the last peaks it's like the singularity in media is like water rising okay and
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.200]  then in the smaller islands get covered up by it okay as everybody becomes media
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.080]  as you get billions of choices a day not millions of choices used to be
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:57.040]  dozens of choices then hundreds of choices then thousands of choices then
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.480]  millions of choices now billions of choices and that's killed the old
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.640]  dinosaur media because they weren't competitive they were caught in lies
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.040]  they still haven't figured it out yet they're they're they're that
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.800]  Hutzpah bravada drunk thank God because if they figured it out they could have
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.040]  fought us better because they just because everything to them is narcissists
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.680]  is that they're king of the earth and they've still got people around them
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.360]  telling them that but then you've got the old new media that's talk radio that
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.560]  always had bigger audiences than them that that is having problems but it's
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:33.200]  still dominant and then you've got the few things like info wars.com that are
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:40.520]  just exploding on every level and there I'm doing them I said I'd cover that at
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.440]  the bottom of the hour I just covered it and people were asking why aren't you
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.040]  covering this aren't you glad limbaugh is going down I'm like I always notice
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.280]  losers always like make it up that I've gone down or it's the it's the end or
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.480]  coffin nails for Alex Jones or Alex doesn't have any listeners and you know
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.120]  they even have Fox executives and CNN executives put articles out that I don't
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.000]  have any listeners all this like that makes it real it's like magical thinking
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.680]  that there's fairies living under the bed or something I mean you guys are a
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.720]  joke losers are the same everywhere they are delusional they lie to themselves
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.600]  about things I want reality I live trying to find reality and the truth is I
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.400]  don't care about being a big shot I don't care about may have in the biggest
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:32.360]  salary and the biggest contract I care about having a future for humanity let's
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.720]  go to your phone calls let's talk to Chad in Kentucky what's your take on
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.640]  Snowden and the rest of it yeah I mean I definitely think that Snowden and
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.840]  Manning are definitely heroes but as you were saying humanity is definitely
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.680]  devolving and the public can't thank for themselves so they're only told what
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.520]  the news tells them so they don't know what to thank other than what Fox news
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.320]  tells them so it's not good for whistleblowers the second thing on the do
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.920]  detail on the truth I think they're gonna be a little bit more truthful and
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.800]  they're gonna put more of a spin on it but it's gonna be more of the stuff
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.840]  like yes we are spying on you with your own yes we are doing this just to create
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:13.640]  the fear factor and I've got one quick question if I got a time sure go ahead
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.600]  can you explain to me why do you think that they would bright Bart Michael
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.840]  Hastings but not do that to Adam Kokesh if all this information gets released
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.520]  and nothing ever happens you know it just doesn't make sense that they would do
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.960]  that to Hastings but not to Kokesh because he's trying to get more of a
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.720]  movement going well it makes perfect they don't want to make a martyr out of a
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.960]  political guy that was being trying to be like a warrior leader they want to
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.040]  kill the high credibility people like a Hastings you had bombshell info that
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.640]  could have sunk them and they only kill you when they absolutely have to they
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.520]  rather kill your credibility and let's face it Kokesh he said I admire his
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:58.480]  courage but smoking pot on air acting crazy you know I get he's free I am
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:04.000]  me I am free but you know you know Kokesh at some points you know actually
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.120]  kind of hurts his cause but that you can say that about me too but but I mean
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:14.240]  no they're putting him under the jail now with with no with no bond so you know
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.440]  they're destroying him that way to just scare everybody but I mean if all this
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.760]  information gets released and nothing ever gets done about it it seems like
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.560]  he's still gonna be a thorn in their side you know if no one's crying out
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.520]  for Michael Hastings why not just take care of Adam the same way they do well
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.640]  we've kind of reached that point they may start coming after me too I mean
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.800]  that's the point we've gotten to where the president signs the NDA a two years

[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.960]  immediately the unconstitutional takes a little bit longer because unconstitutional
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:37.520]  you've got to get past people in public there is a war against checks and
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:42.200]  balances by the criminal class that wants to be able to play God and Bradley
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.440]  Manning is an incredible hero and a political prisoner and we should all
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.640]  pray for him Bradley Manning's not guilty of aiding the enemy but otherwise
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:57.720]  guilty of everything else is what Gizmodo has to say about it not guilty of
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.160]  that but 15 other counts Bradley Manning found not guilty of aiding the
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:11.240]  enemy in WikiLeaks case that's the star reporting US Army Bradley Manning
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:17.520]  private has been acquitted of aiding the enemy for giving secrets to WikiLeaks
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:23.520]  the much anticipated verdict was delivered Tuesday afternoon to a crowd of
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.160]  international journalists who descended on Fort Meade Maryland and they have all
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.520]  these private goons out there with their machine guns getting used to the image
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.120]  of our securities private security and machine guns everywhere so everybody
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.200]  looks at that and gets used to living in a third-world country everything's a
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:45.880]  Psyop totally illegal despicable it's all about raw king rat force that that's
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.040]  manly in America well you can go to Guatemala and see that you could do
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:54.400]  that 50 years ago just very just everything is just an image of a
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.400]  criminal government Bradley Manning not guilty of aiding the enemy over WikiLeaks
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.440]  guilty of at least 15 lesser charges US soldier Bradley Manning has been found
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:12.320]  guilty of the other counts including espionage computer fraud theft charges
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.240]  but not guilty of the most serious charge of any the enemy which carried a
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.000]  possible life sentence he was found guilty of five espionage charges the AP
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:29.400]  reports and others so and and look at the image of the men waddling out with
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.920]  him I want to show some of the viewers this if you're watching us on prison
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.440]  planet dot TV but radio listeners have all have all seen the images out there
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:44.720]  over and over again of the swollen you know weightlifter guys because this is
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.480]  the new status you don't live in a free country you don't have a good pension
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.640]  fund you don't have a future you don't have health but everybody can you know
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.280]  weigh 300 pounds and look like a linebacker and strut around with guys
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.960]  surrounding you with machine guns bugging their eyes out acting tough
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.120]  we'll see how tough all these guys are that are filled with GMO cancer right
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.280]  now you know even top UFC fighters you hear about I'm not even able to walk a
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.600]  few years after and unable to get out of bed and stuff all the big mighty will
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.120]  fall so just remember that but again I just see it America didn't used to have
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.560]  a bunch of guys with machine guns at a military trial bugging their eyes out for
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.280]  the camera acting tough projecting dominance that's that's Nazi Germany
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.840]  didn't even do that that's really bad banana republics people act and dress
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.520]  like this I mean it's just the imagery of our country is so knuckle dragging
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.720]  oh man it makes me sick Jack in Georgia what's your take on this I'm doing all
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.040]  right I'm sad for Bradley Manning I mean he did the right thing he exposed a
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.760]  lot of serious crime absolutely I actually can tell you two sides of the
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.160]  of seeing seeing this go down I actually had a top-tier clearance while I was in
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.280]  the Navy and I at that time they indoctrinate you so much the fact that
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.200]  you would they would tell you these stories about certain people that top
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:14.160]  tier clanses sneaking out thumb drives and trying to sell to the Russians you
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:22.040]  know and you you know you are a useful idiot this time you know 2021-22 that if
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.520]  I was still in and that mindset I would be with how the media is portraying it
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:32.040]  you know but I've been walking up since 2008 and the way I see it now it's it
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.760]  makes me sick to my stomach well giving up I want to hear your inside take on
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.920]  this but giving thumb drives to the Russians is treason coming out and
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.400]  saying we torture people we set up innocent people we murder innocent
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:50.720]  people that's your duty but they equate anybody even speaking out against
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.320]  corruption as a Rusky and that's not what it is you're exactly correct I mean
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.920]  but I'm telling you the way they would spin this they would have you know to
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.400]  even get that clearance they make you sit through hours and hours and hours I
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.840]  just gave that one kid with the Russian thumb drive just as an example but they
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.920]  would they're spinning this so many different ways and and the key term
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.640]  useful idiot is it works well I'll tell you the main crime here tell what come
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.560]  back don't hang up I want to let you finish okay Jack okay stay there and
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.400]  we'll get to Syrian girl and then other callers after you and then the last 30
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.280]  minutes of the next hour we're getting the magician on who was told by the
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.200]  federal government he couldn't do his magic shows anymore without federal
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.600]  authorization because the feds want to run every aspect of our lives but the
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.120]  big issue here is a chilling effect on people in government not reporting
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:49.320]  criminal activities they're trying to build that as espionage

[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.560]  basically kicked out by the Assad folks so that makes her an even more credible
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.480]  source because she's against what's happening in syria even though she
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:32.840]  doesn't like Assad because it is a western destabilization mass murder

[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.480]  brigades the some have been laden brigades when they're now in egypt that's
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.160]  who the egyptian military is shooting and I don't like the military shooting
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.800]  people but it is it is an attempt to radically take over egypt as well and
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.120]  why would our government be supporting this again because they want
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:08.320]  destabilization we're gonna talk about that in a moment but jack somebody you
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.800]  say that worked in in classified areas and saw the stuff going on other points
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.640]  you'd like to add about what now bradley manning is facing decades in
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.440]  prison I'm not exactly on that I kind of wanted to tell you about something that
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:25.960]  happened to me a while ago that in the Navy that you probably interested in sure
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:34.360]  go ahead my my helicopter got shot down in 2008 during a pacific partnership to
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:41.280]  her like a go america tour throughout Asia and what was crazy to me is that
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.000]  because it didn't fit their script this would actually start this this would
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.920]  woke me up and I just had to get out of military at this point because no one
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:56.560]  ever heard about and because it didn't fit their script I mean it was
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:01.680]  beyond me and then they shut down the ship and everyone got a complete you
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:08.520]  know three-hour briefings about secrecy and it just it blew my mind that you
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.800]  know I come back and you know no one no one's even heard about it and I can't
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.520]  even talk about well now I'm way out so it doesn't matter anymore but there's a
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:24.240]  just a blip on a blog on that on the New York Times about it and I was wondering
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:29.200]  if you even heard about that and why you think that they would have silenced
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.520]  that at the time you know what why do you think that was happening I have no
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:42.080]  idea I mean we were on a hospital ship doing a go america tour which was
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.160]  really weird because every port we went to went that we're actually the first
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:52.760]  boots in Vietnam since Vietnam War and every port we go to we'd drop off
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:58.440]  projects mile drop off doctors and you know do a go america tour but then we
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.480]  had massive party with all these high officials in every country we went to
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.840]  and we were actually allowed up there because we were like the only special
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.200]  forces unit on the boat and we just you haven't haven't you know beers and
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.960]  really expensive food on the on the flight deck of the hospital ship you
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.720]  know and you know it kind of now that I'm woken up I see that you know not
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:29.280]  only are they trying to infiltrate these small Asian countries but they're
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.600]  warming up that had officials so that you know they can later come in and make
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:40.000]  deals with when you were in special forces you say in the Navy did did you
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.240]  ever do anything like the Delta Force does where they go and like buy off just
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.400]  say be our friend here's $200,000 and then the police chief says are you
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.880]  trying to bribe me is this a setup no no here's a letter from the president we
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.680]  just want to give you $200,000 for being a nice guy and then a year later on
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:00.600]  the mafia comes and says okay now you're gonna deal drugs for us or let us do it
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.880]  you took $200,000 and and these police chiefs are shocked they go I thought my
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:10.400]  president told me to do this and they go watch it buddy you're involved did you
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.120]  did you ever hear about stuff like that that sounds like economic hitmen type
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:21.040]  stuff no we I did combat search and rescue helicopter search and rescue 50
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.760]  outdoor gunner and real special forces type combat and rescue stuff not not
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.120]  not infiltration because you know special forces across the board to hire up
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:37.840]  units they are trained in infiltrating and influencing target countries with
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.520]  cash and things like that you've never heard of units that did stuff like that
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:48.040]  I will I will tell you this Alex when we arrived in the Persian Gulf back I
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:55.600]  mean just like 2004 we dropped a seal year because we flew with the seal all
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.360]  time we were we were there their helicopter skiff you know yeah you've
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.840]  got like you got the boat guys got the EOD guys then you got the helicopter guys
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:09.760]  pretty much everyone is in unison and we dropped off a steel team unit and at
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.960]  this time I didn't know what it was but now I know absolutely opium field
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:24.200]  absolutely like 2000 2004 you know and then to come back and realize how the
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:32.440]  opium production skyrocketed around that 2002-2003 years it was just
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.600]  mind-blowing to see how much I was upon in their scheme you know absolutely let
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.280]  me ask you this question we'll go to our guests and I appreciate you calling in
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.960]  when I run into military on the street no exaggeration if I'm walking by
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.320]  military half the time they go Alex Jones to check my hand and we're waking up
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:56.360]  and I say how many people are awake and they say 30 50 60 so I average it 45 50
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.040]  percent are awake to the fact that there's criminal interest to control the
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.320]  government it's bigger than Obama that they're being trained to take on the
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:09.320]  American people what percentage of people you talk to and special forces I
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.600]  guess it was the Navy to be Navy SEALs what percentage of them are starting to
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.600]  figure out I mean we saw on Michael Savage last week the father of one of
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.640]  the SEAL team six people whose helicopter blew up saying they blew up the
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.160]  helicopter they killed him well I told people when it happened that we have a
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.880]  family friend whose son who we've known for me my dad's been good friends with
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.840]  them for like 20 years I mean they have come over for barbecue his sons and
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.760]  SEAL team I'm gonna say what SEAL team it's not SEAL team six they said no no
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.800]  the families think that that that the that there was a bomb on board and that
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.680]  was blown up and see I didn't just say that folks I mean obviously they wouldn't
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.280]  come on air and and this is somebody we know who just knew people who died so
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.400]  and now that's on Savage with the dad saying that I mean it's I mean we're
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.600]  not making this stuff up folks I don't just come and say I have a source and
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.200]  they said this I mean I'm telling you something I mean it it happened and and
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.720]  but what percentage would you say are awake or starting to wake up I will tell
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.000]  you this I I have friends that were went through school with me that are now
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.880]  two of them are in SEAL team five and one of them actually made it to SEAL team
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.040]  six and I don't know how you know how they select you for SEAL team six each
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.960]  each team walks the hall and they have a picture of the guy in the team and they
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.120]  put a check on whoever they want to progress the SEAL team six so it's a
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:38.120]  very small unit but it's it's not just like in one area like SEAL team five
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.560]  SEAL team one you know which is cross-coast well from what I know about
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.120]  it I mean and then they got units that are actually sheep dipped above it just
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:52.000]  like Delta Force they do the political weird stuff assassinations you know
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.600]  some of the dirtier things and that's why they've killed so many of them I mean
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.840]  folks you don't want to be involved in the super special units believe me I've
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.440]  had family that have been involved in things like this and they say it's once
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.240]  you even go beyond the military and they go you're now an agent of the CIA and
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.520]  you know you're now former special forces associated with CIA and the
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.160]  National Security Council once you get into that group I mean it is bad man
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.920]  those are the guys loading the drugs on the planes they're the ones guarding
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.440]  Dine Corps when they're flying kids out I mean it's it's unbelievably bad and
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.560]  most of them end up having a conscience problem and they get killed any
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.160]  comments on that I have a conscious problem because when I was shot down I
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.680]  suppressed fire and you know and this is men and now you know in Philippines
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:46.000]  which is a bunch of bunch of civilians and huts you know but my buddy that's
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.720]  until team six you know I speak very freely with him he doesn't he doesn't
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.560]  care you know and they there is a lot of anger towards the system and Obama and
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:01.840]  I'll let you know that so they know I mean I mean do they know what's going
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:08.240]  on it's all it's always like at the tip of their tongue you know and I'm not
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.240]  sure I got counseled on my way out of the military because I woke up to you
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:19.080]  because someone graffiti info or is on a street sign and I was driving to work
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:24.000]  I was like what is that and I don't recommend people doing that but I bet
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.880]  I woke up so many people in San Diego when I was there but on my way out the
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.280]  door I was starting to bring up certain questions of people and let's just say
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.800]  it wasn't it it wasn't a good a good salute out the door I counseled a few
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.040]  times and then I left and well sir you you left with your conscience and your
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.920]  life and people better figure out across the board that this is not a
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:57.240]  game there are thousands of army hit men alone who just kill people in the
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.520]  US and and it's just so sad how naive the public is God bless you and I
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.640]  appreciate you calling into the show and I appreciate Syrian girl getting up
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.440]  early this is the middle of the night over in over in Australia to come on
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:14.640]  with us again her family was in the ruling party there got run out by the
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.800]  Assad's so even though they don't like Assad and or his son she for about a
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.480]  year and a half has given us incredible intel that's all turned out to be
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.360]  absolutely true and since then she's gone public with her full name but on
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.480]  national Australian television we'll just call her Syrian girl here today
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.720]  with us and Syrian girl I appreciate you holding well I went to that caller he
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.400]  was very important you've got the floor the latest developments in Syria the
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.760]  mass murder but also the al-Qaeda brigades killing Christians and
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:46.120]  Coptic Muslims and others are Coptic Christians and Alawites in other areas
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.440]  what is happening and what's the real state of the ongoing stalemate war in
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:58.080]  Syria right now hi Alex thanks for having me you're welcome to call me Mimi
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:04.800]  Alham if you like okay quite wise friend okay fantastic great well you know the
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.920]  media has been sort of hyping up that there's this big split between the so
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.840]  called moderate rebels as they call them an al-Qaeda and they hyped up an
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:23.080]  assassination of one of the FSA insurgents and al-Qaeda which is Jabhat al-Nusra
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:28.840]  is the name is going by in Syria so but in reality you know they choose their
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.400]  words very carefully because they say moderate rebels they don't say secular
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:40.240]  rebels and that's because they're no secular rebels secular rebels are a very
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.160]  tiny minority and you know moderate relative to what like relative to al-Qaeda
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:53.160]  and in economists you might bring up the table that was shown of the types of
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:57.840]  groups and the names of the groups that are part of the rebels this includes
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.440]  Ansar al-Islam which is an Islamist group and then you have liwa al-Tawheed
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.960]  which are under the umbrella of the moderate non al-Qaeda rebels but that's
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.040]  the same group that was responsible for strapping a bomb to a prisoner last
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.840]  year and trying to get him to drive through a checkpoint and become an
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.920]  unwilling suicide bomber so this is the groups that the U.S. government are
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:26.320]  labeling as moderate groups and then you have you know Farooq Battalion and
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:33.600]  Awar al-Sham and it just it's a long list of maybe not al-Qaeda level insane
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:41.600]  insanity but certainly religious groups and in Syria religious based political
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.000]  parties aren't allowed and there's a reason for that because we have many
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.600]  religious groups and when you have religious parties everybody will start
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:53.600]  to vote for their own religious party and then we have something that's
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.280]  exactly like Lebanon where the society is so fractured and split and they've had
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.480]  multiple civil war there's a separation of church and state you don't have
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.880]  religious parties we don't have that here either I mean you can go have one
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.560]  but once they get in government it can't be a a religious based government and I
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.280]  think that's really sensible you know religion there's nothing wrong or
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.840]  inherently evil about any of the religions but religion in politics just
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.640]  creates many many problems and you know just because they're moderate compared
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.680]  to al-Qaeda doesn't mean they're not Islamic doesn't mean that they don't
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.040]  steal from people doesn't mean that they don't kick people out of their homes
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.880]  doesn't mean that doesn't mean they're not constantly killing each other so
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.960]  let me ask you this question what is the current real state of the battlefield
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:43.800]  situation of a mere sources inside Syria right now well if things carry on as
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:49.320]  they are and the rebels or insurgents aren't giving any weapons then the army
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:56.280]  has a sure victory the fact that Xareff fell in homes is that is kind of like
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:01.680]  the styling grad of Syria because it homes the city homes has all the roads
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:06.000]  to all the major cities around Syria so if it's a control point so now that
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.040]  Syrian military controls that control point everything else will follow
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.360]  through but unfortunately you know you have people like Kylie Levine meeting up
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:23.120]  with Salim Idris and talking about not caring about the consequences but
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.360]  definitely wanting to give weapons and the thing is what I'd also like to
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:32.960]  mention is that you know this rivalry is hyped up in the media about between the
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:38.280]  FSA and the al-Qaeda groups but in fact you know there was an article written
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.720]  by Andrew McCarthy which highlights the fact that the split between al-Qaeda and
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:49.680]  the FSA is not so deep because in an Al Jazeera report colonel Abdul Rahman
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.680]  he's calling himself a colonel which is a member of the rebels supreme military
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:00.440]  military council said that al-Qaeda was welcome in Syria to help fight the regime
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.560]  but even the CFR admits about 60% of the fighters are jihadis out of Saudi
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.600]  Arabia who affiliate with al-Qaeda they even have al-Qaeda uniforms they wave
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.760]  al-Qaeda flags I've seen in Egypt the people throwing the secular folks off
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:20.640]  buildings are waving al-Qaeda flags I mean this is al-Qaeda it's you know it's
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.520]  all out in the open they haven't really you know what manner of treason is it to
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.960]  welcome al-Qaeda or foreigners into a land to kill your people the only group
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:36.600]  that's fighting al-Qaeda in Syria right now is the Syrian army the FSA are not
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.480]  fighting al-Qaeda they are weak compared to al-Qaeda al-Qaeda is the biggest
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:45.960]  fighting group fighting the Syrian army in Syria and you know around the same
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:50.280]  time this is very important al-Jazeera also reported two weeks ago they
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.560]  interviewed a leader in al-Qaeda in Syria and he said that the FSA was
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:02.760]  actually selling them weapons so of course when the US going to give these
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.480]  rebels weapons there it's going to end up in the hands of al-Qaeda and even now
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.440]  they've admitted recently that in an aspect aspen security forum they're
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.120]  actually giving them a wage of $150 a month this came out a few days ago and
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:24.320]  if you check my YouTube channel I also point out that I caught one guy that was
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:29.840]  interviewed by Channel 4 news in the UK an al-Qaeda guy saying he also receives
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.440]  $150 a month so you wonder if it's coming from the same distributor and when
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:42.840]  the EU lifted an oil embargo in Syria in the northern part of Syria where al-Rakha
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:48.160]  actually the group that controls Raka and controls the oil flow is al-Qaeda
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.720]  that's right they've got control of that oil pipeline stay there well that's our
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.560]  government as usual funding al-Qaeda while using them to take all of our

[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.760]  girl joining us with a report on what's happening over there from all her
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.000]  sources has proven very accurate now you see her on Australian international
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.560]  television you know breaking it down but looking at this you know the most
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.120]  important news you've covered the last month or two since we had you on
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.880]  info wars nightly news or on the daily radio show what is most important for
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.440]  people to know about what's happening we had Israel hit Syria and blow up some
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:43.280]  of their defensive missiles the Russians reportedly lost people that were there
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.960]  and they're now threatening Israel I mean we see Israel helping gang up to
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.760]  support handing over that area to the radical Islamists because Israel's
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.600]  allied like the US with Saudi Arabia I mean how is Israel gonna have that fly
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:04.600]  aiding al-Qaeda well with Israel you know the whole agenda of Israel is to cut
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:10.640]  Syria up because you know under Zionism they want to control everything from the
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.320]  Nile to the Euphrates so they see Syria and Iran as you know a rival or a threat
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:22.080]  to their ideology or if Syria wants the occupied land back which is the Golan
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:25.960]  Heights which Israel currently occupies that's a problem for Israel so what's
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.240]  the best idea divide and conquer and the whole agenda even in 2006
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.720]  gondolas arise outlined the project for a new new Middle East and it showed that
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.360]  Iran and Iraq and Syria were divided and Syria and Iraq in particular were
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.760]  divided into threes a south in Iraq's north south and middle north being the
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.120]  Kurdish part and in Syria they wanted and to create an Alawite and Christian
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.360]  coast separate to everything else and you know al-Qaeda's ideology is Wahhabism
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.120]  and some of these people in Wahhabism feel that they cannot tolerate any other
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.160]  religion in the area that they are in and they also think that if there's a
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.760]  majority of Muslims anywhere then that land belongs to them like Pakistanis
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.400]  who are Wahhabi are coming to Syria and saying this is our land Syrians out
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:19.440]  because if they these Syrians aren't you know Wahhabis then they've got to go
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:23.640]  there you can kill them to get them out so they're they're really a colonialist
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:30.480]  that's exactly what it is you know it's it's it's exploiting religion to it's
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.720]  a Muslim it's a Muslim colonist radical Muslim colonists who colonize other
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:39.880]  peaceful Muslim nations and that's why the globalists are funding them because
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.840]  they want to spread radical Islam worldwide as a tool of destabilization
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.680]  unbelievable it's like a reverse crusade you know in sort of speak so like as a
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:56.280]  Muslim it doesn't matter to me if my Syrian friend is a Christian because
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.220]  that we're both Syrian you know we grow we're neighbors we grew up in the same
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:05.600]  land we've got the same kind of mentality in the same culture so of course
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:12.280]  I'm gonna be caring about what happens to my Syrian compatriots more so than you
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.840]  know some foreigner coming to my land to to kill them and again that's the key
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:22.040]  even though you're a Sunni you're not a Wahhabist you're not supporting what's
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:25.360]  happening to Syria because it's a foreign invasion and that's why the
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:32.600]  globalist fun radical Wahhabi Islam is that it is a way to basically attack
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.200]  nation states it's another international arm they use what happens
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:42.920]  and never existed in Syria before this time so it goes to show you how this
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.240]  ideologies been exported into Syria and it doesn't really match with our
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:52.800]  society I mean we've been like this secular for forever since we began
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.320]  seven thousand ten thousand years ago so well I tell you it is a real crime
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.360]  against humanity what do you think of the Peace Prize winner Obama funding
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.080]  al-Qaeda to come in and mass murder men women and children what do you want to
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:12.360]  say to the American people I want to say that I don't like to interfere with
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.800]  people's internal affairs I respect the American people I think they're great
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:22.520]  people but unfortunately the government is way out of line of attacking
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:27.000]  countries all over the place they've been supporting dictatorships they've been
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.480]  supporting apartheid and I think Obama is a traitor to his people and to his
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.920]  country yeah but he's really not an American so he can't be a traitor but
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:40.760]  if he was an American he would be a traitor stay there back in 60 seconds

[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.720]  reporting joins us again from Australia and in a ways they almost become a
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.920]  spokesman for the Syrian people that are under siege now going from the internet
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.640]  speaking out to being on a national international television shows in
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.600]  Australia Europe you name it another testament to taking action so Syrian
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.360]  girl continuing here with any other important points to pass along to
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.520]  people you know first we heard Obama was gonna send in even heavier arms but
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:21.920]  then Congress said hey we vote don't do that because they realized politically
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:25.600]  because we're exposing you're exposing the fact that it's al-qaeda they're
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.640]  gonna get in trouble when al-qaeda uses those heat-seeking missiles and stuff to
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.880]  shoot down Western aircraft or maybe they think we're so dumb that it will
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.440]  become treason to not support al-qaeda and the police will come arrest us if we
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.280]  don't support al-qaeda in America I mean maybe we're that evil I don't know you
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:48.400]  know George Orwell said that in a place or when a police state the police state
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:51.800]  thinks it can just switch the flags of the enemy and nobody's supposed to
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:57.320]  notice and if you notice you're a traitor basically but we know when when
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.240]  Congress says it's worried about weapons getting into the wrong hands they
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:06.440]  don't just mean al-qaeda they actually really mean the Syrian army which is
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.600]  quite possible if they kill the rebels that they will capture the weapons and
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:15.880]  you know let's say that there might be very real turf rivalries between the
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.200]  FSA and al-qaeda but even if these groups start fighting each other al-qaeda
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.280]  will be easily because they're stronger now be able to kill these rebel groups
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:29.920]  and capture these heavier weapons so you know it's they're going to be used
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:33.960]  against capital cities now the only things that haven't been really destroyed
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.680]  and smashed are the capital cities and there will be the absolute decimation
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.840]  of Syria but that's okay for the globalist agenda to take place they
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:50.520]  don't really care about our lives but you know the thing is that they they want
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.360]  to keep things under control because they can't have any group become so
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:58.480]  powerful that they start to have a mind of their own and al-qaeda is part of that
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.040]  because even though the heads of al-qaeda might be controlled by the CIA the low
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.880]  level ones have no idea of this you know they think that they're fighting
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:10.840]  America you know but the most comical thing this my last point would be the
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:16.320]  most comical thing was the suggestion by the insurgents and by David Cameron's
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.360]  government that the weapons can go on loan and will be returned later
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:29.600]  oh and this was said in in British Parliament as like a you know one of
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:35.240]  the things that could happen to prevent groups getting too powerful so wow
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  well it was painful for you having family there to watch all this going on but
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.760]  I mean how long can it go it's what two and a half years now how long can this
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.320]  crime go on now now Obama's talking about stalemate being a victory which I
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.720]  guess means al-qaeda takes over part of the country and they break it up that's
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:54.280]  I think that was a gender from the beginning in fact and as I said you
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.480]  know in 2006 gondolese rice's project for a new Middle East showed exactly the
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:04.440]  map that they wanted to draw up and that is a divided Syria and you know I'd
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:12.200]  rather die than see that happen and you know people are dying so what can I say
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.600]  like half of my family have escaped the country I've still got half the family
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:24.680]  there so hopefully we'll come back and to a unified country and rebuild it that's
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:29.360]  that's what we're hoping for I think it's time to form a militia and just mash
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.680]  everybody and go in there and take out al-qaeda I mean that's already happened
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:39.720]  there's now a national defense force militia that's formed alongside the army
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:45.200]  so what happens is the army advances and the militia holds and militias made up
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.760]  of people from the area that lived there and absolutely but it's time for a human
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:54.040]  wave attacks people just got to get geared up and go in there and take al-qaeda
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.000]  out Syrian girl will talk to you soon I think I want to come back and plug your

[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:28.840]  well we're finishing up with Mimi Elohim known as Syrian girl we first
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:34.160]  heard of getting her on the broadcast in the spring of last year she saw some
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.600]  of her YouTube videos speaking out we already confirmed who she was people
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.920]  said oh that's not a real person from Syria saying all the stuff but now she's
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.160]  gone public in the last six months and been on national television around the
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.600]  world and is who she says she is she has a lot of contacts in Syria her family was
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:54.480]  from the old ruling party there in Syria they don't like the Assad's they left
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.440]  most of them or half of them she's in Australia but still she's against what's
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.160]  happening there because it's al-Qaeda coming in engaging in mass murder and
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:07.720]  our so-called government is running it now again this is important not just do
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.920]  the right thing and get out of Syria the whole narrative of we're taking your
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.920]  rights because the Muslim extremist ladies and gentlemen al-Qaeda is out of
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:20.720]  Saudi Arabia our government is deep in bed with them they help create al-Qaeda
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:25.520]  the British intelligence help create the Wahhabist this is on record and so when
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:29.160]  I go to the TSA and they asked me if I'm a terrorist or whatever I just start
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:31.480]  saying you know our government ships the drugs in you know our government runs
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:35.960]  al-Qaeda and they'll go yeah we know going through or you know at the border
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.520]  they go and in customs when I flew back from England do you have any drugs on
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:45.400]  you and I go no I don't use drugs and I don't have any criminal record you know
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:49.600]  that you just swipe my passport you know the government ships the drugs in they
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:56.480]  go yeah we know get on through I mean it's just like stop going along with
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:01.120]  this whole facade that we're all suspects and oh it's not al-Qaeda now it's the
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.440]  gun owners and the veterans and again when I say 9-11's an inside job criminal
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.480]  elements in our government bare minimum allowed what happened to happen and
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:14.520]  that's been confirmed they're like how dare you traitors say that it's a fact
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.000]  now I wanted to get around just for any closing comments you can follow her at
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.480]  well I'll let her get out the best websites best YouTube's best Facebook's
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:28.680]  for people in closing but I remember like a year ago the Syrian army forced
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.480]  back the sixty-something thousand al-Qaeda forces in one area back into Turkey
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:38.360]  and Turkey for three days opened up with us made howitzer cannons killing them
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:44.520]  I mean that's the type of evil that is going on in Israel's been bombing them
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:48.920]  and people say you're being anti-israel what anti-israel I'd be against al-Qaeda
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.320]  attacking Israel if our government was shipping al-Qaeda into Israel to attack
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:56.840]  them I'd be they were shipping them against South Africa they were shipping
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:04.960]  them in against Russia which they are it's so evil it's so evil so Syrian girl
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:08.880]  give out your different websites and stuff for people and any other closing
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:15.800]  comments thanks a lot I wanted to plug the Syrian electronic army Twitter
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:23.320]  account it's at official underscore C 12 because they've been telling me that
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:27.120]  they've actually found something interesting going through the White
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.400]  House emails which is that the White House openly communicates with Facebook
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:36.840]  and you know that I think that is interesting under the prism context and
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.960]  they're always exposing the NSA and applications on your telephone that spy
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:49.120]  on you such as Viber and Facebook as well so I would plug the official C 12
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:55.080]  that's the Syrian electronic army Twitter and I guess my own YouTube account
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:01.120]  is Syrian girl partisan all one word and I want to thank you a lot for this
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.680]  interview if I can plug anything else it would be my Twitter account partisan
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:12.840]  girl and my Facebook account partisan girl as well and thanks a lot for
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:17.840]  everything you're doing and for fighting for the truth well we are against al-Qaeda
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.480]  here we're very un-American and we tend to not like to attack innocent countries
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.280]  and that are murdering Christians and others in mass we're extremists here on
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:29.400]  the air and you know we're extremists we're informed we try to study issues and
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.640]  I don't think Assad's a good guy just like you don't but the final equation
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.240]  what's happening is I'd say a hundred times worse and it's meant to wreck the
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:43.360]  whole region and just bring in incredible tyranny and I forgot that the
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:49.440]  Syrian electronic army has actually hacked into government channels broken a
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.280]  lot of stuff and is that as Syrians or have you heard or is that Russians going
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:13:00.400]  as the Syrian free army orders or does or or the Syrian electronic army
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:05.720]  excuse me I mean is that group I mean just does the Syrian government have
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:09.960]  have hackers that good they're not even government hackers they're just
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:15.960]  teenage boys so and they're inside Syria and I can vouch for that well tell us
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:22.280]  about that group briefly they're just Syrian patriots who kind of like they're
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:29.440]  very young they're hackers basically and they see that the media is manipulating
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.840]  the truth and that's how the group began to begin with it's just to fight the
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:40.080]  media and it might have grown slightly beyond that but their number one
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:47.760]  priority is just to hijack different media groups like routers and CNN hijack
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.680]  the Twitter accounts their Facebooks and put out like real media and I believe
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:57.800]  they also put out info wars reports so it's kind of a it's called cultural
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:02.080]  jamming what they're really doing and I want to agree with you the Syrian
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.600]  government is corrupt like many governments are but you know they were
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.480]  draconian and people had a reason to be pissed off with the government and
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.320]  unfortunately though foreign agendas took advantage of that to create this
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:19.920]  horrible war and you know a patriotic person has to stand with their country
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:26.040]  in a time of war especially when Israel is constantly throwing rockets at us so
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.080]  which is was completely illegal and the United Nations should step into
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.360]  something like that but they don't amazing absolutely I don't know how
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:37.520]  Israel the people of Israel could go along with this Israel aiding al-Qaeda to
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.800]  try to take your country over and I'm not anti-Israel either it's just
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.480]  absolutely outrageous Syrian girl thank you so much thank you thank you yeah
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:49.520]  truly truly amazing all right shifting gears you saw this article a few days
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:56.520]  ago on info wars.com homeland security is now regulating live entertainment DHS
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:03.400]  demands restaurant owner get permit to play live music that is the type of
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.800]  stuff we're dealing with well now we're going to be talking about this evil

[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.080]  even house chores if they had their way so Obama administration requires magician

[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:49.560]  have so many strange things that they recently took out a yellow and red
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.440]  plastic squeaking device because that that squeaker they thought might scare
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.280]  somebody oh oh so they took that well good I knew there'd be something evil
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.280]  there everything's terrorism but terrorist I that's right yeah everything's bad
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:06.600]  but the bad people trust the government not the people well tell us about the
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:11.000]  magic show you do the name of this rabbit and what happened yes I've been a
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.040]  full-time magician for about 27 years and and I've used rabbits out for 30
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.480]  years probably of course that's a classic thing and a magic show to make a
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:24.600]  live bunny rabbit appear and my wife was a good farm girl and so 30 years ago she
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:28.840]  talked me into getting a rabbit into our magic act it for the first 22 years it's
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:33.320]  been a lot of fun and and kids just get knocked out by the rabbit it's always a
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:38.800]  great memory for them and then back in 2005 I was rudely informed during a
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:44.760]  magic show by a surprised inspector that I needed a license for my rabbit
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:48.360]  absolutely landed the free home of the brave and and now tell us where the
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:53.280]  saga has gone yes so we went so it went from 2005 needing a license for my
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:57.120]  rabbit and paying licensing fees and taking my rabbit to the vet
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.680]  faxing my travel itinerary to the USDA if I'm going to be out of town for more
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.480]  than 48 hours and also thing I especially enjoy is is surprise inspections of my
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.760]  home whenever they'd like to check on the rabbit so that I've been told me to
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:14.840]  do those hoops since about 2005 maybe we said the illegal aliens were rabbits
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:19.200]  the government would do something about them then that's right yeah but that so
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.080]  those requirements were bad enough and then finally about a month ago the
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.440]  latest requirement they decided that was that I needed to have a written
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:31.080]  disaster plan in place for my bunny rabbit well I think the answer is don't
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:34.800]  comply with any of this like everybody else I mean I think of the answer is it's
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:40.160]  all unconstitutional don't do it I've got the Census Bureau now yearly telling
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:43.360]  me to answer hundreds of questions and I just told them that it's called the
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:47.600]  Fifth Amendment they can go jump in the lake yes and you know and if I had to do
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.480]  it over again back in 2005 that's what I would have done I they intimidate you
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:57.560]  they catch it off balance and and they I mean I was had to finish my magic show
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.680]  and I was trying to sign autographs I had little children shaking my hands mom's
[02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:04.760]  taking pictures of me with their kids just having a nice meet and greet
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:08.960]  session and could inspector wait five minutes no she barged through the crowd
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:12.120]  in in front of everyone whipped on a badge and threw it at my face oh yeah
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:16.160]  it's all about the exercise of power and they want to pick the most non-threatening
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:19.840]  non-criminal people because they don't want to go after real criminals I mean
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:22.560]  you know the big banks are getting all that laundered money they don't want to
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:28.320]  mess with that that's right and you know and I've never forgotten how that made
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.680]  me feel that that's showing the embarrassment and then you know the
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:36.360]  problems that it caused me I was working a or a series of libraries all
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:41.360]  across the state of Missouri and through email from one library and the word
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:45.160]  spread that Marty Han might cause a problem if he's at your show and you
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:49.080]  know if I really had to do quite a bit of damage at that cost oh so they try to

[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:25.640]  badge I mean now you'll be out fishing on a pier it's happened to me and they'll
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:29.480]  have a woman in body armor March up and I was just seeing in videos of these
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.400]  online in the day and they'll march over go get me see your ID let me see the
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:35.920]  fishing licenses and I'm getting the point where I'm gonna go talk to me like
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:40.840]  I'm a human being there's only so much I can take from you it's just it's like
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:45.200]  these crazy people all on power trips to get in our business and run our lives
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:49.040]  and if you look at all these regulations and stuff there's not even a law
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:55.320]  most of the time when it comes to a rabbit you use you know and then all
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.440]  the regulations for farming that are written by Big Agra that they're exempt
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.200]  from on record to shut down your business and I would take an hour to go
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.440]  over all the evidence of that but Tyson chicken pioneered that Walmart has
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:12.800]  pioneered that and they want to make it impossible for the little guy and these
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:18.120]  agents only mess with little guys I've seen it all these bureaucrats they are
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:25.480]  told you get those little guys and you shut them down and what do you make now
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.640]  of them see because now that you spoke out it caused a furor and now a week
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.400]  after you speak out boom they say they're holding off on disaster plan
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:42.560]  requirements for animal exhibitors absolutely amazing what's your take on
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:46.520]  that Marty the magician well you know what there's a new sheriff in town and
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:49.760]  it's called social media and thanks to the support of people like you and
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:54.920]  others the story went viral and and I think it's created a huge embarrassment
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:00.800]  for them and so now the law that took seven years to write is now going to be
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:03.640]  reviewed and who knows how long that review is going to take and what will
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:09.320]  ultimately happen but but I'm just pleased that you know sometimes we think
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:13.040]  the little guy thinks that we have no voice but luckily the way thing the
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:16.560]  word works nowadays with the internet maybe we still do have a voice well I
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:21.920]  want to know why somebody shows up with a badge makes a big scene if I was a
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:25.240]  librarian it's like it's over your rabbit not having a license well that's
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.000]  unamerican to make you do something like that and it act rude even if it was
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.360]  reasonable you know I wouldn't send an email out don't work with Marty I mean
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.160]  it's the same deal when the system I mean it's like Amish they'll they'll for a
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.080]  year move in next door to spend a million and a half bucks in one case to show
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:44.720]  them undercover getting them to sell the neighbor milk they didn't want to sell
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:48.040]  them milk it wasn't even illegal to then have them go now I'm gonna sell I'm
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:51.360]  gonna give this to my cousin across state lines the almost didn't know what
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:55.600]  that meant so they could swat team them to create the illusion that the Amish
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.440]  were bad to then sell the idea that Amish are criminals because the USDA
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.440]  wanted to start harassing Amish I mean how would you get the cops to act like
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.960]  that and put on a magic show of their own I mean as an entertainer do you see
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.560]  what I'm saying they're putting on a show as well to act like you're bad and
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:19.840]  why did people buy into that yeah yes luckily luckily my reputation is such
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.160]  that I was able to nip that in the bud and turn things around but I tell you
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.000]  when it comes to these USDA inspectors that you just can't reason with them
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.840]  at all I mean when she when she threw that badge in my face I just kind of
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:35.680]  stammered and said well I can see if I was a guy with four white tigers I might
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.640]  need a permit or something and she waved her finger my face I said you're no
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:42.960]  different than they are and I said one three-pound rabbit is no different than
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:46.600]  four tigers by the way I've read by the way I've read the law I've read the law
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.880]  that's a law on zoos and it's on the transport now they got a pass was big
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:54.360]  animals like tigers you're have it have lawyers told you because from when I
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.880]  looked at it I'm no lawyer but I looked at it that your rabbits really exempt
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:03.120]  yeah according to the USDA my rabbit is not exempt it's funny the rulebook has
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:08.440]  a picture of a orca whale a lion a tiger a bear a dog a cat a hamster and a
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:14.200]  rabbit and those all have the same exact license and I think what's happened is
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.440]  they've hired extra inspectors I have my inspectors told me they've hired more
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:22.040]  inspectors and I believe they don't have enough work to do so they've dropped
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.200]  down to lower level people like me well they're not allowed to go after the big
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:30.200]  guys Tyson chicken I remember it was in the associated press back in 97 would
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.320]  have thousands of violations at one facility and I'm getting trouble a
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.040]  smaller plant would have one and they shut them down and arrest them mm-hmm and
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:44.240]  you know why Tyson Tyson chicken ran Clinton that's right unbelievable well
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:49.360]  it's time to only support mom and pops whenever you can it's time to go eat

[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.600]  organic just when you have over a hundred ingredients in there it is a hell
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:30.320]  to be able to have the suppliers have it put together and always have it USDA
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:34.520]  certified so they went through a whole other process and a different factory
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.520]  because the factory can't have anything in it that's GMO or not organic and
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:42.840]  and and literally took two years basically in a facility building their
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.000]  own new factory to bring you this that it's the only one out there you're gonna
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.440]  find where it has this many ingredients and they're all organic

[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:52.280]  Knight said yesterday who's been helping a honcho this contest for me the last
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:57.240]  few months General Electric had a year last year with a hundred thousand
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:59.880]  dollar contest we're gonna do another one too it'll probably be a year next
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:05.120]  time because that's a great way to do it but I wanted to do this to see what got
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:09.800]  produced and then to out of that body of people find folks to work with on
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:12.840]  info wars films that I've been wanting to launch forever because I'm just too
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:18.320]  busy to make films and I want to be able to be a producer and maybe a co-writer
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:23.880]  perhaps on some documentaries or even fiction films but I don't have time in
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:27.320]  amongst everything else to just sit there and do it because I want to make
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:30.560]  really good films which I can do but with the time I've got I've got to
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:34.400]  literally not see my children to do it I mean make an Obama deception to
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:39.120]  especially now I'm gonna be seeing my children maybe half a day a week and
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:42.360]  when I'm around them anyways I'm already thinking about work or and I've got so
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:46.040]  much other stuff devil darts as I call them little things going on that have
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:50.640]  to deal with just please pray for this operation it is a literal miracle that
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.840]  we're still on the air it is a literal miracle that I'm not dead it is a
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:59.080]  miracle that info wars has been able to do this and we are under demonic attack
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:03.760]  make no mistake even don't believe in God just the mindset of the corrupt
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:08.280]  world you see what's happening all over the place society is degenerating and
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:12.160]  we try to stand up for those that love liberty and stand up for freedom we
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:15.800]  hope you'll stand right beside us and support us as well and this is a pure
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:19.560]  research project we've done where you can say what you want about info wars
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:24.320]  com or Alex Jones or my crew a diverse crowd of really hard-working people and
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:27.760]  by diverse I mean their mindsets their understandings their talents that they
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:32.960]  bring to the game of liberty and life and awakening the sleeping giant that is
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:39.240]  America and is the world with the spirit of Paul Revere but it's a great
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:42.480]  responsibility we have being right at the tip of the spear and you're right
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.320]  there with us when you support us and David Knight tell us about some of
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.080]  these other honorable mentions and then I'll let you announce who the second
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:57.680]  place winner here is for ten thousand dollars yesterday was third place
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:01.280]  announcement with political earth today will be second place tomorrow the one
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.080]  hundred thousand dollar grand prize David Knight reporter for info wars
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.480]  nightly news and formerly a contestant who lost on the reporter contest but you
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:13.200]  were a runner-up that's right you know it was very difficult to decide these as
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:17.680]  we've said every time because you've got such a wide diversity of topics and
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.520]  approaches and they just did a great job and it's even harder to pick something
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:26.320]  to put on the radio because so many of these things are really good visually
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:29.800]  and they of course the really good ones are going to tie in things visually with
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:34.840]  the dialogue but I pulled in a couple of these things to show just a about one
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.960]  minute excerpts from a couple of these films but there's some really excellent
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:44.360]  films like clandestine game over beta test 2027 that I don't have a clip for
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:47.960]  those yet to to run today and they may not work on the radio but you know we're
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:50.880]  promoting these things on the nightly news we're promoting it on our website
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:57.000]  and of course the entire online virtual film festival is at YouTube so that was
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.400]  the really that big plan and by the way these things are going from 10,000 to
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:07.920]  50,000 to 100,000 to 200,000 to 300,000 to 400,000 to 500,000 to 600,000 you can
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:11.760]  just see so many of these 600 films are really growing and we'll just have
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.240]  lives of their own to influence people to wake them up it's beautiful that's
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:18.960]  right we want to help people to find an audience we want to help them to get
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:22.720]  their films out in front of people to tell their story to wake people up so
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.280]  we've got films that even like this very first one horse meat it was not
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.360]  something that they went out and shot a lot of films with but they did very good
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:33.160]  research very good editing it's got great content and it's about abortion and
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:39.000]  a different approach about abortion we got a clip of that right now they sell
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:44.160]  baby body parts that's what it's all about yeah you're giving the initial
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:49.160]  fee for the abortion and they make a little bit off of that but they make
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:52.600]  their real money from the baby body part Korean customs officials say the
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:57.680]  first case of someone trying to import the so-called human flesh capsules to
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:02.400]  South Korea arose in August last year since then they say there have been
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.280]  35 cases of people either trying to bring the capsules in through airports
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:13.640]  into South Korea or sending them via post from various areas in China they
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:19.520]  sell the eyes for about a thousand dollars a pair they sell the brain for
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:28.960]  about 2,000 dollars they sell the heart the lungs the liver the kidneys and they
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:36.080]  even sell the arms and the legs they're selling your aborted baby your own flesh
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:41.520]  and blood unbelievable you think about that this is something that people don't
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:46.480]  usually hear about it's hidden in the industry they don't want you to know
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.880]  about this and they use this kind of terminology one-time medical termination
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:55.600]  one-time it only takes one time to a born a child
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:08.120]  and you know they're really smart because all people don't care about horse meat
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:11.680]  they don't care about dead babies and they don't that's why as women learn
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:18.680]  this last late last month to bioethicist dr. Alberto you believe and then we're
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:22.080]  playing a little bit more but people could see the full film up at Operation
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.960]  Paul Revere give them the name again horse meat and babies that's Edward
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.640]  Grecov info wars.com forward slash Paul to find it and then they point out people
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.320]  care about horse meat but not about babies basically and here's the deal
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.160]  they're getting upwards of ten thousand dollars per baby for your baby so you
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:42.560]  think oh I'm getting to kill my baby for three thousand dollars or at a fancy
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.120]  clinic as low as a hundred dollars at some of the city-funded ones or whatever
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:52.240]  if they think you think it's expensive they'll charge you thousands but in a
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:55.840]  lot of countries they're actually paying women who figured this out to come in
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:00.800]  and so that's you know that's pretty good money folks sell your own child you
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:06.440]  pay them 300 bucks and then they sell it for ten thousand dollars so they can use
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:11.120]  it for medical experiments whatever this is this is absolutely abhorrent but it
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:14.800]  it just shows how dehumanized we've got oh yeah absolutely and there was a
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:19.440]  special report that Leanne McAdoo did last week about organs being taken out
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:23.480]  of Chinese prisoners and the tie-in with these body exhibits that are going
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:26.440]  around the plasticized bodies that that's that turns out they're fall-on gong
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:30.160]  that's right now with our next one here is called a dear
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:34.520]  Jiabo and it's about a fellow who's imprisoned by the New World Order and
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:43.320]  he's writing a letter to his son dear Jiabo my son I write you this letter as
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:50.400]  a final testament to truth I've known I write you this letter to save a dangerous
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:56.360]  history they will do everything in their power to suppress but more my son I
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:05.200]  write you this letter so you may know why I have been away and shall not return I
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:12.560]  had always lived as a simple man I never interfered I minded my own business but
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:18.960]  that was another life that was before the calling every drop of time pushes the
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.480]  thoughts of the calling further to the front of my mind every damn I construct
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:37.120]  gives way soon that's a pretty powerful film again we're just teasing you with
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:44.200]  these go to the site see you at info wars.com for slice Paul a little bit
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:48.000]  lighter than these last two and what would an info wars contest me without
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.480]  something with Star Wars and this is called night trials and basically the
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:56.560]  way this is set up it's kind of a quasi-animated live-action film and it's
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.760]  a Jedi who's reporting back to his master he's been sent to America to look
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:04.920]  at land of the free and he's reporting back what he sees all right here it is
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:12.080]  master apprentice report I'm confused for my trials I was sent to the United
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:16.840]  States of America to experience the wonders of a true democracy you were
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:21.960]  what is the issue there is much to tell of behind you apprentice no need to worry
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:27.000]  it is just a zombie a zombie yes master a large portion of the population has
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.080]  become so however it will not harm me as long as I refrain from forming an
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.480]  intelligent thought what the total surveillance grid tracked me and I was
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:40.400]  stopped at a roadside checkpoint is that legal I was unlawfully searched
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.040]  resulting in another weapon seizure apprentice watch out it's okay master
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:50.360]  just a gang defend yourself now I should that will result in my arrest it is
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:54.040]  better to give them what they want the gangs in the illegal seem to have more
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:01.640]  rights than the law-abiding citizens with the checkpoint mind rub these cards
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:05.240]  seem to have been exposed to the same mind-numbing tactics as the civilians
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:10.840]  why would someone poison their own force because they will be next explain I
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:16.720]  was surveilled by a drone on manned aircraft they're a thousand patrol in
[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:22.400]  the sky they are also planning to defeat the Republic via the economy the
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:26.080]  corporations have gone unchecked they have the rights of people and money
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:31.120]  equals free speech the elected officials have been purchased indeed
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  operating under the guise of a two-party system and serving corporate and
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:39.440]  banker interest while crushing the public with fraudulent debt resulting in a
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:45.480]  reduction in quality of life have you tracked this source of evil I have there
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:49.320]  are many heads to the serpent I confronted a dark lord I am unsure
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:53.840]  whether it was the master or the apprentice and the rest of films really
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:56.760]  powerful that's great and again give folks the name of that again that's
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:01.960]  night trials no relation but spell the same way it was it was fun to do stuff
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.400]  like that and he covered a lot of different issues and he did it in an
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:09.720]  entertaining way and you know it's good to have the real meat documentaries out
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:13.960]  there and to cover the issues very carefully we want to show that there's
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:16.840]  other approaches to that are going to work with different types of people so
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:19.800]  there's something like this there's a whole spectrum where you can get people
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:23.960]  involved and get them to absolutely now I'm gonna do some overdrive today so I
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:29.880]  get to these callers that are patiently holding Frank and and Martin and Sean

[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:10.040]  hundred thousand dollar winner tomorrow briefly shifting gears what do you make
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.840]  of Bradley Manning being found not guilty of aiding a foreign enemy but
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:19.120]  found guilty of espionage and now facing decades in prison well I think
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:23.560]  that's a real travesty I think as you mentioned before he didn't harm the
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.880]  security of America what he did was enhance the integrity of government by
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:30.760]  exposing what a lot of these political leaders like you mentioned the quote
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:34.920]  from Henry Kissinger that was that was brought out that the illegal we do right
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.640]  away the unconstitutional takes a little bit longer he made the criminals
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:42.240]  uncomfortable exactly hurt their security exactly you know there's a
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:45.100]  distinction there has to be a distinction made between Bradley Manning and
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:49.600]  Snowden who are exposing the criminal actions and look at how the government
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:53.000]  reacts always saying well we've got to tighten things down we got to stop these
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.600]  leakers they don't want to go after the criminals and you've had a former
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:00.520]  senator from New Hampshire speak out about that and say he write a letter to
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:04.600]  Snowden saying how disappointed he was that there's no talk being made of
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.400]  changing procedures exactly the people broke the law I mean they're speaking
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:13.240]  out about crimes the government's committing their heroes and they spin
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:17.360]  it around like they're the bad guys but no other presidents ever went after you
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:22.520]  if you leak something and they expose criminal actions you got awards under
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:27.480]  Nixon under Bush under Clinton now you go to prison but it's okay because Obama's
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:32.240]  black see he can bomb you and he gets a peace price it's it's the triumph of
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:37.400]  fake liberal packaging it's really sickening authoritarianism no absolutely
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:40.800]  it's just amazing it's like exposing somebody that's committed murder and
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.080]  then they say well we gotta make sure that people don't have a way to do that
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:47.240]  anymore well they're saying we're gonna kill you under national security and of
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:50.120]  our own people blow the whistle they're gonna go to jail yeah so as long as it's
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:53.560]  national security they can take your bank account they can kill you they can
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:58.000]  put cancer viruses in your vaccine it's called authoritarianism we'll be back

[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:23.880]  right without further ado drumroll please the second place winner of the
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:28.080]  Operation Paul Revere contest well let me read you the description here because
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.320]  we're just talking about drones it says haunted by a mission gone wrong u.s.
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:35.120]  drone sensor operator begins to feel suspicious about drone warfare and the
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:38.360]  implications that can have on freedom domestically when his suspicions turn
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:44.280]  into reality he's forced to act this is from yo-han a due to Detroit I hope I
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:47.200]  pronounce his name correctly it's American drone and we got a clip of that
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:57.360]  right now all right here it is the drone is about to bomb a family for radio
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:15.720]  in the shed permission to prosecute did we get a PID on the target copy master
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:22.560]  armed sensor you ready establishing track track established copy launching
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:27.840]  hellfire three two one rifle
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:34.080]  in back in 10 seconds
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:44.400]  now they see a little child and now the drone operator child what's that
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:55.320]  is that a kid I guess we just killed a kid ground command did you see this
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:57:02.240]  ground command did you see that major we did play back confirms it was a goat
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:05.880]  I repeat it was a goat
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:15.960]  here's a purple heart yeah that's right and you catch that little play on words
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:20.320]  there they said we killed a kid and they go it was a goat absolutely because the
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:25.200]  kid is a baby goat now that's a really well done film great acting great shots
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:30.800]  great storyline it touches on the drone kill list it touches on pts and he's
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:34.640]  and he's number two but he probably would have got first place if his film
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:39.040]  the futurist would have not have been made before the contest yeah and that's on
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.640]  our YouTube channel it's amazing honorable mention he made that back in
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:46.800]  September and he couldn't get that on any film festivals they would not play
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:51.160]  that and it only had a thousand viewers on his YouTube yeah it's called the
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:55.040]  futurist it's on our YouTube channel we posted this morning on info wars comm
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:59.520]  it's in the newsfeed area get the futurist and get it out to everybody it's
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:03.160]  also on the Paul Revere site so ten thousand dollars you are the winner of
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:06.520]  ten thousand of course after the feds take it you're the winner of six thousand
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:10.600]  that'll be sent four thousand to foreign banks that's right so sorry that's
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.760]  how it works but it's a great film he touched on a lot of things he touched on
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:16.920]  whistleblowers he touched on the prosecution of journalists not just
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:21.120]  the drone war and yeah because that's a clip of the film and we did some
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:23.400]  clipping that's why it looks right like bad edits because we were just getting
[02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:29.080]  ready for the show right but go see it excellent film the drone film give him
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:32.440]  the name it's American drone and it's the winner and they also made the

[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:51.920]  appreciate you take my call and I want to be sincere when I tell you this that
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:57.960]  my whole family they pray for you and your family and and all your crew and
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:04.760]  we appreciate everything you do brother I appreciate you well you know I just I
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:08.920]  just had to shout it out there I I have a couple comments are one about the
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:16.600]  Bradley Bradley Manning verdict and a very short story I thought you would be
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:23.520]  interested in that happened to me yesterday but the thing that that really
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:31.280]  bothers me about the Bradley Manning verdict today I really think that the
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:37.440]  that the DOJ kind of put themselves in a trick bag with this and I'll explain
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:47.040]  why Eric Holder he sent a letter to Putin saying that that Snowden would be
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:53.160]  treated fairly and and everything would be great if he came back to the US and
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:02:01.440]  you see a verdict like this and and then you see a deal via public relations
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:08.440]  videos saying everybody has to come out with the truth because alternative
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:14.960]  media is is getting assignments and but what's interesting about the the public
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:23.640]  relations video my take on it it's very contradictory because it's saying you
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:30.960]  know we want the truth but from today's verdict we're going to prosecute anyone
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:37.200]  who tries to expose the true no I agree with you it is a scion but it is it
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:40.560]  shows they're collapsing if they're having to go we know you know we're
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:46.760]  liars but we promise we'll be truthful now it was more about internal morale
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:51.120]  because the average person in psyops thinks they're manipulating things for
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:54.560]  a greater good now they know that's not true and it doesn't matter how many
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:58.560]  robots or combat drones they've got once they've lost the moral authority a
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:04.680]  tyranny cannot continue unless you're carrying on a Roman extermination model
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:08.720]  and many ancient cultures did this where they're going to just kill most people
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:13.440]  and that's what Brzezinski wrote in his book that came out this year he said I
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:17.000]  forget the exact quote you can search it and it comes up it was it was quoted
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.440]  newspapers it used to be you know the time has now come where it's less
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:26.800]  expensive to kill a million people than to convince them and he goes on to say
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:31.080]  we can't convince them anymore we got a look at killing everybody and people are
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:35.560]  like that sounds crazy this guy's crazy I didn't say that Brzezinski said that
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:42.000]  people better figure this out he helped orchestrate the come out Rouge and
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.320]  Bragg and wrote two books I've read in the closer public about I couldn't fund
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:50.440]  the camera Rouge to kill you know three million people but I don't know I couldn't
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:54.360]  fund them but I let another group fund them or something like that you know he
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:59.040]  brags that like you're like I didn't oh I forget the exact quote or something like
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:05.040]  I I I won't kill three million people and America won't but we'll fund the
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:09.280]  come out Rouge to do it basically I mean you can go look that stuff up and it's
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:14.040]  all these little games they play but great points Frank anything else yes
[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:19.760]  well I think it validates Snowden's concern about coming back to the US I
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:25.560]  really do and and and I hope you can you know it takes all this into account
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:32.600]  especially today and it's easy you know you know he's got some valid points but
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:40.400]  I want to give you a quick story if I could and this is kind of off topic but
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:46.040]  I have two small children I have a 10 year old and I have a 15 year old two
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:52.240]  daughters and yesterday I took them to my dentist hold on don't hang up don't hang

[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:25.400]  anymore let's go to Frank in Michigan Frank you're on the air sir you were
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:28.440]  trying to tell the story about taking your children to the dentist go go ahead
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:34.520]  yes sir I I took my my two daughters to the dentist yesterday for a basic
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:39.480]  checkup and yeah it's just a basic checkup and they wanted to give them
[03:09:39.480 --> 03:09:46.560]  fluoride treatments and I told them absolutely not I'm not allowing it and
[03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:52.440]  you're not going to do it all of a sudden when I when I rose this up I
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:58.080]  probably had six people come to the front desk telling me that this is
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:01.960]  something that has to be done and you know it's great for their teeth and
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:06.520]  promotes do oh no no they do that with vaccines and fluoride you know my dad's
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:10.840]  a dentist and if somebody wants one he'll give him one and it's actually true
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:16.120]  that topically every once in a while fluoride actually gets into the teeth
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:19.120]  and can harden them but when you do it internally and then the American
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:22.320]  Medical Association and American Civil Association now admit this for seven
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:26.840]  years it actually causes dental fluorosis and in development of children a
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:30.880]  chockiness to the teeth because it it overdoes it plus the type they put in
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:38.080]  the water is the toxic hydrofluorosilic sodium fluoride not the calcium
[03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:41.800]  fluoride like beyond Tangy tangerine I don't think it says it on the label but
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:45.720]  it's got some you know microscopic amounts of calcium fluoride which you
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:49.120]  actually need you need some of the naturally occurring forms in just
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:55.720]  super microscopic amounts of things like arsenic, apples and the seeds in them
[03:10:55.720 --> 03:11:00.560]  have a cyanide based system that's why they say take the different type of plant
[03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:04.640]  seeds like cherry pits they turn those into an anti-cancer drug that actually
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:10.240]  works because it's got us an organic molecule associated with cyanide that
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:15.040]  kills fast-growing cells so there's a lot of stuff there but overall they
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:19.440]  got fluoride mandated what 20-something years ago in Canada for I'm telling you
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:23.320]  for an informational for new audiences and the guy got it promoted saying you
[03:11:23.320 --> 03:11:28.400]  need some regular fluoride he didn't know it was the toxic fluoride so now that
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.560]  famous dentist that got it passed in in Canada has been against it the last few
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:36.000]  years that's why it's getting repealed all over Canada but go ahead so they
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.720]  come over and start saying you got to do this you got to do this what happens
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:42.800]  next and I said well you know I'll tell you what because I kind of prepared for
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:47.560]  this so I already had one of your YouTube videos set up and I said well I
[03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:51.240]  want you to watch this and then you tell me whether or not I should do this to my
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:56.400]  kids so I play the short video is about a five minute video about about
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:03.880]  fluoridation and you know dealing with fluoride treatments and it completely
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:08.200]  counteracted everything they were trying to tell me the funny part was
[03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:14.040]  there was about 10 people in the waiting room and they all were listening to it
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:17.880]  and there you go and if we would all just do that we'd win in a matter of
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:23.000]  months if we all got loud in public or just gave people informationals or gave
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:28.400]  them info or magazines or played them videos if not mine somebody else's with
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:32.920]  medical doctors you know talking about fluoride and again there's always a
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:37.680]  grain of truth to it if you didn't have some calcium fluoride in your diet you
[03:12:37.680 --> 03:12:42.520]  will end up getting degenerative diseases and dying so you do need some
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:47.560]  fluoride but not hundreds and hundreds of times what the recommended dose is
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:55.000]  and not the wrong kind from chemical plants I mean it's amazing well so yeah
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.520]  before I did were treating my children with so I was very leery about so once
[03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:04.240]  I played this and people in the waiting room started hearing it they're like hey
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:08.880]  wait a minute my kids are supposed to get that today hey wait a minute no we
[03:13:08.880 --> 03:13:13.360]  don't want that either so there's somebody people that came up to the desk
[03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:19.480]  and said uh-uh we're not doing this either well I remember I remember when
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:25.000]  I was in kindergarten and my dad had just graduated from dental school I remember
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:29.560]  that and I remember they would give us little red pills a few times a year as a
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:34.040]  fluoride treatment to put in our mouth and suck on and I remember always my
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:39.760]  mom picking me up after school and it's silver super beetle they had and and
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:43.440]  you know Volkswagen and I remember whenever I would get those like not
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:47.720]  being able to walk falling down my mother having to come get me one time I
[03:13:47.720 --> 03:13:52.360]  mean how obvious is that and I was like oh red candy here let me suck on that
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:58.160]  boom throwing up on the ground an hour later God bless you sir good job that's
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:01.800]  an exciting phone call right there Martin in Illinois oh by the way on the

[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:44.360]  taking away and and disregarded to the point where even petitioning in this

[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:56.000]  what a screwed up person does he want to live in a country like that don't they
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:59.440]  get when they do something to us they do it to themselves don't they understand
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:06.200]  that I don't I don't think they care that the police officer I talked to you
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:10.280]  today I've been standing in front of a post office I'm the city sidewalk where
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:16.640]  I'm well within my first member right petition they've they've approached me
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:22.600]  three times in the last two days to check my ID to check to make sure I don't
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:28.120]  have warrants ask me what I'm petitioning for why I'm here if I'm paid or if
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:33.000]  I'm a volunteer and the guy earlier I talked to you this morning that
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:38.240]  approached me the officer he told me that he said look I don't care if it's
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:42.040]  within your rights or not he said I'll arrest you and throw you in jail and
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:46.760]  you'll sit there tonight tomorrow the judge can decide if I'm wrong or not but
[03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:50.920]  it's still gonna cost you a day in jail see I didn't even know you called about
[03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:57.280]  this did we screen your call yes now we don't screen calls what do you call
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:02.960]  having your call screened well yeah he asked me what I was calling oh yeah if
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:06.000]  you volunteer that you could put it on the screen but but screening calls is
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:12.680]  they don't let you on air we let you on air oh yes yes let me just give you a
[03:17:12.680 --> 03:17:17.080]  radio lingo according to radio we you could call it lightly screen but it's
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:20.520]  mainly what's your name where you're calling from and then if you want to say
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:24.320]  your issue we put you on air okay and I guess earlier today I did say it was
[03:17:24.320 --> 03:17:27.120]  about Bradley Manning but nobody did what they were nobody called in about
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:30.640]  what I said so I guess today we kind of screen calls when it's we don't screen
[03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:33.360]  calls according to industry standards you know where you call in and they go
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:35.920]  okay well thank you we've got enough from that view today and they hang up on
[03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:38.840]  you that's normal call screening is where they get what they want put it on
[03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:42.680]  air my point is I didn't know you were gonna come on and tell this story when
[03:17:42.680 --> 03:17:48.760]  I just told my Illinois story before you did it just shows how the police
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:53.480]  coming houses now in Illinois without warrants and it's super creepy anything
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:59.440]  else sir so how did that end up they told me he'd see me again tomorrow and if
[03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:04.800]  I didn't see him I'd see another police officer so it's so you've got and so I
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:10.640]  guess you left rather than be arrested um no he said he said oh I think you're
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:15.000]  within your rights I guess you're okay today but it'll be different tomorrow
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:19.680]  we'll be out here tomorrow to do the same thing again if it's not me it'll be
[03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:26.360]  another police officer I've been kicked out of the state DMV here I was in the
[03:18:26.360 --> 03:18:29.960]  parking lot they told me it was a it was state-owned property but I was not
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:35.200]  allowed to petition on state-owned property and if I wanted to petition I
[03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:39.120]  could petition on their front sidewalk and that was it the front sidewalk the
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:43.560]  front entrance to this whole building is closed down so they basically told me
[03:18:43.560 --> 03:18:48.360]  no no no the only crime in America is being a good American I appreciate your
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:51.120]  call and speaking of that let's look at England and we're gonna go to Brandt
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:56.760]  come back with more calls police let Gypsy family stay in couples 30,000
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:19:01.000]  pound that's over $50,000 stolen basically Winnebago you know travel
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:06.200]  trailer a couple whose 30,000 pound dream caravan was stolen and we told the
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:09.240]  police have no powers to remove the Gypsy family now living in it because it
[03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:15.720]  breached their human rights Kathleen McLean and her partner Michael Curry
[03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:21.080]  bought it with their savings a 26 foot long Bailey Louisiana camper and a
[03:19:21.080 --> 03:19:26.840]  further $10,000 knitting it out before it was stolen by thieves from a Hampshire
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:32.880]  village 10,000 pounds and that was done a while back and they're just told the
[03:19:32.880 --> 03:19:40.360]  gypsies can stay in it now now now my issue for bringing this up is that now
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:44.680]  in England they're saying let Gypsies are allowed to rob you it's their culture
[03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:51.120]  and then if you say that's a bad culture because it's so trendy then you get
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:54.920]  arrested for hate speech so I want to say I think the gypsies should be able to
[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:58.480]  kill them and their whole family and bathe in their blood we'll be right back

[03:25:52.760 --> 03:26:01.840]  action is as a const as constitutional Patriots absolutely also last week they
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:09.040]  there was the vote in the house in Washington for the refunding of door
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:17.000]  to continued funding of NDA a I called both my congressperson sherry boost
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:20.840]  those that's the 17th district he called your Congress critter sir is the
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:25.840]  proper name for them call him whatever you want but I do these things and I
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:31.120]  also called Aaron shock 18th congressional district he's not my
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:36.640]  buddies are Republican what I found interesting was when I checked neither
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:46.240]  one of them voted on that on that on that refunding or reauthorization and I do
[03:26:46.240 --> 03:26:52.400]  these things because we have to continue to build a case against these
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:57.800]  criminals and they are criminals and I have no doubt about it oh yeah no you're
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:01.840]  right you need to get them all on record I'm glad the house voted to keep

[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:12.280]  yeah on record there there are those who voted against it and those who voted for
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:15.800]  it and these two that I just mentioned didn't even show up they didn't even
[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:19.160]  suit up or show up for the game so you want to find out if they supported it or
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:24.920]  not no they didn't they didn't vote no I understand so you wanted to get where
[03:27:24.920 --> 03:27:34.160]  they stood yeah oh yeah but you know of course they denied me that anyway I also
