[00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:10.982]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:12.563]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:14.103]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:18.305]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:22.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:30.749]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:37.054]  I'm David Knight, your host live here in Austin on this Friday, November 21st, 2014.
[00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:40.757]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be co-hosting with me from the UK.
[00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:42.438]  We've got some interesting guests today.
[00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:47.242]  We've got Paul Craig Roberts who's going to be talking to us about some international issues and the economy.
[00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:53.888]  And we have a guest, Eric Rush, author of the book, Negrophilia from Slave Block to Pedestal.
[00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:57.851]  That's an important thing to look at right now as we're waiting for this verdict in Ferguson.
[00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:07.697]  One of the articles that we have on Infowars right now, rioters to target whites, quote, you will never be safe, not you, not your children.
[00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:09.418]  See, that's the issue.
[00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:15.322]  The issue is what started out, and we've seen this over and over again, not just in Ferguson, but in so many places.
[00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.563]  I remember when this first broke as news.
[00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:23.327]  It was yet another case of the police shooting somebody when their life was not in danger.
[00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:24.468]  I still believe that's the case.
[00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:30.214]  Yet, you have this issue of an epidemic of police violence.
[00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:31.335]  Many people have spoken out on it.
[00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:33.958]  We're going to have a quote from Frank Serpico.
[00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:41.166]  I'm sure many of you, pretty much all of you, know him from the movie Serpico, but he spoke out and said that essentially
[00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:42.842]  We're good to go.
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.933]  Out of control, unchecked police violence.
[00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:18.390]  But of course, they were able to take what could have been a thoughtful look at the situation, something that both sides could come together on, white and black, could take a look at this and see that although this is something that is affecting black people more than it is white people, it is affecting everybody now.
[00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.092]  This is a true epidemic.
[00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:28.115]  They just had in the Albuquerque Police Department a memo, a course that's being put out on killology.
[00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.736]  We see them talking about puppieside because they're killing so many dogs.
[00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:39.039]  They're killing everyone and all they have to do is say, I feel that I was threatened and they're given a pass.
[00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:46.322]  We could have a real discussion about how we get control of our government, get control of the police, but instead
[00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:52.546]  They turned it into a racial paradigm, trying to turn it into a race war.
[00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:57.189]  And now we see also that they're reinforcing the fear of the police.
[00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:07.697]  The police have been told for a long time by Homeland Security, by the federal government, they've been told that they're in a war, that they need to fight back, that they're going to have to shoot first and keep shooting.
[00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:11.559]  And all this does is underscore that.
[00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:19.305]  This is going to basically further entrench this kind of war mentality when they're threatening the police, saying, we're going to come to your house.
[00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:20.986]  We're going to come and get you.
[00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:23.208]  That's not the right way to approach this.
[00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.169]  We need to get control of the police.
[00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.910]  There needs to be accountability.
[00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.513]  Frank Serpico had some really good points to make in the Politico article.
[00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:32.254]  We'd love to get him on.
[00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:34.015]  He's been on with Alex Jones many times.
[00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:34.936]  He's difficult to find.
[00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.457]  But that's the real issue.
[00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:39.978]  But instead they're going to make it into a race war.
[00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:42.359]  So we have reporters that are there on the scene.
[00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.141]  Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs are going to be giving us updates on what is happening.
[00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.363]  The threats, the build-up and anticipation of today, the grand jury meeting.
[00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:57.507]  We believe that they're going to, everyone believes that they're going to come across with their verdict today.
[00:03:57.507 --> 00:04:04.330]  And of course, Darren Wilson, the police officer who did the shooting, is going to possibly resign.
[00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.032]  I guess that's going to be their olive branch of peace that they're going to make out there.
[00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:11.834]  I think going to address the problem.
[00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:18.598]  They let this thing run for a very long time before they brought out any evidence that would justify what he did.
[00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:25.902]  I think that was a deliberate effort by the government to move this into a race war.
[00:04:25.902 --> 00:04:32.546]  So we're going to be talking to our reporters there in Ferguson, and as I said, we're going to be talking to Eric Rusch on Negrophilia.
[00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:35.548]  Now there's a lot of reactions today to Obama's
[00:04:36.448 --> 00:04:38.072]  Amnesty speech yesterday.
[00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:42.821]  We're going to be talking about the reactions that people had to that and we're going to talk about what that really means.
[00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.262]  Stay with us.
[00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:45.867]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:03.855]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:08.136]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.896]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:17.758]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:17.758 --> 00:05:18.898]  But for how long?
[00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:21.118]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:25.539]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.400]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.360]  Just won't quit.
[00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:34.536]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:40.941]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:50.328]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:01.367]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:06.349]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.010]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.053]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:16.053 --> 00:06:19.034]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:19.034 --> 00:06:21.995]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:24.016]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.857]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:32.659]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.180]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.181]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:46.583]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:49.804]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:06:59.997 --> 00:07:01.318]  The experts are clear.
[00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:08.443]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:07:08.443 --> 00:07:14.707]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:14.707 --> 00:07:22.673]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:07:22.673 --> 00:07:27.696]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:07:27.956 --> 00:07:28.977]  Not our iodine.
[00:07:28.977 --> 00:07:35.342]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:14.968]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:19.131]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:26.766]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:30.508]  I'm David Knight in Austin, joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[00:08:30.508 --> 00:08:37.051]  Now, of course, last night was the amnesty speech that Obama gave, giving people permission to stay.
[00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:42.214]  Not necessarily making them citizens, but basically giving them the right to stay as long as they wish.
[00:08:42.214 --> 00:08:44.715]  And we've seen how this works out in many cases.
[00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:50.298]  We've had a measure in Illinois to allow people who aren't citizens to vote.
[00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:59.522]  We know that with the deferred action that was done for children, the DACA program, he allowed people up to the age of 31 to stay.
[00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:09.125]  And not only that, but to get free education benefits, to go to universities with an in-state tuition, in many cases a full ride.
[00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.946]  I mean, we're the ones who are paying for this.
[00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:12.867]  I look at one of the immigration groups.
[00:09:14.057 --> 00:09:19.239]  Casa, they say, was a major immigrant rights group that was based in Maryland and Virginia.
[00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:24.180]  They were planning three screening parties last night to watch this announcement.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:31.263]  When I looked at that, Casa, you know, it's like mi casa, su casa, you know, my house is your house, except it's the other way around, isn't it?
[00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:36.466]  They're essentially saying to the American people, su casa, mi casa.
[00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:38.527]  Your house is my house.
[00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:42.049]  I'm coming to live with you, and there's nothing you're going to do about it.
[00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:45.110]  And that's essentially what Obama has done for them.
[00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:53.975]  Paul, they're saying that it's 11 million people that they believe are possibly here illegally at this point, and they're only going to extend
[00:09:56.818 --> 00:09:59.601]  Who's counting these people?
[00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:01.403]  They don't have any idea how many people are here.
[00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:07.069]  He's created a massive entitlement program as well as incentivizing further illegal immigration.
[00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:09.147]  Well, exactly.
[00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:12.670]  I mean, they always underplay the numbers that are most embarrassing to them.
[00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.593]  They underplay the jobs numbers on a routine basis, so who knows how many illegals are here.
[00:10:17.593 --> 00:10:25.098]  But as you said, they had the screening parties, the celebrations in the Mexican restaurants, and what they're all saying, the message is,
[00:10:25.738 --> 00:10:27.498]  This is only the beginning.
[00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:29.379]  The fight begins here.
[00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:34.340]  They want the welfare, they want the medical benefits, and they want the voting rights.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.840]  This is only the start, David.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.020]  Oh yeah, of course it only begins here.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.201]  We've been through all this before.
[00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:46.542]  We saw this back when Reagan did it in 1986, and that was going to be just allow the people who are already here to stay.
[00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:50.303]  They've got ties here, so just grant them the ability to stay.
[00:10:50.303 --> 00:10:51.023]  We'll fix the
[00:10:51.523 --> 00:10:55.224]  Well, exactly, and then, you know, there's the constitutional perspective, which is key as far as I'm concerned.
[00:10:55.224 --> 00:10:57.465]  I think Pat Buchanan nailed it in his article today.
[00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.816]  He said future presidents will cite the Obama precedent.
[00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:28.471]  We have just taken a monumental step away from Republicanism towards Caesarism.
[00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:28.731]  Yes.
[00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:33.495]  This is ruled by diktat, the rejection of which sparks the American Revolution.
[00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:45.125]  But David, I mean, that revolution is not going to be led by the Republican leadership, because we know already they've come out with their lukewarm response against it, as we predicted yesterday.
[00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:45.805]  Yes.
[00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:50.349]  And it's encapsulated in a Washington Post article which talks about how
[00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:56.518]  Boehner and McConnell are more concerned over the party's brand than anything else.
[00:11:56.518 --> 00:12:01.841]  They're concerned about having a stable period of GOP governance.
[00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:06.003]  And this is summed up in a quote by Peter King out of New York, a Republican.
[00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:11.528]  I'm particularly illustrative of the rhino Republican rhetoric that we're seeing.
[00:12:11.528 --> 00:12:15.072]  He said it's the first real challenge for Boehner and McConnell together.
[00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:20.477]  They'd like to wipe the slate clean for when they start up next year with this situation behind us.
[00:12:20.477 --> 00:12:26.362]  And what he's talking about is eliminating the quote insurgent Tea Party Republicans
[00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:35.997]  Shunning them to the side, restricting their influence on the party and dropping any opposition to Obama's executive amnesty.
[00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:46.990]  So the leadership of the Republican Party across the board will do absolutely nothing to stop this train wreck and to reverse what Obama has wrought on the country over the past six years.
[00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:47.970]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.511]  They want this badly.
[00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:50.972]  This is for the U.S.
[00:12:50.972 --> 00:12:51.752]  Chamber of Commerce.
[00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:59.096]  This is for the large companies that want to have competition for blue-collar workers, for people at the bottom end of the scale.
[00:12:59.096 --> 00:13:03.758]  Those are the people who have traditionally been core to the Democrat Party.
[00:13:03.758 --> 00:13:06.400]  They're the ones that Obama has really betrayed.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.481]  But the Republicans are betraying the country.
[00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:12.063]  The Republicans themselves, Republican leadership, is betraying the Constitution.
[00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:14.004]  Now, we do have some Republicans who are speaking out on it.
[00:13:14.004 --> 00:13:16.045]  It remains to be seen what they're going to do.
[00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:17.266]  I don't know.
[00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.121]  That's
[00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:51.458]  We're good to go.
[00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:13.774]  Basically, you got into some of the details of it.
[00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:27.620]  The Simpson-Mazzoli Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, required Reagan, the president, to adjust the status of certain illegal immigrants to the category of quote, alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:34.522]  It also authorized the Attorney General to allow other illegal immigrants who did not qualify for amnesty to remain in the U.S.
[00:14:34.522 --> 00:14:37.803]  if they needed to, quote, assure family unity.
[00:14:37.803 --> 00:14:43.545]  So the small number of people that was adjusted by Reagan later on was in compliance with that.
[00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:47.867]  And he said they even quoted it in their article, in their order, rather.
[00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:51.648]  They said the administration made it clear it was carrying out the direction of Congress.
[00:14:51.648 --> 00:14:56.610]  It even cited the section of law from the Simpson-Mazzoli Act that provided this direction.
[00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.414]  And he has the section of law there.
[00:14:59.414 --> 00:15:04.945]  The bottom line is, is that he was not acting against the will of the people.
[00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:07.610]  They were essentially implementing the law that was there.
[00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:09.743]  Well, precisely.
[00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:22.376]  I mean, Pelosi came out before Obama's speech and said, basically, along with other establishment Democrats, look, Obama's only doing what Reagan did in 86, but Reagan didn't sign an executive order.
[00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:25.359]  It was an act passed by Congress.
[00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:28.803]  Even if you disagreed with it, it was constitutional.
[00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.526]  What Obama's doing, as Senator Sessions said, is
[00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:38.274]  Becoming America's first emperor and going back on his own words from as recently as last year.
[00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:44.799]  In fact, Sessions quotes Obama in his article today, quote, I know some people want me to bypass Congress.
[00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.420]  This is Obama, remember last year?
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.920]  Yeah.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.102]  And change the laws on my own.
[00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:51.783]  That's not how our democracy functions.
[00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:53.725]  That's not how our constitution is written.
[00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:56.708]  The problem is that I'm the President of the United States.
[00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:59.010]  I'm not the Emperor of the United States.
[00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.153]  My job is to execute laws that are passed.
[00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:13.785]  So that was Obama last year responding to pressure from immigration activists and the foundation's lobby groups that support them to pass executive action on immigration.
[00:16:14.528 --> 00:16:19.792]  He basically said I can't do that because it would violate the Constitution and make me an Emperor.
[00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:20.092]  Yes.
[00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:21.673]  Now he's done exactly that.
[00:16:21.673 --> 00:16:25.616]  So in his own words and with his own actions yesterday and today...
[00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:29.633]  Obama is admitting that he is now officially Caesar.
[00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:33.576]  He's the emperor and this is just the beginning as we talked about yesterday.
[00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.618]  We've got more coming down the pipeline.
[00:16:35.618 --> 00:16:41.782]  We've got global warming executive orders which could completely eviscerate the US economy.
[00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:47.226]  Talking about ridiculous reductions in carbon tax first to 2005 levels.
[00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:53.630]  Eventually they want an 80% reduction in carbon tax and then a 100% reduction in carbon tax.
[00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:53.971]  So I guess
[00:16:54.733 --> 00:17:03.580]  You know, human beings aren't going to be able to exhale for very much longer if they get their full agenda through, but this is only the beginning.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:13.428]  If this precedent is set, as Buchanan said, it's going to grease the skids for something that could reverberate for the next several administrations and get worse and worse.
[00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:17.929]  It fundamentally changes the structure of government.
[00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:19.750]  It essentially does make him a dictator.
[00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:25.811]  If he says, I gave this agenda to Congress, they didn't act on it, so I'm just going to ignore them and go over their heads.
[00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:31.013]  As you were pointing out, he's mentioned this several times, Rand Paul pointed that out in his speech yesterday.
[00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:38.755]  He said, the president has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration.
[00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:48.746]  You know, when you speak this with an executive order, when you dictate it, in other words, a dictator is somebody, the law comes out of their mouth.
[00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:50.587]  That's why they call them dictators.
[00:17:50.587 --> 00:17:52.107]  That's why he's a dictator.
[00:17:52.107 --> 00:17:55.948]  The only thing I disagree with here, he says, I believe immigration reform is needed.
[00:17:55.948 --> 00:17:57.289]  We must first secure the border.
[00:17:58.249 --> 00:18:11.352]  I don't think that it's going to be possible to secure the border as long as you incentivize illegal immigration in the way that Obama has with DACA, with this newest order, whatever they decide to call it.
[00:18:11.352 --> 00:18:16.713]  But there's been many, many cases already where he should have been impeached for criminal action.
[00:18:16.713 --> 00:18:18.513]  He and Eric Holder.
[00:18:18.513 --> 00:18:26.495]  And to allow them to have a pass for this long and to do nothing about it, we know that the Republicans don't want to do anything about it because, A,
[00:18:27.455 --> 00:18:31.658]  And the fact is, if you go and look at Dennis Kucinich's articles of impeachment against George W. Bush from back in, I think it was 2007-2008,
[00:18:57.728 --> 00:19:13.524]  Obama, and this was a couple of years ago now, Obama has already fulfilled 27 out of the 35 articles of impeachment that were levelled against Bush, and he's probably added a few more to that tally since that was emphasised a couple of years ago.
[00:19:13.524 --> 00:19:18.289]  Now you can add this to it, but as he said, it's very, very unlikely to happen because
[00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:22.718]  The Republican establishment is in league with the Democratic leadership.
[00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:34.230]  They're completely disinterested in standing up to this Obama-Caesar precedent ruled by Dictat, just as the Democrat leadership failed to punish Bush for his
[00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:43.095]  Unconstitutional activities in regards to illegal war and torture back in 2006 after the 2006 midterms.
[00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:51.259]  So they refuse to roll back the damage that Obama has done because as he said, their only concern is remaining in power.
[00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:53.621]  They don't care about fixing the country.
[00:19:53.621 --> 00:19:54.041]  Absolutely.
[00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:55.022]  We've got to go to break Paul.
[00:19:55.022 --> 00:19:55.802]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:00.364]  Hang on right there, we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:20:00.364 --> 00:20:05.785]  This holiday season, give the gift that keeps on giving, an in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:20:05.785 --> 00:20:10.406]  With your very own freeze dryer, you'll be able to freeze dry the food your family loves.
[00:20:10.406 --> 00:20:19.709]  Because we live in uncertain, difficult times, what better way to show your love for your family than to buy them a gift that helps them preserve food they can use now,
[00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:21.690]  Or in 25 years.

[00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:27.795]  Layaway is available.

[00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:31.357]  You know about RVs.
[00:20:31.357 --> 00:20:32.818]  You've heard about bunkers.
[00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:35.580]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.343]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:40.324]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.
[00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:49.187]  The ultimate fully functional off-the-grid survival bug-out house that's mobile, well-equipped, and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.

[00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:05.938]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[00:21:05.938 --> 00:21:11.705]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:18.654]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:28.137]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[00:21:28.137 --> 00:21:31.137]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[00:21:31.137 --> 00:21:40.720]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.581]  One World Whey is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:50.844]  We believe One World Whey is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.
[00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:55.566]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.

[00:21:59.128 --> 00:22:00.449]  The experts are clear.
[00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:07.552]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:22:07.552 --> 00:22:12.715]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:13.796 --> 00:22:17.559]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:21.763]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:22:21.763 --> 00:22:27.088]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:28.109]  Not our iodine.
[00:22:28.109 --> 00:22:31.652]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:34.433]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:24:19.997 --> 00:24:21.258]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:21.258 --> 00:24:21.838]  I'm David Ide.
[00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:26.500]  On this Friday, November 21st, 2014, the day after Obama has just told 5 million people, they say, that they can stay.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.901]  Of course, we don't really know.
[00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:39.307]  How many people that is.
[00:25:09.027 --> 00:25:14.551]  We, however, extend free health care, free education, a get-out-of-jail card for free.
[00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:17.193]  I mean, it's just the opposite.
[00:25:17.193 --> 00:25:20.195]  Has there ever been a country that has done this?
[00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:32.324]  Every other country requires, if you immigrate to that country, that you not only have to already have a means of support, already have an income, savings, that sort of thing, to show that you can support yourself and your family.
[00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:35.887]  I mean, that's Mexico, it's Belize, it's any country that you want to immigrate to, isn't it?
[00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:41.921]  Well, precisely, unless they're following the European Socialist model, which they are.
[00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:43.243]  And that's the key point.
[00:25:43.243 --> 00:25:47.408]  You have to understand the thinking that drives Obama and the people behind him.
[00:25:47.408 --> 00:25:54.137]  And again, it would take hours to explain, but it's best summed up in Dinesh D'Souza's America, Imagine a World Without Her.
[00:25:54.837 --> 00:26:00.200]  Basically, it sounds like a cliche, but it boils down to the fact that they hate America.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.122]  They think it should be completely transformed, as you were making the point yesterday.
[00:26:05.122 --> 00:26:14.807]  Because Obama's mentors are people like Reverend Wright, Bill Ayers, the domestic weather underground terrorist, who by the way, they invented the term white privilege.
[00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:20.349]  So they were the original race baiters, and they were a big influence on Obama.
[00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:23.731]  So it's based on this liberation theology, this idea that
[00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:25.130]  I don't know.
[00:26:36.107 --> 00:26:37.068]  Fought over.
[00:26:37.068 --> 00:26:38.809]  They had battles over them.
[00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:39.810]  They were not stolen.
[00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.912]  They were won or lost in wars.
[00:26:41.912 --> 00:26:43.853]  That's not a positive or a negative thing.
[00:26:43.853 --> 00:26:44.514]  That's a neutral.
[00:26:44.514 --> 00:26:47.296]  That's just the way that the world worked at that time.
[00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:58.605]  But this racist, extremist ideology that the land was stolen from Mexicans has been inoculated in that culture which the big foundations, the lobby groups have seized upon.
[00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:10.810]  This is the whole ideology that drives Obama, that drives the people behind him, which is why Nancy Pelosi likened it to the Emancipation Proclamation, right?
[00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:22.435]  Because they think that the Mexicans in America, the illegals, are basically refugees, are slaves, because they should be in Mexico because the land was stolen from us, from Univision.
[00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:24.115]  I think there's a lesson, Paul.
[00:27:24.115 --> 00:27:25.436]  Obama paying back a debt.
[00:27:25.436 --> 00:27:25.696]  Go ahead.
[00:27:25.956 --> 00:27:30.759]  Yeah, I think there's a lesson from the Mexican Revolution for Obama.
[00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:36.402]  It wasn't just Texas that revolted against a dictatorial tyrant.
[00:27:36.402 --> 00:27:42.386]  It was multiple provinces, three of them, Texas was just one of them, established governments.
[00:27:42.386 --> 00:27:47.809]  He was able to put down the revolution everywhere except in Texas and it wasn't just Americans
[00:27:48.329 --> 00:27:52.053]  Uh, people coming in from English-speaking people coming in from America.
[00:27:52.053 --> 00:27:59.039]  It was people who were Mexican, who were Hispanic, Latino, who were living in the area as well that revolted against that tyranny.
[00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.121]  Uh, that should be the lesson for them.
[00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:05.866]  Not that it's some kind of, uh, uh, Latins versus, uh, English people.
[00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:11.590]  I think it's interesting, too, to look at this situation that we had a report on yesterday.
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.490]  RT reported this.
[00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:19.055]  American-born London mayor, maybe you can talk about this, Boris Johnson, refuses to pay taxes to the U.S.
[00:28:19.055 --> 00:28:26.240]  He left when he was five years old, and now the IRS is coming after this guy who's been mayor of London since 2008.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.265]  I think maybe some of the people who are coming to this country might want to second guess whether they want to be U.S.
[00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.006]  citizens or not.
[00:28:34.006 --> 00:28:35.887]  There's a lot of baggage attached to that.
[00:28:37.094 --> 00:28:42.261]  I mean, the creators and the business owners are leaving America in droves, the middle class.
[00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:50.471]  There's a flight away from America, because they're the very people being punished under this transformative system that Obama is bringing in.
[00:28:50.471 --> 00:28:54.597]  And in fact, some of these illegals are now going to be, you know, semi-legal.
[00:28:55.117 --> 00:28:59.059]  They're going to get EITC payments because they're going to be enrolled in the tax system.
[00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:04.302]  They're not going to pay a lot of tax, but they're going to get a lot of benefits out of this EITC system.
[00:29:04.302 --> 00:29:07.163]  And that's being paid for by American taxpayers.
[00:29:07.163 --> 00:29:12.206]  So your dollars are going directly to these illegal immigrants as a result of this Obama program.
[00:29:12.526 --> 00:29:18.970]  Well, the biggest area of taxation for most people, whether they realize it or not, are the local taxes that pay for the schools.
[00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.493]  And of course, everyone, K-12, is going to be getting a free ride if they're living in this area.
[00:29:24.493 --> 00:29:28.835]  They're also going to get free medical care, whether or not it's part of Obama, because that's part of the law.
[00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:32.237]  If you go to an emergency room, they have to treat you.
[00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.760]  So, that's going to be something that is on our nickel.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.641]  As I said before, it's really su casa, mi casa.
[00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:41.763]  Your house becomes my house, whether you like it or not.
[00:29:41.923 --> 00:29:44.945]  But I think it's kind of in reverse with what's going on with the London mayor.
[00:29:44.945 --> 00:29:47.147]  He's not even here, but they're coming after him for taxes.
[00:29:47.147 --> 00:29:48.428]  They're essentially getting a free ride.
[00:29:48.428 --> 00:29:49.689]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:50.830]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.352]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:56.034]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.154 --> 00:30:05.395]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:11.697]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:30:11.697 --> 00:30:19.019]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:30:19.019 --> 00:30:28.921]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:35.685]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:30:35.685 --> 00:30:38.747]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:30:38.747 --> 00:30:40.529]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[00:30:40.529 --> 00:30:44.111]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:46.012]  No needles, no injections.
[00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:47.653]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:30:47.653 --> 00:30:48.854]  Try it for yourself.
[00:30:48.854 --> 00:30:51.156]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[00:30:51.156 --> 00:30:56.299]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:00.582 --> 00:31:07.227]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:07.227 --> 00:31:12.372]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:21.099]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:23.961]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:27.424]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:39.243 --> 00:31:41.384]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.384 --> 00:31:43.164]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:43.164 --> 00:31:46.045]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:46.045 --> 00:31:50.286]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:52.667]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:55.368]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:55.368 --> 00:31:56.968]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:56.968 --> 00:31:57.749]  Got it.
[00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:58.249]  Others don't.
[00:31:59.841 --> 00:32:01.842]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:32:01.842 --> 00:32:06.364]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:32:06.364 --> 00:32:10.847]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:32:10.847 --> 00:32:18.150]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:27.215]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:32.978]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:32:32.978 --> 00:32:40.563]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:32:40.563 --> 00:32:43.144]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:32:43.144 --> 00:32:48.327]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWard.

[00:32:56.512 --> 00:33:11.941]  DNA Force from Infowarslife.
[00:33:11.941 --> 00:33:14.563]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.563 --> 00:33:15.964]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.783 --> 00:33:28.064]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.064 --> 00:33:31.929]  I'm David Knight in Austin, joined with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:34.551]  We have Paul Craig Roberts coming up in the second hour.
[00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:38.836]  He's going to talk about the revival of the Cold War, as well as economic issues.
[00:33:38.836 --> 00:33:45.203]  Of course, he was in the Reagan administration, a key economist there in the Treasury Department for Ronald Reagan.
[00:33:45.203 --> 00:33:47.946]  We're also going to have Eric Rusch, who wrote the book
[00:33:48.426 --> 00:34:04.405]  Necrophilia from slave block to pedestal because what is coming up in Ferguson is a complete Takeover of what really should have been talked about not just because of that single shooting There's so much anger and unrest there because that is not
[00:34:05.006 --> 00:34:06.827]  An isolated incident.
[00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:12.990]  There's a pattern of behavior, an epidemic of police violence throughout this country, not just in Ferguson.
[00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:15.031]  Certainly race plays a part of it.
[00:34:15.031 --> 00:34:18.192]  It is a component, but they have made it solely about race.
[00:34:18.192 --> 00:34:20.173]  And so we're going to talk to him about that.
[00:34:20.173 --> 00:34:25.216]  Talk to him about, we'll also be talking with Paul Joseph Watson about why we can't
[00:34:26.016 --> 00:34:28.377]  Have real genuine police reform.
[00:34:28.377 --> 00:34:32.058]  We're also going to have Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson joining us from Ferguson.
[00:34:32.058 --> 00:34:34.458]  Our reporters are there on the scene.
[00:34:34.458 --> 00:34:40.460]  Today is the day that we are expecting to hear the verdict announced there.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.681]  Before I go back to Paul Joseph Watson, I wanted to let you know that Silver Bullet is back.
[00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:46.662]  That's how we pay for the
[00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:51.506]  Alex Jones Radio Show here is the products that we sell, and this is a great product.
[00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:57.170]  This is concentrated to 30 parts per million in a pure base of deionized water.
[00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:03.155]  Very high concentration makes it difficult and dangerous to produce this in this kind of high concentration.
[00:35:03.155 --> 00:35:04.796]  So it could run out very soon.
[00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:07.298]  It takes at least six more weeks to get it in.
[00:35:07.298 --> 00:35:12.763]  This is a great time to stock up on silver, of course, with flu season coming up.
[00:35:13.323 --> 00:35:16.284]  And many other viruses coming around during the winter.
[00:35:16.284 --> 00:35:20.784]  Colloidal silver is a vital supplement for maintaining your healthy lifestyle.
[00:35:20.784 --> 00:35:26.765]  There's never been a more important time to have a powerful and clean form of colloidal silver within reach for you and your family.
[00:35:26.765 --> 00:35:30.146]  Go to Infowarslife.com to order Silver Bullet now.
[00:35:30.146 --> 00:35:30.606]  You can call 888-253-3139.
[00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:30.806]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:30.806 --> 00:35:32.346]  Silver Bullet is back and it is a limited supply.
[00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:45.342]  Well, Paul, today we've got the verdict coming.
[00:35:46.463 --> 00:35:52.824]  Out of Ferguson, most people believe, with the grand jury that's going to deliver their verdict.
[00:35:52.824 --> 00:35:56.645]  Everybody expects that Darren Wilson is going to walk.
[00:35:56.645 --> 00:36:03.186]  He has made it known that he is willing to resign, I guess, as kind of a peace offering.
[00:36:03.186 --> 00:36:09.127]  We're going to be going to Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs and Ferguson later in the show.
[00:36:09.127 --> 00:36:11.428]  But what's your take on this, from looking at it from a distance?
[00:36:14.468 --> 00:36:19.953]  Well, I put a video out a couple of days ago, the truth about the Michael Brown shooting.
[00:36:19.953 --> 00:36:29.481]  And you have to bear in mind, I mean I would preface this by saying I've written numerous articles about police brutality directed against black people.
[00:36:30.157 --> 00:36:38.381]  Recently, there was the case in New York where the guy was choked to death by a police officer for the crime of selling cigarettes on the street.
[00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:39.041]  Yes.
[00:36:39.041 --> 00:36:41.623]  I mean, that caused some protest.
[00:36:41.623 --> 00:36:45.044]  It was in the news for about a week, then it completely disappeared.
[00:36:45.044 --> 00:36:54.049]  It was forgotten about, even though it was a clear-cut case of police brutality, and in my mind, at least manslaughter.
[00:36:54.049 --> 00:36:56.390]  And the evidence is there for everybody to see on tape.
[00:36:57.054 --> 00:37:03.619]  With this Michael Brown situation, it's a lot more ambiguous, which is what we find time and time again.
[00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:21.074]  The race baiters, the Al Sharptons of the world, they always jump on the ambiguous cases, the Trayvon Martins, the Michael Browns, and immediately decide on the guilt of whoever they want to demonize is involved before any evidence has come in.
[00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.554]  The problem with this Michael Brown situation, again, there's a police problem in Ferguson.
[00:37:26.554 --> 00:37:30.637]  There's a genuine problem with police brutality in Ferguson.
[00:37:30.637 --> 00:37:34.259]  There's a massive problem with police brutality across America.
[00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:40.704]  Nobody's denying that and nobody's championed fixing that problem as much as we have.
[00:37:40.704 --> 00:37:41.845]  But if you look at the actual
[00:37:42.799 --> 00:37:58.827]  Evidence in the Michael Brown case, at best it's ambiguous and at worst, if you look at the autopsy, the ballistics evidence and what the eyewitnesses said, which we can get on to in a moment, it backs up Officer Wilson's case and that's the problem.
[00:37:58.827 --> 00:38:05.451]  The black leaders that have jumped on board the race bait as the Al Sharpton, you know, the FBI, former FBI informant and his ilk,
[00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:20.795]  I've refused to take into account any of this evidence because it doesn't fit the narrative that they're trying to advance, which again is based around race baiting, which we've explained on many occasions, benefits nobody whatsoever.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.861]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:29.772]  My only concern about it is that they took a very, very long time to put out any evidence that would clear the officer.
[00:38:29.772 --> 00:38:30.933]  That took a very long time.
[00:38:30.933 --> 00:38:36.141]  They should have come out with that right away unless, unless they wanted this tension to build.
[00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:37.283]  That's my concern about it.
[00:38:38.063 --> 00:38:47.209]  You know, whenever something like this happens and they've got a crisis, they always try to use it to the maximum, whether it's for gun control or whether it's to try to stoke a race war.
[00:38:47.209 --> 00:38:54.874]  And when I look at the way this thing was handled, that's my big concern about it, is that that was really, I think that was part of the agenda.
[00:38:54.874 --> 00:39:01.799]  I think they deliberately let this thing run for a very long time before they gave any evidence that would clear the officer.
[00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:03.520]  But I want to get your reaction to this, Paul.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:16.803]  It just came out of the Albuquerque Police Department, and of course, Albuquerque is famous for being the place that has the highest number of shootings per capita, many, many times more than, let's say, New York City, for example.
[00:39:16.803 --> 00:39:28.905]  So much so that for several years, they've been under the scrutiny of the Department of Justice, supposedly trying to get them to stop, although we know that this kind of mentality is coming out of Washington.
[00:39:28.905 --> 00:39:33.306]  Now we see, just as they announced, I think it was just like nine days earlier,
[00:39:33.766 --> 00:39:40.890]  They announced an agreement with the Department of Justice that they were going to change their approach, their mentality towards the public.
[00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:50.835]  And of course, not only are their statistics out of control, but I think the one incident that really galvanized this with everybody was the shooting of that homeless man up on the hill.
[00:39:50.835 --> 00:40:01.460]  That was what was recorded on their police cameras, and everybody saw them shoot this unarmed man at a distance, kill him at a distance where he could not
[00:40:02.222 --> 00:40:06.125]  Effectively harm them in any way shape or form he was unarmed nevertheless.
[00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:10.488]  This is what just came out a kill ology Instruction class now.
[00:40:10.488 --> 00:40:13.430]  This is a guy who this is the actual title of it.
[00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.594]  It's bulletproof mind prevailing in violent encounters before and after
[00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:23.440]  This is a class that's going to be taught to the Albuquerque police officers.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.268]  This guy represents himself as the world's leading combat authority and the founder of Killology.
[00:40:29.268 --> 00:40:35.797]  He says, there are people who wake up every morning determined to send your family into a box.
[00:40:37.048 --> 00:40:41.049]  Are you aware that you're in a war and you are the warrior?
[00:40:41.049 --> 00:40:45.571]  See, that warrior mentality, that encapsulates it in that one sentence.
[00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:51.933]  That encapsulates what the federal government with Homeland Security has been telling police for so long.
[00:40:51.933 --> 00:40:53.833]  That's why there's this mentality.
[00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:57.734]  That's the thing that's underlying this epidemic of police violence.
[00:40:57.734 --> 00:41:02.376]  So you can see on the monitor, that's the shooting in the Albuquerque Hills of that homeless man who was camping out.
[00:41:03.296 --> 00:41:11.860]  They killed him because he was camping out and wouldn't follow their orders evidently, and perhaps there's some mental issues there, but he certainly was not a threat to them.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.502]  If you or I have a gun, and we have it for our self-defense,
[00:41:17.571 --> 00:41:17.771]  Can we
[00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:49.294]  Who are pushing this sort of thing, and that's what is being stoked on the other side of this, as the demonstrators are threatening the police in the streets saying, we're going to come to your house, we're going to shoot your kids.
[00:41:49.294 --> 00:42:01.420]  I see this whole thing moving into a race war, moving into a violent conflict, and stoking this whole mentality that's being sold by the central government that this is a war zone.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.300]  Paul, you want to comment on that?
[00:42:03.427 --> 00:42:06.008]  Yeah, and it goes back to the point I just made.
[00:42:06.008 --> 00:42:15.073]  The media and the establishment, the black leadership groups that completely sell out black people every chance they get, they only jump on the ambiguous cases when you've got
[00:42:15.856 --> 00:42:23.643]  The homeless guy being shot and the officer beforehand that came out on tape saying I'm going to shoot him in the penis deliberately went out to kill him.
[00:42:23.643 --> 00:42:28.667]  Of course we had the Kelly Thomas brutal beating which ended in his death.
[00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:32.510]  The war against homeless people, that gets basically zero attention.
[00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:41.338]  There were people back in May storming the council meetings in Albuquerque trying to arrest the chief of police over this police brutality.
[00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:47.881]  40 shootings since 2010, 25 of which were fatalities.
[00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:51.182]  They stormed the council meetings on numerous occasions.
[00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:53.562]  And again, it was only in local media.
[00:42:53.562 --> 00:42:58.524]  That was a huge story with the killing of the homeless man and the repercussions afterwards.
[00:42:58.524 --> 00:43:02.045]  But it never went outside local Albuquerque media.
[00:43:02.045 --> 00:43:04.606]  There may be sporadic mentions, but nothing like
[00:43:05.146 --> 00:43:18.065]  Ferguson, nothing like Trayvon Martin, and even in cases as I said where black people are targeted and killed by police, if it can't be made into a race-baiting issue, if it can't be hijacked by the likes of Al Sharpton and Obama,
[00:43:18.786 --> 00:43:24.129]  If it's ambiguous, which it is in the Brown and Trayvon Martin cases, they're not interested in it.
[00:43:24.129 --> 00:43:26.890]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:37.316]  When you said that, they seize on the ambiguous cases, they elevate those, they try to highlight the ambiguity, they try to highlight what might exonerate somebody early on.
[00:43:37.316 --> 00:43:45.620]  They are deliberately stoking this thing, but we really do need to have a discussion, and of course we're not getting that discussion, on what do we do about the police?
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.202]  There's another article here, this is Buffalo, New York,
[00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:55.713]  They're talking about one police department, a small police department in Buffalo, has shot 92 dogs in three years.
[00:43:55.713 --> 00:44:01.201]  One of the officers has killed about a third of those, 25 of them by himself.
[00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:02.743]  One officer has killed these dogs.
[00:44:04.105 --> 00:44:05.445]  Why is this important?
[00:44:05.445 --> 00:44:15.148]  It's not that dogs are more important than human lives, because we know that people are getting shot down on the streets all the time as well, but this tells you about the mentality.
[00:44:15.148 --> 00:44:19.510]  It also tells you about what's driving this, of course, because in many of these cases
[00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.693]  It's a situation where they have a SWAT team with a no-knock raid.
[00:44:24.693 --> 00:44:28.135]  And of course, dogs are going to bark when somebody comes to your door.
[00:44:28.135 --> 00:44:29.916]  In most cases, it startles them.
[00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:33.378]  What do you think they're going to do when somebody blows the door open?
[00:44:33.378 --> 00:44:34.679]  But they don't even wait for that.
[00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:43.324]  We've had videos that have surfaced in recent weeks of a small dog that was running away and being shot by the police as it was running away.
[00:44:43.324 --> 00:44:46.686]  We've got another video of the police calling a dog over to them and shooting it.
[00:44:47.466 --> 00:44:58.734]  They put these videos up, and Paul, when I look at this, it reminds me that one of the characteristics of serial killers is that they are cruel to animals at a very young age.
[00:44:58.734 --> 00:45:01.976]  It's a lack of empathy, and that's the dangerous thing.
[00:45:01.976 --> 00:45:17.047]  When they can look at a dog that is no threat to them, brag about the fact that they're killing these animals, that shows that they don't have any empathy for any living things, and of course we see them doing this over and over again to the general public, as we've been talking about so many years here at InfoWars, and yet
[00:45:17.427 --> 00:45:26.246]  There is nothing that's being done about that because they always move it into some kind of a, like you said, they choose the ambiguous situation and move it into a race war.
[00:45:27.765 --> 00:45:28.706]  Yes.
[00:45:28.706 --> 00:45:39.694]  It's the fact they're being trained to immediately escalate situations and immediately resort to violent force without adequately surveying the severity of the situation.
[00:45:39.694 --> 00:45:42.136]  That seems to happen in every single case.
[00:45:42.136 --> 00:45:44.318]  And that must come from their training.
[00:45:44.318 --> 00:45:47.661]  There are good cops out there that need to speak out against this.
[00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:56.828]  But with the Ferguson situation, I mean, I've made the point that these violent protests by the agitators that have hijacked the initial protests
[00:45:57.739 --> 00:46:04.143]  They only serve to delegitimize opposition to police brutality, which is a genuine problem.
[00:46:04.143 --> 00:46:14.249]  So now you've got the entirety of the conservative media basically in America pouring scorn on all of these Ferguson activists and demonstrators.
[00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:26.916]  Yeah, the problem of police brutality is very real, but in that circumstance it's being delegitimized when these people loot and become violent because the conservative media analyzes the evidence in the Brown case
[00:46:27.702 --> 00:46:31.846]  Which clearly shows that, I mean, look at the autopsy results.
[00:46:31.846 --> 00:46:34.228]  He did struggle with the officer in the car.
[00:46:34.228 --> 00:46:37.912]  He did try to grab his gun, all the evidence suggests.
[00:46:37.912 --> 00:46:43.717]  Six black witnesses said that he charged Wilson afterwards and that's when he shot him again.
[00:46:43.717 --> 00:46:46.200]  The evidence shows that his hands were not up.
[00:46:46.855 --> 00:46:50.639]  When the final shots were fired, they were down by his side.
[00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:57.025]  So again, that whole narrative, hands up, don't shoot, comes completely undone by the actual autopsy evidence.
[00:46:57.025 --> 00:46:57.246]  Yes.
[00:46:57.246 --> 00:47:00.449]  And you've got forensic pathologists like Judy Melinek asserting that
[00:47:01.576 --> 00:47:06.703]  There's no evidence that he attempted to surrender when Wilson shot him in the street again.
[00:47:06.703 --> 00:47:18.918]  So when the conservative media looks at that and sees that there's not actually a huge case against Officer Wilson, which is why he will probably be acquitted on the evidence, they then look at it and say,
[00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:43.986]  They make the judgment that these black people, these people in Ferguson, are just rioting for the sake of it and looting for the sake of it, overlooking a genuine police problem in Ferguson and dismissing and diminishing the legitimacy of the police brutality problem that has swept America over the last 10-15 years, which is documented by the likes of the ACLU, you know, the increasing
[00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:49.868]  Use of SWAT teams, raiding houses, throwing flashbangs in babies' cribs.
[00:47:49.868 --> 00:47:51.809]  It's a genuine problem.
[00:47:51.809 --> 00:47:58.811]  Conservative media sees this evidence, and then they use it to dismiss the general issue of police brutality.
[00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:05.173]  So, I mean, that's why I say that it delegitimises opposition to police brutality.
[00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:13.796]  When you actually base a whole movement, and that movement becomes violent on a case like the Michael Brown shooting, which if you actually study the evidence,
[00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:23.670]  Officer Wilson will be acquitted for it based on that evidence, not because he's white, but because the evidence suggests that his story, his account is true.
[00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:25.238]  Exactly.
[00:48:25.238 --> 00:48:28.099]  You've got the agent provocateurs that are there doing their job.
[00:48:28.099 --> 00:48:34.082]  You've got the government, which could have released this information that would clear Officer Wilson.
[00:48:34.082 --> 00:48:50.668]  But, you know, I think as you pointed out, this is something that they are really using to essentially stoke the race war, to stoke the tension between the police and the public, to drive home the point that the mentality that they've been trying to sell the police for a very long time, that they're
[00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:56.272]  combatants in a war, and that the public is the enemy combatant.
[00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:59.594]  We see that in documents from the federal government constantly.
[00:48:59.594 --> 00:49:06.299]  We see that in the training that they're giving there to police departments, just as this latest memo surfaces from the Albuquerque Police Department.
[00:49:06.299 --> 00:49:14.065]  I think it was interesting, Paul, and I wanted to read a couple of comments here that Frank Serpico had, and of course everybody is seeing the movie Serpico with Al Pacino.
[00:49:14.065 --> 00:49:18.729]  You know that story very well, but he says he tried to be an honest cop
[00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:19.629]  I don't
[00:49:40.285 --> 00:49:42.587]  Are coming from the war on drugs.
[00:49:42.587 --> 00:49:47.111]  That's the thing that corrupted the police when Serpico was a cop in New York.
[00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:48.232]  It was the war on drugs.
[00:49:48.232 --> 00:49:54.757]  But now the aspect of the war on drugs that is coming home to roost are these no-knock SWAT team raids.
[00:49:54.757 --> 00:49:55.818]  That kind of violence.
[00:49:55.818 --> 00:49:58.260]  That's what's behind so many of these shootings.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:03.004]  And that's what has been feeding this mentality of a militarized police.
[00:50:03.004 --> 00:50:03.905]  He said the problem
[00:50:04.895 --> 00:50:05.355]  Thank you.
[00:50:22.543 --> 00:50:29.228]  Can pull out their weapons and fire without fear that anything will happen to them, even if they shoot someone wrongfully.
[00:50:29.228 --> 00:50:33.512]  What do you think that does to their psychology as they patrol the streets?
[00:50:33.512 --> 00:50:36.114]  That sense of invulnerability.
[00:50:36.114 --> 00:50:39.917]  The famous old saying that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:50:39.917 --> 00:50:47.583]  We still don't know how many of these incidents occur each year, even though Congress enacted the Violent Crime Control Act 20 years ago.
[00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:51.206]  These reports on the police violence were never issued.
[00:50:51.866 --> 00:50:53.007]  That's Frank Serpico.
[00:50:53.007 --> 00:51:00.195]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK and we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts in the next hour.

[00:51:31.507 --> 00:51:34.929]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:36.611]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:51:36.611 --> 00:51:38.552]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:38.552 --> 00:51:44.416]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:44.416 --> 00:51:45.236]  I know, right?
[00:51:45.236 --> 00:51:46.557]  You love it too!
[00:51:46.557 --> 00:51:47.978]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[00:51:47.978 --> 00:51:49.019]  Let's go get some!

[00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:02.313]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:02.313 --> 00:52:07.436]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:07.436 --> 00:52:15.560]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.083]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:23.905]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:24.045 --> 00:52:29.986]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.986 --> 00:52:33.167]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:33.167 --> 00:52:38.528]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:38.528 --> 00:52:46.670]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.950]  Do business with
[00:52:59.036 --> 00:53:04.341]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:11.288]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:50.429]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:54:18.226 --> 00:54:19.707]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:19.707 --> 00:54:24.569]  I'm David Knight, your host today with Paul Joseph Watson, who's joining us from the UK.
[00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:42.217]  We were just talking before the break about how unfortunate it is that the system has once more taken what should have been a discussion about the epidemic of police violence and essentially seizing on a situation that they knew the officer would get exonerated.
[00:54:42.717 --> 00:55:05.058]  Turning that into a situation where they can exploit racial tensions, where they can fuel the fires of suspicion between police officers, the attitude that they are in a war zone, that the public is the enemy combatant, all of those are the things that we expect to see come out of Ferguson, that's what we are seeing coming out of Ferguson, rather than any kind of discussion
[00:55:05.798 --> 00:55:14.227]  about limiting the rules of engagement, essentially holding the police to the same standards that they hold other people to.
[00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:21.555]  As Serpico put it, he came up with six points in his article here that's on Politico, and you really need to take a look at this.
[00:55:21.555 --> 00:55:22.856]  This is back on August 23rd.
[00:55:23.817 --> 00:55:25.640]  It's a great article from Serpico.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.384]  He lays out the problems and he has six solutions he thinks.
[00:55:29.384 --> 00:55:37.675]  So one of those I thought was interesting was require community involvement from police officers so they know the districts and the individuals they're policing.
[00:55:37.675 --> 00:55:39.217]  That will encourage empathy and understanding.
[00:55:39.217 --> 00:55:40.218]  I've seen a lot of that.
[00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:46.203]  Go down since, you know, when they started with police, they were walking neighborhoods and big cities.
[00:55:46.203 --> 00:55:48.966]  That's really where the policing started in big cities.
[00:55:48.966 --> 00:55:50.307]  People knew who the police were.
[00:55:50.307 --> 00:55:51.988]  The police knew the people.
[00:55:51.988 --> 00:55:54.990]  Yet now we see there's no such connection.
[00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.772]  They're typically in police cars.
[00:55:56.772 --> 00:55:59.954]  There's typically harassing people for minor traffic violations.
[00:55:59.954 --> 00:56:02.496]  They're doing nothing really to protect the residents.
[00:56:02.496 --> 00:56:03.717]  They don't know the residents.
[00:56:03.717 --> 00:56:05.519]  There's no connection there within the community.
[00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:10.583]  But he also says, of course, enforce the laws against everyone, including police officers.
[00:56:10.583 --> 00:56:15.126]  And he says, last but not least, police cannot police themselves.
[00:56:15.126 --> 00:56:21.090]  We need to have permanent, independent boards to review incidents of police corruption and brutality.
[00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:28.736]  If there was some kind of an independent board, I don't think they would have been able to manipulate this situation in Ferguson to get where it is today, Paul.
[00:56:30.222 --> 00:56:42.086]  Well exactly, and there was a cop who came out the other day, I forgot out of what area, he was making the point that 80% of crime, violent crime in many cities, is black-on-black crime.
[00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:50.269]  And amidst this race-baiting national debate, that black-on-black violent crime, which is a far bigger problem, gets ignored.
[00:56:50.269 --> 00:56:56.091]  And then the other problem, as you mentioned, is there seems to be no retribution against the police that engage in this brutality.
[00:56:56.917 --> 00:57:01.720]  The cop who pepper sprayed Occupy demonstrators, you remember that famous footage?
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:01.981]  Oh yeah.
[00:57:01.981 --> 00:57:10.967]  I mean he got, I forgot whether it was, I think it was an insurance payout because his livelihood was harmed by the publicity of that incident.
[00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:19.993]  So he was actually rewarded by, I think it was at least $100,000 for pepper spraying, you know, two dozen students directly in the face in that
[00:57:20.433 --> 00:57:22.478]  Horrific famous footage that we all saw.
[00:57:22.478 --> 00:57:28.590]  So as he said, when there's no retribution against them, they're just as likely to do it even more so.
[00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.456]  It doesn't discourage police brutality, it encourages it.
[00:57:32.188 --> 00:57:39.113]  Yeah, and you know, I don't see any movement towards trying to get independent boards who are going to oversee what the police are doing.
[00:57:39.113 --> 00:57:43.257]  Instead, we're going just the opposite, into more of a police state.
[00:57:43.257 --> 00:57:49.501]  We've got this report out of Pennsylvania, where they're going to allow the police who are in the schools.
[00:57:49.501 --> 00:57:55.146]  I'm looking at this picture, and I see two police officers looking at this little kid, being accompanied by her parent, walking her in.
[00:57:55.766 --> 00:57:57.568]  And it's like, what is wrong with this picture?
[00:57:57.568 --> 00:58:02.012]  It's like, oh that's right, they didn't have police in the schools when I went to school, number one.
[00:58:02.012 --> 00:58:04.134]  Number two, listen to what they're going to do.
[00:58:04.134 --> 00:58:10.300]  Says, the superintendent says, I can't imagine a scenario that would get to a search down to the undergarments
[00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:15.784]  Yet they still felt it necessary to give that power to the police in the schools.
[00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:22.167]  They're going to allow them to strip search the kids, even though they say, well, I can't even understand why we would do that.
[00:58:22.167 --> 00:58:24.628]  We're not going to do that to search for drugs.
[00:58:24.628 --> 00:58:25.309]  I don't really know.
[00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:29.031]  But hey, we should have the power to do whatever we want.
[00:58:29.751 --> 00:58:33.813]  That's the mentality that is feeding the police state in America.

[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.642]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:23.642 --> 00:59:27.905]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:27.905 --> 00:59:29.686]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:00:18.212 --> 01:00:22.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.787 --> 01:00:28.169]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.169 --> 01:00:31.394]  I'm David Knight in Austin, joined with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:40.788]  We've been talking about Obama's amnesty, essentially crossing the Rubicon, announcing himself as emperor because, you know, hey, he didn't get what he wanted out of the
[01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:46.433]  Congress, so he just decided to do it himself and bypass Congress.
[01:00:46.433 --> 01:00:51.536]  And so now Congress is this useless appendage if they don't do something about it.
[01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:52.597]  He's thrown down the gauntlet.
[01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:54.658]  Are they going to pick it up and do anything about it?
[01:00:54.658 --> 01:00:56.099]  We're hearing some tough talk.
[01:00:56.099 --> 01:01:02.183]  Rand Paul says he's not going to sit idly by and let the president bypass Congress and the Constitution.
[01:01:02.183 --> 01:01:03.144]  We hear U.S.
[01:01:03.144 --> 01:01:06.106]  Representative Mo Brooks, Republican from Alabama, went further.
[01:01:06.106 --> 01:01:06.446]  He said
[01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:17.313]  There's a federal statute that punishes anyone who aids or bets, encourages or entices foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States of America.
[01:01:17.313 --> 01:01:19.495]  In other words, Obama should face prison.
[01:01:19.495 --> 01:01:23.717]  There's a lot of people in the Obama administration that should face prison.
[01:01:23.717 --> 01:01:26.780]  Paul, you mentioned that Dennis Kucinich's
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:50.335]  went through and had 37 points to impeach George W. Bush and essentially we've met all those with Obama and of course if you look back at the articles of impeachment for Nixon, they look in many respects identical to what Obama has done, particularly using the IRS against his political enemies.
[01:01:50.335 --> 01:01:52.897]  Well precisely and the reaction that we predicted
[01:01:53.698 --> 01:01:58.822]  Which was that the Republican leadership would do absolutely nothing has come to fruition already.
[01:01:58.822 --> 01:02:00.923]  It's a top story on Drudge Report.
[01:02:00.923 --> 01:02:04.225]  Republicans leave town without a plan to fight Obama.
[01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:08.868]  President Obama's announcement may bring a constitutional crisis in the words of Rep.
[01:02:08.868 --> 01:02:09.729]  Mike Simpson.
[01:02:10.329 --> 01:02:13.932]  But Republicans in Congress haven't the damnedest idea what they'll do about it.
[01:02:13.932 --> 01:02:19.257]  So they've already flown off on Thanksgiving recess with no plan whatsoever.
[01:02:19.257 --> 01:02:21.739]  So the Republicans get this major win, right?
[01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:25.422]  And so they come back and the only thing that they've done that I'm aware of
[01:02:26.202 --> 01:02:31.308]  Uh, was they passed the Keystone Pipeline thing for a ninth time, sending it to the Senate.
[01:02:31.308 --> 01:02:34.471]  They know it's going to be dead on arrival, but they keep doing that.
[01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:42.940]  They've done it nine times, but they can't even be bothered to do anything about Obama's, uh, making himself an emperor.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.981]  And they knew this was coming.
[01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:47.411]  They've known it's been coming.
[01:02:47.411 --> 01:02:54.940]  I mean, if there's a funding bill for DHS or whatever, you can bet your bottom dollar they'll stick with it until it's passed.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.723]  You know, McCain and the rest of them.
[01:02:56.723 --> 01:02:59.466]  When it comes to this, they've already left.
[01:02:59.466 --> 01:03:00.447]  They've gone.
[01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:02.410]  And you were mentioning just at the top of the hour there,
[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:10.317]  This federal statute, I actually got an email from somebody who found the original statute which Representative Mo Brooks talked about.
[01:03:10.317 --> 01:03:19.265]  It's actually imprisonment up to 10 years for anybody caught encouraging, inducing, aiding or abetting an illegal alien.
[01:03:20.212 --> 01:03:28.977]  For commercial advantage or private financial gain in which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years for each alien, that's for each illegal alien they aid.
[01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:32.398]  He could be in there for about a number of years.
[01:03:32.398 --> 01:03:37.021]  For a long prison sentence by the looks of it, if the Republican leadership were bothered.
[01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:40.924]  Yeah, he could be in there for about the half-life of a piece of plutonium.
[01:03:40.924 --> 01:03:47.190]  You know, talking about Nixon and getting his Nixon on, this is on our website, on InfoWars.
[01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.772]  It's from PJ Media Bombshell.
[01:03:49.772 --> 01:03:54.997]  Email proves that the White House and the Department of Justice targeted reporter Cheryl Atkinson.
[01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:55.698]  I mean, you talk about
[01:03:56.098 --> 01:04:02.925]  Having their enemies list, talking about acting exactly like Nixon, using the IRS against their enemies, going after their opponents in the press.
[01:04:02.925 --> 01:04:13.537]  They say one of the documents provides smoking gun proof that the Obama White House and Eric Holder's Justice Department colluded to get CBS News to block reporter Sheryl Atkinson.
[01:04:14.237 --> 01:04:18.040]  She was one of the few reporters who went after Fast and Furious.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.502]  This is an email dated October 4th, 2011.
[01:04:21.502 --> 01:04:35.671]  Attorney General Holder's top press aide, Tracy Schmoller, called Atkinson, quote, out of control, told White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz that he intended to call CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer to get the network to shut her up.
[01:04:36.411 --> 01:04:36.952]  There we go!
[01:04:36.952 --> 01:04:45.799]  I mean, this guy, where do you... It's a target-rich environment, yet they won't do anything except pass the Keystone Pipeline for the ninth time.
[01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:48.381]  I don't care if you agree with the Keystone Pipeline or not.
[01:04:48.381 --> 01:04:50.002]  What are these guys doing?
[01:04:50.002 --> 01:04:55.887]  They're obviously serving their corporate masters, and they want the power levers when they get in.
[01:04:55.887 --> 01:04:58.269]  We'll be right back with Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.710]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:04.668]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:37.991]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:39.771]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:39.771 --> 01:05:47.613]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:47.613 --> 01:05:48.773]  But for how long?

[01:05:55.394 --> 01:05:58.215]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:05.962]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:06.942]  It has changed my life.
[01:06:06.942 --> 01:06:09.123]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[01:06:09.123 --> 01:06:10.623]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[01:06:10.623 --> 01:06:13.184]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:06:13.184 --> 01:06:14.644]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[01:06:14.644 --> 01:06:18.646]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:06:18.646 --> 01:06:20.626]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:06:20.626 --> 01:06:23.267]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:06:23.387 --> 01:06:41.317]  Whether it's Survival Shield, Nascent Iodine, or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.

[01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:48.762]  I'm going to promote something.
[01:06:48.762 --> 01:06:51.763]  It's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.

[01:07:09.323 --> 01:07:19.245]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:19.245 --> 01:07:22.166]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:23.007]  I think so.
[01:07:37.503 --> 01:07:37.883]  We're good.
[01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.607]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.607 --> 01:08:07.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:16.202]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:16.202 --> 01:08:20.665]  I'm David Knight in Austin, joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:08:20.665 --> 01:08:26.089]  I wanted to get Paul's reaction to this, and I want to give you an idea.
[01:08:26.089 --> 01:08:28.231]  I just came across this story.
[01:08:28.231 --> 01:08:29.992]  This has been out for about a week.
[01:08:29.992 --> 01:08:31.513]  It's been kind of percolating.
[01:08:31.513 --> 01:08:35.657]  Could a rapper go to prison for cutting a rap album?
[01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:40.200]  Now, this is a rapper, Brandon Duncan, also known as Tiny Doo.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.763]  They say he's rapped with hip-hop artist Lil Wayne.
[01:08:44.423 --> 01:08:48.665]  But the bottom line is, they're charging him with gang conspiracy.
[01:08:48.665 --> 01:08:52.967]  Now, listen to the conspiracy theory that the police have come up with.
[01:08:52.967 --> 01:09:04.433]  They're saying, they're using a little-known statute that's been put in place by voters in 2000, allowing the prosecution of gang members if they benefit from crimes committed by other gang members.
[01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:06.274]  But this is what his attorney says.
[01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:07.935]  He says, it's shocking.
[01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.716]  He has no criminal record.
[01:09:10.716 --> 01:09:13.558]  Nothing in his lyrics say go out and commit a crime.
[01:09:14.338 --> 01:09:21.743]  Nothing in his lyrics reference these shootings, yet they're holding him liable for conspiracy.
[01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:22.304]  You understand?
[01:09:22.304 --> 01:09:25.606]  I mean, this is guilt by association.
[01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:31.290]  This is something that could shut down the First Amendment if they allow this type of thing to stand.
[01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.011]  And one constitutional lawyer,
[01:09:34.062 --> 01:09:37.405]  That they talked to, the local news station there, talked to him.
[01:09:37.405 --> 01:09:41.148]  He says, where does it end if that's the definition of criminal liability?
[01:09:41.148 --> 01:09:46.412]  Is Martin Scorsese going to be prosecuted if he meets with mafia members for a movie of his next film?
[01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:54.519]  The Constitution says it can't be a crime to simply make gangster rap songs and hang out with people who are committing crimes.
[01:09:54.519 --> 01:09:56.580]  You have to have more involvement than that.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.283]  It truly is a guilt by association.
[01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:01.905]  And we go back to what Voltaire said, of course, about
[01:10:02.345 --> 01:10:07.891]  Free speech, you know, I may hate what you're saying, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
[01:10:07.891 --> 01:10:17.982]  If we don't take that attitude, say they pull up these cases, here's somebody that, you know, most people are going to look at this, if you listen to what he's saying, you probably won't like it.
[01:10:17.982 --> 01:10:21.185]  Especially if he's talking about the gang members that he's in there.
[01:10:21.185 --> 01:10:24.348]  But if we don't defend that kind of free speech in principle,
[01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:26.583]  We lose that.
[01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:31.205]  Furthermore, we're going to expose ourselves to that kind of liability.
[01:10:31.205 --> 01:10:34.567]  Just look at what they have been able to do with the RICO statute.
[01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:49.174]  That was going to essentially give them a free hand to come against the mafia by saying they were involved in racketeering, influencing corruption, and so they had to confiscate their assets first before prosecution began so they could get a conviction.
[01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:52.655]  In other words, punish people before they're found guilty of something.
[01:10:52.655 --> 01:10:56.537]  We're seeing that happening everywhere now, not just with war on drugs.
[01:10:56.537 --> 01:11:01.639]  We've even seen it in prosecutions of people who were involved in theft.
[01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:08.302]  They basically confiscated their home, which they were using as leverage to pay for their defense.
[01:11:08.302 --> 01:11:17.006]  So they confiscated their home, confiscated the money that they had gotten from refinancing their home to pay for their defense, leaving them literally defenseless.
[01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.067]  Paul, what do you think about this?
[01:11:19.389 --> 01:11:25.140]  If that's set as a precedent, then every rapper under the sun is going to go to jail.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.703]  They're also applying it politically.
[01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:29.849]  You remember a couple of years ago, the case of Brandon Raub.
[01:11:30.433 --> 01:11:48.910]  He made some political statements on his Facebook page, was grabbed and basically treated as a violent criminal, interned in a psychiatric ward for a period of days before he was able to get out, basically for some Facebook comments which were deemed to be threats of violence.
[01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:52.273]  If you actually read them, it was nothing of the sort within its own context.
[01:11:53.053 --> 01:11:55.314]  They're using that to go after people politically now.
[01:11:55.314 --> 01:12:01.716]  It's still quite rare, but as you said, if they're allowed to set that precedent, it's chilling for free speech.
[01:12:01.716 --> 01:12:09.539]  Well, you can see where they're heading with all this stuff, because we've seen over and over again the efforts to try to get control of the internet.
[01:12:09.539 --> 01:12:13.781]  The FCC trying to assert its control of the internet, and they'll do it if that means
[01:12:14.981 --> 01:12:18.704]  Supporting net neutrality or if it means taking down net neutrality.
[01:12:18.704 --> 01:12:20.526]  They've been on both sides of this issue.
[01:12:20.526 --> 01:12:26.310]  They're back on the side of net neutrality again because that seems to be the side that the public will support.
[01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:32.736]  But what they're really trying to do is establish a precedent where the FCC has control of the Internet.
[01:12:33.456 --> 01:12:43.582]  And we've already seen with their moves to take the pulse of various newsrooms that they are very interested in controlling content, not just in allocating frequency.
[01:12:43.582 --> 01:12:49.246]  There's absolutely no need for the FCC to establish net neutrality.
[01:12:49.246 --> 01:12:54.109]  Net neutrality is what we've had for about 15 years, or as long as the Internet's been going.
[01:12:54.109 --> 01:12:57.271]  And they don't need to have them come in to establish that.
[01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.912]  But they're trying to establish their control.
[01:12:59.492 --> 01:13:05.177]  And they're going to establish their control with these copyright legislations that they haven't been able to get through.
[01:13:05.177 --> 01:13:07.018]  CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, PIPA.
[01:13:07.018 --> 01:13:12.603]  They're going to do that with the Trans-Pacific, the Trans-Atlantic Partnership trade agreements.
[01:13:12.603 --> 01:13:21.310]  That's a vital part of those agreements that are being negotiated in secret without our elected representatives even being able to see that.
[01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:22.471]  They're going to spring that on us.
[01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:24.372]  They're going to do that again.
[01:13:24.372 --> 01:13:28.636]  Obama couldn't get his legislative agenda through with amnesty, so he just declares it
[01:13:29.456 --> 01:13:29.957]  I think so.
[01:13:51.012 --> 01:13:54.435]  Cheryl Atkinson being gagged by CBS.
[01:13:54.435 --> 01:13:56.617]  We now have the smoking gun proof.
[01:13:56.617 --> 01:14:05.584]  The emails have surfaced within the Justice Department sending emails to CBS telling them to shut her up because she was asking questions about Fast and Furious.
[01:14:05.584 --> 01:14:09.647]  One of the few people in the mainstream media that was asking questions.
[01:14:09.647 --> 01:14:11.709]  Yeah, and it's not just Cheryl Atkinson.
[01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:16.953]  We had the CNBC reporter silenced for criticizing Obamacare.
[01:14:17.569 --> 01:14:18.789]  So we have that case as well.
[01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:27.651]  We have, you know, CNN journalists who criticize the TSA and then they go to the airport and find out that they get special treatment.
[01:14:27.651 --> 01:14:36.253]  Then going back to the FCC, I mean, you know, they're sending people into newsrooms to try and dictate news content under the guise of polls and surveys.
[01:14:36.253 --> 01:14:41.574]  The FCC is not the friend of free speech and this net neutrality issue.
[01:14:41.574 --> 01:14:43.675]  They're not even pushing real net neutrality.
[01:14:43.675 --> 01:14:45.355]  They're pushing a reclassification
[01:14:46.192 --> 01:14:49.356]  Of the Internet under the Telecommunications Act.
[01:14:49.356 --> 01:14:52.159]  So they want it to look like cable television.
[01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:54.002]  This has been the agenda for a while.
[01:14:54.002 --> 01:14:57.726]  They want to get that regulation in.
[01:14:57.726 --> 01:15:01.831]  Numerous congressmen senators over the years have pushed for a Chinese style Internet.
[01:15:02.617 --> 01:15:03.438]  And that's what they want.
[01:15:03.438 --> 01:15:16.869]  They want the government to have the power in times of crisis, as the communist Chinese government says when it's crushing dissent in Tibet, to go down and shut down certain parts of the internet, make it off limits for people in certain areas of the country.
[01:15:16.869 --> 01:15:17.249]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:17.249 --> 01:15:18.010]  That's on record.
[01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:19.591]  Lieberman has pushed that for years.
[01:15:19.591 --> 01:15:23.594]  That's what they want with this either kill switch or this regulation of the internet.
[01:15:23.594 --> 01:15:28.699]  So to trust them and believe them that it's just about net neutrality is completely naive.
[01:15:29.099 --> 01:15:33.022]  Yeah, they talk about how they admire the Chinese approach to the Internet.
[01:15:33.022 --> 01:15:36.024]  We've had comments from Bush and Clinton how they would love to be a dictator.
[01:15:36.024 --> 01:15:39.226]  And finally, we see that Obama just comes out and does it this week.
[01:15:39.226 --> 01:15:43.068]  And so, we're going to see them do that Chinese-style Internet as well.
[01:15:43.068 --> 01:15:49.633]  Now, joining us now, Paul, we've got Paul Craig Roberts, American economist and columnist for Creators Syndicate.
[01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:53.555]  Of course, he was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under the Reagan administration.
[01:15:53.555 --> 01:15:56.677]  He earned fame as co-founder of Reaganomics.
[01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:57.718]  Welcome, Mr. Roberts.
[01:15:57.718 --> 01:15:58.178]  Dr. Roberts.
[01:16:00.079 --> 01:16:02.540]  I want to get your comment and Paul's got a lot of questions for you.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:09.563]  I want to get your comment on Jim Webb, who's announced his candidacy opposing Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:09.563 --> 01:16:12.224]  He's forming a committee to explore that.
[01:16:12.224 --> 01:16:20.407]  I think he could cause Hillary Clinton a lot of discomfort, I think, opposing some of the things that were done as she was Secretary of State.
[01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:27.150]  Of course, he was the Secretary of the Navy while you were there at the Reagan administration.
[01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:30.071]  He had some interesting comments about Libya.
[01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:34.533]  He said there were no treaties at risk, there were no Americans at risk, there were no terrorist attacks coming out of Libya.
[01:16:34.533 --> 01:16:35.554]  Why did we attack them?
[01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:39.155]  And of course that's a direct jab at Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:39.155 --> 01:16:40.596]  What do you think about Jim Webb?
[01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:46.855]  Well, I don't think the establishment will put up with him.
[01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:53.001]  He certainly would be a far better prospect than Hillary.
[01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:54.642]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:16:54.642 --> 01:16:57.025]  He's a real person.
[01:16:57.025 --> 01:17:01.188]  But because he is a real person, he would not be welcome.
[01:17:02.538 --> 01:17:06.662]  By the power structure that selects the president.
[01:17:06.662 --> 01:17:07.963]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:07.963 --> 01:17:09.605]  So I don't really know.
[01:17:09.605 --> 01:17:18.553]  He may simply find that he gets smeared or framed up or some kind of accusations come forward.
[01:17:18.553 --> 01:17:23.938]  That's the usual trick they use to get rid of unwelcome.
[01:17:25.705 --> 01:17:43.219]  He could certainly make things interesting for her because, of course, with his experience as Secretary of the Navy, and he was a Vietnam war vet, and he's pretty much come out against the military-industrial complex at the same time that Hillary is doing everything she can to embrace the military-industrial complex and perpetual war, isn't it?
[01:17:43.219 --> 01:17:47.502]  That's right, but the fact that he's against it means they'll work against him.
[01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:48.803]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:17:48.803 --> 01:17:50.424]  I know Paul had some questions he wanted to ask.
[01:17:50.424 --> 01:17:50.905]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:17:51.636 --> 01:17:52.797]  Bring you in on this.
[01:17:52.797 --> 01:18:04.705]  Yeah, I was just reading Dr. Roberts' article earlier today, the next presidential election will move the world closer to war, in which you write, Dr. Roberts, Hillary as president would mean war with Russia.
[01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:12.030]  Why are we more likely to see this cold war turn hot under Hillary than under Obama or even Bush before him?
[01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:16.172]  Well, for several reasons.
[01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:23.514]  One, of course, we've already discussed that she's in tight with the military security complex.
[01:18:23.514 --> 01:18:28.775]  And, of course, she has also compared Putin to Hitler.
[01:18:28.775 --> 01:18:37.317]  She has made a direct comparison of the Russian president to Adolf Hitler, and that's something she can't really back away from.
[01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:45.734]  So when you go that far out on the limb, you really kind of have to go the rest of the way.
[01:18:45.734 --> 01:19:05.266]  So I think it's almost certain that if you get somebody like Hillary in the office of the president, that she will certainly accommodate the neoconservatives who also want war with Russia because they think Russia can be defeated.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:14.162]  And the military security complex, they'll support all that.
[01:19:14.162 --> 01:19:21.485]  And of course, most of the generals, you know, war is good for promotions.
[01:19:21.485 --> 01:19:24.926]  So I don't think there's any candidate
[01:19:26.337 --> 01:19:32.900]  That we could end up with this president that would be more likely to go to war with Russia than Hillary.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:39.002]  I think that's a real possibility, especially with the Republicans in control of the House and Senate.
[01:19:39.002 --> 01:19:44.564]  They would rubber stamp any kind of war that she would want to go into in just about any place.
[01:19:44.564 --> 01:19:48.266]  We're going to be right back with Paul Craig Roberts and Paul Joseph Watson.

[01:22:04.482 --> 01:22:10.784]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.

[01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:03.333]  He's gone.
[01:24:16.664 --> 01:24:18.125]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.666]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:22.789]  We have Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, my co-host today.
[01:24:22.789 --> 01:24:27.252]  And on the phone we have Paul Craig Roberts, and we only have him to the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:27.252 --> 01:24:32.096]  And I know that Paul Joseph Watson had a question for him about MH17.
[01:24:32.096 --> 01:24:32.957]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:24:33.942 --> 01:24:45.432]  Yeah, well obviously we've seen this international propaganda campaign to demonise Russia over MH17 despite the fact that the State Department has repeatedly failed to provide hard evidence.
[01:24:45.432 --> 01:24:47.153]  It still very much remains a mystery.
[01:24:47.153 --> 01:24:48.975]  I just wanted to ask Dr Roberts
[01:24:49.495 --> 01:24:55.678]  Has it become any clearer in your mind who was responsible for the downing of MH17?
[01:24:55.678 --> 01:25:06.262]  And will the NATO powers need to contrive or exploit a similar incident, maybe even on a bigger scale, to grease the skids for war against Russia in the future?
[01:25:09.915 --> 01:25:17.824]  It seems clear that Kiev was responsible and probably with Washington's complicity.
[01:25:17.824 --> 01:25:29.316]  And the reason this seems clear is that the Dutch government just the other day announced that they weren't releasing the results of the investigation.
[01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:43.482]  Because when the investigation was set up, an agreement was made that any participant in the investigation could veto its release.
[01:25:43.482 --> 01:25:50.405]  And apparently, Kev, the American puppet government, Kev,
[01:25:51.730 --> 01:26:10.466]  Is blocked the release and the Dutch minister in charge of all of this said that he thought it was more important to maintain good relations between the countries who were participating in the investigation than to release the results to the public.
[01:26:11.736 --> 01:26:21.000]  So, assuming this news report is correct, what that tells us is that we are not going to get the results.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:29.743]  And if you're not going to get the results, that means they're unfavorable to Kiev and to Washington.
[01:26:29.743 --> 01:26:36.346]  Clearly, if the results were unfavorable to Russia, they would be released.
[01:26:36.346 --> 01:26:41.128]  Russia is not part of the investigation and would have no veto
[01:26:41.883 --> 01:26:45.885]  Power over, at least that's my understanding from the news report.
[01:26:45.885 --> 01:26:51.048]  And regardless, if it was against Russia, it would be released.
[01:26:51.048 --> 01:26:53.209]  Think how long this has been going on.
[01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:57.471]  It doesn't take this long to figure out what happened.
[01:26:57.471 --> 01:26:59.492]  They're just not going to tell us.
[01:26:59.492 --> 01:27:06.156]  It's something that will just disappear from the news, like Ebola, like everything else.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:15.523]  So do you think there has to be a new Cassus Belli, a new justification to increase aggression against Russia?
[01:27:15.523 --> 01:27:19.604]  Or will they just ratchet up the sanctions and the tension as they've already been doing?
[01:27:19.604 --> 01:27:24.426]  Or will they need a new MH17 style incident to exploit?
[01:27:24.426 --> 01:27:26.747]  I don't think they need anything new.
[01:27:26.747 --> 01:27:30.549]  If they start the violence again against the separatists,
[01:27:32.101 --> 01:27:43.532]  What they hope is to draw Russia into it because what Washington really wants to do is to permanently break up the economic and political relations between Europe and Russia.
[01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:48.048]  And Putin knows this, and so he's not been drawn into it.
[01:27:48.048 --> 01:27:51.148]  He's not sending troops.
[01:27:51.148 --> 01:28:13.632]  He has essentially sacrificed the Russians in the separatist provinces in order to try to maintain his relationships with Europe, because he really understands that if Washington can break Russia from Europe, that Washington can continue with Europe as a vassal state.
[01:28:14.588 --> 01:28:25.286]  Whereas if the economic and political developments between Russia and Europe continue, Europe will be pulled away from Washington and be pulled out of NATO.
[01:28:26.528 --> 01:28:44.807]  And so he's willing to take the risk for the Russian residents in the in southeastern Ukraine in order to try to hold or to keep Europe from being irredeemably lost into American vassalage.
[01:28:44.807 --> 01:28:47.970]  So in my opinion, that's that's what's going on.
[01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:49.512]  It's going to be hard for them
[01:28:50.052 --> 01:29:00.855]  To get Russia into a war because of this, of what Putin sees, the consequences with Europe.
[01:29:00.855 --> 01:29:02.115]  Okay, David Knight?
[01:29:02.115 --> 01:29:05.336]  Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how this develops.
[01:29:05.336 --> 01:29:17.479]  And as we pointed out earlier, as what you said, Dr. Roberts, that if Hillary Clinton becomes president, we are going to see war because I think she's going to be there with a Republican Congress that is going to rubber stamp
[01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:20.872]  Everything that she would want to do.
[01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:24.953]  I wish we had more time to talk to you, but you can only stay with us to the bottom of the hour.
[01:29:24.953 --> 01:29:26.994]  And thank you for joining us.
[01:29:26.994 --> 01:29:30.295]  This is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts we've been talking to.
[01:29:30.295 --> 01:29:34.437]  You can find more of his analysis at paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:29:34.437 --> 01:29:38.418]  And of course we carry his articles very frequently at infowars.com.
[01:29:38.418 --> 01:29:39.539]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:40.419 --> 01:29:41.480]  Pleased to be with you.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.360]  We'll do it again.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.281]  Thank you.
[01:29:43.281 --> 01:29:46.823]  We're going to be right back with our reporters from Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:29:46.823 --> 01:29:49.245]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs, join us.
[01:29:49.245 --> 01:29:50.646]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.646 --> 01:29:53.167]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.167 --> 01:29:55.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.222 --> 01:30:01.543]  The experts are clear.
[01:30:01.543 --> 01:30:08.667]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:30:08.667 --> 01:30:14.930]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:18.532]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:30:18.652 --> 01:30:22.876]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:30:22.876 --> 01:30:28.200]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.201]  Not our iodine.
[01:30:29.201 --> 01:30:33.004]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:30:33.004 --> 01:30:35.546]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:32:07.185 --> 01:32:08.406]  Security alert.
[01:32:08.406 --> 01:32:10.406]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:10.406 --> 01:32:11.306]  Analysis.
[01:32:11.306 --> 01:32:12.007]  InfoWars.
[01:32:12.007 --> 01:32:14.107]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:14.107 --> 01:32:18.988]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:18.988 --> 01:32:20.029]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:20.029 --> 01:32:21.569]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.430]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:27.670]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:29.831]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:31.492]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.492 --> 01:32:34.314]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:34.314 --> 01:32:36.275]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:36.275 --> 01:32:40.318]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:40.318 --> 01:32:43.920]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.283]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:47.283 --> 01:32:48.263]  Imperative.
[01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:50.285]  Destroy 4th Minute TV.
[01:32:50.285 --> 01:32:54.828]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.828 --> 01:32:57.109]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:33:08.422 --> 01:33:11.965]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:11.965 --> 01:33:19.813]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.813 --> 01:33:21.134]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.134 --> 01:33:21.954]  I'm David Knight.
[01:33:21.954 --> 01:33:29.982]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us from the UK and we're going to be joining our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri to check on the status of what's going on there.
[01:33:30.908 --> 01:33:34.929]  Now, Silver Bullet is back in stock, but as usual, it's a limited supply.
[01:33:34.929 --> 01:33:39.170]  Once it runs out, it's probably going to take about six weeks to get another batch in.
[01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:46.151]  The reason that happens is because it's a really difficult, slow process to get silver in this kind of concentration.
[01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:51.152]  We have it concentrated to 30 parts per million in a pure base of deionized water.
[01:33:51.152 --> 01:33:56.233]  It's widely known that colloidal silver is a vital supplement for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
[01:33:56.793 --> 01:34:05.307]  Now, Infowarslife.com takes colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique that's free of toxic artificial additives.
[01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:11.837]  There's never been a more important time, especially with flu season coming up, to have a powerful and clean form of colloidal silver
[01:34:12.057 --> 01:34:14.078]  Within reach for you and your family.
[01:34:14.078 --> 01:34:20.282]  Go to Infowarslife.com to order Silver Bullet now or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:20.282 --> 01:34:25.065]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:25.945]  Silver Bullet.
[01:34:25.945 --> 01:34:27.866]  We've got them in for a limited time.
[01:34:27.866 --> 01:34:29.467]  Now let's go to Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:34:29.467 --> 01:34:31.448]  We have our reporters there.
[01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:33.430]  Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson have been
[01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:43.774]  Joe, what do you see?
[01:34:43.774 --> 01:34:49.496]  Joe Biggs, I'm standing outside of the Justice Center here in Clayton, Missouri.
[01:34:49.496 --> 01:34:53.478]  This is a little downtown area where most of the decisions are made for the laws.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.783]  This is where the police department is for Ferguson.
[01:34:56.783 --> 01:34:59.546]  So this is an area that everyone's keeping their eye on.
[01:34:59.546 --> 01:35:02.709]  This is where the decision is supposed to come down from the grand jury.
[01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:07.655]  And today, as you can see, if we pan over to the left, there is way more media out here today.
[01:35:07.655 --> 01:35:10.658]  There's a lot of police that we haven't seen patrolling the area.
[01:35:10.658 --> 01:35:14.502]  People walking around around the building as well.
[01:35:14.502 --> 01:35:15.463]  Another interesting thing.
[01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:20.567]  People are bracing for an explosion of civil unrest, I should say.
[01:35:20.567 --> 01:35:25.670]  I got a letter last night from an employee at a business in this area.
[01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:29.932]  And now what happened is the property manager sent out a letter to all their tenants.
[01:35:29.932 --> 01:35:36.136]  Now this is a building that houses a lot of different medical facilities, radiology, oncology, different things like that.
[01:35:36.136 --> 01:35:44.121]  And in the letter it says, due to the possibility of an uprise of civil unrest this weekend and next week,
[01:35:44.984 --> 01:35:53.168]  I warn you to stock up, to brace yourself basically, to keep the patients there all week, all weekend into the next week.
[01:35:53.168 --> 01:35:57.711]  And what they said they're going to do is they're going to lock the doors and not allow anyone to enter or leave.
[01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:03.794]  So they're going to lock medical patients down, workers in these buildings in case something happens.
[01:36:03.794 --> 01:36:07.596]  And they said they're going to cooperate with police and other government entities.
[01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:08.616]  Wow.
[01:36:08.616 --> 01:36:09.477]  Wow, that's amazing.
[01:36:10.263 --> 01:36:27.228]  And we've been talking a little bit about this between Paul Joseph Watson and I earlier in the program, how unfortunate that this is not about trying to get oversight or control of the police or setting limits or terms on the rules of engagement to try to stop this epidemic of violence, but it's become
[01:36:27.928 --> 01:36:43.375]  A race war it's something as part of that I think there's agent provocateurs that are threatening the police and that kind of feeds this whole mentality that they're trying to feed the police all the time that they are actually in a war on the streets and that the public are enemy combatants.
[01:36:44.568 --> 01:36:45.830]  Yeah, it's nothing like that.
[01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:48.393]  Last night, everyone was peacefully protesting.
[01:36:48.393 --> 01:36:57.625]  It didn't get out of control for, you know, maybe it was like five minutes, but it didn't get out of control until all these police officers showed up and they started lining up in riot gear.
[01:36:57.625 --> 01:37:01.390]  Before that, the people were just out protesting across the street in the parking lot.
[01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.750]  Yes.
[01:37:17.893 --> 01:37:19.614]  You guys are inciting the violence.
[01:37:19.614 --> 01:37:25.418]  We just wanted to say here, now you guys are showing up and you're trying to flex your muscle and make your presence known.
[01:37:25.418 --> 01:37:27.700]  So what a lot of people did is they got angry.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:33.684]  One of the police officers pepper sprayed a young woman and that agitated the crowd a lot.
[01:37:33.684 --> 01:37:36.706]  And what that did was push the protesters into the street.
[01:37:36.706 --> 01:37:38.587]  They began to block traffic.
[01:37:38.587 --> 01:37:42.690]  Jakar Jackson and I, once again, were standing in a very lawful spot.
[01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:49.894]  On the sidewalk, we were once again pushed by the police into the road, into an unlawful area where we're impeding the flow of traffic.
[01:37:49.894 --> 01:37:56.657]  And then last night, yet again, they bomb rushed everybody, pushed them into a dark parking lot, started throwing people to the ground.
[01:37:56.657 --> 01:37:58.598]  Someone said they were shot with a rubber bullet.
[01:37:58.598 --> 01:38:01.219]  I didn't personally see that, but that's what was said.
[01:38:01.219 --> 01:38:03.480]  There was a lot of scuffling going on.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.022]  One man fought with the police for a minute, was thrown to the ground.
[01:38:06.022 --> 01:38:10.864]  Three people were arrested last night, one 17 years old, one 19, and one 25.
[01:38:13.427 --> 01:38:22.970]  We're watching anybody who's looking at the video feed, the broadcast, can see the footage that you guys shot, the B-roll that's there, the police confronting people.
[01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:24.951]  And that's exactly it, Joe.
[01:38:24.951 --> 01:38:27.352]  They're getting needlessly confrontational.
[01:38:27.352 --> 01:38:37.035]  There was an article just this last week, it was on NPR, I think, and they were talking about how some of the remote areas of Alaska might start to arm their policemen.
[01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:41.516]  Says it's the last area in America where the police aren't armed at all.
[01:38:41.516 --> 01:38:44.757]  They basically go out and what they do is they talk to people.
[01:38:44.757 --> 01:38:46.758]  They don't try to get confrontational with them.
[01:38:46.758 --> 01:38:58.162]  As a matter of fact, they talked to a police officer and he said part of the job is trying to talk to people in a non-confrontational way and yet we see just the opposite here.
[01:38:58.542 --> 01:38:59.623]  Yeah.
[01:38:59.623 --> 01:39:03.644]  I mean, that's de-escalating the situation without a show of force.
[01:39:03.644 --> 01:39:05.645]  That makes someone a lot more comfortable.
[01:39:05.645 --> 01:39:12.608]  When someone comes up to you with a shotgun pointed at you, wearing riot gear, in your mind you're thinking, alright, this person means business.
[01:39:12.608 --> 01:39:14.369]  They're not trying to negotiate with me.
[01:39:14.369 --> 01:39:20.132]  You don't see negotiators who go into a hostage situation with a gun and a shield.
[01:39:20.132 --> 01:39:21.972]  No, they go dressed down, no gun on.
[01:39:21.972 --> 01:39:23.193]  They go in, they confront the
[01:39:23.752 --> 01:39:28.736]  The hostage taker and they talk to them one-on-one because that's the only way you can de-escalate a situation.
[01:39:28.736 --> 01:39:37.064]  You don't go in there with guns because all that does is incite more violence and make people uneasy about themselves and put themselves in a defensive posture.
[01:39:37.637 --> 01:39:42.860]  I think they've been trying to incite this thing from day one, as I mentioned to Paul earlier.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:48.883]  If they had this evidence and they knew what was happening, they had a deposition, they didn't give anybody any indication of this.
[01:39:48.883 --> 01:39:58.969]  They wanted to build this up into a racial confrontation, into a confrontation that further enforces this idea amongst the police that they're at war.
[01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:02.311]  Paul, did you have a question that you wanted to ask Joe while he's there?
[01:40:03.086 --> 01:40:05.528]  Yeah, I was just reading a headline that's just come out.
[01:40:05.528 --> 01:40:14.595]  Masked Ferguson protesters with guns threaten violence, which is basically a YouTube video of some people dressed up in black ski masks threatening violence.
[01:40:14.595 --> 01:40:27.285]  I just wanted to ask Joe if it was part of the conversation amongst the demonstrators, if they were aware of the fact that there are outside agitators, as there were back in August, planning maybe to escalate it from their side.
[01:40:27.285 --> 01:40:28.986]  Is that something that people are talking about?
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:36.184]  Um, there's a lot of people out there making, uh, empty threats, you know, via social media.
[01:40:36.184 --> 01:40:42.688]  All the people that we've seen on the ground out here, these protests, when the cameras aren't on them, you know, they're out there hugging.
[01:40:42.688 --> 01:40:46.410]  You see black people, white people hugging each other, talking, laughing, joking.
[01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:51.693]  And for some reason, they only, the mainstream media always catches people when they're yelling at the police officers.
[01:40:51.693 --> 01:40:52.514]  So it seems like
[01:40:52.975 --> 01:40:55.557]  All the people here are just angry and they want to fight.
[01:40:55.557 --> 01:41:00.861]  You know, about the video you're talking about, I saw that about four days ago, and I did a little research myself.
[01:41:00.861 --> 01:41:10.849]  That's actually a group out of Atlanta, so that's not something here in Ferguson, but Atlanta's another spot where they're talking about having demonstrations after this grand jury decision comes down.
[01:41:11.912 --> 01:41:30.425]  You know, we have an article on InfoWars from Max Slavo where he's talking about outside agitators, and one in particular, Elisa Fithian, who he says was partly responsible for organizing the violent protests in the battle for Seattle, essentially saying, you know, we need to take this to people
[01:41:31.165 --> 01:41:32.266]  Who don't look like me.
[01:41:32.266 --> 01:41:33.907]  I'm presuming that she's black.
[01:41:33.907 --> 01:41:37.470]  I haven't watched the video, so I don't know if she's black or white, but I'm presuming that's what it is.
[01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:42.134]  Again, an outside agitator feeding this racial divide.
[01:41:42.134 --> 01:41:47.638]  We're going to have Eric Rush joining us in the next hour.
[01:41:47.638 --> 01:41:50.220]  He's an author of Negrophilia from Slave
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.421]  Well, what we're hearing so far today, and I believe
[01:42:21.053 --> 01:42:25.762]  At this time, this is probably the truest thing we've gotten so far and that's because of the large...
[01:42:27.102 --> 01:42:32.387]  You know, influx of all these mainstream media people that are starting to show up now and the heavy police presence today.
[01:42:32.387 --> 01:42:39.673]  What we're being told is that the grand jury is going to call the family and give them a 48 hour advance notice.
[01:42:39.673 --> 01:42:50.021]  So today is the day that they're supposed to call the family and also warn the military and the police in the area for what's going to happen after this decision comes out.
[01:42:50.021 --> 01:42:51.683]  But, you know, from the people I've talked to,
[01:42:52.183 --> 01:42:59.187]  In Ferguson, last night on the streets, they all know that the family, once they get that information, there will be a leak.
[01:42:59.187 --> 01:43:01.248]  They're going to make phone calls, they're going to tell somebody.
[01:43:01.248 --> 01:43:04.970]  And somebody on that inner circle is going to want to be the person that releases it out.
[01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:11.873]  And I have a feeling by tonight, we'll know whether or not Darren Wilson is going to be indicted on these charges or not.
[01:43:11.873 --> 01:43:17.156]  But what they're saying is they're going to try and wait and publicly let the media know on Sunday, 48 hours later.
[01:43:17.156 --> 01:43:18.597]  But I have a feeling that's not going to happen.
[01:43:19.389 --> 01:43:26.018]  Yeah, that's going to leak out and that's going to get Obama's amnesty off of the top of the headlines, isn't it?
[01:43:26.018 --> 01:43:28.781]  Well, yeah, that's the plan anyways, you know.
[01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:33.027]  Let's go ahead and cover that up with a Ferguson burka.
[01:43:33.027 --> 01:43:34.328]  That's right.
[01:43:34.328 --> 01:43:36.211]  Paul, did you have another question that you wanted to ask Joe?
[01:43:37.014 --> 01:43:43.376]  Yeah, just reading some breaking news actually, Ferguson schools are going to be closed Monday and Tuesday.
[01:43:43.376 --> 01:43:46.417]  That's not confirmed, but it seems like a pretty strong rumour.
[01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:57.161]  So if this decision is announced today, it looks like that any trouble, any violence, if it happens, they expect it to happen on Sunday after that 48-hour notice.
[01:43:57.161 --> 01:43:59.201]  Schools are closed on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:43:59.201 --> 01:44:00.242]  Just wanted to ask Joe if
[01:44:01.358 --> 01:44:07.222]  Officer Darren Wilson has suggested that he will resign no matter what happens with the grand jury case.
[01:44:07.222 --> 01:44:12.345]  Do you think that will serve to de-escalate any of the tensions or will it not make any difference?
[01:44:13.218 --> 01:44:14.520]  I don't think it's going to make any difference.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:24.070]  You know, like I said, Ferguson has this gaping wound and it's been festering now for months on end because this has taken, quite honestly, too long to come to a decision on.
[01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:29.235]  You know, they've been teeter-tottering with the media, you know, acting like they're going to release the information.
[01:44:29.235 --> 01:44:30.877]  People around here are fed up.
[01:44:30.877 --> 01:44:31.778]  They're tired.
[01:44:31.778 --> 01:44:35.742]  The hate's been built up for this guy, you know, regardless if they indict him or not.
[01:44:36.082 --> 01:44:38.423]  He's not ever going to be a police officer again, I don't think.
[01:44:38.423 --> 01:44:41.365]  His face has been on too many TV screens throughout America.
[01:44:41.365 --> 01:44:47.269]  I don't foresee him ever having a police beat job where he's going up and down the street patrolling whatsoever.
[01:44:47.269 --> 01:44:52.872]  So regardless of that outcome, you know, it's probably in his best interest to quit.
[01:44:52.872 --> 01:44:59.115]  And from what I heard too, they're going to give him a nice little $500,000 payout for that as well.
[01:44:59.115 --> 01:45:00.116]  Whoa.
[01:45:00.116 --> 01:45:00.836]  Whoa.
[01:45:00.836 --> 01:45:04.659]  I want to ask you if you've, you say the people that are there, they're kind of civil
[01:45:06.001 --> 01:45:07.622]  What is the sense that you get from people there?
[01:45:07.622 --> 01:45:11.405]  I mean, are they looking at any solutions that they're proposing?
[01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:12.306]  Have they proposed anything?
[01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:20.072]  I mean, we talked earlier about Frank Serpico's op-ed piece for Politico that came out about three weeks ago.
[01:45:20.072 --> 01:45:31.121]  He had six specific proposals, things like community involvement from police officers, and that means a lot more than just having a certain percentage of people who are black and a certain percentage of white.
[01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:33.343]  He's talking about something that's far deeper than that.
[01:45:33.343 --> 01:45:34.444]  He's talking about having
[01:45:35.405 --> 01:45:40.430]  Not that I know of.
[01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:52.902]  I haven't heard anything to that nature whatsoever, but when you go out and you talk to people out here on the streets, when you ask them, what do you think's going on?
[01:45:52.902 --> 01:45:57.866]  First thing they do, they roll their eyes, they put their head down, and it's that Ferguson fatigue.
[01:45:57.866 --> 01:45:59.328]  It's setting for everybody.
[01:45:59.679 --> 01:46:01.080]  In this area, in the surrounding St.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:03.262]  Louis area, everyone's tired of this.
[01:46:03.262 --> 01:46:04.763]  They just want it to be over with.
[01:46:04.763 --> 01:46:08.587]  But you have a lot of the young protesters who are really angry.
[01:46:08.587 --> 01:46:14.431]  They don't have the same life experiences as the older people who've lived in Ferguson for 50, 60 years.
[01:46:14.431 --> 01:46:18.735]  You know, the older crowds that we talked to, they just wanted to be over with regardless of the situation.
[01:46:18.735 --> 01:46:20.156]  They want everyone to be peaceful.
[01:46:20.156 --> 01:46:23.139]  But a lot of the younger people, they're mad, they're angry, they don't know how to
[01:46:24.366 --> 01:46:27.533]  To focus that anger in a positive way.
[01:46:27.533 --> 01:46:31.302]  And what we're hearing a lot of is people want to come down to Clayton.
[01:46:31.302 --> 01:46:33.908]  They want to riot in this area because this is where the decisions are made.
[01:46:34.244 --> 01:46:41.629]  But when you talk to a lot of the citizens in Ferguson as well, what they're thinking of, what they're more worried about are the outside agitators.
[01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:47.894]  They know that they've had discussions with a lot of these young adults who live in Ferguson, and they've talked to them.
[01:46:47.894 --> 01:46:50.636]  They said, hey, destroying our neighborhood is not going to do anything.
[01:46:50.636 --> 01:46:52.057]  It's only going to harm you.
[01:46:52.057 --> 01:46:53.838]  You know, you're going to grow up, you're going to want to have kids.
[01:46:53.838 --> 01:46:56.320]  You can't raise kids in a burnt down city.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.221]  So think about that.
[01:46:57.628 --> 01:47:09.831]  But what they're worried about now are these outside agitators from other states coming in, who are professional protesters, rioters, anarchists, who feed off of that anger, that energy, and they just want total and complete chaos.
[01:47:09.831 --> 01:47:12.331]  And that's what people in this area are worried about.
[01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:25.414]  The people are going to come in here, burn the city down, and then fly back to their homes in California, New York, Chicago, wherever it may be, and go back into their cozy homes or apartments and sit back and watch everything go up in flames on Fox and CNN.
[01:47:26.368 --> 01:47:35.516]  Yeah, that's the problem, and that is, you know, that they're not going to focus this in any positive way that could really make it better for that community or make it better for anywhere else.
[01:47:35.516 --> 01:47:49.008]  And as Paul pointed out, they always like to pick these ambiguous situations where they can get both sides even more at war with each other, even more angry, try to balkanize the population even more into racial groups or whatever.
[01:47:49.008 --> 01:47:52.732]  Paul, do you have any other comments that you wanted to, questions you wanted to ask Joe while he's there?
[01:47:53.277 --> 01:48:10.566]  Yeah, I was just wondering from being on the ground there, Joe, we've seen comments by some of the protesters about moving away from West Florissant, which I believe is the main area where they've been congregated, and going to South Florissant, because that's where the white people live, is basically what they're saying.
[01:48:10.566 --> 01:48:20.571]  Where do you think these protests will be situated, and are they going to target businesses again, or is this just going to be a general street protest from what you can see there on the ground?
[01:48:21.263 --> 01:48:25.586]  Well, South Florissant is right where the police station and fire department is.
[01:48:25.586 --> 01:48:30.469]  Now, back on Halloween, they called a vandal.
[01:48:30.469 --> 01:48:32.790]  That was a term that Fox 2 used.
[01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:39.955]  Someone hit a transformer and knocked out the power in that area and it actually took out the power to the police department and the fire station.
[01:48:39.955 --> 01:48:43.597]  So, that was one of the threats by one of the militants was to hit the power grid.
[01:48:43.928 --> 01:48:45.008]  And take that out.
[01:48:45.008 --> 01:48:47.409]  But it's not gonna be South Florissant that I'm hearing.
[01:48:47.409 --> 01:48:48.229]  I'm hearing it's what it's called.
[01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:49.590]  They call it South City.
[01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:51.250]  South City is where we're at now.
[01:48:51.250 --> 01:48:53.711]  Like Clayton, this is a predominantly white area.
[01:48:53.711 --> 01:48:57.212]  A lot of ritzy neighborhoods just south of here in that area.
[01:48:57.212 --> 01:49:01.794]  This is where the agitators, the militants are focusing a lot of their anger on.
[01:49:02.174 --> 01:49:07.758]  Because like I said, this is the Justice Center, the courthouse is right over here, the police station is right over here.
[01:49:07.758 --> 01:49:09.419]  This is where all the laws are made.
[01:49:09.419 --> 01:49:15.062]  These are the people they blame for not handling the situation about the death of Mike Brown very well.
[01:49:15.062 --> 01:49:18.384]  And they're very mad at these, the lawmakers, the politicians.
[01:49:18.809 --> 01:49:21.491]  And the higher ups in the police force in this area.
[01:49:21.491 --> 01:49:24.534]  So the word on the street, we spoke to a preacher the other day, too.
[01:49:24.534 --> 01:49:33.701]  He believes that this is where most of the violence will be focused on here in the Clayton area, around the courthouse, the Justice Center, and surrounding white areas as well.
[01:49:33.701 --> 01:49:41.307]  That's why a lot of the schools in the area that you heard about will possibly shut down on Monday and Tuesday, just because they want a brace for the worst.
[01:49:41.307 --> 01:49:44.469]  Everyone's hoping for the best, but we saw what happened in August.
[01:49:44.469 --> 01:49:46.131]  And with the National Guard being called in,
[01:49:46.951 --> 01:49:50.452]  The pictures I saw yesterday of people following them coming into St.
[01:49:50.452 --> 01:49:57.195]  Louis, right now as we speak they should be setting up around that red perimeter that we have a picture that Kit Daniels did an article right now.
[01:49:57.195 --> 01:50:04.077]  They're supposed to have National Guard set up at different areas and posting up and waiting on that verdict so when it happens they can close in.
[01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:09.139]  And try to de-escalate the situation, I guess, as best as they can.
[01:50:09.139 --> 01:50:11.500]  But at the end of the day, they're going to strip people's liberties away.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:19.444]  Like I said, they're already telling local businesses that they're going to lock the doors and keep anybody who's inside locked in there for as long as they have to.
[01:50:20.233 --> 01:50:27.697]  Well, you know, getting in people's faces with guns and shields and tanks isn't really going to de-escalate the situation, as you pointed out earlier, Joe.
[01:50:27.697 --> 01:50:29.338]  It's only going to escalate it.
[01:50:29.338 --> 01:50:32.360]  It's going to make the people that are there very angry.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.480]  It's going to increase the anger.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.802]  And, of course, we have agent provocateurs from outside the area there as well.
[01:50:38.963 --> 01:50:48.251]  A violent confrontation is only going to make this thing worse unless they come forward with real concrete proposals, and those are going to have to come from outside of City Hall.
[01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:52.655]  If the community could get itself together to have some proposals like that, that would really help.
[01:50:52.655 --> 01:50:54.256]  But we've got to go to commercial break.
[01:50:54.256 --> 01:50:55.197]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:55.197 --> 01:50:56.979]  We've got our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:50:56.979 --> 01:50:58.920]  I've got Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:50:59.421]  Stay with us.

[01:51:59.219 --> 01:52:02.040]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:07.162]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:52:07.162 --> 01:52:15.285]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:15.285 --> 01:52:19.807]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:52:19.807 --> 01:52:23.788]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:23.788 --> 01:52:28.490]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working
[01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.710]  I think?
[01:52:58.710 --> 01:53:04.014]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:53:04.014 --> 01:53:10.960]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:18.445]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[01:54:09.551 --> 01:54:10.992]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:10.992 --> 01:54:15.936]  On this Friday, November 21st, we have our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:54:15.936 --> 01:54:17.177]  We just talked to Joe Biggs.
[01:54:17.177 --> 01:54:19.339]  We're going to go back to Jakari Jackson there.
[01:54:19.339 --> 01:54:29.687]  They've been there all week observing the build-up to the grand jury verdict that is expected to be released today, at least perhaps as Joe was telling us.
[01:54:30.507 --> 01:54:34.291]  Secretly or confidentially to the family of Michael Brown.
[01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:36.312]  That's probably not going to stay confidential.
[01:54:36.312 --> 01:54:38.734]  They expect this to erupt this weekend.
[01:54:38.734 --> 01:54:42.998]  We also have Paul Joseph Watson on the line with us as co-host from the UK.
[01:54:42.998 --> 01:54:45.581]  Let's go back to Ferguson to Jakari Jackson.
[01:54:45.581 --> 01:54:45.941]  Jakari.
[01:54:46.912 --> 01:54:47.292]  Yes.
[01:54:47.292 --> 01:54:49.193]  Sir, did you have something that you wanted to add?
[01:54:49.193 --> 01:54:49.533]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:49.533 --> 01:54:52.174]  You know, he doesn't typically have a guy talking to us off camera.
[01:54:52.174 --> 01:54:54.415]  Ja'Kari Jackson from Clayton, Missouri.
[01:54:54.415 --> 01:55:03.719]  Joe Biggs was just telling me we had a breaking news situation that the prosecutor is ready to have a press conference to announce some of the things that are going on with the Darien Wilson trial.
[01:55:03.719 --> 01:55:07.460]  So as soon as we're done here, we'll try to get over there and see if we can get into that.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:11.262]  But meanwhile, yeah, we've talked to a lot of people who are in the area.
[01:55:11.262 --> 01:55:14.743]  The gentleman who was just speaking to us off camera, he was saying that he didn't expect
[01:55:15.347 --> 01:55:18.409]  The outcome to be all that bad as far as the street response.
[01:55:18.409 --> 01:55:23.513]  He didn't so much expect to see the riots and the protests and all the things that we've seen previously.
[01:55:23.513 --> 01:55:27.296]  A lot of people that we've talked to, they have varying degrees of concern.
[01:55:27.296 --> 01:55:29.838]  Some people think it's gonna be worse than it was back in August.
[01:55:29.838 --> 01:55:33.201]  Some people think it's just gonna be a minor thing, so only time will tell.
[01:55:33.761 --> 01:55:42.427]  But I do agree that, you know, once this thing is announced, you know, whether the prosecutor tells us exactly what's going on or they kind of string us along and just, you know, how they do.
[01:55:42.427 --> 01:55:43.989]  You've dealt with these PIOs.
[01:55:43.989 --> 01:55:45.450]  Oh yeah.
[01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:49.112]  They give you just enough to say that they gave you something even though they didn't tell you anything at all.
[01:55:49.112 --> 01:55:49.533]  That's right.
[01:55:49.533 --> 01:55:52.735]  So I don't have the highest hopes, but we'll go try to check it out regardless.
[01:55:53.295 --> 01:55:56.558]  So, the people here, they're getting prepared, regardless of what that means for them.
[01:55:56.558 --> 01:56:01.422]  Some people have purchased firearms, some people have purchased food, some of the schools have closed down.
[01:56:01.422 --> 01:56:03.924]  And Joe, did you have something you wanted to share?
[01:56:03.924 --> 01:56:05.465]  Well, you guys reported earlier.
[01:56:05.465 --> 01:56:06.506]  You reported earlier this week.
[01:56:06.506 --> 01:56:10.069]  Hold on, breaking news real quick.
[01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:16.754]  Barnes Christian Hospital has three floors that have been cleared out in anticipation of the victims of rioting.
[01:56:16.754 --> 01:56:21.658]  One floor for injured police, one floor for injured protesters, one floor for injured police family members.
[01:56:21.658 --> 01:56:22.459]  That's happening right now.
[01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:28.676]  Wow, they didn't have any space for media, but okay.
[01:56:28.676 --> 01:56:34.241]  We have the infidel, so thank you all.
[01:56:34.241 --> 01:56:35.743]  It's a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:56:35.743 --> 01:56:39.326]  People are making preparations, regardless if you think this is a big deal or not.
[01:56:39.326 --> 01:56:40.948]  The people here are making serious preparations.
[01:56:40.948 --> 01:56:42.109]  You just heard about the hospital.
[01:56:42.469 --> 01:56:44.550]  The National Guard is ready to move.
[01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:46.311]  We see the cops already out in riot gear.
[01:56:46.311 --> 01:56:49.252]  At least they go out to the protests there in riot gear and all that.
[01:56:49.252 --> 01:56:52.654]  So the people here on the ground are taking this very seriously.
[01:56:52.654 --> 01:56:57.056]  The majority of people I've talked to since I've been here, they're peaceful people.
[01:56:57.056 --> 01:56:59.037]  They do expect some agent provocateurs.
[01:56:59.037 --> 01:57:04.120]  If you guys see that video I posted, not last night but the night before, I talked to the guy in the Guy Fawkes mask.
[01:57:04.804 --> 01:57:14.494]  And he was saying that the majority of the people here are good, peaceful people, but they do expect the agent provocateurs and people who just want to come in and kick up stuff to burn down, to riot, to loot.
[01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:19.219]  They do expect those people to come in, but by and large, the crowds here are mostly peaceful.
[01:57:19.219 --> 01:57:19.800]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.802]  And as you guys reported earlier this week,
[01:57:22.442 --> 01:57:25.805]  Gun sales are up 300% in some cases at some of these stores.
[01:57:25.805 --> 01:57:30.148]  They're saying that 75% of those sales are first-time gun owners.
[01:57:30.148 --> 01:57:33.230]  So you guys have got your infidel body armor there.
[01:57:33.230 --> 01:57:35.131]  Hopefully you're going to be safe in this.
[01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:38.173]  But like you said, they don't have a floor for reporters.
[01:57:38.173 --> 01:57:39.054]  That's amazing news.
[01:57:39.054 --> 01:57:40.575]  They've cleared away three floors.
[01:57:40.575 --> 01:57:44.978]  One for protesters, one for police, and one for the families of police.
[01:57:44.978 --> 01:57:46.599]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[01:57:46.599 --> 01:57:49.541]  And that's that kind of agent provocateuring where
[01:57:49.881 --> 01:57:56.164]  Yeah, because you remember, David, that came out earlier this week, the list of targets that got released.
[01:57:56.164 --> 01:58:01.886]  You know, there's many things on there, including Monsanto, other local businesses, and also many officers' families.
[01:58:01.886 --> 01:58:12.951]  And to anybody out there watching, if you think that targeting the families of these officers is going to do anything besides just agitate them to the point where they will have no patience, I'm not exactly sure what you're expecting to happen.
[01:58:13.551 --> 01:58:19.254]  It just feeds the narrative that this is a war zone, and that's not the message we need to be sending to our police.
[01:58:19.254 --> 01:58:21.135]  We need to be sending a different message to them.
[01:58:21.135 --> 01:58:21.975]  Well, thank you.
[01:58:21.975 --> 01:58:23.196]  Thank you, Jakari.
[01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:25.877]  We're going to stay up with you to see what's happening there.
[01:58:25.877 --> 01:58:27.598]  Of course, there's a press release coming up.
[01:58:27.598 --> 01:58:29.599]  We have agent provocateurs that are covert.
[01:58:29.599 --> 01:58:34.782]  We also have overt agent provocateurs like Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, the FBI informant.
[01:58:34.782 --> 01:58:35.962]  Oh, they don't like Al Sharpton.
[01:58:35.962 --> 01:58:37.103]  We talked to some people yesterday.
[01:58:37.103 --> 01:58:37.423]  That's right.
[01:58:37.423 --> 01:58:38.404]  We're going to be right back.
[01:58:38.404 --> 01:58:38.804]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.614 --> 01:58:46.600]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:55.304]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:58:55.304 --> 01:59:01.628]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:59:01.628 --> 01:59:08.934]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:59:08.934 --> 01:59:18.841]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:59:19.421 --> 01:59:25.585]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:59:25.585 --> 01:59:30.429]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:34.031]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:59:34.031 --> 01:59:35.912]  No needles, no injections.
[01:59:35.912 --> 01:59:37.553]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:59:37.553 --> 01:59:38.754]  Try it for yourself.
[01:59:38.754 --> 01:59:41.076]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:59:52.444 --> 01:59:55.066]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.061 --> 02:00:07.362]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.362 --> 02:00:09.123]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.123 --> 02:00:10.884]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.884 --> 02:00:12.465]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.465 --> 02:00:14.026]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.026 --> 02:00:18.208]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.208 --> 02:00:22.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.191 --> 02:00:29.473]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.473 --> 02:00:32.879]  I'm David Knight in Austin, joined with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[02:00:32.879 --> 02:00:39.430]  We were just talking to our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, as people there are awaiting the grand jury's verdict.
[02:00:40.259 --> 02:00:45.382]  And of course we're talking about the agent provocateurs who are threatening the police, threatening their family.
[02:00:45.382 --> 02:00:49.745]  Joe Biggs broke the news that they are clearing out three floors of the hospital there.
[02:00:49.745 --> 02:00:54.568]  One for police, one for protesters, and one for the families of the police.
[02:00:54.568 --> 02:00:58.871]  That is not the message that the people need to be sending to the police.
[02:00:58.871 --> 02:00:59.812]  They need to come together.
[02:00:59.812 --> 02:01:08.277]  They're going to have to reform the situation in that community as well as other communities of the rules of engagement of the police.
[02:01:08.277 --> 02:01:09.298]  But all this does
[02:01:09.918 --> 02:01:10.138]  Yes.
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:30.421]  We're going to be talking in the next segment to Eric Rush.
[02:01:30.421 --> 02:01:40.025]  He's the author of Negrophilia from Slave Block to Pedestal and he takes on the race pimps like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.
[02:01:40.025 --> 02:01:50.069]  He takes them on directly and he talks about what's really behind this and of course that's the other unfortunate outcome that they've engineered here in Ferguson is to turn it into
[02:01:50.889 --> 02:01:52.471]  Uh, one race against another.
[02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:16.136]  Uh, control of the police as well as mandating police involvement in the community.
[02:02:16.136 --> 02:02:27.288]  Not just hiring a certain number of people of one race or the other because if they're not actively involved in the community, whether they're white or black, they're going to identify more as being blue than anything else.
[02:02:27.288 --> 02:02:29.851]  Paul, your comments on what we just heard from Ferguson.
[02:02:31.403 --> 02:02:39.090]  Yeah, it's interesting that they're having a press conference on it, because obviously we thought there would be a delay before the decision, the actual announcement of it.
[02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:41.793]  There's an interesting article out in the Washington Times though.
[02:02:41.793 --> 02:02:45.356]  Americans say officers should not be indicted, 81% predict violent reaction.
[02:02:47.478 --> 02:02:59.526]  So only one in four Americans believe that white police officer Darren Wilson should be charged with murder by the grand jury in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, according to a poll released Friday.
[02:02:59.526 --> 02:03:03.409]  So only one in four believe that he's guilty of murder.
[02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:11.994]  81% predict a violent reaction and only 10% predict that there will be no violent reaction whatsoever.
[02:03:11.994 --> 02:03:17.018]  So that kind of squares with what we were talking about earlier regarding the ambiguity of the shooting itself.
[02:03:17.878 --> 02:03:29.967]  I understand people's, you know, I understand the black community looking at this verdict and saying they're getting away with it yet again because we've seen so many clear-cut cases where the police do not police themselves.
[02:03:29.967 --> 02:03:31.929]  And that was one of the things that Frank Serpico said.
[02:03:31.929 --> 02:03:34.490]  He said, get over the idea that the police are going to police themselves.
[02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:38.013]  It's not going to happen without outside oversight.
[02:03:38.013 --> 02:03:41.576]  But there are cases where there are justified police shootings.
[02:03:42.516 --> 02:03:44.797]  It's such a long history of the other kind.
[02:03:44.797 --> 02:03:55.622]  I can see that many people there are going to go ahead and take out their frustration and their anger at the system by just striking out blindly in violence rather than trying to change the system from the outside.
[02:03:57.150 --> 02:04:07.973]  Well precisely, I mentioned the case earlier, there was actually a few years ago, I forgot the name of the individual, but it was on the guy on the subway that was basically murdered in cold blood, that was a black guy I believe.
[02:04:07.973 --> 02:04:17.716]  Then recently the case in New York, the guy selling cigarettes basically put in a chokehold by a police officer, choked him to death.
[02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:22.198]  And again, we didn't see any kind of mass protest over that incident.
[02:04:22.198 --> 02:04:22.538]  Exactly.
[02:04:22.858 --> 02:04:25.859]  It was flagrantly an example of police brutality.
[02:04:25.859 --> 02:04:28.479]  There was no debate about it whatsoever.
[02:04:28.479 --> 02:04:34.741]  I think there's a lot of people who, you know, we talk about people putting up with the police violence against the black community.
[02:04:34.741 --> 02:04:38.822]  Most of these truly egregious situations are against the homeless.
[02:04:38.822 --> 02:04:42.903]  And people in this country seem to have absolutely no sympathy for the homeless.
[02:04:42.903 --> 02:04:49.365]  They have no sympathy whatsoever, even to the extent of allowing the people, as we talked to the 90-year-old gentleman,
[02:04:49.725 --> 02:04:52.567]  He's been threatened with jail multiple times because he's feeding the homeless.
[02:04:52.567 --> 02:04:59.391]  They certainly don't care if they beat a homeless man to death on the streets like they did Kelly Thomas in California and get away with it.
[02:04:59.391 --> 02:05:00.151]  We're going to be right back.
[02:05:00.151 --> 02:05:01.972]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.972 --> 02:05:05.635]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:06.495 --> 02:05:10.960]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:18.266]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:05:18.266 --> 02:05:27.355]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:27.555 --> 02:05:33.099]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:22.462]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:07:22.662 --> 02:07:22.962]  I think?
[02:07:37.639 --> 02:07:37.859]  I think so.
[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:22.313]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:22.313 --> 02:08:27.015]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.444 --> 02:08:31.765]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:31.765 --> 02:08:32.465]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:32.465 --> 02:08:35.808]  We have Paul Joseph Watson with us from the UK.
[02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:41.752]  And joining us now is Eric Rush, author of Negrophilia, from Slave Block to Pedestal.
[02:08:41.752 --> 02:08:46.375]  You know, we've seen Al Sharpton and Ferguson, as well as Jesse Jackson, show up.
[02:08:46.375 --> 02:08:50.557]  They always show up, as Paul put it, at these ambiguous situations.
[02:08:50.557 --> 02:08:53.660]  When there's a clear-cut injustice, you don't usually see them.
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:09:00.124]  But when it's something that is kind of ambiguous, and they can use that to really separate the races, you know, because
[02:09:00.684 --> 02:09:15.178]  It looked like for at the beginning everything that we were hearing sounded like it was yet another case of an unjustified use of force by the police and then after they let that narrative simmer for quite some time and built up a lot of attention over that
[02:09:15.938 --> 02:09:20.140]  They then start releasing evidence that would clear the officer.
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:26.102]  So it looks like a deliberate manipulation as well as the timing of this grand jury verdict.
[02:09:26.102 --> 02:09:32.085]  And of course anybody that knows anything about grand juries knows that they're very, they're not the same as a regular jury.
[02:09:32.085 --> 02:09:34.986]  Juries are pretty much under the influence of judges.
[02:09:35.846 --> 02:09:44.271]  In many cases, unfortunately, they act as a rubber stamp for the judge, not taking into account their right and their duty to judge the law as well as the facts of the case.
[02:09:44.271 --> 02:09:49.834]  So they don't usually think independently, but certainly with a grand jury, that is the case.
[02:09:49.834 --> 02:09:53.716]  As many people point out, you can indict a ham sandwich with a right grand jury.
[02:09:53.716 --> 02:09:55.778]  So this timing is very suspicious.
[02:09:55.778 --> 02:09:57.719]  But joining us now is Eric Rush.
[02:09:57.719 --> 02:10:01.941]  I want to talk to him about the way they have built up racial tension here.
[02:10:01.941 --> 02:10:03.202]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Rush.
[02:10:04.099 --> 02:10:06.340]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:17.462]  Now, we see this over and over again, as you point out, and you call out Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, the people who have basically made a career out of exacerbating race relations wherever they can go.
[02:10:17.462 --> 02:10:28.745]  You kind of call them out as to, you know, to doing this, but you also have something else, I think, that's very interesting to say about this whole notion that they've sold us about white privilege.
[02:10:28.745 --> 02:10:31.566]  I'll let you have the floor and explain your thesis to us.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:51.135]  Well, the fact of the matter is that it's kind of, as I talk about in my book, Negrophilia, from Slave Lock to Pedestal, America's Racial Obsession, you know, you have on the one hand the political left that is really exploiting black Americans.
[02:10:51.135 --> 02:10:56.739]  I mean, in a way, they're sort of like the new plantation owners.
[02:10:56.739 --> 02:10:58.981]  But then the other side of the coin is that
[02:10:59.661 --> 02:11:00.321]  I think?
[02:11:17.882 --> 02:11:35.824]  In the events leading up to his unfortunate demise are not only not being looked at in a, you know, in a realistic context, they're just been, they've just been surrealistically spun in the other direction.
[02:11:36.344 --> 02:11:55.140]  And I believe that that has to do with, you know, I believe that has to do not only with the economic imperative that some activists, Jesse, Al, the rest of them have for, you know, advancing the idea that America is still an institutionally racist nation,
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.444]  But I think that there are other political motivations going on.
[02:12:00.444 --> 02:12:14.377]  We can get into the administration and Eric Holder and all of them if you want, but it is part of this racial orthodoxy that has been advanced.
[02:12:15.018 --> 02:12:30.043]  It really has been advanced to the detriment of blacks and to the benefit of people who either politically or economically or both are profiting from this, you know, advancing this twisted worldview.
[02:12:30.043 --> 02:12:33.985]  Yeah, we even see like in the recent election we see Mary Landrieu in Louisiana.
[02:12:34.779 --> 02:12:43.025]  Who made the amazing claim that her sinking popularity and the sinking popularity of Obama was because people didn't like women and blacks.
[02:12:43.025 --> 02:12:53.413]  When Obama's been elected twice, she's been elected three times, she can't admit that this could be something about what they're doing, their actual actions, their policies.
[02:12:53.413 --> 02:12:57.235]  Essentially, the pedestal has completely swung the other way, hasn't it?
[02:12:57.235 --> 02:13:00.758]  Like you point out in the subtitle of your book, from slave block to pedestal.
[02:13:01.218 --> 02:13:04.680]  We have put people on a pedestal, especially people like Barack Obama.
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.022]  You can't criticize him without being called a racist.
[02:13:08.022 --> 02:13:09.083]  Absolutely.
[02:13:09.083 --> 02:13:23.191]  And for example, the fact that he was elected twice and did have this massive support, at least, you know, the first time that he was elected, all of that goes by the wayside when they want to pull out the race card.
[02:13:23.191 --> 02:13:26.813]  You know, in the case of, for example, Trayvon Martin.
[02:13:27.633 --> 02:13:34.239]  It didn't matter that George Zimmerman was this little Latino man.
[02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:43.466]  The press and the agitators spun him into this Nordic god with his war hammer, prowling around for little black kids to squish.
[02:13:44.967 --> 02:13:46.707]  And people bought it.
[02:13:46.707 --> 02:13:48.508]  I mean, that's the thing that blows my mind.
[02:13:48.508 --> 02:13:56.592]  The press picked up on it, Eric Holder, the Obama administration, and people bought it.
[02:13:56.592 --> 02:13:59.493]  I felt like I was in a bad science fiction movie.
[02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:00.482]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:00.482 --> 02:14:15.917]  You know, it's interesting, in your book you said, and of course, Barack Obama, Mary Landrieu, couldn't have been elected if men didn't vote for her, if white people didn't vote for Obama, and yet they always spin it that way.
[02:14:15.917 --> 02:14:23.565]  You point out that in 1964, you said in your book, there was justifiable collective shame on the part of whites and justifiable collective anger
[02:14:24.145 --> 02:14:30.127]  On the part of blacks, there was a fundamental change in the hearts and minds of white people at that point in time.
[02:14:30.127 --> 02:14:31.528]  Address that a little bit.
[02:14:31.528 --> 02:14:33.468]  That was kind of the pivotal issue.
[02:14:33.468 --> 02:14:34.729]  There was a real problem there.
[02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:35.809]  People addressed it.
[02:14:35.809 --> 02:14:43.252]  I think they went maybe too far to the other extreme, as you point out, putting people on a pedestal rather than just handling them as individuals.
[02:14:44.113 --> 02:15:02.980]  Well, you know, Americans, I don't know if it has to do with our character or if it has to do with the effectiveness of the propaganda machine, but we have this habit of just blasting by the sort of happy medium, the middle ground, where we sort of need to live.
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:04.861]  And we've done that in a number of areas.
[02:15:05.801 --> 02:15:09.524]  Um, the whole race thing being, uh, you know, one of them.
[02:15:09.524 --> 02:15:29.441]  You know, we go from, you know, blacks being second-class citizens to, um, blacks being exploited by the very people who are supposed to be helping them, and young black multi-millionaires getting on television every single day talking about this being an institutionally racist nation.
[02:15:29.441 --> 02:15:29.782]  Hello?
[02:15:31.456 --> 02:15:32.637]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:15:32.637 --> 02:15:45.990]  And it's something that is damaging to black people as well, as Walter Williams has pointed out many times, the fact that they put them on a pedestal is damaging to the black community as well, because it's a condescending thing to do that, isn't it?
[02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:51.455]  Saying you can't achieve this on your own, we're going to set aside quotas for you, we're going to put you on a pedestal.
[02:15:51.955 --> 02:15:53.537]  Well, yeah.
[02:15:53.537 --> 02:16:12.279]  I remember when Affirmative Action came out, for example, and I was about to start applying for colleges and stuff, and jobs and what have you, and it drove me out of my tree that they were setting up this sort of structure
[02:16:12.979 --> 02:16:30.005]  That was going to not only, you know, advance, you know, the whole reverse racism, unfairness, that whole deal, but that it was going to wind up in the long term being detrimental to minorities, blacks, women, what have you.
[02:16:30.005 --> 02:16:36.987]  And, you know, again, this is a different kind of subtle bigotry, but it's bigotry nonetheless.
[02:16:37.705 --> 02:16:38.805]  Yeah, I see.
[02:16:38.805 --> 02:16:49.949]  I grew up in the South, and I see in this reverse racism, the quotas and that sort of thing, I see kind of a hint back to Reconstruction, and I see some parallels to that.
[02:16:49.949 --> 02:16:54.930]  It's part of the history that I think that America doesn't really know, and I think that was a key part.
[02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:58.351]  In the change in the hearts and minds of the white community.
[02:16:58.351 --> 02:17:01.392]  I think a lot of them had forgotten what had happened there.
[02:17:01.392 --> 02:17:06.314]  And it's like, why do we have these laws here where we're oppressing this group of people?
[02:17:06.314 --> 02:17:14.096]  But I think what had happened was essentially what we're seeing happening in Ferguson, where they misdirect the anger from one group to the other.
[02:17:14.096 --> 02:17:15.837]  They pit one group against the other.
[02:17:15.837 --> 02:17:19.258]  That was, I think, when I look back at Reconstruction, they took a kind of
[02:17:20.158 --> 02:17:33.022]  An oppression that was masquerading as paternalism during slavery, and they misdirected that into an actual hatred of blacks during Reconstruction that I think turned up in these Jim Crow laws.
[02:17:33.022 --> 02:17:38.143]  And after a generation where people had lost that history, it's like, we don't really need this anymore.
[02:17:38.143 --> 02:17:40.104]  But they always seem to do that.
[02:17:40.104 --> 02:17:47.766]  They seem to be able to pit one group against another, and that seems to be the way that they effectively govern, by divide and conquer.
[02:17:48.545 --> 02:17:49.326]  Absolutely.
[02:17:49.326 --> 02:17:52.288]  The cultural balkanization is key.
[02:17:52.288 --> 02:17:54.289]  And it's not just a racial thing.
[02:17:54.289 --> 02:18:14.663]  I mean, they're exploiting, you know, ageism, sexism, sexual orientationism, just any kind, any sort of subtle difference between, you know, subgroups in our American society that they have been able to exploit.
[02:18:15.403 --> 02:18:28.354]  They do that, and I believe that this administration has really taken it to another level with regard to that cultural balkanization, and we're seeing that play out right now in Ferguson.
[02:18:28.354 --> 02:18:41.304]  You know, the left compromises blacks economically, educationally, all these different ways, and then when something like this Michael Brown thing happens, whether or not it's legitimate,
[02:18:41.904 --> 02:18:42.305]  Yeah.
[02:18:42.305 --> 02:18:42.525]  Okay.
[02:18:56.741 --> 02:19:14.082]  You know, and of course, in terms of balkanization, we saw that in heavy handwriting last night with Obama's announcement and the way it was handled, doing it on the anniversary of Mexico's independence, doing it right before the Latin Grammys, and of course we have no idea
[02:19:14.702 --> 02:19:16.502]  How many people are going to be affected by this?
[02:19:16.502 --> 02:19:17.823]  Because it's an entitlement program.
[02:19:17.823 --> 02:19:19.543]  We don't know that it's going to be 5 million people.
[02:19:19.543 --> 02:19:24.764]  And he's incentivizing illegal immigration because it's the perfect form of balkanization.
[02:19:24.764 --> 02:19:32.006]  You not only got cultural differences that you can play up, but of course language differences that they can play up.
[02:19:32.006 --> 02:19:35.186]  And of course they're trying to play up a racial aspect to it as well.
[02:19:35.186 --> 02:19:38.147]  We're talking to Eric Rush, the author of Negrophilia.
[02:19:38.147 --> 02:19:42.648]  We're going to be right back after the break and I promise I'm going to give Paul Joseph Watson a chance to
[02:19:42.949 --> 02:19:44.813]  Jump in and ask you some questions.
[02:19:44.813 --> 02:19:45.234]  Stay with us.
[02:19:45.234 --> 02:19:45.916]  We'll be right back.

[02:20:31.787 --> 02:20:34.169]  You must be gone on vacation for a while.

[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:06.242]  Without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[02:21:06.242 --> 02:21:11.125]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment.
[02:21:11.125 --> 02:21:14.387]  And Maser instruments are your best line of defense.
[02:21:14.387 --> 02:21:23.454]  Unlike lower-cost products, Maser instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[02:21:23.454 --> 02:21:29.638]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Maser instruments are different.
[02:21:29.638 --> 02:21:33.080]  They're designed to be always on, just like your smoke alarm.
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:36.823]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[02:21:36.823 --> 02:21:37.904]  Made in America.

[02:22:58.221 --> 02:23:00.142]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:23:00.142 --> 02:23:03.783]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:23:03.783 --> 02:23:05.143]  A pair of scissors.
[02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:10.925]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:23:10.925 --> 02:23:15.847]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:23:15.847 --> 02:23:16.827]  The phone line.
[02:23:16.827 --> 02:23:22.089]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:23:22.089 --> 02:23:25.830]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:29.312]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:23:29.312 --> 02:23:31.773]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[02:24:14.022 --> 02:24:21.933]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we have with us Eric Rush, the author of Negrophilia, from Slave Block to Pedestal.
[02:24:21.933 --> 02:24:30.386]  We thought it'd be great to have him on to talk about race relations and what has really happened in this country, especially because of what's going on in Ferguson.
[02:24:30.986 --> 02:24:37.773]  We see conscious race baiting and manipulation, divide-and-conquer strategies that are going on there.
[02:24:37.773 --> 02:24:39.995]  And joining us also is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:24:39.995 --> 02:24:42.017]  I got to ask all the questions in the last segment.
[02:24:42.017 --> 02:24:45.601]  I'm going to give Paul a chance to ask Mr. Rush a question.
[02:24:45.601 --> 02:24:48.264]  But I'm also going to give you a chance to ask questions.
[02:24:48.264 --> 02:24:49.184]  We're going to give out our 800 number.
[02:24:49.184 --> 02:24:49.405]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:24:49.405 --> 02:24:49.765]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:59.732]  9-2-3-1, if you'd like to talk to Mr. Rush with comments or questions, you can call that.
[02:24:59.732 --> 02:25:02.533]  We'll take that in the next segment.
[02:25:02.533 --> 02:25:05.394]  Go ahead, Paul, do you have a question for Mr. Rush?
[02:25:05.394 --> 02:25:07.875]  Yeah, congratulations on your book, by the way, Eric.
[02:25:07.875 --> 02:25:15.819]  I see an overwhelming amount of five-star reviews on Amazon, which for an obviously contentious subject is quite the achievement.
[02:25:15.819 --> 02:25:19.180]  I wanted to ask you about Obama himself, because
[02:25:19.955 --> 02:25:32.991]  We know his upbringing, his mentors, I'm speaking of the likes of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, the influence that they had on him, how did that shape Barack Obama's views on race and class in America?
[02:25:34.318 --> 02:25:38.381]  Well, it absolutely had a major effect.
[02:25:38.381 --> 02:26:00.716]  I mean, the guy was raised, not just, you know, in his adult life, but, you know, from the time that he was fairly young, you know, than whichever origins narrative you want to believe, and there are a few of them out there, the common denominator is always a very
[02:26:03.115 --> 02:26:23.966]  You know, anti-Western, anti-American, in some cases anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-capitalist, you know, anti-all of the things that we sort of grew up as, you know, being taught, you know, most of our worldview in as like these things, there's nothing wrong with these things.
[02:26:24.406 --> 02:26:26.788]  We don't have a perfect society.
[02:26:26.788 --> 02:26:43.420]  You know, as we were talking about in the last segment, you know, we sort of matured as a country and woke up one day and was like, whoa, you know, it's not cool to have these, you know, whole segment of society, like, meaning blacks being these
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:44.201]  I think so.
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:26:59.720]  I think?
[02:27:29.801 --> 02:27:30.382]  We're good to go.
[02:27:40.489 --> 02:27:47.070]  Yeah, you know, I think a lot of people are not familiar with the upbringing of Obama in Indonesia.
[02:27:47.070 --> 02:28:05.294]  There's a movie that came out, I didn't know anything really about the Indonesian situation that he grew up in or went to Indonesia shortly afterwards, but there's a movie called The Act of Killing that really sheds a lot of light on that regime there that his adoptive father brought him up in.
[02:28:05.294 --> 02:28:05.574]  He was
[02:28:06.534 --> 02:28:17.140]  Very tightly connected to that regime and of course his mom was there as many of us believe as part of the CIA USAID's Openly been a part of the CIA her parents were both in the CIA.
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:34.189]  He grew up in an alien culture Grew up in an authoritarian culture that had just committed mass murder on a gigantic scale and then he comes back to America and he hangs out with Frank Davis and His bomb thrower Bill Ayers, thank you
[02:28:36.351 --> 02:28:38.193]  But yeah, he hangs out with those guys.
[02:28:38.193 --> 02:28:40.296]  He finishes off his education there.
[02:28:40.296 --> 02:28:46.464]  I mean, regardless of the photoshopped birth certificate, his origins should have caused people to have great concern about that.
[02:28:47.219 --> 02:29:03.251]  Absolutely, and few people know as well that there were people who were involved in his early life other than those you have mentioned who were politically active and interactive.
[02:29:03.251 --> 02:29:11.637]  People from the leftist community in the United States who were politically active with the Sukarno regime and all of those guys in Indonesia.
[02:29:12.177 --> 02:29:23.302]  In addition to which, you also have to remember that that is an Islamic, if not Islamist, society over there.
[02:29:23.302 --> 02:29:31.746]  Yes, and of course the first time he appeared in public at Georgetown University after the inauguration, he insisted that they cover up all Christian symbols at Georgetown University.
[02:29:31.746 --> 02:29:33.306]  It's like, who is this guy?
[02:29:33.306 --> 02:29:34.307]  Some kind of a vampire?
[02:29:34.307 --> 02:29:36.008]  I don't know, but we're going to be right back.
[02:29:36.008 --> 02:29:40.289]  We're going to take your calls for author Eric Rush, Negrophilia.
[02:29:40.289 --> 02:29:40.970]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:41.390]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.324 --> 02:29:53.250]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.106 --> 02:31:06.512]  When I first got online and I seen the price of X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[02:31:06.512 --> 02:31:07.533]  It has changed my life.
[02:31:07.533 --> 02:31:11.216]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, pounding the weights, staying in shape.
[02:31:11.216 --> 02:31:13.298]  InfoWarsLive.com.

[02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:19.224]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[02:31:19.224 --> 02:31:21.205]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:31:21.205 --> 02:31:23.868]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[02:31:23.968 --> 02:31:33.691]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.

[02:33:11.639 --> 02:33:14.182]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.435 --> 02:33:21.795]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.795 --> 02:33:22.876]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:33:22.876 --> 02:33:25.776]  We have Paul Joseph Wesson with us in the UK.
[02:33:25.776 --> 02:33:31.057]  And on the line we have Eric Rush, author of Negrophilia from Slave Block to Pedestal.
[02:33:31.057 --> 02:33:34.818]  If you'd like to ask him questions or you have comments, you can call in at 800-259-9231.
[02:33:34.818 --> 02:33:35.078]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:33:35.078 --> 02:33:36.519]  But before we go back to Mr. Rush,
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:46.083]  This hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by Silver Bullet.
[02:33:46.083 --> 02:33:48.084]  We now have it back in stock.
[02:33:48.084 --> 02:33:49.245]  It's in limited supply.
[02:33:49.245 --> 02:34:00.773]  It will take at least six weeks to get it in once we run out again because it's a very difficult, long-period process to get these things done in this kind of concentration.
[02:34:00.773 --> 02:34:02.395]  We have 30 parts per million.
[02:34:02.955 --> 02:34:05.297]  In a pure base of deionized water.
[02:34:05.297 --> 02:34:07.718]  That kind of concentration is very difficult to manufacture.
[02:34:07.718 --> 02:34:10.460]  That's why we have the long lead times to get this in.
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:15.463]  It's widely known colloidal silver is a vital supplement for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
[02:34:15.463 --> 02:34:23.409]  Now Infowarslife.com takes colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique that is free of toxic artificial additives.
[02:34:24.169 --> 02:34:28.152]  There's never been a more important time to have a powerful and clean form of colloidal silver.
[02:34:28.152 --> 02:34:30.353]  Right now we have flu season coming on us.
[02:34:30.353 --> 02:34:34.076]  We have all types of viruses that are circulating around.
[02:34:34.076 --> 02:34:36.958]  This is something you need to have within reach for you and your family.
[02:34:36.958 --> 02:34:41.241]  Go to Infowarslife.com, order Silver Bullet now, or you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:34:41.241 --> 02:34:41.541]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:34:47.805 --> 02:34:52.907]  Now, reading from Mr. Rush's book, Negrophilia, here's one of his definitions.
[02:34:52.907 --> 02:34:56.969]  Of course, he talks about it quite extensively, but I just wanted to read this quote.
[02:34:56.969 --> 02:35:06.152]  He says, Negrophilia is not by nature a conscious partiality toward or devotion to black people, but a subliminal persuasion toward affinity.
[02:35:06.152 --> 02:35:13.015]  It's essentially the result of an ongoing propaganda campaign that has underpinned positive stereotypes.
[02:35:13.795 --> 02:35:19.178]  I think that's interesting, especially in light of all the controversy we've heard lately about Bill Cosby.
[02:35:19.178 --> 02:35:21.099]  He had the show in the 1980s.
[02:35:21.099 --> 02:35:29.503]  That was a great show that was really kind of showing positive stereotypes, almost in an over-the-top, unbelievable way, like we would have seen back in the 1950s.
[02:35:29.503 --> 02:35:34.966]  And, you know, Mr. Rush, when I looked at that, I always thought that was a good thing.
[02:35:34.966 --> 02:35:39.308]  My curiosity at the time, and I think it kind of reflects on your book here a little bit, is the fact that
[02:35:40.008 --> 02:35:50.193]  In the 1980s, even though they could show the perfect black family, we couldn't have had a perfect white family on television really without getting laughed out of town.
[02:35:50.193 --> 02:35:50.613]  Don't you think?
[02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:57.754]  Absolutely, and I think that kind of plays to the double standard.
[02:35:57.754 --> 02:36:00.697]  I don't expect people to be perfect.
[02:36:00.697 --> 02:36:03.600]  I don't expect our society to be perfect.
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:10.906]  I want to get away from that segment that thinks we can have utopia, because we really can't.
[02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:23.383]  You have to get to where you can recognize when you're being exposed to an agenda or propaganda or not.
[02:36:23.383 --> 02:36:26.945]  And of course, when you have something that's as innocuous as a
[02:36:29.486 --> 02:36:40.479]  You know, NBC sitcom or whatever with this iconic, you know, beloved star, which Bill Cosby, I was going to say, is, at least he was then.
[02:36:40.479 --> 02:36:46.766]  You know, it was a nice, it was a nice show, as you said, but, you know, you have to put it into context.
[02:36:46.766 --> 02:36:49.009]  Like what, what is it really representing?
[02:36:49.489 --> 02:36:57.834]  I mean, there were a lot of things that came out of that show, even if it was a good one, that bugged me.
[02:36:57.834 --> 02:37:15.444]  For example, it may not be something that you had picked up on, but when the Intelligentsia decided that we were going to call blacks African Americans now, the Cosby Show was
[02:37:16.605 --> 02:37:16.865]  Right.
[02:37:16.865 --> 02:37:17.145]  Yeah.
[02:37:17.145 --> 02:37:17.485]  Exactly.
[02:37:33.522 --> 02:37:38.385]  But I'm not, and most of the black people I know are not.
[02:37:38.385 --> 02:37:40.647]  I mean, because they don't know from Africa.
[02:37:40.647 --> 02:37:48.193]  I mean, and then again, what is with the necessity to hyphenate every damn individual in this country?
[02:37:48.576 --> 02:37:49.677]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:37:49.677 --> 02:38:00.365]  We're so caught up on labels, and I don't know, you know, it's amazing how many times I've seen in my lifetime the label that they want to put on people that we now call black or call African-American.
[02:38:00.365 --> 02:38:02.647]  It's like, why do they keep changing it?
[02:38:02.647 --> 02:38:06.990]  And I think that all boils down to this premise that you've got in this book.
[02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:11.434]  I want to give people, some callers, a chance to ask some questions and comments.
[02:38:11.434 --> 02:38:13.115]  We've got David in Missouri.
[02:38:13.115 --> 02:38:14.997]  He wanted to ask a question about Ferguson.
[02:38:14.997 --> 02:38:16.318]  David, are you close to Ferguson?
[02:38:17.956 --> 02:38:22.958]  Oh yeah, I mean not close, probably 100 miles west.
[02:38:22.958 --> 02:38:23.278]  Okay.
[02:38:23.278 --> 02:38:24.659]  Closer to Kansas City.
[02:38:24.659 --> 02:38:27.180]  We had a question for Mr. Rush.
[02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:30.881]  Yeah, I mean this is great to talk to you, Paul, and Mr. Rush all at once.
[02:38:30.881 --> 02:38:45.327]  I mean, I've heard you, David, and Paul say that, what are the people out here, what are their opinions on alternative things to do other than violence?
[02:38:45.327 --> 02:38:47.168]  I mean, I say everybody gets a
[02:38:48.058 --> 02:38:54.721]  Transparent, legal, neighborhood watch, armed neighborhood watch, and everybody takes care of each other.
[02:38:54.721 --> 02:39:04.386]  But, I mean, my question to him, Mr. Rush, I think Bill Cosby was, for the most part of his life, definitely, you know, juiced in, let's say.
[02:39:04.386 --> 02:39:11.209]  But, he, I mean, I grew up watching, like, you know, Cosby's show, Family Matters.
[02:39:11.209 --> 02:39:12.730]  I'm a Caucasian person.
[02:39:13.833 --> 02:39:14.614]  I think both shows.
[02:39:14.614 --> 02:39:18.117]  I mean, anything on TV is fair to, you know, pass time, at least.
[02:39:18.117 --> 02:39:29.286]  But my question is, what is your, to Mr. Rush, what is your non-violent alternative to this Ferguson situation and situations to come?
[02:39:29.286 --> 02:39:33.209]  Because in every news article it says, white cop, black male.
[02:39:33.209 --> 02:39:35.030]  Like, that's just ridiculous.
[02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.671]  God bless you guys.
[02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:50.094]  Yeah, well, you know, as someone was talking about this, I think, in the previous hour of the show, and that is the fact that, you know, the police typically aren't going to police themselves.
[02:39:50.094 --> 02:39:59.817]  And so, you know, you have to, while I have a respect for law enforcement, you do have to sort of look at the police with a critical eye to some extent.
[02:40:00.237 --> 02:40:19.140]  Because you do have incidents of police brutality, and sometimes it's race-based, sometimes it's not, sometimes it's just a matter of the police involved having become these really jaded, brutal individuals, and those things have to be handled on an individual basis.
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:36.011]  The problem that we have here isn't, you know, there may be a certain, you know, well, there is a certain level of police misfeasance everywhere you're going to go.
[02:40:36.011 --> 02:40:37.592]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[02:40:37.592 --> 02:40:41.294]  But the problem that we're having here is interpretation.
[02:40:41.294 --> 02:40:42.055]  When you have
[02:40:42.775 --> 02:40:59.897]  A situation in which you have so many disenfranchised blacks, in this case it just happens to be blacks, who are disenfranchised for mostly economic reasons that can be traced to things other than white racism.
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:09.286]  And then you have it exploited due to this incident that, you know, arises Michael Brown.
[02:41:09.286 --> 02:41:11.848]  You know, you have to look at it in context.
[02:41:11.848 --> 02:41:15.671]  The problem isn't police brutality as so much as it is
[02:41:16.611 --> 02:41:27.514]  The disenfranchised, angry, you know, a lot of them impoverished, unemployed individuals who are being heavily propagandized.
[02:41:27.514 --> 02:41:33.675]  Well, that has a lot less to do with police brutality overall than it does a political agenda.
[02:41:33.675 --> 02:41:37.256]  So we have to address that first and foremost.
[02:41:37.256 --> 02:41:38.076]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:41:38.076 --> 02:41:40.097]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida.
[02:41:40.097 --> 02:41:41.317]  Stephen, you have a question for Mr. Rush.
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.401]  Yeah, good afternoon.
[02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:46.182]  Yeah, I actually have three.
[02:41:46.182 --> 02:41:53.268]  First of all, I was wondering, Mr. Rush, if you've seen the documentary that I was carrying and you interviewed the author of that.
[02:41:53.268 --> 02:41:58.031]  It's a DVD called Dreams from My Real Father about Obama.
[02:41:58.031 --> 02:42:07.078]  Also, why do you think it is that blacks in America are so willing to keep themselves on the globalist plantation when they can clearly get off of it?
[02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:19.878]  And the third thing is, I have a friend, and the way he responds to Obama, and I wonder if you disagree with this from what you know of him, he says he's a teleprompter reading CIA sock puppet.
[02:42:19.878 --> 02:42:22.699]  And that's my question.
[02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:25.581]  Um, okay.
[02:42:25.581 --> 02:42:31.465]  Now, who is it that they said was a CIA sock puppet?
[02:42:31.465 --> 02:42:32.105]  Obama.
[02:42:32.105 --> 02:42:36.148]  My friend refers to him as a teleprompter reading CIA sock puppet.
[02:42:37.097 --> 02:42:40.458]  Okay, well, let me address them in order.
[02:42:40.458 --> 02:42:49.641]  One, no, I have not seen the DVD, I haven't seen the movie, the DVD, Dreams from My Real Father, although I'm familiar with the content.
[02:42:49.641 --> 02:42:50.982]  Why do blacks stay on the
[02:42:52.442 --> 02:42:58.125]  On the plantation, because there, it's what you, you go with what you know.
[02:42:58.125 --> 02:43:02.848]  I mean, we grew up being told Hitler was an evil guy.
[02:43:02.848 --> 02:43:12.913]  If we had been grown up, if we had grown up being told Hitler was, you know, the next best thing to Jesus or Buddha, that's probably what we would have thought.
[02:43:12.913 --> 02:43:18.516]  You've got blacks who are being told by teachers, the press,
[02:43:19.276 --> 02:43:19.977]  We're good to go.
[02:43:38.676 --> 02:43:44.000]  Right now, he's kind of running the CIA, so I'm not quite sure how that would play out.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:55.670]  I know that there were a lot of shadowy figures and parties, governments, organizations that played a part in his ascendancy.
[02:43:55.670 --> 02:44:00.033]  As far as who's pulling his strings now, you know, any number of people.
[02:44:01.457 --> 02:44:07.284]  I want to get Paul Joseph Watson in with a comment but I would say going back to looking at some of this stuff I look at
[02:44:16.667 --> 02:44:17.928]  The Indian Reservation System.
[02:44:17.928 --> 02:44:24.110]  When you talked about, have you grown up thinking that Adolf Hitler was a great guy, then you would believe that.
[02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:30.513]  I think that when I look at the Washington Plantation System that we have now, and that's what really what it is, is a plantation system.
[02:44:30.513 --> 02:44:34.794]  It's really oppression masquerading as paternalism.
[02:44:34.794 --> 02:44:38.696]  We're here to protect you, but it's really the way that they oppress people.
[02:44:38.696 --> 02:44:43.298]  We see that now in the Indian Reservations, of course, you know, that was originally not set up
[02:44:43.798 --> 02:44:48.182]  With the motivation that they were going to protect anybody except the white people from the Indians.
[02:44:48.182 --> 02:44:50.283]  They were going to contain them on those reservations.
[02:44:50.283 --> 02:44:59.751]  The way they pacified them was to separate the children from the families, to send them across the country to their own schools to re-educate them.
[02:45:00.271 --> 02:45:01.992]  Yeah, that was the intent.
[02:45:01.992 --> 02:45:07.495]  Then they put them on these Indian reservations where they don't allow them to have any true economic opportunity.
[02:45:07.495 --> 02:45:08.036]  And you know what?
[02:45:08.036 --> 02:45:16.080]  We allowed that Indian reservation system to perpetuate, to continue, and now they're using that same strategy.
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:17.541]  Then they use it on the black community.
[02:45:18.181 --> 02:45:22.302]  Essentially not, you know, keeping them on a reservation where they didn't have the kind of freedom.
[02:45:22.302 --> 02:45:25.183]  Now they're extending that to everybody.
[02:45:25.183 --> 02:45:28.804]  We are now all going to be slaves on the Washington plantation.
[02:45:28.804 --> 02:45:33.505]  We need to get over this way where they pit us against each other because we're white, black, or red.
[02:45:33.505 --> 02:45:37.526]  We need to understand this is a Washington plantation system.
[02:45:37.526 --> 02:45:45.988]  It is simply oppression masquerading as paternalism trying to make us dependent on the central government in every way that they can.
[02:45:47.011 --> 02:45:48.212]  Paul, did you want to comment on that?
[02:45:48.212 --> 02:45:49.073]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Mr. Rush.
[02:45:49.073 --> 02:45:50.334]  You comment first and I'll get past you.
[02:45:50.334 --> 02:45:52.977]  I was going to answer just real short.
[02:45:52.977 --> 02:46:03.266]  Toward the end of the book, I said, you know, when I talk to black people who start realizing this and they get angry, I tell them, hey, don't take it personally, you know.
[02:46:03.266 --> 02:46:05.628]  They're planning to enslave all of us.
[02:46:05.628 --> 02:46:06.309]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:09.051]  They're equal opportunity, aren't they?
[02:46:09.051 --> 02:46:11.073]  Paul, do you want to comment on that?
[02:46:11.073 --> 02:46:12.455]  Yeah, I just thought about
[02:46:13.453 --> 02:46:16.214]  Culture and the role models that emerge out of culture.
[02:46:16.214 --> 02:46:18.355]  We were talking about the Cosby Show earlier.
[02:46:18.355 --> 02:46:29.681]  You know, I grew up watching things like the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which, you know, they were silly, but generally a general positive portrayal of black people, of hard-working black families.
[02:46:29.681 --> 02:46:34.623]  Now, all we seem to have emerging out of black culture is hip-hop stars
[02:46:35.183 --> 02:46:42.147]  You know, whose lyrics are laden with genuine misogyny, not that the feminists really care about it to a great extent.
[02:46:42.147 --> 02:46:51.853]  And this kind of idea that anybody can emerge out of their situation and just become a global multimillionaire superstar rapper, when the reality is obviously quite different.
[02:46:51.853 --> 02:47:04.181]  There doesn't seem to be that many realistic, strong black role models emerging out of culture that would guide black people, young black people growing up into becoming more, you know, self-empowered.
[02:47:05.041 --> 02:47:12.089]  So, I mean Eric, what's your take on that in terms of hip-hop culture and how that's emerged and grown over the last two decades or so?
[02:47:12.089 --> 02:47:14.252]  At least that was a healthy thing, wasn't it, from the Cosby Show.
[02:47:14.252 --> 02:47:19.057]  At least they had doctors and lawyers as role models as opposed to rappers and gang members.
[02:47:19.057 --> 02:47:19.458]  Mr. Rush?
[02:47:19.878 --> 02:47:25.663]  Yeah, precisely, and I could go on about that all day long.
[02:47:25.663 --> 02:47:37.314]  I think it's definitely by design promoting the sort of lowest common denominator amongst blacks, and of course it's aimed primarily at the youth.
[02:47:37.794 --> 02:47:51.700]  Whereby you have this anti-socialism, disrespect for authority, misogyny, promiscuity, you know, every sort of, you know, low caliber value that you can name yet.
[02:47:52.677 --> 02:48:04.629]  If you bring that up in the same way that you bring up trying to get blacks off of the dependency plantation, they will label you a racist.
[02:48:04.629 --> 02:48:09.294]  They will say, you're trying to deprive black Americans of their culture.
[02:48:09.294 --> 02:48:10.415]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:48:11.093 --> 02:48:11.934]  What's their culture?
[02:48:11.934 --> 02:48:29.725]  You're telling blacks that they're supposed to be these, you know, chain-snatching, you know, just baby-mama-making, you know, thieving, crack-smoking, cop-shooting, you know, basically, you know, scum?
[02:48:29.725 --> 02:48:31.906]  You're telling them how to self-identify.
[02:48:32.947 --> 02:48:34.408]  It's very deliberate.
[02:48:34.408 --> 02:48:39.351]  They're very well aware and self-conscious of the subliminal messages that they're sending people.
[02:48:39.351 --> 02:48:40.892]  They're very well aware of that.
[02:48:40.892 --> 02:48:41.672]  Thank you, Stephen.
[02:48:41.672 --> 02:48:43.613]  Let's go to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:46.515]  Fred?
[02:48:46.515 --> 02:48:51.338]  Yes, I called up wanting to disagree with Paul.
[02:48:51.338 --> 02:48:58.202]  First of all, I'm a big supporter of Alex and the host, and I find the author very interesting.
[02:49:00.078 --> 02:49:08.861]  But I want to say that the incident with Jeremiah Wright, with Reverend Wright, has been completely taken out of context.
[02:49:08.861 --> 02:49:19.344]  I actually saw the entire, well, a good portion of that sermon before his statement of God damn America.
[02:49:19.344 --> 02:49:25.406]  And he was really saying, God bless America if America does right by God.
[02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:36.252]  And goddamn America, if America does wrong by God, the same message that conservative Protestant ministers have been making for hundreds of years.
[02:49:36.252 --> 02:49:43.274]  So really, Obama is more complex a person than the figure that some people have been saying.
[02:49:43.274 --> 02:49:45.455]  Do you want to respond to that, Paul?
[02:49:45.455 --> 02:49:45.715]  Go ahead.
[02:49:46.570 --> 02:50:05.280]  Yeah, I would argue that it's not just drawn from one sermon, it's rooted in the mindset that people like Jeremiah Wright are invested in, people like Bill Ayers that Obama was heavily influenced by and mentored by when he was growing up, which is this idea which we talked about before that America's founding was based on
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:09.082]  It was based on rapacious principles about stealing land from Mexicans.
[02:50:09.082 --> 02:50:13.445]  It was based on racist principles about genocide against Native Americans.
[02:50:13.445 --> 02:50:20.250]  Which again, if you read Dinesh D'Souza's America, Imagine a World Without Her, he completely demolishes that case historically.
[02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:26.514]  So that's the point I make about how Obama's worldview is influenced by these kind of people.
[02:50:26.514 --> 02:50:29.936]  Yeah, there's a larger context even than just that one particular speech.
[02:50:29.936 --> 02:50:31.978]  Would you like to address that Mr. Rush?
[02:50:33.406 --> 02:50:38.792]  Uh, you know, I would just disagree with it on the same basis.
[02:50:38.792 --> 02:50:41.796]  I mean, there was a great deal more.
[02:50:41.796 --> 02:50:48.903]  I mean, I've probably forgotten more about Jeremiah Wright and his sermons than most people are likely to.
[02:50:48.903 --> 02:50:49.864]  All right, we've got to go to break.
[02:50:49.864 --> 02:50:51.566]  We'll be right back with Eric Rush.
[02:50:51.566 --> 02:50:51.927]  Stay with us.
[02:50:51.927 --> 02:50:52.828]  We'll be taking your calls.

[02:51:32.217 --> 02:51:32.998]  No joke.
[02:51:32.998 --> 02:51:35.701]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:51:35.701 --> 02:51:36.641]  And if House Bill HR

[02:52:14.121 --> 02:52:18.064]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[02:52:18.064 --> 02:52:20.045]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:52:20.045 --> 02:52:22.707]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[02:52:22.807 --> 02:52:40.714]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:40.714 --> 02:52:41.934]  There's two.
[02:52:41.934 --> 02:52:46.256]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[02:52:46.256 --> 02:52:47.096]  It's great stuff.
[02:52:47.196 --> 02:52:48.118]  I'm gonna promote something.
[02:52:48.118 --> 02:52:51.123]  It's gotta be something I personally use and that I believe in.

[02:52:58.655 --> 02:53:00.777]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[02:53:00.777 --> 02:53:06.883]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[02:53:06.883 --> 02:53:11.067]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[02:53:11.067 --> 02:53:15.391]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[02:53:15.391 --> 02:53:19.755]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[02:53:19.755 --> 02:53:23.279]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[02:53:23.499 --> 02:53:26.802]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[02:53:26.802 --> 02:53:32.448]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.
[02:53:32.448 --> 02:53:35.251]  Learn the secret to creating cash flow and freedom.

[02:54:12.622 --> 02:54:13.823]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:13.823 --> 02:54:14.864]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:54:14.864 --> 02:54:16.845]  We have Paul Joseph Watson with us in the UK.
[02:54:16.845 --> 02:54:22.450]  And on the line we have Eric Rush, author of Negrophilia, from Slave Block to Pedestal.
[02:54:22.450 --> 02:54:23.711]  And we've been taking your calls.
[02:54:23.711 --> 02:54:26.053]  We've got the phone lines basically full here.
[02:54:26.053 --> 02:54:30.256]  We're going to try to go quickly, if possible, and try to get through everybody that's been on hold.
[02:54:30.256 --> 02:54:32.538]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[02:54:32.538 --> 02:54:33.779]  John, you have a question for Mr. Rush.
[02:54:34.879 --> 02:54:51.137]  Yes, I don't agree with much of what's been said, but I think some of the truth came out by a caller who pointed out that Obama is a CIA asset, going back since the time that he was brought as a toddler with his top CIA parents.
[02:54:51.747 --> 02:55:05.983]  To help oversee and participate in the genocidal anti-communist coup that the CIA perpetrated that killed over a million people with the rivers running red with blood.
[02:55:05.983 --> 02:55:12.010]  That coup that his parents, and he was present in,
[02:55:12.631 --> 02:55:28.299]  I was totally based on anti-communism, it was totally based on anti-leftism, and I wonder why we don't get some of the leftist critiques of Obama as a right-winger, because he was brought up... Don't use any kind of justification to do whatever they want to.
[02:55:28.299 --> 02:55:31.260]  If it's in their interest to pose as right-wingers, they'll do that.
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:33.901]  If it's in their interest to pose as left-wingers, they'll do that.
[02:55:33.901 --> 02:55:34.942]  Any comments, Mr. Bush?
[02:55:37.073 --> 02:55:44.544]  Well, I'm somewhat curious as to which genocide the caller is referring to.
[02:55:44.544 --> 02:55:47.889]  Are you talking about Indonesia when you're talking about the rivers running red with blood?
[02:55:48.644 --> 02:56:00.430]  I'm talking about the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency overthrew a popular Suharto government to overthrow and kill the very popular millions of communists and their families and their supporters.
[02:56:00.430 --> 02:56:08.593]  And after that, Zbigniew Brzezinski tutored Obama at Columbia and has been his advisor ever since.
[02:56:08.593 --> 02:56:12.095]  And he is the most ultra-right, anti-communist, anti-Russia
[02:56:12.655 --> 02:56:12.755]  Yeah.
[02:56:30.206 --> 02:56:30.806]  I don't know.
[02:56:50.798 --> 02:56:56.701]  Udall, who is not going to be coming back, has threatened that he will read it on the floor of the Senate.
[02:56:56.701 --> 02:57:00.763]  I wish he would read the unredacted torture report on the floor of the Senate.
[02:57:00.763 --> 02:57:01.163]  Let's move on.
[02:57:01.163 --> 02:57:02.704]  I want to get to some of the other callers.
[02:57:02.704 --> 02:57:03.364]  Sue in Florida.
[02:57:03.364 --> 02:57:04.905]  Go ahead, Sue.
[02:57:04.905 --> 02:57:05.065]  Hi.
[02:57:05.065 --> 02:57:06.425]  Can you hear me over the speakerphone?
[02:57:06.425 --> 02:57:06.605]  Yes.
[02:57:06.605 --> 02:57:07.206]  Go ahead.
[02:57:07.206 --> 02:57:08.646]  Great.
[02:57:08.646 --> 02:57:18.851]  The governor of Missouri has a 16-person commission that he just formed with blacks, whites, younger, older, a policeman, young black activists.
[02:57:19.577 --> 02:57:21.379]  And is that a step in the right direction?
[02:57:21.379 --> 02:57:27.066]  What are things that blacks and whites can do to help set some things right where they need to be right?
[02:57:27.066 --> 02:57:31.612]  And just in general, what is your advice to whites who really care about these issues?
[02:57:31.612 --> 02:57:35.897]  But if you're being called Uncle Tom and such things, what can we say or do to make a difference?
[02:57:35.897 --> 02:57:36.277]  Go ahead, Ms.
[02:57:36.277 --> 02:57:36.438]  Rush.
[02:57:37.754 --> 02:57:59.099]  Well, I think that, as I said in the book, you know, we're going to have to sort of show a little bit of spine and collectively or individually decide that, you know, if somebody calls me some names, that's, you know, that, you know, the civil rights marchers had to put up with a whole hell of a lot more than just being called, you know, names.
[02:57:59.099 --> 02:58:00.779]  I get called names all the time.
[02:58:00.779 --> 02:58:03.140]  A lot of the, you know, the people who are in the same
[02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:04.260]  Absolutely.
[02:58:04.260 --> 02:58:04.861]  Absolutely.
[02:58:04.861 --> 02:58:06.002]  We're about out of...
[02:58:31.761 --> 02:58:33.182]  I gotta cut you off there, Mr. Rush.
[02:58:33.182 --> 02:58:34.362]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:34.362 --> 02:58:40.506]  Eric Rush, author of Negrophilia and Real Racism Gets a Pass When They Misuse It.
