[00:00.000 --> 00:13.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.320 --> 00:22.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.080 --> 00:33.240]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host live here in Austin on
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.000]  this Friday November 21st 2014 Paul Joseph Watson is going to be co-hosting
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.880]  with me from the UK we've got some interesting guests today we've got Paul
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.080]  Craig Roberts is going to be talking to us about some international issues and
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.280]  the economy and we have a guest Eric Rush author of the book Negro Philea
[00:51.280 --> 00:55.920]  from slave block to pedestal that's an important thing to look at right now as
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.200]  we're waiting for this verdict and Ferguson one of the articles that we
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.480]  have on info wars right now rioters to target whites quote you will never be
[01:04.480 --> 01:11.360]  safe not you not your children see that's the issue the issue is what started
[01:11.360 --> 01:14.880]  out and we've seen this over and over again not just in Ferguson but in so many
[01:14.880 --> 01:19.400]  places I remember when this first broke as news it was yet another case of the
[01:19.400 --> 01:23.840]  police shooting somebody when their life was not in danger I still believe
[01:23.840 --> 01:30.360]  that's the case yet you have this issue of an epidemic of police violence many
[01:30.360 --> 01:34.040]  people have spoken out on it we're going to have a quote from Frank Serpicoe I'm
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.560]  sure many of you pretty much all of you know him from the movie Serpicoe but he
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.440]  spoke out and said that essentially we've moved from a the biggest problem
[01:44.440 --> 01:48.080]  being corruption when he was in New York is essentially a corruption that came on
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.480]  by the war on drugs that kind of prohibition always corrupts the police
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.560]  but he says we've moved on from that and now the issue really is this out of
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.920]  control unchecked police violence but of course they were able to take what
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.400]  could have been a thoughtful look at the situation something that both sides
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.760]  could come together on white and black could take a look at this and see that
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.280]  although this is something that is affecting black people more than it is
[02:16.280 --> 02:21.160]  white people it is affecting everybody now this is a true epidemic they just
[02:21.160 --> 02:26.040]  had in the Albuquerque Police Department a memo of course it's being put out on
[02:26.040 --> 02:31.280]  killology we see them talking about puppy side because they're killing so many
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.400]  dogs they're killing everyone and all they have to do is say I feel that I was
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.320]  threatened and they're given a pass we could have a real discussion about how
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.160]  we get control of our government get control of the police but instead they
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.840]  turned it into a racial paradigm trying to turn it into a race war and now we
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.720]  see also that they're reinforcing the fear of the police the police have been
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.840]  told for a long time by Homeland Security by the federal government they've
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.560]  been told that they're in a war that they need to fight back that they're
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.480]  going to have to shoot first and keep shooting and all this does is underscore
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.920]  that this is going to basically further entrench this kind of war mentality
[03:15.920 --> 03:19.120]  when they're threatening the police saying we're going to come to your house
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.280]  we're going to come and get you that's not the right way to approach this we
[03:23.280 --> 03:27.520]  need to get control of the police there needs to be accountability Frank Serpico
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.960]  had some really good points to make in the political article would love to get
[03:31.960 --> 03:35.720]  him on he's been on with Alex Jones many times he's difficult to find but
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.160]  that's the real issue but instead they're going to make it into a race war so we
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.160]  have reporters that are there on the scene
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.880]  Jacarie Jackson Joe Biggs are going to be giving us updates on what is
[03:45.880 --> 03:50.960]  happening the threats the build-up and anticipation of today the grand jury
[03:50.960 --> 03:55.000]  meeting we believe that they're going to everyone believes that they're going to
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.840]  come across with their verdict today and of course Darren Wilson the police
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.080]  officer who did the shooting or is going to possibly resign I guess that's going
[04:05.080 --> 04:09.280]  to be their olive branch of peace that they're going to make out there but it's
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.080]  not really I think going to address the problem they let this thing run for a
[04:13.080 --> 04:18.240]  very long time before they brought out any evidence that would justify what he
[04:18.240 --> 04:24.600]  did I think that was a deliberate effort by the government to move this into a
[04:24.600 --> 04:29.520]  race war so we're going to be talking to our reporters there in Ferguson and as I
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.080]  said we're going to be talking to Eric Rush on negra fulia now there's a lot
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.480]  of reactions today to Obama's amnesty speech yesterday we're going to be
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.280]  talking about the reactions that people had to that and we're going to talk
[04:41.280 --> 04:44.760]  about what that really means stay with us I'll be right back with Paul Joseph

[08:10.840 --> 08:16.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[08:16.920 --> 08:27.480]  GCN radio network welcome back to the Alex Jones show I am David Knight in
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.640]  Austin joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK of course last night was the
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.720]  amnesty speech that Obama gave giving people permission to stay not
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.440]  necessarily making them citizens but basically giving them the right to stay
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.480]  as long as I wish and we've seen how this works out in many cases we've had a
[08:45.480 --> 08:51.680]  measure in Illinois to allow people who aren't citizens to vote we know that
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.960]  with the deferred action that was done for children of the DACA program he
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.960]  allowed people up to the age of 31 to stay and not only that but to get free
[09:00.960 --> 09:08.320]  education benefits to go to universities with a in-state tuition in many cases a
[09:08.320 --> 09:12.000]  full ride I mean we're the ones who are paying for this I look at a one of the
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.200]  immigration groups Casa they say was a major immigrant rights group that's
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.680]  based in Maryland and Virginia they were planning three screening parties last
[09:21.680 --> 09:27.040]  night to watch this announcement well I looked at that Casa you know it's like
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.720]  Mikasa Sukasa you know my house is your house except it's the other way around
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.600]  isn't it they're essentially saying to the American people Sukasa Mikasa your
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.920]  house is my house I'm coming to live with you and there's nothing you're
[09:40.920 --> 09:44.640]  going to do about it and that's essentially what Obama has done for
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.280]  them Paul they're saying that it's 11 million people that they believe are
[09:49.280 --> 09:56.040]  possibly here illegally at this point and they're only going to extend legal
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.040]  status to half of those people who's counting these people they don't have
[10:00.040 --> 10:03.880]  any idea how many people are here he's created a massive entitlement program as
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.480]  well as incentivizing further illegal immigration well exactly I mean they're
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.160]  always underplay the numbers that are most embarrassing to them they underplay
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.720]  the jobs numbers on a routine basis so who knows how many illegals are here but
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.200]  as he said they had the screening parties the celebrations in the Mexican
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.440]  restaurant and what they're all saying the message is this is only the beginning
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.400]  the fight begins here they want the welfare they want the medical benefits
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.440]  yeah and they want the voting rights this is only the start David oh yeah of
[10:36.440 --> 10:39.960]  course it only begins here we've been through all this before we saw this back
[10:39.960 --> 10:45.080]  when Reagan did it in 1986 and that was going to be just allow the people who
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.800]  are already here to stay they've got ties here so just grant them the ability
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.800]  to stay we'll fix the border here we won't have any more illegal immigration
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.080]  yet it's continued to rise and unabated actually accelerating if you incentivize
[10:59.080 --> 11:03.440]  people coming here and that's what Obama did with DACA that's what he's doing
[11:03.440 --> 11:06.560]  with this announcement you're going to get more of that you're not going to get
[11:06.560 --> 11:11.800]  less of it well exactly and then you know there's the constitutional perspective
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.840]  which is key as far as I'm concerned I think Pat Buchanan nailed it in his
[11:16.840 --> 11:23.040]  article today he said future presidents will cite the Obama precedent we have
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.880]  just taken a monumental step away from republicanism towards Caesarism yes this
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.600]  is ruled by dictat the rejection of which sparks the American Revolution but
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.200]  David I mean that revolution is not going to be led by the Republican
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.600]  leadership because we know already they've come out with their lukewarm
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.280]  response against it as we predicted yesterday yes and it's encapsulated in
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.720]  a Washington Post article which talks about how Boehner and McConnell are more
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.320]  concerned over the party's brand than anything else they're concerned about
[11:57.320 --> 12:03.280]  having a stable period of GOP governance and this is summed up in a quote by
[12:03.280 --> 12:09.040]  Peter King out of New York a Republican particularly illustrative of the Rhino
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.240]  Republican rhetoric that we're seeing he said it's the first real challenge for
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.040]  Boehner and McConnell together they'd like to wipe the slate clean for when
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.880]  they start up next year with this situation behind us and what he's
[12:20.880 --> 12:28.040]  talking about is eliminating the quote insurgent Tea Party Republicans shunning
[12:28.040 --> 12:32.440]  them to the side restricting their influence on the party and dropping any
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.640]  opposition to Obama's executive amnesty so the leadership of the Republican
[12:37.640 --> 12:43.000]  Party across the board will do absolutely nothing to stop this train wreck and to
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.360]  reverse what Obama has wrought on the country over the past six years oh
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.960]  absolutely they want this badly this is for the US Chamber of Commerce this is
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.720]  for the large companies that want to have competition for blue collar workers
[12:56.720 --> 13:00.320]  for people at the bottom end of the scale those are the people who have
[13:00.320 --> 13:05.320]  traditionally been core to the Democrat Party they're the ones that Obama has
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.160]  really betrayed but the Republicans are betraying the country the Republicans
[13:09.160 --> 13:12.440]  themselves or Republican leadership is betraying the Constitution now we do have
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.440]  some Republicans who are speaking out on it remains to be seen what they're
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.200]  going to do Louie Gohmert said the president has said well Congress didn't
[13:19.200 --> 13:22.400]  act I waited six years so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and he said that's
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.200]  outrageous and it is we have a system of checks and balances we have a
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.200]  constitutional system we have rule of law look at how many things for example
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.600]  Ronald Reagan who was up against Democrats majority in both houses of
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.360]  Congress a lot of things that he wanted to do that they blocked him on and he
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.720]  didn't say well you know I waited for six months or waited for six years and
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.560]  you didn't do what I wanted to do so I'm just gonna sign a bill and make it
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.360]  happen on my own without you I mean he didn't do that in spite of what they're
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.040]  saying about the amnesty there's a really good article that really kind of
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.800]  laid that out there's been a lot of back and forth between left and right AP
[13:59.800 --> 14:03.760]  put out a story earlier this week saying that well you know both Reagan and
[14:03.760 --> 14:07.520]  Bush did exactly the same thing that Obama is doing no they didn't at all
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.560]  this is a good analysis Paul that I saw on the power line blog basically he got
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.480]  into some of the details of it the Simpson-Mazzoli act the immigration
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.840]  reform and control act of 1986 required Reagan the president to adjust the
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.760]  status of certain illegal immigrants to the category of quote alien lawfully
[14:25.760 --> 14:30.440]  admitted for temporary residents it also authorized the attorney general to
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.080]  allow other illegal immigrants who did not qualify for amnesty to remain in the
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.600]  US if they needed to quote assure family unity so the small number of people that
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.000]  was adjusted by Reagan later on was in compliance with that and he said they
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.160]  even quoted it in their article that in their in their order rather they said
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.640]  the administration made it clear it was carrying out the direction of Congress it
[14:51.640 --> 14:56.080]  even cited the section of law from the Simpson-Mazzoli act that provided this
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.920]  direction and he has the section of law there the bottom line is is that he was
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.400]  not acting against the will of the people they were essentially implementing
[15:06.400 --> 15:12.640]  the law that was there well precisely I mean Pelosi came out before Obama's
[15:12.640 --> 15:17.080]  speech and said basically along with other establishment Democrats look
[15:17.080 --> 15:22.000]  Obama's only doing what Reagan did in 86 but Reagan didn't sign an executive
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.240]  order it was it was an act passed by Congress it was even if you disagreed
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.400]  with it it was constitutional what Obama's doing as Senator Sessions said
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.960]  is becoming America's first emperor and going back on his own words from as
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.360]  recently as last year in fact Sessions quotes Obama in his article today quote
[15:42.360 --> 15:46.120]  I know some people want me to bypass Congress this is Obama remember last
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.200]  year yeah and change the laws on my own that's not how our democracy functions
[15:51.200 --> 15:55.360]  that's not how our Constitution is written the problem is that I'm the
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.480]  president of the United States I'm not the emperor of the United States my job
[15:59.480 --> 16:05.240]  is to execute laws that are passed so that was Obama last year responding to
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.040]  pressure from immigration activists and the foundations lobby groups that
[16:10.040 --> 16:15.800]  support them to pass executive action on immigration he basically said I can't do
[16:15.800 --> 16:19.960]  that because it would violate the Constitution and make me an emperor yes
[16:19.960 --> 16:25.200]  now he's done exactly that so in his own words and with his own actions yesterday
[16:25.200 --> 16:30.360]  and today Obama is admitting that he is now officially Caesar he's the emperor
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.160]  and this is just the beginning as we talked about yesterday we've got more
[16:34.160 --> 16:38.840]  coming down the pipeline we've got global warming executive orders which
[16:38.840 --> 16:42.920]  could completely eviscerate the US economy talking about ridiculous
[16:42.920 --> 16:49.000]  reductions in carbon tax first to 2005 levels eventually they want an 80%
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.520]  reduction in carbon tax and then a hundred percent reduction in carbon tax
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.120]  so I guess you know human beings aren't going to be able to
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.640]  exhale for very much longer if they get their full agenda through but this is
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.320]  only the beginning if this precedent is set as Buchanan said it's going to
[17:07.320 --> 17:11.520]  grease the skids for for something that could reverberate for the next several
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.560]  administrations and get worse and worse it fundamentally changes the structure
[17:16.560 --> 17:21.200]  of government it essentially does make him a dictator if he says I gave this
[17:21.200 --> 17:24.800]  agenda to Congress they didn't act on it so I'm just going to ignore them and go
[17:24.800 --> 17:28.400]  over their heads as you were pointing out he's mentioned this several times
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.040]  Rand Paul pointed that out in his speech yesterday he said the president has said
[17:32.040 --> 17:38.760]  22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration
[17:38.760 --> 17:44.280]  you know when you speak this with an executive order when you dictate it in
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.240]  other words a dictator somebody the law comes out of their mouth that's why they
[17:49.240 --> 17:53.440]  call them dictators that's why he's a dictator the only thing I disagree with
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.960]  here he says I believe immigration reform is needed we must first secure the
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.440]  border I don't think that it's going to be possible to and to secure the border
[18:01.440 --> 18:06.000]  as long as you incentivize illegal immigration in the way that Obama has
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.440]  with DACA with this newest order whatever they decide to call it but
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.320]  there's been many many cases already where he should have been impeached for
[18:15.320 --> 18:21.720]  criminal action he and Eric Holder and it to allow them to have a pass for this
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.640]  long and to do nothing about it we know that the Republicans don't want to do
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.720]  anything about it because a their corporate sponsors want this to happen
[18:29.720 --> 18:33.880]  and b they want the power when they become president so they're going to set
[18:33.880 --> 18:38.960]  by and allow this to become even more concentrated into the hands of one man
[18:38.960 --> 18:44.720]  and let the entire elected Congress become this useless vestige of power
[18:44.720 --> 18:50.040]  that's just sitting there and the fact is if you go and look at Dennis
[18:50.040 --> 18:54.440]  Kucinich's articles of impeachment against George W. Bush from back in I
[18:54.440 --> 19:00.840]  think it was 2007 2008 Obama and this was a couple of years ago now Obama has
[19:00.840 --> 19:05.800]  already fulfilled 27 out of the 35 articles of impeachment that were
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.120]  leveled against Bush and he's probably added a few more to that tally since
[19:10.120 --> 19:13.880]  that was since that was emphasized a couple of years ago oh yeah now you can
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.320]  add this to it but as he said it's it's very very unlikely to happen because
[19:18.320 --> 19:22.680]  the Republican establishment is in league with the Democratic leadership
[19:22.680 --> 19:27.720]  they're completely disinterested in standing up to this Obama Caesar
[19:27.720 --> 19:33.440]  precedent ruled by dicta just as the Democrat leadership failed to punish
[19:33.440 --> 19:38.040]  Bush for his unconstitutional activities in regards to illegal war and
[19:38.040 --> 19:44.640]  torture back in 2006 after the 2006 midterms so they they refused to roll
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.000]  back the damage that Obama has done because as he said their only concern
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.120]  is remaining in power they don't care about fixing the country absolutely we
[19:54.120 --> 19:57.840]  gotta go to break Paul will be right back to party monopoly in America hang on

[24:19.480 --> 24:29.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David I don't this Friday November 21st
[24:29.600 --> 24:36.240]  2014 the day after Obama has just told five million people they say that they
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.720]  can stay course we don't really know how many people that is they're not really
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.800]  keeping information on people as they come across our open borders what he's
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.360]  done is he's created an entitlement program and he's created he's incentivized
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.960]  one more time and one more way illegal immigration now Paul we just had
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.280]  yesterday as this was being done we see just the opposite happening in Mexico
[25:00.280 --> 25:03.040]  they announced that they're going to start charging Americans crossing the
[25:03.040 --> 25:09.560]  border $28 if they're going to come in and in a new pilot program we however
[25:09.560 --> 25:15.320]  extend free health care free education a get out of jail card for free I mean
[25:15.320 --> 25:19.920]  it's we do just the opposite has there ever been a country that has done this
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.640]  every other country requires if you immigrate to that country that you not
[25:23.640 --> 25:29.000]  only have to already have a means of support already have an income savings
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.480]  that sort of thing to show that you can support yourself and your family I mean
[25:32.480 --> 25:35.560]  that's Mexico it's Belize it's any country that you want to immigrate to
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.880]  isn't it well precisely unless they're following the European Socialist model
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.800]  which they are and that's the key point you have to understand the thinking that
[25:44.800 --> 25:49.240]  drives Obama and the people behind him and again it's it would take hours to
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.560]  explain but it's best summed up in Dinesh De Souza's America imagine a world
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.200]  without her basically it sounds like a cliche but it boils down to the fact
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.320]  that they hate America they think it should be completely transformed yes you
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.600]  were making the point yesterday because Obama's mentors are people like Reverend
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.240]  Wright Phil Ayres the domestic weather underground terrorist who by the way
[26:12.240 --> 26:17.280]  they invented the term white privilege so they were at the original race baiters
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.840]  and they were a big influence on Obama so it's based on this liberation
[26:21.840 --> 26:28.120]  theology this idea that the land that is now America was stolen from Mexico
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.920]  during the war which of course during that time all across the world all
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.880]  territorial wars were fought over they would they had battles over them they
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.120]  were not stolen they were worn or lost in wars that's not a positive or a
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.120]  negative thing that's a neutral that's just the way that the world worked at
[26:46.120 --> 26:51.200]  that time but this this racist extremist ideology that the land was
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.120]  stolen from Mexicans as being inoculated in that culture which the big
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.960]  foundations the lobby groups have seized upon well actually the ideology
[27:00.960 --> 27:05.800]  actually drives Obama that drives the people behind him which is why Nancy
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.600]  Pelosi called it likened it to the Emancipation Proclamation right yeah
[27:10.600 --> 27:15.240]  because they think that the Mexicans in America the illegals are basically
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.600]  refugees are slaves because they should be in Mexico because the land was
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.920]  stolen I think there's a lesson I think there's a lesson I'm Obama paying back
[27:24.920 --> 27:30.120]  a debt go ahead yeah I think there's a lesson from the Mexican Revolution for
[27:30.120 --> 27:36.600]  Obama it wasn't just Texas that revolted against the dictatorial tyrant it was
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.320]  multiple provinces three of them Texas was just one of them established
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.760]  governments he was able to put down the revolution everywhere except in Texas
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.360]  and it wasn't just Americans people coming in from English-speaking people
[27:50.360 --> 27:55.520]  coming in from America it was people who were Mexican who were Hispanic Latino
[27:55.520 --> 28:00.000]  who were living in the area as well that revolted against that tyranny that
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.560]  should be the lesson for them not that it's some kind of Latins versus English
[28:05.560 --> 28:10.240]  people I think it's interesting too to look at this situation that we had a
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.960]  report on yesterday RT reported this American-born London mayor maybe you
[28:13.960 --> 28:19.400]  can talk about this Boris Johnson refuses to pay taxes to the US he left
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.600]  when he was five years old and now the IRS is coming after this guy who's been
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.440]  mayor of London since 2008 I think maybe some of the people who are coming this
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.160]  country might want to second-think second guess whether they want to be US
[28:33.160 --> 28:38.040]  citizens or not there's a lot of baggage attached to that well I mean the
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.720]  the creators and the business owners are leaving America in droves the middle
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.680]  class yes there's a flight away from America because they're the very people
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.600]  being punished under this transformative system that Obama is bringing in and in
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.240]  fact some of these illegals are now going to be you know semi-legal they're
[28:55.240 --> 28:58.560]  going to get EITC payments because they're going to be enrolled in the tax
[28:58.560 --> 29:01.360]  system they're not going to pay a lot of tax but they're going to get a lot of
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.120]  benefits out of this EITC system and that's being paid for by American
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.240]  taxpayers so your dollars are going directly to these illegal immigrants as
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.440]  a result of this Obama program well the biggest area of taxation for most people
[29:15.440 --> 29:18.640]  whether they realize that or not are the local taxes that pay for the schools and
[29:18.640 --> 29:22.880]  of course everyone K through 12 is going to be getting a free ride if they're
[29:22.880 --> 29:26.480]  living in this area they're also going to get free medical care whether or not
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.360]  that's part of Obama because that's part of the law if you go to a emergency
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.520]  room they have to treat you so that's going to be something that is on our
[29:34.520 --> 29:40.000]  nickel as I said before it's really a su casa me casa your house becomes my house
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.560]  whether you like it or not but I think it's kind of in reverse with what's
[29:43.560 --> 29:46.320]  going on with the London mayor he's not even here but they're coming after him
[29:46.320 --> 29:49.320]  for taxes they're essentially getting a free ride would be right back with Paul

[33:35.200 --> 33:40.480]  the revival of the cold war as well as economic issues of course he was in the

[33:48.680 --> 33:54.040]  filia from slave block to pedestal because what is coming up in ferguson is
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.120]  a complete takeover of what really should have been talked about not just
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.360]  because of that single shooting there's so much anger and unrest there because
[34:03.360 --> 34:09.400]  that is not an isolated incident there's a pattern of behavior an epidemic of
[34:09.400 --> 34:13.720]  police violence throughout this country not just in ferguson certainly race
[34:13.720 --> 34:18.280]  plays a part of it it is a component but they have made it solely about race and
[34:18.280 --> 34:21.960]  so we're going to talk to him about that talk to him about uh we'll also be
[34:21.960 --> 34:27.920]  talking with paul joseph whatson about why we can't have real genuine police
[34:27.920 --> 34:31.560]  reform we're also going to have joe biggs and jacari jackson joining us from
[34:31.560 --> 34:36.880]  ferguson our reporters are there on the scene today is the day that we are
[34:36.880 --> 34:41.600]  expecting to hear the verdict announced there before i go back to paul joseph
[34:41.600 --> 34:46.120]  whatson i wanted to let you know that silver bullet is back that's how we pay
[34:46.120 --> 34:50.600]  for the alex jones radio show here is the products that we sell and this is a
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.760]  great product this is concentrated to 30 parts per million in a pure base of
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.960]  deionized water very high concentration makes it difficult and dangerous to
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.320]  produce this and this kind of high concentration so it could run out very
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.080]  soon it takes at least six more weeks to get it in this is a great time to stock
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.720]  up on silver course with flu season coming up and many other viruses coming
[35:14.720 --> 35:18.840]  around during the winter colloidal silver is a vital supplement for
[35:18.840 --> 35:22.000]  maintaining your healthy lifestyle there's never been a more important time
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.200]  to have a powerful and clean form of colloidal silver within reach for you and
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.560]  your family go to info wars life dot com to order silver bullet now you can call
[35:30.560 --> 35:39.200]  888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139 silver bullet it's back and it is a
[35:39.200 --> 35:47.320]  limited supply well Paul today we've got the verdict coming out of Ferguson most
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.720]  people believe with the the grand jury that's going to deliver their verdict
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.200]  everybody expects that Darren Wilson is going to walk he has made it known that
[35:58.200 --> 36:03.560]  he is willing to resign I guess is kind of a peace offering we're going to be
[36:03.560 --> 36:09.440]  going to jacari Jackson and Joe Biggs and Ferguson later in the show but what's
[36:09.440 --> 36:15.680]  your take on this from looking at it from from a distance well I put a video
[36:15.680 --> 36:21.080]  out a couple of days ago the truth about the Michael Brown shooting and you have
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.960]  to bear in mind I mean I would preface this by saying I've written numerous
[36:24.960 --> 36:31.000]  articles about police brutality directed against black people recently there
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.560]  was the case in New York where the guy was choked to death by a police officer
[36:35.560 --> 36:40.120]  for the crime of selling cigarettes on the street yes I mean that that caused
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.680]  some protest it was in the news for about a week then it completely disappeared
[36:44.680 --> 36:50.720]  it was forgotten about even though it was a clear-cut case of police brutality
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.800]  and in my mind at least manslaughter and the evidence is there for everybody to
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.680]  see on tape with this Michael Brown situation it's it's a lot more
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.640]  ambiguous which is what we find time and time again the race baiters the Al
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.560]  Sharptons of the world they always jump on the ambiguous cases the Trayvon
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.520]  Martins the Michael Browns and immediately decide on the guilt of whoever
[37:16.520 --> 37:20.920]  the whoever they want to demonize is involved before any evidence has come
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.760]  in the problem with this Michael Brown situation again there's a police problem
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.800]  in Ferguson there's a genuine problem with police brutality in Ferguson there's
[37:30.800 --> 37:35.320]  a massive problem with police brutality across America nobody's denying that
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.040]  and nobody's championed fixing that problem as much as we have but if you
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.800]  look at the actual evidence in the Michael Brown case at best it's
[37:45.800 --> 37:50.560]  ambiguous and at worst if you look at the autopsy the ballistics evidence and
[37:50.560 --> 37:56.080]  what the eyewitnesses said which we can get on get on to in a moment it backs up
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.800]  officer Wilson's case and that's the problem the black leaders that have
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.080]  jumped on board the race baiters the Al Sharptons you know the FBI former FBI
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.000]  informant and his ilk have refused to take into account any of this evidence
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.520]  because it doesn't fit the narrative that they're trying to advance which again
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.000]  is based around race baiting which we've we've explained on many occasions
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.080]  benefits nobody whatsoever yeah absolutely my only concern about it is
[38:24.080 --> 38:28.640]  that they took a very very long time to put out any evidence that would clear
[38:28.640 --> 38:31.880]  the officer that took a very long time they should have come out with that
[38:31.880 --> 38:36.920]  right away unless unless they wanted this tension to build that's my concern
[38:36.920 --> 38:40.680]  about it you know whenever something like this happens and they've got a crisis
[38:40.680 --> 38:44.600]  they always try to use it to the maximum whether it's for gun control or
[38:44.600 --> 38:48.480]  whether it's to try to stoke a race war and when I look at the way this thing
[38:48.480 --> 38:54.000]  was handled that's my big concern about it is that that was really I think that
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.360]  was part of the agenda I think they deliberately let this thing run for a
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.320]  very long time before they gave any evidence that would would clear the
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.880]  officer but I want to get your reaction to this Paul it just came out of the
[39:04.880 --> 39:08.280]  Albuquerque police department and of course Albuquerque is famous for being
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.320]  the place that has the highest number of shootings per capita many many times
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.040]  more than let's say New York City for example so much so that for several
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.320]  years they've been under the scrutiny of the Department of Justice supposedly
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.600]  trying to get them to stop although we know that this kind of mentality is
[39:26.600 --> 39:32.120]  coming out of Washington now we see just as they announced I think it was just
[39:32.120 --> 39:35.480]  like nine days earlier they announced an agreement with the Department of
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.400]  Justice that they were going to change their approach their mentality towards
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.880]  the public and of course not only are there statistics out of control but I
[39:43.880 --> 39:47.560]  think the one incident that really galvanized this with everybody was the
[39:47.560 --> 39:52.200]  shooting of that homeless man up on the hill that was what was recorded on
[39:52.200 --> 39:56.480]  their on their police cameras and everybody saw them shoot this unarmed
[39:56.480 --> 40:03.000]  man at a distance kill him at a distance where he could not effectively harm
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.760]  them in any way shape or form he was unarmed nevertheless this is what just
[40:06.760 --> 40:12.320]  came out a kill ology instruction class now this is a guy who this is the
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.400]  actual title of it it's bulletproof mind prevailing and violent encounters
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.520]  before and after this is a class it's going to be taught to the Albuquerque
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.080]  police officers this guy represents himself as the world's leading combat
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.640]  authority and the founder of kill ology he says there are people who wake up
[40:31.640 --> 40:37.640]  every morning determined to send your family into a box are you aware that
[40:37.640 --> 40:42.800]  you're in a war and you are the warrior see that warrior mentality that
[40:42.800 --> 40:48.320]  encapsulates it in that one sentence that encapsulates what the federal
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.040]  government with Homeland Security has been telling police for so long that's
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.520]  why there's this mentality that's the thing that's underlying this epidemic
[40:56.520 --> 40:59.840]  of police violence so you can see on the monitor that's the shooting in the
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.800]  Albuquerque Hills of that homeless man who was camping out they killed him
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.760]  because he was camping out and wouldn't follow their orders evidently and
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.320]  perhaps there's some mental issues there but he certainly was not a threat to
[41:11.320 --> 41:18.040]  them if you or I have a gun and we have it for our self-defense and we shoot
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.800]  somebody who is not an immediate threat to us that is called murder and it
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.360]  should be called murder and it should be called murder even if you're wearing a
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.400]  blue uniform it should be called murder now of course the Department of
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.440]  Justice says we need to shift away from this mentality of viewing all citizens
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.240]  as enemy combatants of some sort and yet they're the ones the very ones who
[41:38.240 --> 41:41.840]  are pushing this sort of thing and that's what is being stoked on the other
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.520]  side of this as the demonstrators are threatening the police in the streets
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.520]  saying we're going to come to your house we're going to shoot your kids I see
[41:49.520 --> 41:55.000]  this whole thing moving into a race war moving into a violent conflict
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.400]  and stoking this whole mentality that's being sold by the central government
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.640]  that this is a war zone Paul you want to comment on that yeah and it goes back
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.360]  to the point I just made the media and the establishment the black leadership
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.040]  groups that completely sell out black people every chance they get they only
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.600]  jump on the ambiguous cases when you've got the homeless guy being shot and the
[42:17.600 --> 42:20.560]  officer beforehand it came out on tape saying I'm going to shoot him in the
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.000]  penis deliberately went out to kill him yes of course we had the Kelly Thomas
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.760]  brutal beating which ended in his death the war against homeless people that
[42:30.760 --> 42:35.000]  gets basically zero attention there were people back in May storming the
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.080]  council meetings in Albuquerque trying to arrest the chief of police yes over
[42:40.080 --> 42:46.600]  this police brutality they've had 40 shootings since 2010 25 of which were
[42:46.600 --> 42:51.480]  fatalities they stormed the council meetings on numerous occasions and again
[42:51.480 --> 42:56.080]  it was only in local media that was a huge story with the killing of the
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.920]  homeless man and the repercussions afterwards but it never went outside
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.600]  local Albuquerque media there may be sporadic mentions but nothing like
[43:04.600 --> 43:09.440]  Ferguson nothing like Trayvon Martin and even in cases as I said where black
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.160]  people are targeted and killed by police if it can't be made into a race baiting
[43:14.160 --> 43:18.360]  issue if it can't be hijacked by the likes of Al Sharpton and old Barma if
[43:18.360 --> 43:23.080]  it's ambiguous which is in the Brown and Trayvon Martin cases yes they're not
[43:23.080 --> 43:27.280]  interested in it and yes that's exactly right they seize exactly when you said
[43:27.280 --> 43:31.800]  that they seize on the ambiguous cases they elevate those they try to highlight
[43:31.800 --> 43:36.640]  the ambiguity they try to highlight what might exonerate somebody early on
[43:36.640 --> 43:41.280]  they are deliberately stoking this thing but we really do need to have a
[43:41.280 --> 43:44.360]  discussion and of course we're not getting that discussion on what do we do
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.200]  about the police there's another article here this is Buffalo New York they're
[43:49.200 --> 43:52.560]  talking about one police department a small police department in Buffalo has
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.720]  shot 92 dogs in three years one of the officers has killed about a third of
[43:57.720 --> 44:04.520]  those 25 of them by himself one officer has killed these dogs now why is this
[44:04.520 --> 44:08.800]  important it's not that dogs are more important than human lives because we
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.360]  know that people are getting shot down on the streets all the time as well but
[44:12.360 --> 44:17.320]  this tells you about the mentality it also tells you about what's driving this
[44:17.320 --> 44:22.000]  of course because in many of these cases it's a situation where they have a
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.080]  SWAT team with a no-knock raid and of course dogs are going to bark when
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.320]  somebody comes to your door in most cases it startles them what do you think
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.240]  they're going to do when somebody blows the door open but they don't even wait
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.800]  for that we've had videos that have surfaced in recent weeks of a small
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.240]  dog that was running away and being shot by the police as it was running away
[44:43.240 --> 44:46.560]  we've got another video of the police calling a dog over to them and shooting
[44:46.560 --> 44:52.120]  it they put these videos up and Paul when I look at this it reminds me that one
[44:52.120 --> 44:57.000]  of the characteristics of serial killers is that they are cruel to animals at a
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.200]  very young age as a lack of empathy and that's the dangerous thing when they
[45:02.200 --> 45:05.800]  can look at a dog that is no threat to them brag about the fact that they're
[45:05.800 --> 45:09.680]  killing these animals that shows that they don't have any empathy for any
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.000]  living things and of course we see them doing this over and over again to the
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.680]  general public as we've been talking about so many years here at Info Wars
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.040]  and yet there is nothing that's being done about that because they always move
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.480]  it into some kind of a like you said they choose the ambiguous situation and
[45:24.480 --> 45:30.440]  move it into a race war yes it's the fact they're being trained to
[45:30.440 --> 45:35.000]  immediately escalate situations and immediately resort to violent force
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.800]  without adequately surveying the severity of the situation that's that
[45:39.800 --> 45:43.800]  seems to happen in every single case and that must come from their training
[45:43.800 --> 45:48.680]  there are good cops out there that need to speak out against this but with the
[45:48.680 --> 45:54.400]  Ferguson situation I mean I've made the point that these violent protests by the
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.640]  agitators that have hijacked the initial protest they only serve to
[45:58.640 --> 46:04.240]  delegitimize opposition to police brutality which is a genuine problem so
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.480]  now you've got the entirety of the conservative media basically in America
[46:08.480 --> 46:14.600]  pouring scorn on all of these Ferguson activists and demonstrators yet the
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.040]  problem of police brutality is very real but in that circumstance it's being
[46:19.040 --> 46:24.160]  delegitimize when these people loot and become violent because the conservative
[46:24.160 --> 46:29.480]  media analyzes the evidence in the brown case which clearly shows that I mean
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.800]  look at the autopsy results he did struggle with the officer in the car
[46:33.800 --> 46:39.240]  and he did try to grab his gun all the evidence suggests six black witnesses
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.800]  said that he charged Wilson afterwards and that's when he shot him again the
[46:43.800 --> 46:49.160]  evidence shows that his hands were not up when the final shots were fired they
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.440]  were down by his side so again that whole narrative hands up don't shoot
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.600]  comes completely undone by the actual autopsy evidence yes and you've got
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.440]  forensic pathologist like Judy Melanek asserting that there's no evidence that
[47:02.440 --> 47:07.960]  he attempted to surrender when Wilson shot him in the street again so when the
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.760]  conservative media looks at that and sees that there's not actually a huge case
[47:12.760 --> 47:16.480]  against officer Wilson which is why you will probably be acquitted on the
[47:16.480 --> 47:21.640]  evidence they then look at it and see they make the judgment that these these
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.720]  black people these people in Ferguson are just rioting for the sake of it and
[47:25.720 --> 47:31.120]  looting for the sake of it overlooking a genuine police problem in Ferguson and
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.720]  dismissing and diminishing the legitimacy of the police brutality problem
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.720]  that has swept America over the last 10 15 years which is documented by the
[47:41.720 --> 47:46.840]  likes of the ACLU you know the increasing use of SWAT teams raiding
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.800]  houses throwing flashbangs in babies cribs it's a genuine problem yeah
[47:51.800 --> 47:56.000]  conservative media sees this evidence and then they use it to dismiss the
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.840]  general issue of police brutality yes I mean that's that's why I say that it
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.480]  dealer just legitimizes opposition to police brutality when you actually base
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.920]  a whole movement and that movement becomes violent on a case like the
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.320]  Michael Brown shooting which if you actually study the evidence officer
[48:15.320 --> 48:20.280]  Wilson will be acquitted for it based on that evidence not because he's white but
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.360]  because the evidence suggests that his story his account is true exactly you've
[48:25.360 --> 48:28.640]  got the agent provocateurs that are there doing their job you've got the
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.040]  government which could have released this information that would clear officer
[48:33.040 --> 48:37.920]  Wilson but you know they I think as you pointed out this is something that they
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.800]  are really using to essentially stoke the race war to stoke the tension between
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.720]  the police and the public to drive home the point that the the mentality that
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.080]  they've been trying to sell the police for a very long time that they're
[48:51.080 --> 48:57.040]  combatants in a war and that the public is the enemy combatant we see that in
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.680]  documents from the federal government constantly we see that in the training
[49:00.680 --> 49:03.720]  that they're giving there to police departments just as this latest memo
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.120]  surfaces from the Albuquerque Police Department I think it was interesting
[49:07.120 --> 49:10.200]  Paul and I wanted to read a couple of comments here that Frank Serpico had and
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.160]  of course everybody is seeing the movie Serpico with Al Pacino you know that
[49:15.160 --> 49:20.280]  story very well but he says he tried to be an honest cop and a force that was
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.600]  full of bribe takers he thinks that police violence has gotten worse as the
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.880]  bribery has gotten less now I don't know about that clearly the bribery is not as
[49:30.880 --> 49:35.280]  visible as people getting shot down in the streets you didn't see that kind of
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.640]  people could still be on the take and of course we know that both of these
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.960]  things actually are coming from the war on drugs that's the thing that corrupted
[49:43.960 --> 49:48.840]  the police when Serpico was a cop in New York it was the war on drugs but now the
[49:48.840 --> 49:53.200]  aspect of the war on drugs that is coming home to roost are these no-knock
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.480]  SWAT team raids that kind of violence that's what's behind so many of these
[49:57.480 --> 50:01.760]  shootings and that's what has been feeding this mentality of a militarized
[50:01.760 --> 50:08.200]  police he said the problem facing people across the country is that the police
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.360]  departments are useless at investigating themselves he says this may be the
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.960]  problem in Ferguson, Missouri which has been a lightning rod for discontent even
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.280]  though the circumstances under which an African-American youth Michael Brown was
[50:19.280 --> 50:23.860]  shot remain unclear he said most cops today can pull out their weapons and
[50:23.860 --> 50:27.480]  fire without fear that anything will happen to them even if they shoot
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.040]  someone wrongfully what do you think that does to their psychology as they
[50:32.040 --> 50:37.000]  patrol the streets that sense of invulnerability the famous old saying
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.880]  that power corrupts an absolute power corrupts absolutely we still don't know
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.280]  how many of these incidents occur each year even though Congress enacted the
[50:44.280 --> 50:49.800]  violent crime control act 20 years ago these reports on the police violence
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.760]  were never issued that's Frank Serpico we're gonna be right back with Paul

[54:21.800 --> 54:25.960]  Joseph Watson who's joining us from the UK and we were just talking before the
[54:25.960 --> 54:33.400]  break about how unfortunate is that the system has once more taken what should
[54:33.400 --> 54:37.760]  have been a discussion about the epidemic of police violence and
[54:37.760 --> 54:41.680]  essentially seizing on a situation that they knew the officer would get
[54:41.680 --> 54:45.720]  exonerated turning that into a situation where they can exploit racial
[54:45.720 --> 54:52.360]  tensions where they can fuel the fires of suspicion between police officers the
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.960]  attitude that they are in a war zone that the public is the enemy combatant
[54:56.960 --> 55:00.760]  all of those are the things that we expect to see come out of Ferguson
[55:00.760 --> 55:04.480]  that's what we are seeing coming out of Ferguson rather than any kind of
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.840]  discussion about limiting the rules of engagement essentially holding the
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.040]  police to the same standards that they hold other police to other people to as
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.480]  Serpico put it he came up with six points in his article here that's on
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.360]  Politico and you really need to take a look at this this is back on August 23rd
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.920]  it's a great article from Serpico he lays out the problems and he has six
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.800]  solutions he thinks now one of those I thought was interesting was require
[55:31.800 --> 55:35.640]  community involvement from police officers so they know the districts and
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.240]  the individuals are policing that will encourage empathy and understanding I've
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.240]  seen a lot of that go down since you know when they started with police they
[55:43.240 --> 55:47.280]  were walking neighborhoods and big cities that's really where the policing
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.960]  started in big cities people knew who the police were the police knew the
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.240]  people yet now we see there's no such connection they're typically in police
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.040]  cars there's typically harassing people for minor traffic violations they're
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.160]  doing nothing really to protect the residents they don't know the
[56:03.160 --> 56:06.680]  residents there's no connection there within the community but he also says
[56:06.680 --> 56:10.720]  of course enforce the laws against everyone including police officers he
[56:10.720 --> 56:15.520]  says last but not least police cannot police themselves we need to have
[56:15.520 --> 56:20.120]  permanent independent boards to review incidents of police corruption and
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.040]  brutality if there was some kind of an independent board I don't think they
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.000]  would have been able to manipulate this such situation in Ferguson to get where
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.720]  it is today Paul well exactly and there was a cop who came out the other day I
[56:32.720 --> 56:38.560]  forgot how what area he was making the point that 80% of crime violent crime
[56:38.560 --> 56:44.040]  in many cities is black-on-black crime and amidst this race-baiting national
[56:44.040 --> 56:49.680]  debate that black-on-black violent crime which is a far bigger problem gets
[56:49.680 --> 56:52.800]  ignored and then the other problem as you mentioned is there seems to be no
[56:52.800 --> 56:57.680]  retribution against the police that engage in this brutality the cop who
[56:57.680 --> 57:02.440]  pepper sprayed occupy demonstrators you remember that oh yeah oh yeah I mean he
[57:02.440 --> 57:06.800]  got I forgot whether it was I think it was an insurance payout because he's
[57:06.800 --> 57:11.280]  his livelihood was harmed by the publicity of that incident so he was
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.800]  actually rewarded but I think it was at least a hundred thousand dollars for
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.000]  pepper spraying you know two dozen students directly in the face in that
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.120]  horrific famous footage that we all saw so as he said when there's no
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.560]  retribution against them they're just as likely to do it even more so it
[57:28.560 --> 57:33.440]  doesn't discourage police brutality encourages it yeah and you know I don't
[57:33.440 --> 57:37.720]  see any movement towards trying to get independent boards who are going to
[57:37.720 --> 57:41.080]  oversee what the police are doing instead we're going just the opposite
[57:41.080 --> 57:46.240]  into more of a police state we've got this report out of Pennsylvania where
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.040]  they're going to allow the police who are in the schools I'm looking at this
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.480]  picture and I see two police officers looking at this little kid being a
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.120]  company buyer parent walking her in and it's like what is wrong with this
[57:57.120 --> 58:00.760]  picture it's like oh that's right they didn't have police in the schools when I
[58:00.760 --> 58:04.280]  went to school number one number two listen to what they're going to do says
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.880]  the superintendent says I can't imagine a scenario that would get to a search
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.880]  down to the undergarments yet they still felt it necessary to give that power
[58:13.880 --> 58:18.200]  to the police in the schools they're going to allow them to strip strip search
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.880]  the kids even though they say well I can't even understand why we would do
[58:21.880 --> 58:25.440]  that we're not going to do that to search for drugs I don't really know but
[58:25.440 --> 58:30.840]  hey we should have the power to do whatever we want that's the mentality
[58:30.840 --> 58:34.560]  that is feeding the police state in America stay with us we're going to be
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.680]  right back with Paul Joseph Watson and Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining

[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:29.160]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and Austin
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.880]  joined with Paul Joseph Watson in the UK we've been talking about Obama's
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.520]  amnesty essentially crossing the Rubicon announcing himself as emperor
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.520]  because you know hey he didn't get what he wanted out of the Congress so he just
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.120]  decided to do it himself and bypass Congress and so now Congress is this
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.200]  useless appendage if they don't do something about it he's thrown down the
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.000]  gauntlet are they going to pick it up and do anything about it we're hearing
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.240]  some tough talk Rand Paul says he's not going to sit idly by and let the
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.640]  president bypass Congress and the Constitution we hear a US representative
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.480]  Mo Brooks Republican from Alabama went further he said that the there's a
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.440]  federal statute that punishes anyone who aides or bets encourages or entices
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.760]  foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States of America in other words
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.320]  Obama should face prison there's a lot of people in the Obama administration
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.720]  that should face prison Paul you mentioned that Dennis Kaseniches went
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:33.920]  through and had 37 points to impeach George HW George W. Bush and
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.560]  essentially we've met all those with with Obama and of course if you look back
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.920]  at the articles of impeachment for Nixon they look in many respects identical to
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.640]  what Obama has done particularly using the IRS against his political enemies
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.080]  well precisely and the reaction that we predicted which was that the Republican
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.240]  leadership would do absolutely nothing has come to fruition already it's a top
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.720]  story on drudge report Republicans leave town without a plan to fight Obama
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.040]  resident Obama's announcement may bring a constitutional crisis in the words of
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.040]  rep Mike Simpson but Republicans in Congress haven't the damnedest idea what
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.840]  they'll do about it so they've already flown off on Thanksgiving recess no
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.440]  plan whatsoever so the Republicans get this major win right and so they come
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.120]  back and the only thing that they've done that I'm aware of was a past the
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.520]  Keystone pipeline thing for a ninth time sending it to the Senate they know
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.280]  it's going to be dead on arrival but they keep doing that they've done it nine
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.120]  times but they can't even be bothered to do anything about Obama's making
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.600]  himself an emperor and they knew this was coming they've known they've known
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.480]  it's been coming I mean if there's a there's a funding bill for DHS or
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.960]  whatever you can bet your bottom dollar they'll they'll stick with it until it's
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.200]  passed you know McCain and the rest of them when it comes to this they've
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.120]  already left they've gone and you were mentioning just at the top of the hour
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.720]  there this federal statue actually got an email from somebody who found the
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.320]  original statue which representative Mel Brooks talked about it's actually
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:17.240]  imprisonment up to 10 years for anybody caught encouraging inducing aiding or
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:22.400]  abetting an illegal alien for commercial advantage or private financial gain in
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.320]  which the maximum turn of imprisonment is 10 years for each alien that's for
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.560]  each illegal alien they so he can be in there for about a number of years for a
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.520]  long prison sentence by the looks of it if this is if the Republican leadership
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.440]  were bothered yeah he could be in there for about the half-life of a piece of
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.720]  plutonium you know talking about Nixon and getting his Nixon on this is on our
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.800]  website an info wars is from a PJ Media bombshell email proves that the White
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.000]  House and the Department of Justice targeted reporters Cheryl at consent of
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.400]  me talk about having their enemies list talking about acting exactly like Nixon
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.800]  using the IRS against their enemies going after their opponents in the press
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.480]  they say one of the documents provides smoking gun proof that the Obama White

[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:09.880]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin, joined by Paul
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.240]  Joseph Watson in the UK. I wanted to get Paul's reaction to this and I want to
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.080]  give you an idea that I just came across this story. This has been out for
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.360]  about a week. It's been kind of percolating. Could a rapper go to
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.200]  prison for cutting a rap album? Now this is a rapper, Brandon Duncan, also known
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.600]  as Tiny Do. They say he's wrapped with hip-hop artist Lil Wayne, but the
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.680]  bottom line is they're charging him with gang conspiracy. Now listen to the
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.000]  conspiracy theory that the police have come up with. They're using a
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.720]  little-known statute that's been put in place by voters in 2000, allowing
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.600]  the prosecution of gang members if they benefit from crimes committed by other
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.040]  gang members. But this is what his attorney says. He says it's shocking. He
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.480]  has no criminal record. Nothing in his lyrics say go out and commit a crime.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:19.440]  Nothing in his lyrics reference these shootings, yet they're holding him liable
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:25.920]  for conspiracy. You understand? I mean this is guilt by association. This is
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.720]  something that could shut down the First Amendment if they allow this type of
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:35.640]  thing to stand. And one constitutional lawyer that they talked to, the local
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.720]  news station there, talked to him. He says where does it end if that's the
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.080]  definition of criminal liability? Is Martin Scorsese going to be prosecuted
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.280]  if he meets with mafia members for a movie of his next film? The Constitution
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.600]  says it can't be a crime to simply make gangster rap songs and hang out with
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.440]  people who are committing crimes. You have to have more involvement than that.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.560]  It truly is a guilt by association. We go back to what Voltaire said, of course,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.400]  about free speech. You know, I may hate what you're saying, but I will defend to
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.520]  the death. You're right to say it. If we don't take that attitude, say that they
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.640]  pull up these cases. Here's somebody that, you know, most people are going to look at
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.480]  this. If you listen to what he's saying, you probably won't like it, especially if
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.360]  he's talking about the gang members that he's in there. But if we don't defend
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:28.160]  that kind of free speech in principle, we lose that. Furthermore, we're going to
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.160]  expose ourselves to that kind of liability. Just look at what they have
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.800]  been able to do with the Rico Statute. That was going to essentially give them a
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.940]  free hand to come against the mafia by saying they were involved in racketeering
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.960]  influence and corruption. And so they had to confiscate their assets first
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.400]  before prosecution began so they could get a conviction. In other words, punish
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.680]  people before they're found guilty of something. We're seeing that happening
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.560]  everywhere now, not just with war on drugs. We've even seen it in
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.000]  prosecutions of people who are involved in theft. They basically confiscated
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.400]  their home, which they were using as leverage to pay for their defense. So
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.280]  they confiscated their home, confiscated the money that they had gotten from
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.240]  refinancing their home to pay for their defense, leaving them literally
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.400]  defenseless. Paul, what do you think about this?
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.600]  If that says a precedent and every rapper under the sun is going to go to jail,
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.640]  they're also applying it politically. You remember a couple of years ago, the
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.520]  case of Brandon Raub, he made some political statements on his Facebook
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:39.320]  page, was grabbed and basically treated as a violent criminal, interned in a
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.000]  psychiatric ward for a period of days before he was able to get out. Basically
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.040]  for some Facebook comments, which would deem to be threats of violence. If you
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.160]  actually read them, it was nothing of the sort within its own context. So they're
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.840]  using that to go after people politically now. It's still quite
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.880]  rare, but as you said, if they're allowed to set that precedent, it's chilling for
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.440]  each speech. Well, you can see where they're heading with all this stuff,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.680]  because we've seen over and over again the efforts to try to get control of the
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.800]  internet, the FCC trying to assert its control the internet. And they'll do it
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.160]  if that means supporting net neutrality or if it means taking down new net
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.640]  neutrality. They've been on both sides of this issue. They're back on the side of
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.360]  net neutrality again, because that seems to be the side that the public will
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.160]  support. But what they're really trying to do is establish a precedent where the
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.040]  FCC has control of the internet. And we've already seen with their moves to
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.400]  take the pulse of various newsrooms that they are very interested in
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.560]  controlling content, not just in allocating frequency. There's absolutely
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.280]  no need for the FCC to establish net neutrality. Net neutrality is what we've
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.360]  had for about 15 years or as long as the internet's been going, and they don't
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.280]  need to have them come in to establish that. But they're trying to establish
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.480]  their control, and they're going to establish their control with these
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.840]  copyright legislations that they haven't been able to get through, SISPA, SOPA,
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.400]  Act of PIPA. They're going to do that with the Trans-Pacific, the Trans-Atlantic
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.120]  partnership trade agreements. That's a vital part of those agreements that are
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.000]  being negotiated in secret without our elected representatives even being able
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  to see that. They're going to spring that on us. They're going to do that again.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Obama couldn't get his legislative agenda through with Amnesty, so he just
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.320]  declares it as a executive order. What they're going to do with this, since they
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  can't get their agenda through with legislatively in America or in Europe,
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.880]  they're just going to bring it in as part of a trade agreement. It's defending
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.920]  freedom of speech. That's what these guys are really after. They're really trying
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.680]  to shut down the internet, shut down the press, just as we were talking about in
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:55.240]  the previous segment, Cheryl Atkinson, being gagged by CBS. We now have the
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.160]  smoking gun proof. The emails have surfaced within the Justice Department
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.160]  sending emails to CBS, telling them to shut her up because she was asking
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.880]  questions about Fast and Furious, one of the few people in the mainstream media
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.120]  that was asking questions. Yeah, and it's not just Cheryl Atkinson. We had the
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:18.760]  CNBC reporter silence for criticizing Obamacare, so we have that case as well.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:24.160]  We have, you know, CNN journalists who criticize the TSA, and then they go to
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.240]  the airport and find out that they get special treatment. Then going back to
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.840]  the FCC, I mean, you know, they're sending people into newsrooms to try and
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.880]  dictate news content under the guise of polls and surveys. The FCC is not the
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.120]  friend of free speech, and there's a net neutrality issue. They're not even
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.400]  pushing real net neutrality. They're pushing a reclassification of the
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.480]  internet under the Telecommunications Act, so they want it to look like cable
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.800]  television. This has been the agenda for a while. They want to get that
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.320]  regulation in. Numerous congressmen and senators over the years have pushed for
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.840]  a Chinese style internet, and that's what they want. They want the government to
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.800]  have the power in times of crisis, as the communist Chinese government says,
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:12.880]  when it's crushing dissent in Tibet, to go down and shut down certain parts of
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.520]  the internet, make it off limits for people in certain areas of the country.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.920]  Oh, absolutely. That's on record. Lieberman has pushed that for years. That's what
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.720]  they want with this either kill switch or this regulation of the internet. So
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.720]  they talk about them and believe them that it's just about net neutrality is
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.280]  completely naive. Yeah, they talk about how they admire the Chinese approach to
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.520]  the internet. We've had comments from Bush and Clinton how they would love to
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.960]  be a dictator. Finally, we see that Obama just comes out and does it this
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.120]  week, and so we're going to see them do that Chinese style internet as well. Now
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.760]  joining us now, Paul, we've got Paul Craig Roberts, American economist and
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.120]  columnist for creators syndicate. Of course, he was the assistant secretary of
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.480]  the Treasury under the Reagan administration. He earned fame as
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:00.400]  co-founder of Reaganomics. Welcome, Mr. Roberts. Dr. Roberts, sorry. I wanted to
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.080]  get your comment and Paul's got a lot of questions for you. I wanted to get your
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.440]  comment on Jim Webb, who's announced his candidacy opposing Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.160]  He's forming a committee to explore that. I think he could cause Hillary Clinton a
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.400]  lot of discomfort, I think, opposing some of the things that were done as she was
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.760]  Secretary of State. Of course, he was the secretary of the Navy while you were
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:30.000]  there at the Reagan administration. He had some interesting comments about Libya.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.720]  He said there were no treaties at risk. There were no Americans at risk. There were
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.840]  no terrorist attacks coming out of Libya. Why did we attack them? And of course,
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.400]  that's a direct jab at Hillary Clinton. What do you think about Jim Webb? Well, I
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.520]  don't think the establishment will put up with him. Yeah, that's right. He certainly
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:55.360]  would be a far better prospect than Hillary. No doubt about that. He's a real
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:03.360]  person, but because he is a real person, he would not be welcomed by the power
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.760]  structure that selects the president. Yeah, that's right. So I don't really know. He
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.840]  may simply find that he gets smeared or framed up or some kind of accusations
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:25.720]  come forward. That's the usual trick they use to get rid of an unwelcome. He
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.800]  could certainly make things interesting for her because of course with his
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.840]  experience as Secretary of the Navy and he was a Vietnam War vet and he's pretty
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.960]  much come out against military industrial complex at the same time that
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.400]  Hillary is doing everything she can to embrace the military industrial complex
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.200]  and perpetual war, isn't it? That's right, but the fact that he's against it
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.560]  means they'll work against him. Yes, absolutely. I know Paul had some
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.320]  questions he wanted to ask. Go ahead, Paul, bringing you in on this. Yeah, I was just
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.400]  reading Dr. Roberts's article earlier today. The next presidential election will
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.560]  move the world closer to war, in which you write Dr. Roberts, Hillary as
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:07.520]  president would mean war with Russia. Why are we more likely to see this Cold War
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:15.320]  turn hot under Hillary than under Obama or even Bush before him? Well, for several
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.560]  reasons. One, of course, we've already discussed that she's in tight with the
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:28.080]  military security complex and of course she has also compared Putin to Hitler.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.320]  She has made a direct comparison of the Russian president to Adolf Hitler and
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.600]  that's something she can't really back away from. So when you go that far out on
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:48.320]  the limb, you really kind of have to go the rest of the way. So I think it's
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:54.240]  almost certain that if you get somebody like Hillary in the office of the
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:00.480]  president, that she will certainly accommodate the neoconservatives who
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:08.120]  also won't war with Russia because they think Russia can be defeated. And the
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:15.480]  military security complex, they all support all of that. And of course, most
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:25.480]  of the generals, war is good for promotions. So I don't think there's any candidate
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.960]  that we could end up with as president that would be more likely to go to war
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.720]  with Russia than Hillary. I think that's a real possibility, especially with the
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.760]  Republicans in control of the House and Senate. They would rubber stamp any kind
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.120]  of war that she want to go into in just about any place. We're going to be right

[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jonas Show. I'm David Knight in Austin. We have Paul
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.680]  Joseph Watson in the UK, my co-host today. And on the phone we have Paul Craig
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.080]  Roberts and we only have him to the bottom of the hour. And I know that Paul
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:34.280]  Joseph Watson had a question for him about MH17. Go ahead Paul. Yeah, well
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.680]  obviously we've seen this international propaganda campaign to demonize Russia
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.640]  over MH17 despite the fact that the State Department has repeatedly failed to
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:48.200]  provide hard evidence. It still very much remains a mystery. I just wanted to ask
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.400]  Dr. Roberts, has it become any clearer in your mind who was responsible for the
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:00.440]  downing of MH17 and will the NATO powers need to contrive or exploit a similar
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.600]  incident maybe even on a bigger scale to grease the skids for war against Russia
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:14.480]  in the future? Well, you know, it seems clear that Kiev was responsible and
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.000]  probably with Washington's complicity. And the reason this seems clear is that
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.560]  the Dutch government just the other day announced that they weren't releasing the
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:34.880]  results of the investigation because when the investigation was set up an
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.760]  agreement was made that any participant in the investigation could veto its
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:51.680]  release. And apparently, Kiev, the American puppet government in Kiev, is
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.040]  blocked the release and the Dutch minister in charge of all this said that
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:03.200]  he thought it was more important to maintain good relations between the
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.880]  countries who were participating in the investigation than to release the
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.880]  results to the public. So, assuming this news report is correct, what that tells
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:22.360]  us is that we are not going to get the results. And if you're not going to get
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:29.040]  the results, that means they're unfavorable to Kiev and to Washington.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:35.520]  Clearly, if the results were unfavorable to Russia, they would be released.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:42.560]  Russia is not part of the investigation and it would have no veto power over.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.200]  At least that's my understanding from the news report. Regardless, if it was
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:53.080]  against Russia, it would be released. Think how long this has been going on.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:58.360]  It doesn't take this long to figure out what happened. They're just not going to
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:05.360]  tell us. It's something that will just disappear from the news like Ebola, like
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:11.480]  everything else. So, do you think there's there has to be a new Cassus
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.920]  Belly, a new justification to increase aggression against Russia, or will they
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.520]  just ratchet up the sanctions and the tension as they've already been doing,
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:25.120]  or will they need a new MH17-style incident to exploit? I don't think they
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:31.280]  need anything new. If they start the balance again against the separatists,
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:36.920]  what they hope is to draw Russia into it because what Washington really wants to
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.440]  do is to permanently break up the economic and political relations between
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  Europe and Russia. Putin knows this and so he's not been drawn into it. He's not
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:55.160]  sent in troops. He has essentially sacrificed the Russians and the
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:02.000]  separatists provinces in order to try to maintain his relationships with Europe
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.600]  because he really understands that if the Washington can break Russia from
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.440]  Europe, that Washington can continue with Europe as a vassal state. Whereas if the
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.640]  economic and political developments between Russia and Europe continue,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:27.000]  Europe will be pulled away from Washington and be pulled out of NATO. And so
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.720]  he's willing to take the risk for the Russian residents and the in
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:40.320]  southeastern Ukraine in order to try to hold or to keep Europe from being
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:46.440]  irredeemably lost into American vassalage. So, in my opinion, that's
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.640]  what's going on. It's going to be hard for them to get Russia into a war because
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.880]  of what Putin sees the consequences with Europe.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:04.800]  Okay, David Knight. Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how this
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.440]  develops and as we pointed out earlier, as what you said, Dr. Roberts, that if
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.280]  Hillary Clinton becomes president, we are going to see war because I think
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.120]  she's going to be there with a Republican Congress that is going to rubber
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:22.320]  stamp everything that she would want to do. I wish we had more time to talk to
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.480]  you, but you can only stay with us to the bottom of the hour. And thank you for

[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.920]  Joseph Watson is joining us from the UK and we're going to be joining our
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.000]  reporters in Ferguson Missouri to check on the status of what's going on there
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.240]  now silver bullet is back in stock but as usual it's a limited supply once it
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.600]  runs out it's probably going to take about six weeks to get another batch in
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:43.720]  the reason that happens is because it's really difficult slow process to get
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:48.200]  silver in this kind of concentration we have a concentrate to 30 parts per
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.680]  million and a pure base of the ionized waters widely known that colloidal silver
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.640]  is a vital supplement for maintaining a healthy lifestyle now info wars life
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.040]  calm takes colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.360]  that's free of toxic artificial additives there's ever been a more important
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.120]  time especially with flu season coming up to have a powerful and clean form of
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.880]  colloidal silver within reach for you and your family go to info wars life
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:24.760]  calm to order silver bullet now or call 1-888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.160]  silver bullet we've got them in for a limited time now let's go to Ferguson
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.600]  Missouri we have our reporters there Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson have been there
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:40.240]  this week awaiting the grand jury verdict and also noticing how tensions are
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:47.800]  building Joe what do you see Joe Biggs I'm standing outside of the the Justice
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.960]  Center here in Clayton Missouri this is a little downtown area where most of the
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.800]  decisions are made for the laws this is where the police department is for
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.760]  Ferguson so this is an area that everyone's keeping their eye on this is
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.480]  where the decision supposed to come down from the grand jury and today as you can
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.840]  see if we pan over to the left there is way more media out here today there's a
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.520]  lot of police that we haven't seen patrol in the area people walking around
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:17.600]  around the building as well another interesting thing people are bracing for
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.520]  an explosion of civil unrest I should say I got a letter last night from an
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.120]  employee at a business in this area and now what happened is the property
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.840]  manager sent out a letter to all their tenants now this is a building that
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.880]  houses a lot of different medical facilities a radiology on ecology
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.040]  different things like that and in the letter it says due to the the possibility
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:46.280]  of a uprise of civil unrest this weekend in the next week I warn you to stock up
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:52.560]  to brace yourself basically to keep the patients there all week all weekend into
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.760]  the next week and what they said they're going to do is they're going to lock the
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.960]  doors and not allow anyone to enter or leave so they're going to lock medical
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.120]  patients down workers in these buildings in case something happens and they said
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.720]  they're going to cooperate with police and other government entities wow wow
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.160]  that's amazing and we've been talking a little bit about this between Paul Joseph
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.280]  Watson and I earlier in the program how unfortunate that this is not about
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.760]  trying to get oversight or control the police or setting limits or terms on the
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.520]  rules of engagement to try to stop this epidemic of violence but it's become a
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.400]  race war it's something as part of that I think there's agent provocateurs that
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.680]  are threatening the police and that kind of feeds this whole mentality that
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.040]  they're trying to feed the police all the time that they are actually in a
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.360]  war on the streets and that the public are enemy combatants yeah it's nothing
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.320]  like that last night everyone was peacefully protesting it didn't get out
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.160]  of control for you know maybe it was like five minutes but it didn't get out of
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.040]  control until all these police officers showed up and they started lining up in
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.800]  riot gear before that the people were just out protesting across the street in
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.680]  the parking lot some moved over and to the the sidewalk in front of the police
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.240]  station but they were just out there protesting once a police officer showed
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.840]  up with batons shields riot gear then it made the people angry they're asking
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.720]  them why do you come out here with guns why do you come out here with shields
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.560]  why do you come out here with all this year you guys are inciting the violence
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.680]  we just wanted to say here now you guys are showing up and you're trying to
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.640]  flex your muscle and make your presence known so what a lot of people did is
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.880]  they got angry one of the police officers pepper pepper sprayed a young woman and
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.000]  that agitated the crowd a lot and what that did was push the protesters into
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.400]  the street they began to block traffic jacarjax and an aisle once again we're
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.320]  standing in a very lawful spot on the sidewalk we were once again pushed by
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.120]  the police into the road into an unlawful area where we're impeding the flow of
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.720]  traffic and then last night yet again they bomb rushed everybody pushed them
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.080]  into a dark parking lot started throwing people to the ground someone said
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.040]  they were shot with a rubber bullet I didn't personally see that but that's
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:04.240]  what was said there was a lot of scuffling going on one man fought with
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:07.560]  the police for a minute was thrown to the ground three people were less were
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:15.000]  arrested last night 117 years old 119 and 125 we're watching watching anybody
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.680]  who's looking at the video feed or the broadcast can see the footage that you
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.240]  guys shot the B-roll that's there the police confronting people and that's
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.640]  exactly it Joe they're getting needlessly confrontational there was an
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.000]  article just this last week it was on NPR I think and they were talking about
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.680]  how some of the remote areas Alaska might start to arm their policemen says
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.800]  it's the last area in America where the police aren't armed at all they basically
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.480]  go out and what they do is they talk to people they don't try to get
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.880]  confrontational with them as a matter of fact they talked to a police officer and
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.960]  and he said part of the job is trying to talk to people and in a
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:02.680]  non-confrontational way and yet we see a situation without using without a
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.360]  show of force that makes someone a lot more comfortable when someone comes up
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.760]  to you with a shotgun pointed at you wearing riot gear in your mind you're
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.440]  thinking all right this person means business they're not trying to negotiate
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.160]  with me you don't see negotiators you go into a hostile or a hostage situation
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.520]  with a gun and a shield no they go dressed down no gun on they go in they
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.760]  confront the the hostage taker and they talk to them one-on-one because that's
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.800]  the only way you can de-escalate a situation that's right going there with
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.960]  guns because all that does is incite more violence and make people uneasy
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.120]  about themselves and put themselves in a defensive posture I think they've been
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.360]  trying to incite this thing from day one as I mentioned to Paul earlier you know
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.200]  they if they had this evidence and they knew what was happening they had a
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.840]  deposition they didn't give anybody any indication of this they wanted to build
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.160]  this up into a racial confrontation into a confrontation that further
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:59.600]  enforces this idea amongst the police that they're at war Paul did you have a
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.000]  question that you wanted to ask Joe while he's there yeah I was just reading a
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.400]  headline that's just come out masked Ferguson protesters with guns threatened
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.680]  violence which is basically a YouTube video of some people dressed up in in
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.800]  black ski mass threatening violence I just wanted to ask Joe if if it was part
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.480]  of the conversation amongst the demonstrators if they were aware of the
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.800]  fact that there are outside agitators as there were back in August planning
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.680]  maybe to escalate it from their side is that something that people are talking
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.600]  about there's a lot of people out there making empty threats you know via
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.040]  social media all the people that we've seen on the ground out here these
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.640]  protests when the cameras aren't on them you know they're out there hugging
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.080]  you see black people white people hugging each other talking laughing joking and
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.680]  for some reason though they only the mainstream media always catches people
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.520]  when they're yelling at the police officer so it seems like all the people
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.720]  here are just angry and they want to fight you know about the video you're
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.840]  talking about I saw that about four days ago and I did a little research myself
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.120]  that's actually a group out of Atlanta so that's not something here in
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.720]  Ferguson but Atlanta is another spot where they're talking about having
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.360]  demonstrations after this grand jury decision comes down you know we have an
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.560]  article on info wars from Max Slavo where he's talking about outside
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:22.760]  agitators and one in particular Alisa Fithian who he says was partly
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.440]  responsible for organizing the violent protests in the battle for Seattle
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.280]  essentially saying you know we take this we need to take this to people who
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.800]  don't look like me I'm presuming that she's black I haven't watched the video
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.240]  so I don't know if she's black or white but I'm presuming that's what it is
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:43.280]  again an outside agitator feeding this racial divide we're going to have Eric
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.760]  Rush joining us in the in the next hour he's an author of Negro filia from
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.640]  slave block to pedestal and so he's going to be talking about the racial
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.560]  aspect of this how people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton always seem to
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.160]  show up at the scene of as Paul Joseph Watson put it these ambiguous shootings
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:10.320]  to try to exploit the racial unrest there but have you heard anything about
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:16.120]  anything else about the grand jury verdict nothing is surface jet about
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.680]  that is that correct well so what we're what we're hearing so far today and I
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.760]  believe at this time this is probably the truest thing we've gotten so far and
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.160]  that's because of the large you know influx of all these mainstream media
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.480]  people that are starting to show up now in the heavy police presence today what
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.960]  we're being told is that the grand jury is going to a call the family and give
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.360]  them a 48 hour advance notice so today is the day that they're supposed to call
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.640]  the family and also warn the military and the police in the area for what's
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.000]  going to happen after this decision comes out but you know from the people
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.440]  I've talked to in Ferguson last night on the streets they all know that the
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.560]  family once they get that information there will be a leak they're going to
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.400]  make phone calls are going to tell somebody and somebody on that inner
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.280]  circle is going to want to be the person that releases it out and I have a
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.080]  feeling by tonight we'll know whether or not Darren Wilson is going to be
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.120]  indicted on these charges or not but what they're saying is they're going to
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.240]  try and wait and publicly let the media know on Sunday 48 hours later but I
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.400]  have a feeling that's not going to happen yeah that's going to leak out and
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.200]  that's going to get Obama's amnesty off of the top of the headlines isn't it
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:29.600]  well yeah I mean that's that's the plan anyways you know let's go ahead and cover
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.920]  that up and with a Ferguson burka that's right Paul do you have another
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.600]  question that you wanted to ask Joe yeah just reading some breaking news
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.920]  actually Ferguson schools are going to be closed Monday and Tuesday that's not
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.040]  confirmed but it seems like a pretty strong rumor so if this decision is
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:53.600]  announced today it looks like that any trouble any violence if it happens they
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.040]  expect it to happen on Sunday after that 48 hour notice schools are closed on
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.640]  Monday and Tuesday just wanted to ask Joe if officer Darren Wilson has
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.080]  suggested that he will resign no matter what happens with the grand jury case
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:10.880]  do you think that will serve to de-escalate any of the tensions or
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.160]  will it not make any difference I don't think it's going to make any
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.040]  difference you know like I said Ferguson has this gaping wound and it's been
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.560]  festering now for months on in because this has taken quite honestly too long
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:25.760]  to come to a decision on you know they've been teeter-tottering with the
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.760]  media you know acting like they're gonna release the information people around
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.960]  here are fed up they're tired the hate's been built up for this guy you know
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.320]  regardless if they indict him or not he's not ever going to be a police
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:40.800]  officer again I don't think his face has been on too many TV screens throughout
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.080]  America I don't foresee him ever having a police beat job where he's going up and
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:50.120]  down the street patrolling whatsoever so regardless of that outcome you know it's
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.040]  probably at his best interest to quit and from what I heard too they're gonna
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:01.080]  give him a nice little a $500,000 payout for that as well whoa whoa I want to
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:06.120]  ask you if you've you say the people that are there they're kind of civil what
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.440]  is the sense that you get from people there I mean are they looking at any
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.800]  solutions that they're proposing have they proposed anything I mean we talked
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:18.880]  earlier about Frank Serpico's op-ed piece for Politico that came out about
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.240]  three weeks ago he had six specific proposals things like community
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:27.280]  involvement from police officers and that means a lot more than just having a
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.920]  certain percentage of people who are black and a certain percentage of white
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:33.880]  he's talking about something that's far deeper than that he's talking about
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.360]  having oversight of the police with independent commissions that are set up
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.040]  in the community has anybody proposed any concrete solutions to the police
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.240]  situation not that I know I've ever heard anything to that nature whatsoever but
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.160]  when you go out and you talk to people out here on the streets when you ask
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.680]  them what do you think's going on first thing they do they roll their eyes they
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.520]  put their head down and it's that Ferguson fatigue it's set in for
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.560]  everybody in this area in the surrounding St. Louis area everyone's
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.240]  tired of this they just want to be over with but you have a lot of the young
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.440]  protesters who are really angry they don't have the same life experiences as
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.560]  the older people who lived in Ferguson for 50 60 years you know the older crowds
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.800]  we talked to they just wanted to be over with regardless of the situation they
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.000]  want everyone to be peaceful but a lot of the younger people they're mad they're
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.800]  angry they don't know how to to focus that anger in a positive way and what
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.600]  we're hearing a lot of is people want to come down to Clayton they want to
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.520]  riot in this area because this is where the decisions are made but when you
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.600]  talk to a lot of the citizens in Ferguson as well what they're thinking of
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.440]  what they're more worried about are the outside agitators they know that they've
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.520]  had discussions with a lot of these young young adults who live in Ferguson
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:49.960]  and they've talked and they said hey destroying our neighborhood it's not
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:52.720]  going to do anything it's only going to harm you you know you're going to grow
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:55.880]  up you're going to want to have kids you can't raise kids in a burnt down city
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.440]  so think about that but what they're worried about now are these outside
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.320]  agitators from other states coming in who are professional protesters rioters
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.760]  anarchists who feed off of that anger that energy and they just want total and
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.680]  complete chaos and that's what people in this area are worried about the people
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.080]  are going to come in here burn the city down and then fly back to their homes
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.960]  in California New York Chicago wherever it may be and go back into their cozy
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.880]  homes or apartments and sit back and watch everything go up in flames on Fox
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.320]  and CNN yeah that's the problem and and that is you know that they're not going
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.600]  to focus this in any positive way that could really make it better for that
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.800]  community or make it better for anywhere else and as Paul pointed out they
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:41.760]  always like to pick these ambiguous situations where they can get both sides
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.360]  even more at war with each other even more angry try to balkanize the
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.600]  population even more into racial groups or whatever Paul do you have any other
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.440]  comments that you wanted to questions you want to ask Joe while he's there yeah
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.040]  I was just wondering from being on the ground there Joe we've seen comments by
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:01.720]  some of the protesters about moving away from West Flores on which I believe is
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.720]  the main area where they've been congregated and going to South Flores
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:10.160]  on because that's where the white people live is basically what they're saying
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.000]  where do you think these protests will be situated and are they going to target
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.400]  businesses again or is this just going to be a general street protest from what
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.800]  you can see there on the ground well South Flores is right where the police
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:29.080]  station and fire department is now back in back on Halloween there was a they
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.600]  called a vandal that was a term that Fox to use someone had a transformer and
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.840]  knocked out the power in that area and it actually took out the power to the
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.480]  police department the fire station so that was one of the threats by one of
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.120]  the militants was to hit the power grid and take that out but it's not going to
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.320]  be South Flores that I'm here and I'm here and it's what it's called they
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.400]  call South City South City is where we're at now like Clayton this is a
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.760]  predominantly white area a lot of ritzy neighborhoods just south of here in that
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.200]  area this is where the agitators and militants are focusing a lot of their
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  anger on because like I said this is the Justice Center the courthouse is right
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.120]  over here the police stations right over here this is where all the laws are
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.440]  made these are the people they blame for not handling the situation about the
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.520]  death of Mike Brown very well and they're very mad at these the lawmakers
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.200]  the politicians and the higher-ups in the police force in this area so the word
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.560]  on the street we spoke to a preacher the other day to he believes that this is
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.600]  where most of the violence will be focused on here in the Clayton area
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.400]  around the courthouse the Justice Center and surrounding white areas as well
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.160]  that's why a lot of the schools in the area that you heard about will possibly
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.160]  shut down on Monday and Tuesday just because they want to brace for the worst
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.760]  everyone's hoping for the best but we saw what happened in August and with the
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.160]  National Guard being called in the pictures I saw yesterday of people
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:52.280]  following them coming in the St. Louis right now as we speak they should be
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.160]  setting up around that red perimeter that we have a picture that Kit Daniels
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.160]  had an article right now they're supposed to have National Guard set up a
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.640]  different areas and posting up and waiting on that verdict so when it
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.120]  happens they can close in and try to de-escalate the situation I guess as best
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.880]  as they can but at the end of the day they're going to strip people's
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.440]  liberties away like I said they're you know already telling local businesses
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.960]  that they're going to lock the doors and keep anybody who's inside locked in
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.840]  there for as long as they have to well you know getting in people's faces with
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.560]  guns and shields and tanks isn't really going to de-escalate the situation as
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.640]  you pointed out earlier Joe it's only going to escalate it yeah it's going to
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.480]  make the people that are there very angry it's going to increase the anger
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.400]  and of course we have agent provocateurs from outside the area there as well a
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.040]  violent confrontation is only going to make this thing worse unless they come
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.000]  forward with real concrete proposals and those are going to have to come from
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.640]  outside of City Hall if the community could get itself together to have some
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.200]  proposals like that that would really help but we got to go to commercial break
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:57.200]  will be right back we've got our reporters in Ferguson Missouri I've got

[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.680]  reporters in Ferguson, Missouri we just talked to Joe Biggs we're gonna go back
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:22.960]  to Jacarie Jackson there they've been there all week observing the buildup to
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:28.480]  the grand jury verdict that is expected to be released today at least perhaps as
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:33.200]  Joe was telling us secretly or confidentially to the family of Michael
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.720]  Brown that's probably not going to stay confidential they expect this to erupt
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.760]  this weekend we also have Paul Joseph Watson on the line with us as co-host
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.680]  from the UK let's go back to Ferguson to Jacarie Jackson Jacarie yes sir did you
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:51.440]  have something that you want to add okay you know he doesn't talk to us off
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.560]  camera Jacarie Jackson from Clayton, Missouri Joe Biggs was just telling me
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:59.880]  we had a breaking news situation that the prosecutor is ready to have a press
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.080]  conference to announce some of the things that are going on with the Darian
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.040]  Wilson trial so as soon as we're done here we'll try to get over there and see
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.440]  if we can get into that but meanwhile yeah we've talked to a lot of people who
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.680]  are in the area the gentleman who was just speaking to us off camera he was
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:17.920]  saying that he didn't expect the outcome to be all that bad as far as the street
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:21.760]  response he didn't so much expect to see the riots and the protests and all the
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:25.560]  things that we've seen previously a lot of people that we've talked to they have
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:28.720]  varying degrees of concern some people think it's gonna be worse than it was
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.360]  back in August some people think it's just gonna be a minor thing so only
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.600]  time will tell but I do agree that you know once this thing is announced you
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.680]  know whether the prosecutor tells us exactly what's going on or they kind of
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:43.720]  string a salon and just you know how they do you dealt with these PIOs
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.920]  Oh yeah they gave you just enough to say that they gave you something even though
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:50.800]  they didn't tell you anything at all that's right so I don't have the highest
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.280]  hopes but we'll go try to check it out regardless so the people here they're
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:57.160]  getting prepared regardless what that means for them some people have
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:00.440]  purchased firearms some people have purchased food some of the schools have
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.240]  closed down and Joe did you have something you want to share well you guys
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:07.800]  reported earlier you report earlier this week breaking breaking news real
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:13.400]  quick Barnes Crick breaking news Barnes Christian Hospital has three floors that
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.400]  have been cleared out in anticipation of the victims of rioting one floor for
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:20.720]  injured police one floor for injured protesters one floor for injured police
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.520]  family members that's happening right now wow I didn't have any space for media
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:30.720]  but okay well you guys yeah we have the infidel so that's right you got your
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:36.040]  infidel armor so you're you're fine it's a lot of stuff going on here people are
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.000]  making preparations you know regardless if you think this is a big deal or not
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.640]  the people here are making serious preparations you just heard about the
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.960]  hospital the National Guard is ready to move we see the cops already out in the
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:48.920]  riot gear at least they go out to the protest there in riot gear and all that
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.920]  so the people here on the ground are taking this very seriously the most
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:56.480]  majority of people I've talked to since I've been here they're peaceful people
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.720]  they do expect some agent provocateurs if you guys see that video I posted not
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.960]  last night but the night before I talked to the guy and the guy Fox mask and he
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:08.360]  was saying that the majority of people here are good peaceful people but they
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.640]  do expect the agent provocateurs of people who just want to come in and
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.680]  kick up stuff to burn down to riot to loot they do expect those people to come
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.320]  in but by and large the crowds here are mostly peaceful oh absolutely and as you
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:24.800]  guys reported earlier this week gun sales are up 300% and some cases that
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:29.720]  some of these stores they're saying that 75% of those sales are first-time gun
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  owners so you guys who got your infidel body armor there you're hopefully you're
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.120]  gonna be safe in this but like you said they don't have a floor for reporters
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.680]  that's amazing news that's cleared away three floors one for protesters one for
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.240]  police and one for the families of police that's what I'm concerned about
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.320]  and that's that kind of agent provocaturing where they came out
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.640]  earlier this week the the list of the targets got released you know as many
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.760]  things on there including Monsanto other local businesses and also many
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:05.480]  officers families and today by out there watching if you think that targeting
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:09.080]  the families of these officers is going to do anything besides just agitate
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.080]  them to the point where they will have no patience I'm not exactly sure what
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.400]  you're expecting to happen it's just the narrative that this this is a war zone
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.480]  and that's not what we the message we need to be sending to our police we need
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.600]  to be sending a different message to them well thank you thank you jacari

[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:17.160]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:24.160]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:31.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin joined with Paul
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.160]  Joseph Watson in the UK we're just talking to our reporters in Ferguson
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:40.680]  Missouri as people there are awaiting the grand jury's verdict and of course we
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:43.920]  were talking about the agent provocateurs who are threatening the
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:47.120]  police threatening their family Joe Biggs broke the news that they are
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.120]  clearing out three floors of the hospital there one for police one for
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:56.920]  protesters and one for the families of the police that is not the message that
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:59.520]  the people need to be sending to the police they need to come together
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.640]  they're going to have to reform this situation in that community as well as
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.840]  other communities of the rules of engagement of the police but all this
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:13.760]  does is escalate things it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail when you
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.400]  threaten the families of the police and of course we have agent provocateurs
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.480]  that are there covertly we have had agent provocateurs they show up at all
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:27.200]  of these ambiguous situations people like Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton we're
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.440]  going to be talking in the next segment to Eric Rush he's the author of
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.040]  Negro filia from slave block to pedestal and he takes on the race pimps
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:42.440]  like my Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he takes him on directly and he talks
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:46.320]  about what's really behind this and of course that's the other unfortunate
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.400]  outcome that they've engineered here in Ferguson is to turn it into one race
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.240]  against another of course the black community has felt the brunt of the
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:01.880]  epidemic of police violence more than the white community has but that's not
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.400]  the way to confront this problem there is there are things that need to be done
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:10.200]  we've talked about Frank Serpico's suggestions about how they have outside
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:15.720]  control of the police as well as mandating police involvement in the
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.120]  community not just hiring a certain number of people of one race or the
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.560]  other because if they're not actively involved in the community whether they're
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.760]  white or black they're going to identify more as being blue than anything else
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:32.240]  Paul your comments on what we just heard from Ferguson yeah it's interesting
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.360]  that they're having the press conference that because obviously we thought there
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.320]  would be a delay before the decision the actual announcement of it there's an
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:42.920]  interesting article out of the Washington Times though Americans say officers
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:48.680]  should not be indicted 81% predict violent reaction so only one in four
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.040]  Americans believe that white police officer Darren Wilson should be charged
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.240]  with murder by the grand jury and the shooting death of an on-black teenager
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:01.200]  Michael Brown according to a poll released Friday so only one in four
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:07.600]  believe that he's guilty of murder 81% predict a violent reaction and only
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.600]  10% predict that there will be no violent reaction whatsoever so that kind of
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:16.200]  squares with what we were talking about earlier regarding the ambiguity of the
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.440]  shooting itself I understand people's you know I understand the black
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.760]  community looking at this verdict and saying they're getting away with it yet
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.920]  again because we've seen so many clear-cut cases where the police do not
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:32.000]  police themselves and that was one of the things that Frank Serpico said he
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.760]  said get over the idea that the police are going to police themselves it's not
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:39.880]  going to happen without outside oversight but there are cases where there are
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.800]  justified police shootings but it's such a long history of the other kind I
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.480]  can see that many people there are going to go ahead and take out their
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:52.120]  frustration and their anger at the system by just striking out blindly and
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:57.280]  violence rather than trying to change the system from the outside well
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.880]  precisely I mentioned the case earlier there's actually a few years ago I
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:04.040]  forgot the name of the individual but it was on the the guy on the subway that
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:08.080]  was basically murdered in cold blood that was a black guy I believe then
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.600]  recently the case in New York the guy selling cigarettes basically put in a
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:19.280]  chokehold by a police officer choked him to death and again we didn't see any
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:24.960]  kind of mass protest over that incident even though it's flagrantly an example of
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.960]  police brutality there was no debate about it whatsoever I think there's a
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:32.720]  lot of people who you know we talk about people putting up with the police
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.280]  violence against a black community most of these truly egregious situations are
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.600]  against the homeless and people in this country seem to have absolutely no
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:46.120]  sympathy for the homeless they have no sympathy whatsoever even to the extent
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.000]  of allowing the people as we talked to the 90-year-old gentleman who's been
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.680]  threatened with jail multiple times because he's feeding the homeless they
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:56.240]  certainly don't care if they beat a homeless man to death on the streets
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:59.720]  like they did Kelly Thomas in California and get away with it we're gonna be
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:02.000]  right back stay with us

[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:33.320]  Alex Jones back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we have Paul Joseph
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:39.280]  Watson with us from the UK and joining us now is Eric Rush author of negro
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:44.120]  filia from slave block to pedestal you know we've seen Al Sharpton and Ferguson
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:49.040]  as well as Jesse Jackson show up they always show up as Paul put it at these
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.000]  ambiguous situations when there's a clear-cut injustice you don't usually
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.120]  see them but when it's something that is kind of ambiguous and they can use that
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.840]  to really separate the races you know because it looks like for at the
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:04.800]  beginning everything that we were hearing sounded like it was yet another
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.160]  case of an unjustified use of force by the police and then after they let that
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.640]  narrative simmer for quite some time and built up a lot of a tent attention
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.880]  over that they then start releasing evidence that would clear the officer
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.840]  so it looks like a deliberate manipulation as well as the timing of
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.160]  this grand jury verdict and of course anybody knows anything about grand
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:32.560]  juries knows that they're very they're not the same as regular jury juries are
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.120]  pretty much under the influence of judges they in many cases unfortunately
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.520]  act as a rubber stamp for the judge not taking into account their right and
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:44.560]  their duty to judge the law as well as the facts of the case so they don't
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:49.880]  usually think independently but certainly with a grand jury that is the case as
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:53.520]  many people point out you're gonna die to ham sandwich with a right grand jury
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.000]  so this timing is very suspicious but joining us now is Eric rush and want to
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.200]  talk to him about the way they have built up racial tension here thank you
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:07.240]  for joining us mr. Rush thank you very much for having me on now we see this
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.600]  over and over again as you point out and you call out Al Sharpton and Jesse
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.760]  Jackson the people who basically made a career out of exacerbating relation
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.760]  race relations wherever they can go you kind of call them out as to you know to
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:24.040]  doing this but you also have something else I think that's very interesting to
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.000]  say about this whole notion that they've sold us about white privilege I'll let
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.480]  you have the floor and explain your thesis to us well the fact of the matter
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.480]  is that it's kind of as I talk about my in my book
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:43.000]  negrophilia from slave black to pedestal America's racial obsession you
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.680]  know you have on the one hand the political left that is really exploiting
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.960]  black Americans I mean I in a way they're sort of like the new plantation
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:01.600]  owners but then the other side of the coin is that blacks cannot be criticized
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.760]  for anything you have a situation you have many situations in which blacks are
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:13.400]  not held accountable I think this you know Michael Brown shooting is sort of a
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:20.840]  case in point his participation in the events leading up to his unfortunate
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:27.320]  demise are not only not being looked at in a read you know in a realistic
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:34.960]  context they're they're just been they just been to realistically spun in the
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:40.400]  other direction and I believe that that has to do with you know I believe that
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.720]  has to do not only with the economic imperative that some activists Jesse
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:52.920]  Al the rest of them have for you know advancing the idea that America is still
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:57.320]  an institutionally racist nation but I think that there are other you know
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:02.520]  political motivations going on you know we can get into the administration and
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:10.240]  Eric Holder and you know all of them if you want but it is it is part of this
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:16.000]  you know this racial orthodoxy that has been advanced that really has been
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.920]  advanced to the detriment of blacks and to the benefit of people who either
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:28.040]  politically or economically or both are profiting from this you know advancing
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.480]  this twisted worldview yeah we even see like in the recent election we see
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.880]  Mary Landrieu and Louisiana who made the amazing claim that her sinking
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:41.960]  popularity and the sinking popularity of Obama was because people didn't like
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.120]  women in blacks when Obama's been elected twice she's been elected three
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:50.840]  times she can't admit that this could be something about what they're doing
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.960]  their actual actions their policies they essentially the the pedestal has
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.240]  completely swung the other way hasn't it like you point out in your the
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.200]  subtitle your book from slave block to pedestal we have put people on a
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.240]  pedestal especially people like Barack Obama you can't criticize him right
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:12.280]  without being called a racist absolutely and and for example the fact that he was
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:18.080]  elected twice and did have this massive support at least you know the first time
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.920]  that he was elected all of that goes by the wayside when they want to pull out
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:27.840]  the race card you know in the case of for example Trayvon Martin it didn't
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.520]  matter that it didn't matter that George Zimmerman with this little Latino man
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:40.040]  yeah the press and the agitators spun him into this Nordic God with his war
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.960]  hammer prowling around for little black kids to squish and and it and people bought
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:50.200]  it I mean that's the thing that blows my mind the pet the press picked up on it
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:55.320]  Eric Holder the Obama administration and then people bought it and it was just
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.440]  I mean I felt like I was in a bad science fiction movie yeah absolutely
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:05.320]  yeah you know it's interesting in your book you said and of course Barack Obama
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:11.680]  Mary Landrieu couldn't have been elected if the if men didn't vote for her if
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.960]  white people didn't vote for Obama and yet they always spin it that way you
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.160]  point out that in 1964 you said in your book there was justifiable collective
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.280]  shame on the part of whites and justifiable collective anger on the
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.880]  part of blacks there was a fundamental change in the hearts and minds of white
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:32.120]  people at that point time address that a little bit as to that was kind of the
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.280]  pivotal issue there was a real problem there people addressed it I think they
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.800]  went maybe too far to the other extreme as you point out putting people on a
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:46.200]  pedestal rather than just handling them as individuals well you know I Americans
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:50.280]  I don't know if it has to do with our character or if it has to do with
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:55.720]  effectiveness of the propaganda machine but we have this habit of of just
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:01.960]  blasting by the sort of happy medium the middle ground where we sort of need to
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:08.440]  to live and we've done that in a number of areas the whole race thing being you
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.480]  know one of them you know we go from you know blacks being second-class
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:18.920]  citizens to blacks being exploited by the very people who are supposed to be
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:23.680]  helping them and young black multi-millionaires getting on television
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.960]  every single day talking about this being an institutionally racist nation
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:35.320]  hello exactly yeah and it's something that is damaging to black people as well
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:40.000]  as Walter Williams has pointed out many times the fact that they put them on a
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.080]  pedestal is damaging to the black community as well because it's a
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:47.880]  condescending thing to do that isn't it is saying you can't achieve this on your
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.080]  own we're going to set aside quotas for you going to put you on a pedestal well
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.840]  yeah when I remember when like affirmative action came out for example
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:02.360]  and and I was about to go to I was about to start applying for colleges and
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:09.120]  stuff and jobs and what have you and I it drove me out of my tree that they
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.680]  were setting up this sort of structure that was going to not only you know
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:20.400]  advance you know the whole reverse racism unfairness but that whole deal
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.120]  but that it was going to wind up in the long term being detrimental to to
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:32.600]  minorities blacks women what have you and it's you know again this is it's a
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:38.960]  different kind of subtle bigotry but it's bigotry nonetheless yeah I see I
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:44.040]  grew up in the south and I see in this reverse racism the quotas and that sort
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.880]  of thing I see kind of a hint back to reconstruction and some I see some
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:52.240]  parallels of that as part of the history that I think that America doesn't
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:56.920]  really know and I think that was a key part in the change in the hearts and
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:00.800]  minds of the white community I think a lot of them had forgotten what had
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.480]  happened there and it's like what why do we have these these laws here where
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:07.720]  we're oppressing this group of people but I think what had happened was
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.680]  essentially what we're seeing happening in Ferguson where they misdirect the
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:16.120]  anger from one group to the other they pit one group against the other that was
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.760]  I think when I look back at reconstruction they took a kind of an
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:24.160]  oppression that was masquerading as a paternalism during slavery and they
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:29.240]  misdirected that into an actual hatred of blacks during reconstruction that I
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:35.000]  think turned up in these Jim Crow laws and after a generation where people had
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.960]  lost that history that's like we don't really need this anymore but they always
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.960]  seem to do that they'd seem to be able to pit one group against another and that
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:47.920]  seems to be the way that they effectively govern by divide and conquer
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:54.280]  absolutely the cultural balkanization is key and it's not just a racial thing I
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:18:02.360]  mean they're exploiting you know ageism sexism sexism sexual orientation
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:09.640]  is them just any kind any any sort of subtle difference between you know
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:15.520]  subgroups in in our American society that they have been able to exploit they
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:20.080]  do that and I believe that this administration has really taken it to
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:25.040]  another level with regard to that cultural balkanization and we're seeing
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:32.440]  that play out right now in Ferguson you know the left compromises black blacks
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:37.840]  economically educationally all these different ways and then when something
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.800]  like this Michael Brown thing happens whether or not it's legitimate is in
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.080]  material in terms of the police brutality angle but then they point to the
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:54.160]  name of blacks pain pain being white racism well it isn't it's public bad
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:58.240]  public policy that's the problem you know and of course in terms of
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.400]  balkanization we saw that in heavy handwriting last night with Obama's
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:08.520]  announcement and the way it was handled doing it on the anniversary of Mexico's
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.520]  independence doing it right before the Latin Grammys and of course we have no
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:17.040]  idea how many people are going to be affected by this because it's an
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:19.640]  entitlement program we don't know that's going to be five million people and
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.000]  he's incentivizing illegal immigration because it's the perfect form of
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.720]  balkanization you not only got cultural differences that you can play up but of
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.800]  course language differences that they can play up and of course they're trying
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:36.640]  to play up a racial aspect to it as well we're talking to Eric Rush the

[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:22.320]  the author of Negro filia from slave block to pedestal we thought it'd be
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.760]  great to have him on to talk about race relations and what has really happened
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.320]  in this country especially because of what's going on in Ferguson where we see
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.320]  conscious race baiting and manipulation divide and conquer strategies that are
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:40.800]  going on there and joining us also as Paul Joseph Watson I got to ask all the
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.720]  questions in the last segment I'm going to give Paul a chance to ask mr. Russia
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.520]  question but I'm also going to give you a chance to ask questions we're going to

[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:05.520]  that in the next segment go ahead Paul do you have a question for mr. Rush yeah
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.640]  congratulations on your book by the way Eric I see an overwhelming amount of
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.840]  five-star reviews on Amazon which for a obviously contentious subject is quite
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.400]  the achievement but I wanted to ask you about Obama himself because we know his
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:25.560]  upbringing his mentors and speaking the likes of Reverend Jeremiah Wright Bill
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:31.160]  Ayers the influence that they had on him how did that shape Barack Obama's views
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:38.640]  on race and class in America well it absolutely had a major effect I mean
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:46.320]  the guy who was raised not just you know in his adult life but you know from the
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.720]  time that he was fairly young you know that then whichever narrow origins
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:57.720]  narrative you want want to believe and there are a few of them out there the
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:06.440]  common denominator is always a very you know anti-western anti-American in
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:12.560]  some cases anti-Christian anti-Semitic anti-capitalist you know anti all of the
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:19.280]  things that we sort of grew up as you know being taught you know most of our
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:24.480]  worldview in as like these things there's nothing wrong with these things we
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.720]  don't have a perfect society you know as we were talking about in the last
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:36.400]  segment you know we sort of matured as as a country and woke up one day and
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:41.040]  was like whoa you know it's not cool to have these you know whole segment of
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:47.080]  society like meaning blacks being these you know second-class citizens sort of
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:51.080]  like they woke up one day and said hey you know there's women not voting that
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:56.840]  isn't cool either so you know we're not perfect we're sort of evolving in a
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:04.200]  way and and so we had these people who sort of you know they stick to this
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:10.560]  idea for whatever their you know mental makeup or neurosis or whatever it
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:18.520]  happens to be that that America is the name of the world's paint and Obama was
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:24.360]  he was suckled on that basically so if you look at his early life all the way
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.160]  up through his college you know early employment everything it was he was
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:37.360]  almost exclusively exposed to mentored by socialized by and with people who
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:42.640]  hated America and the West yeah you know I think a lot of people are not
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:48.200]  familiar with the the upbringing of Obama in Indonesia there's a movie that
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.160]  came out I didn't know anything really about the Indonesian situation that he
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.880]  grew up in or went to Indonesia shortly afterwards but there's a movie called the
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:02.240]  act of killing that really sheds a lot of light on that regime there that his
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:08.520]  adoptive father brought him up and he was very tightly connected to that regime
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:13.320]  and of course his mom was there as many of us believes part of the CIA USA IDs
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.080]  openly been a part of the CIA her parents were both in the CIA he grew up in an
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:21.880]  alien culture you up in an authoritarian culture that had just
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:26.880]  committed mass murder on a gigantic scale and then he comes back to America and
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:33.600]  he hangs out with Frank Davis and his bomb thrower we talked about Bill
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:38.720]  Ayers thank you yeah but yeah he hangs out with those guys that that's the he
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.480]  finishes off his education there I mean regardless of the photoshopped birth
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.000]  certificate his origins should have caused people to have great concern
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.040]  about that absolutely and and you know few people know as well that there were
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:56.320]  there are people who were involved in his early life other than you know those
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:02.200]  that you have mentioned who were who were a politic politically active and
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:07.360]  interactive people from the the leftist community in the United States who were
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:11.040]  politically active with the Sukarno regime and all of those guys in
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:16.080]  Indonesia in addition to which you you also have to you know remember that that
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:23.680]  is a very isn't Islamic it's not Islamist society over there yes and of

[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:50.280]  that's 888-253-3139 now reading from Mr. Rush's book
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:54.640]  Negrophilia here's one of his definitions of of course he's talks
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:57.200]  about it quite extensively but I just wanted to read this quote he says
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:02.280]  Negrophilia is not by nature a conscious partiality toward or devotion to black
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:06.920]  people but a subliminal persuasion toward affinity it's essentially the
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.920]  result of an ongoing propaganda campaign that has underpinned positive
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:17.320]  stereotypes I think that's interesting especially in light of all the controversy
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:22.160]  we've heard lately about Bill Cosby had the show in the 1980s that was a great
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:26.960]  show that was really kind of showing positive stereotypes almost in an over
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:30.880]  the top unbelievable way like we would have seen back in the 1950s and Mr.
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:35.080]  Rush when I looked at that I always thought that was a good thing my
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:38.320]  curiosity at the time and I think it kind of reflects on your book here a
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.600]  little bit is the fact that in the 1980s even though they could show the perfect
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:48.280]  black family we couldn't have had a perfect white family on television really
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:54.440]  without getting laughed at a town don't you think absolutely and I think that
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.200]  that kind of plays to the double standard you know I don't expect people to be
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:04.240]  perfect you know I don't expect our society to be perfect I mean I think
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:08.320]  only you know there's that I want to get away from that segment that thinks we
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:15.080]  can have utopia because we really can't but you know it's you have to get to
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:21.120]  where you can recognize when when when you're being exposed to an agenda or
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.720]  propaganda or not and of course when you you have something that is innocuous as
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:34.200]  a as a you know NBC sitcom or whatever with this iconic you know beloved star
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:42.000]  which Bill Cosby I was gonna say is at least he was then you know it was a
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.680]  nice it was a nice show as he said but you know you have to put it into context
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:51.320]  like what what is it really representing I mean there were a lot of things that
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:55.400]  there were a lot of things that came out of that show even it was even if it was
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:02.080]  a good one that bugged me for example it may not be something that you would
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:10.240]  pick up on but when the the the intel intelligence here decided that we were
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:17.280]  gonna call blacks African Americans but now the Cosby show was right out in
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:23.040]  front with that right out in front and I don't use that term to me African
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.640]  American is like what the hell is that you know I mean if you're an African
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:33.640]  who's a naturalized citizen US citizen I guess you're an African American but
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:39.760]  I'm not and the most of the black people I know are not I mean cuz they don't know
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:45.480]  from Africa I mean and and then again what is with the necessity to hyphenate
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:50.560]  every damn individual in this country exactly exactly we're so caught up on
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:55.240]  labels and I don't know you know they it's amazing how many times I've seen in
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:59.200]  my lifetime the label that they want to put on people that we now call black or
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.400]  call African American is like why do they keep changing and I think that all
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  boils down to this this premise that you've got in this book I want to give
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.720]  people some callers a chance to ask some questions and comments we've got
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:15.480]  David in Missouri he wanted to ask a question about Ferguson David are you
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:23.760]  close to Ferguson yeah I mean not close probably 100 miles west okay closer to
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:28.520]  Kansas City we had a question for mr. Rush yeah I mean this is great to talk
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:35.400]  to you Paul and on mr. Rush all at once I mean I've heard you David and Paul say
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:43.320]  that what are the people out here what are their like opinions on alternative
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:49.800]  things to do other than violence I mean I say everybody gets a transparent legal
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:54.480]  neighborhood watch armed neighborhood watch everybody takes care of each other
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:59.640]  but I mean my question to a mr. Rush I think Bill Cosby was for the most part
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:06.880]  of his life definitely you know juiced in let's say but he I mean I grew up
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:12.800]  watching so like you know Cosby show family matters I'm a Caucasian person
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:17.680]  I think those shows I mean anything on TV is a third of you know past time at
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:24.440]  least but my question is what is your to a mr. Rush what is your nonviolent
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:30.240]  alternative to this Ferguson situation and situations to come because in every
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:35.360]  news article it says white cop black male like that's just ridiculous yeah bless
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:41.440]  you guys yeah well you know as you were someone was talking about this I think
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.920]  in the previous hour of the show and then that is the fact that you know the
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.320]  police are typically aren't going to police themselves and so you know you
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:56.120]  have to while I have a respect for law enforcement you do have to sort of look
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:01.320]  at at the police with a critical eye to some extent because you do have that
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:06.600]  but incidents of police brutality and sometimes it's race-based sometimes it's
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:12.400]  not sometimes it's just a matter of the police involved having become these
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:17.800]  really jaded brutal individuals and those things have to be handled on an
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:25.440]  individual basis the problem that we have here isn't you know it there may be a
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:32.560]  certain you know well there is a certain level of police
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.840]  misfeasants everywhere you're going to go I mean it doesn't matter but the
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:43.920]  problem that we're having here is interpretation when you have a situation
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.560]  in which you have so many disenfranchised blacks in this case it just
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:55.640]  happens to be blacks who are disenfranchised for mostly economic
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:01.120]  reasons that can be traced to things other than white racism and then you
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:09.360]  have it exploited due to this incident that you know arises Michael Brown you
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:14.520]  know that you have to look at it in context the problem isn't police brutality
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:20.840]  as so much as it is the the disenfranchised angry you know a lot of
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.880]  them in the impoverished unemployed individuals who are being heavily
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:31.200]  propagandized well that has a lot less to do with the police brutality overall
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.560]  than it does a political agenda so we have to address that first and foremost
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:41.400]  yes absolutely let's go to Steven in Florida Steven have a question for Mr.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:47.360]  Rush yeah good afternoon yeah absolutely three first of all I was wondering
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:51.440]  if Mr. Rush if you've seen the documentary that I was carrying in the interview
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:56.400]  with the author of that it's a DVD called Dreams for my real father about
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:02.680]  Obama also why do you think it is that blacks in America are so willing to keep
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:07.360]  themselves on the globalist plantation when they can clearly get off of it and
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.400]  the third thing is I have a friend and the way he responds to Obama and I'm
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.000]  wondering if you disagree with this from what you know of him he says he's a
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:26.200]  teleprompter reading CIA stockpuppet and that's my question okay now who is
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:39.040]  who is it that they said was the CIA stockpuppet okay I will well let me
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:44.600]  address them in order one no I have not seen the DVI haven't seen this movie the
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:49.920]  DVD Dreams for my real father although I'm familiar with the content why do
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:56.800]  blacks stay on the on the plantation because they're it's it's what you you
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:03.040]  go with what you know I mean we grew up being told Hitler was an evil guy if we
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.920]  had been grown up if we had grown up being told Hitler was you know the
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.200]  next best thing to Jesus or Buddha we that's probably what we would have
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:20.040]  thought you've got blacks who are being told by teachers the press agitators
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:24.800]  community people you know in people in their community the Al Sharpsons of the
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:31.040]  world what the deal is and who can save them and that's you know typically you
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:36.160]  know voting Democrat and that's why they stay there as far as Obama being a CIA
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:42.040]  sock puppet right now he's kind of running the CIA so I'm not quite sure how
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:49.720]  that would play out I know that there are a lot of shadowy figures and parties
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:56.240]  governments organizations that played a part in his ascendancy as far as who's
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:02.760]  pulling his strings now you know any number of people he's but but you know I
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:07.880]  mean it's sort of him being a CIA sock puppet in my view is putting the card
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:12.120]  before the horse right at this moment I want to get Paul Joseph Watson with a
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.960]  comment but I would say going back to looking at some of this stuff I look at
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:20.360]  the Indian Reservation System when you talked about have you grown up thinking
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:24.720]  that it often was a great guy then you would believe that I think that when I
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:28.320]  look at the Washington Plantation System that we have now and that's what
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:33.160]  really what it is as a plantation system it's really oppression masquerading as
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:37.600]  paternalism we're here to protect you but it's really the way that they
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:41.640]  oppress people we see that now in the Indian Reservations of course you know
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:45.080]  that was originally not set up with the motivation that they were going to
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.520]  protect anybody except the white people from the Indians they were going to
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:52.840]  contain them on those reservations the way they pacified them was to separate
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:57.600]  the children from the families to send them across the country to their own
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:03.000]  schools to re-educate them yep that was the intent then they put them on these
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.800]  Indian reservations where they don't allow them to have any true economic
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:10.640]  opportunity and you know what we allow that Indian Reservation System to
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:16.440]  perpetuate to continue and now they're using that same strategy then they use
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:20.040]  it on the black community essentially not you know keeping them on a
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.000]  reservation where they didn't have the kind of freedom now they're extending
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.720]  that to everybody we are now all going to be slaves on the Washington
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:31.640]  Plantation we need to get over this way where they pit us against each other
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:35.880]  because we're white black or red we need to understand this is a Washington
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:41.600]  Plantation System it is simply oppression masquerading as paternalism trying to
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.400]  make us dependent on the central government in every way that they can
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:53.280]  yeah did you want to comment on that I'm sorry go ahead mr. rush you come to the
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.720]  end of the book I said you know when I I talked to black people who who start
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:02.960]  realizing this and they get angry I tell them hey don't take it personally you
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.680]  know they're planning to enslave all of us oh yeah yeah they're equal
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:11.960]  opportunity aren't they Paul do you want to comment on that or yeah I sort of
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.280]  thought about culture and that the role models that emerge out of culture we
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:19.720]  were talking about the Cosby show earlier you know I grew up watching things
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:23.880]  like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air which you know they were silly but generally a
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:29.080]  general positive portrayal of black people of hard-working black families
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:35.360]  now all we seem to have emerging out of black culture is hip-hop stars you know
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:40.040]  whose lyrics are laden with genuine misogyny not that the feminists really
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.080]  care about it to a great extent and this kind of idea that anybody can emerge
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:49.000]  out of their situation and just become a global multi-millionaire superstar
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.640]  rapper when the reality is obviously quite different there doesn't seem to be
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:58.280]  that many realistic strong black role models emerging out of culture that
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.440]  would guide black people young black people growing up into becoming more
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:07.560]  you know self-empowered so I mean at least your take on that in terms of
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.640]  hip-hop culture and how that's emerged and grown over the last two decades or
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:14.480]  so at least that was a healthy thing wasn't it from the Cosby show at least
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:18.320]  they had doctors and lawyers as role models as opposed to rappers and gang
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:24.880]  members mr. Rush yeah precisely and I you know I could go on about that all day
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:30.840]  long I think it's it's definitely by design promoting this sort of lowest
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:37.000]  common denominator amongst blacks and of course it's aimed primarily at the
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:42.720]  youth whereby you have this anti-socialism disrespect for
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:48.680]  authority misogyny promiscuity you know every sort of you know low caliber
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:56.040]  value that you can name yet if you if you bring that up in the same way that
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.400]  you bring up trying to get blacks off of this deep you know dependency
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:06.000]  plantation they they will label label you a racist they will say you're trying
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.240]  to deprive black Americans of their culture now now wait a minute what's
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.320]  their culture you're telling blacks that they're supposed to be these you know
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:22.840]  chain-snatching you know big you know just baby mama making you know is
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:29.560]  heaving crack smoking cock shooting you know basically you know scum you're
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:34.320]  you're telling them how to self-identify oh yeah it's very deliberate very very
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.440]  they're very well aware and self-conscious of the subliminal messages
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:41.440]  that they're sending people they're very well aware of that thank you Steven
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:48.800]  for let's go to Fred and Pennsylvania Fred yes I called off wanting to
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:55.520]  disagree with Paul first of all I'm I'm a big supporter of Alex and the host and
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:02.520]  I find the author very interesting and but I I want to say that the the the
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:07.240]  incident with Jeremiah Wright with Reverend Wright has been completely taken
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:14.720]  out of context I actually saw the entire a lot well a good portion of that
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:21.520]  sermon before his statement of goddamn America and he was really saying God
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:27.640]  bless America if America does well does right by God and goddamn America if
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:33.040]  America does wrong by God the same message that conservative Protestant
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:37.800]  ministers have been making for hundreds of years so really Obama is more
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:44.680]  complex a person than the figure that some people have been saying do you want
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:49.000]  to respond to that Paul go ahead yeah I would argue that it's it's not just drawn
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.040]  from one sermon it's rooted in the mindset that people like Jeremiah Wright
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.680]  are invested in people like Bill as the Obama was heavily influenced by and
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:03.160]  mentored by when he was growing up which is this idea which we talked about
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.120]  before that America's founding was based on rapacious principles about
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.960]  stealing land from Mexicans it was based on racist principles about genocide
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:16.080]  against Native Americans which again if you read Dinesh D'Souza's America
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.360]  Imagine a World Without Her he completely demolishes that case
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.920]  historically so that's the point I make about how Obama's worldview is
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:28.400]  influenced by these kind of people yeah there's a larger context even than just
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:34.040]  that one particular speech would you like to address that mr. Rush you know
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:40.160]  I would just disagree with it on the same basis I mean there was a great deal
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:47.280]  more I mean I've I've probably forgotten more about Jeremiah Wright and his
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:50.520]  sermons that most people are like we gotta go to break we'll be right back
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:51:00.800]  with Eric Rush stay with us we'll be taking your calls this hour of GCN

[02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:19.320]  Joseph Watson with us in the UK and on the line we have Eric Rush author of
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:23.840]  Negrofilia from slave block to pedestal and we've been taking your calls we've
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:27.360]  got the phone lines basically full here we're gonna try to go quickly if
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:31.800]  possible to try to get through everybody that's been on hold let's go to John in
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:36.560]  Ohio John you have a question for Mr. Rush. Yes I don't agree with much of
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.000]  what's been said but I think some of the truth came out by a caller who pointed
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:48.200]  out that Obama is a CI asset going back since the time that he was brought as
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:56.200]  a toddler with his CI top CI parents to help oversee and participate in
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:01.720]  the genocidal anti-communist coup that the CI perpetrated that killed over a
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:07.880]  million people with the rivers running red with blood that coup that his
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:15.320]  parents and he was up present in was totally based on anti-communism it
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:20.600]  was totally based on anti-leftism and I wonder why we don't get some of the
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:25.080]  leftist critiques of Obama as a right-winger because he was brought up
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:29.040]  they'll use any kind of justification to do whatever they want to think if it's
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.600]  in their interest to pose as right-wingers they'll do that if it's in
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.960]  their interest to pose as left-wingers they'll do that any comments mr. Rush
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:43.400]  well I'm I'm somewhat curious as to what which genocide the callers referring
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:46.440]  to was he talking are you talking about Indonesia and we're talking about the
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:51.400]  rivers running red with blood I'm talking about the fact that the central
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.320]  intelligence agency overthrew a popular suharto government to do
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:59.160]  overthrow and killed a very popular millions of communists and their
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:03.840]  families and their supporters and after that it was a big new Brzezinski
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.080]  tutored Obama at Columbia and has been his advisor ever since and he is the
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.960]  most ultra-right anti-communist anti-russia strategist in the country so I
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.640]  believe this whole in the canard that somehow has been perpetrated that
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:25.080]  Obama is a leftist or a communist is it is a deliberate disinformation why don't
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:30.600]  we have people on like the leftist black agenda report yeah to criticize Obama as
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:36.680]  being nothing but a black base of blue bush and chain you but these people
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:39.880]  they'll use any kind of they'll use any kind of mask as possible and of course
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:43.600]  we see it's interesting I find it interesting that Obama the Obama
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:49.160]  administration is blocking this report on the CIA torture that's there before
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:53.200]  the Senate and of course Mark Udall who is not going to be coming back has
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:57.560]  threatened that he will read it on the floor of the Senate I wish he would read
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:01.200]  the unredacted torture report on the floor of the Senate let's move on I
