[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08.160 --> 00:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, here we are.
[00:13.000 --> 00:21.000]  Seems like 2014 just began and it's already December 25th, 2014, it's Christmas.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  Yes, they've turned into a giant commercial event.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  There's record numbers of suicides and car wrecks and DWIs on the state.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  And it's not the traffic and the long lines that lead up to Christmas I like, but it is.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  It is the Christmas carols, it's the music of childhood, it's meeting with family.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  I like Christmas overall and I really like the message of Christ that Christmas is connected to.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  It's something that the system really tries to distract us from with fad driven hoaxes like Santa Claus.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  And I'm not against that jolly old elf.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  It's just that he's only been manufactured in the West in the last 80 years or so.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  Sure, in the Netherlands and other areas Santa Claus was a jolly old guy.
[01:09.000 --> 01:18.000]  If you go back to the 1700s, Christmas was banned in England for a while because it was a day kind of like Devil's Night in Detroit
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  to go out and burn down buildings and murder people.
[01:21.000 --> 01:32.000]  And Santa Claus was a striped shirted Freddy Krueger type elf who was a patron saint of murdering gangs that were out looting
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  and as I said, raping and burning down buildings.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  So Christmas is a lot of things to a lot of people.
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  But on this Christmas edition of the global transmission, I just want to say that I'm thankful for all the great listeners out there that put up with me.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  I'm thankful for my great crew.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  I'm thankful for my family.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  I'm thankful for the Providence.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  You know, God's good graces.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  Some people call it luck, but I knock on wood and thank the good Lord above for all of the close calls I've had.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  There's certainly a invisible hand of good working there to shepherd and protect so many of us.
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  And I'm thankful for the amazing fact that I'm alive and conscious and then I can interface with all of you other conscious beings.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's really amazing.
[02:20.000 --> 02:34.000]  And I'm always humbled by the fact that I have an audience that tunes in on record levels even during days like Christmas when most radio shows have almost no listeners.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  And it's because you're hardcore folks that care about humanity, care about defeating tyranny.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  You take it personal.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  You're involved and you're the salt of the earth.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  So I get grumpy.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  I get irritable doing three, four hours of radio every day and sometimes I'm a jerk.
[02:48.000 --> 02:57.000]  But in my heart, I really love all of you and I appreciate you and our guest sponsors, affiliates, really everyone that's made the info war possible.
[02:57.000 --> 03:12.000]  And it's seen through all of my foibles, all of my warts, all of my problems and seen that kernel of greatness there that has helped grow the info war so much because Gandhi said that in each of us is the seed of the universe.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  And just as I saw in Paul Watson and so many other great reporters, I have the seeds of greatness.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  You have seen that in me as well.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  And we see that back looking at each other.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  I mean, Drudge Report has helped us to send hundreds and hundreds of millions of visitors over the years to infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  I'm thankful to that.
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  I'm thankful to other real media out there like WorldNet Daily and countless others and mainstream journalists as well.
[03:38.000 --> 03:46.000]  You know, even Esquire last year did a profile and I guess this year seems like last year, seems like it's already 2015 and said Alex Jones is really a pretty good guy.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then they almost didn't publish it and put it at the back, the writer told me, but they said if we don't get a picture of you acting crazy, it really won't go in there.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  They want to balance it.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  That was like a famous documentary filmmaker made a big five part documentary with me in it, Joe Belger.
[04:03.000 --> 04:13.000]  And when it went to Discovery Channel, they said it's too positive, make Alex look bad and he refused so they shelved the $5 million project.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  It was a million dollar budget per piece.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  And it would have gotten ratings for Discovery.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  He's the guy that made some kind of monster.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  You name it with Metallica, Brothers Keeper, just a really famous award-winning guy.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  I think he won an Academy Award.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  It was a nomination.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  The point, I'm not bragging here.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  The point is, is that there have been so many people out there that resonate for justice and freedom.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  I know you're out there where brothers and sisters and arms together.
[04:39.000 --> 04:46.000]  So Merry Christmas to all of you, even if you don't like Jesus or anything, you know it's a fun time of year and the lights are pretty.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  So I love all of you and we'll see you obviously coming up live tomorrow.
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  We've got a powerful retransmission coming up right now with Billy Corrigan and the former head of the NSA and a lot more.
[04:57.000 --> 05:20.000]  Stay with us.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  Is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  But for how long?
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's an iodine or DNA force.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  Super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[06:32.000 --> 06:40.000]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  There's two.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  It's great stuff.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  Check out InfoWarsLife.com today and the entire line of ground breaking, cutting edge, hard core products.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  Using super oxygenation, oxy powder, available through InfoWarsLife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Doe has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  Took it that first day and I took it for six more days after that.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  12 pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  And I've been able to keep it off too.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this oxy powder.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  Oxy powder flushes it out.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  Secure your oxy powder at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:52.000 --> 08:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:22.000 --> 08:41.000]  You travel very far. You travel far like a star. And you are.
[08:41.000 --> 08:56.000]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com is the website, SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com, to find the new album that I just got in and can't wait to listen to the whole thing.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  Monuments to an LG, want to find out what that means, or LG.
[09:02.000 --> 09:12.000]  Tommy Lee, one of my favorite drummers, of course, of Motley Crue fame, is doing drums on the album.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  We're going to be playing part of some of the songs here today, but not in their entirety, because that'll send the computer bots crazy out there on different internet platforms.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  Billy Corgan is our guest, or as I say it in Texas, drawl where he butcher names, Billy Corgan.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  Leon came here and said, you know, you're friends with him. You ought to pronounce his name right, Billy Corgan.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  And he's not in a hotel room. He's flown in and landed. He is in the airport right now.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  So I can't wait to have him back in studio next time. He's in Austin. He's a regular listener, and he's just a great guy.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.000]  I learned that he was a listener through a man cow, a fellow friend, and he's a really smart guy, one of the smartest people I've talked to, not just in music or entertainment, but period.
[09:54.000 --> 10:03.000]  And Billy Corgan has actually taught me quite a bit about perspectives and how to see the world and has helped me mature some.
[10:03.000 --> 10:14.000]  And I think that's why out of the blue for the last decade or so, you see just random hit pieces, even though there's no scandals, no dirt, nothing.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  That's why you see Anderson Cooper in the middle of the CIA attacking him.
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  Now, that's why you see MSNBC saying snippy things, Rolling Stones saying snippy things. It's because he's outside of the system.
[10:25.000 --> 10:37.000]  He didn't play ball with him. He spoke out about the dumbing down of music with MTV and more, and they don't like smart people who have the power of reaching tens of millions who've sold 40 million albums.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Just like Dave Mustaine, their views may differ a little bit, but they agree on fighting Terry. There's a global government.
[10:43.000 --> 10:53.000]  There's social engineering. Look at the demonization of him, because if you let one aunt stand up, they might all stand up to quote, is it a bug's life?
[10:53.000 --> 11:02.000]  This is what we're talking about here. So he's joining us from the airport. I'll look even to about 40 after 45 after or so, so he can get on his next plan or get on down the road.
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.000]  He was going to be on with us yesterday, but I had a family emergency had to take care of Billy Corgan. Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  Thank you, Alex. Always a pleasure to talk to you. You heard my intro there. There's so much to get into. Let's talk about Anderson Cooper first.
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  Not that he even matters, has almost no viewers, dinosaur media. But at the same time, it's so clear that every time you've got an album about to come out, the hit pieces begin because they want to slap you down.
[11:30.000 --> 11:41.000]  Yeah, well, it's pretty strange. I don't know if your listeners know the context of this, but I did a cover for a charity called Cause Chicago. It's a no kill shelter model, very proud.
[11:41.000 --> 11:52.000]  I've helped raise, along with my partner in the band, Jeff, a quarter million dollars for the charity. One of my proudest things I've ever done is being involved in animal rights issues.
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  It was about six months ago. The image went viral. It's me and my rescue cats on the cover of the magazine. Never in a million years did I think I'd start getting attacked.
[12:01.000 --> 12:14.000]  Out of nowhere, four or five months later, there I am being made fun of. No context for the fact that it's charity magazine. Basically presented as if I've fallen so far off the celebrity radar that I'm reduced to doing a cat magazine.
[12:14.000 --> 12:27.000]  Then ties it into where has he gone, whatever happened to him, making mocking my participation in professional wrestling. No mention of my new album, no mention of my successes.
[12:27.000 --> 12:44.000]  Nothing, as if I just disappeared off the celebrity map. Very strange. I think he's probably been a bit shocked by the reaction because, A, I fought back, which you're not supposed to do. You're supposed to take your licks and just put your tail between your licks because the mighty CNN has spoken.
[12:44.000 --> 12:59.000]  On top of that, now a lot of animal rights people raised up and started poking in the eye because it's something that's a demarcation line that should be left alone. People doing charity work. It really is emblematic of the sickness of our culture.
[12:59.000 --> 13:14.000]  By the way, you don't brag about that a lot, but I've seen it. You help a lot of charities out there and you were helping save and rescue cats, raising and other tons of money and really working in the community like I know you quietly do in and around Chicago.
[13:14.000 --> 13:27.000]  And then you're a bad guy. No, it's because you are a good guy and are quietly out there working while doing other big things in media that they're scared of you. It's because they know they don't control you and you know what's going on.
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.000]  I think it is very interesting to see these kind of assassins come out of the woodwork. This is probably the most well-received album I've had in about 20 years and I've been through a lot in my own way and I've shot myself in the foot like any good artist would.
[13:42.000 --> 13:57.000]  But I've seemed to kind of dial the back in. The music business is coming up back around me and it's amazing that all of a sudden then you're at a target because you have power, you have a mass power again. It's the kind of power that's very threatening to those systems.
[13:57.000 --> 14:12.000]  They do not want outliers. They love muppets. They love people who tow the party line. Your audience doesn't need an education on this. They're more aware than any audience in the world how these things work.
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  So we don't have to go on about it. But I think it's very obvious that here they come. The agenda starts to poke out. I just had an interview about a week ago.
[14:23.000 --> 14:37.000]  A guy was asking me about Edward Snowden. Here's the line of questioning out of nowhere in the middle of an interview about my new album. Do you believe Edward Snowden was a hero? Yes. Why? Because it's the right thing.
[14:37.000 --> 14:48.000]  Next question. Would you do the same? I told the guy to go, you know what, himself. I said, am I running for president? What kind of line of questioning is that? I'm promoting an album.
[14:48.000 --> 14:58.000]  Well, and the reason we raise it, I know my audience is very informed. It's that obviously you can speak here uncensored. They won't be able to filter it as much.
[14:58.000 --> 15:12.000]  And so you can speak directly to it because this is what happens to myself, to Ron Paul, to countless others that really try to shift the paradigm into really waking up to the larger control system is they put articles out constantly.
[15:12.000 --> 15:26.000]  Alex Jones has no audience. Alex Jones wishes he wasn't discredited. Alex Jones is a racist with no proof, but we know they're doing it because they want to assassinate the messenger.
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  But the good news is they've already assassinated their own credibility, so they're shooting blanks. And I don't think in their arrogance they figured that out yet, Billy.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  No, I agree with you, but just to give you a little bit of kind of the context of the other side of it, right after the Anderson Cooper thing kind of went viral.
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.000]  I know you put a story on your site and I gave a quote for that when that sort of kind of ticked back up into the mainstream consciousness.
[15:52.000 --> 16:03.000]  I probably did about 10 interviews in the next couple of days. And in seven of the 10 interviews, I was asked about the Anderson Cooper flap and five of the seven people interviewed me had no idea it was for a charity.
[16:03.000 --> 16:10.000]  So that shows you that there is still a little effectiveness counting on that low information project that will be on headline.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  That's it. They are targeting a low information crowd. But again, that crowd of zombies really don't even matter anymore.
[16:17.000 --> 16:28.000]  I mean, I'm sad to say that it's like they're almost not even people. They've decided to just mindlessly buy into this and this narcissistic, thin, mindless gruel that's being spewed out.
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  But speaking, speaking of Anderson Cooper, and we're going to get into your album that I do think is one of your best in a long time.
[16:34.000 --> 16:46.000]  Speaking of Anderson Cooper, he really is a CIA guy. He really was in the CIA, not just an intern. He really is the grandson of one of the biggest dynasties in the country.
[16:46.000 --> 17:00.000]  Or is it the Astros? So he's a little rich kid, given everything he's got. He's failed. He has some of the worst ratings on CNN. So I would feel good, Billy, just to have this joke, this failure that was given everything.
[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  I mean, you came from nowhere. I came from nowhere. He was given everything. He's the opposite of Americana.
[17:06.000 --> 17:18.000]  You know, I think what's interesting, because to me, you know, I try to stay out of the personal side of it, although I did say the other day I wasn't born with a silver spoon on my arse, like he was.
[17:18.000 --> 17:28.000]  I think it's very interesting that there is a level of arrogance here. That crowd, whatever that crowd is, and I've hung with them, you know, I've been in those rooms and so have you.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  I've been to those parties and so have you. That crowd really thinks they can sort of flick us off their shoulder anytime they want.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  And what they don't realize is that people like you and me are just symbols of a much greater conversation.
[17:39.000 --> 17:48.000]  They don't understand that a vast part of our country is waking up, is breaking this hypnosis, this grip of hypnosis, and they can't see it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:57.000]  They literally can't see it. They literally think they can just double down, triple down on these narratives and these false paradigms, and the public's just going to keep laughing them up.
[17:57.000 --> 18:14.000]  And I think as we see from recent events, people are starting to sort of question the narratives, and you see the media, those old world media, doubling, triple, quadrupling down on false storylines, because they literally don't have a beat plan.
[18:14.000 --> 18:25.000]  I agree with you. And just the beginning of the questioning is the beginning of the end, because as soon as you question, you're no longer only in that narrow, low-information media system.
[18:25.000 --> 18:32.000]  You now discover the wider world. You come out of Plato's Cave and it's game over. That is such an incredibly exciting thing.
[18:32.000 --> 18:39.000]  You know, I think one of your songs in the last album or the album before was about the world on fire, and the lyrics really spoke to this.
[18:39.000 --> 18:50.000]  I remember we were talking like six years ago when you were saying you can clearly see crisis after crisis coming, which is now here, but that out of that, we really could see a new renaissance.
[18:50.000 --> 19:00.000]  I think I get the sense from talking to my friends and family, and I'm sure many of your listeners, of course, which I'm one of.
[19:00.000 --> 19:08.000]  Those conversations that we had around the dinner table seven years ago, which were really difficult conversations to have, and people would just throw their hands up and say, you're crazy.
[19:08.000 --> 19:23.000]  Now people are listening. And just the fact that you're even able to sit at that table and have those conversations and be able to back it up with statistics and people, you know, the failure of this particular administration, the lying that goes on.
[19:23.000 --> 19:35.000]  And the fact that there's this greater divide between the public that's awake and the public that's asleep. I mean, those that are asleep really do want to be asleep because, I mean, how could you not be eyes open at this point?
[19:35.000 --> 19:46.000]  That's right. How could you not be eyes open at this point? And his mother was a Vanderbilt, the heir of the entire Vanderbilt fortune, not a not a ask her, but it doesn't matter.
[19:46.000 --> 19:54.000]  They're interrelated. And again, nothing wrong with being the last male heir of one of the biggest robber baron horrible dynasties.
[19:54.000 --> 20:03.000]  It's just give us a break, Anderson Cooper, because I don't even get into fighting with these personalities. But at the same time, I think it's important to not just respond and say, hey, I'm helping a cat charity.
[20:03.000 --> 20:11.000]  Leave me alone. Don't try to make me, you know, look like it has been when I'm not. Everybody knows that you've been popular all along and you've had big reassurgences.
[20:11.000 --> 20:19.000]  I mean, it's just a joke. I mean, you've sold 40 million albums. Anderson Cooper is on a failed network that's converting to cooking shows.
[20:19.000 --> 20:28.000]  So I'm not being nasty. It's just they are dancing on their own graves when you are just having the courage to express what's already there.
[20:28.000 --> 20:41.000]  You said we're like little tips of iceberg sticking up or little focal points as Ron Paul always says. I mean, we're nothing. We are just like everybody else that is trying to find out what the hell is really going on.
[20:41.000 --> 20:53.000]  I can't disagree with you. And I think there's a democratization there in the way that we're all communicating. And, you know, thank God for people like you for building these new systems by which we're sharing information.
[20:53.000 --> 21:02.000]  And, you know, we're building up our own networks of communication. I mean, basically, I would argue we're past the tipping point. And now it's just how is this all going to play out?
[21:02.000 --> 21:11.000]  And as you've been predicting, I don't know how many years. Now we're seeing the rolling out of this next wave of control and propaganda.
[21:11.000 --> 21:18.000]  But the fact of the matter is that everyone's so prepared and has been sort of mentally prepared for what's coming.
[21:18.000 --> 21:29.000]  I went out one small thing because I think it's important in the context of the conversation we're having. You know, when President Obama was elected, that night I went on stage and I knew I was already listening to you.
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  I was kind of like half awake, let's put it. And I went on stage and I said, let's hope this is the sign that things are going to go in the right direction.
[21:37.000 --> 21:44.000]  And you actually ran a piece and we didn't know each other then. You used a piece kind of mocking me or being another celebrity sort of drinking the Kool-Aid.
[21:44.000 --> 21:53.000]  And I was thinking back to that time. I wasn't offended by the piece. I thought it was kind of funny. But I'm never thinking back to the time where I was in my own kind of awakening.
[21:53.000 --> 22:02.000]  And we have to remember, those of us that are awake, there are so many people that are in that horrible moment of like, wow, if this stuff is true, what do I do?
[22:02.000 --> 22:10.000]  And we see that more and more now. We see people waking up and it's really shocking to them that they've been given a lie sort of all along.
[22:10.000 --> 22:19.000]  And as you sit in bars and round coffee houses and talk to people about what's really going on, you can see that it's not so much that they don't know that something's happening.
[22:19.000 --> 22:28.000]  They just don't know what to do about it. So we have to continue to prepare the way. And this is not some begging appeal to be supported as an artist.
[22:28.000 --> 22:36.000]  But what I would say to everybody is the artists in many ways are some of the most dangerous people in the world because we have that street credibility to go out and sing some gospel.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  And that's what makes me dangerous is once my career starts rolling in the right direction again, well, here I come because how is it possible?
[22:44.000 --> 22:51.000]  I mean, they've tried to kill me how many times. And Anderson Cooper is just a small example getting kicked in the shin.
[22:51.000 --> 22:59.000]  And so it really helps. And I'm not begging for my own self, but please support artists, to support free voices, to support people like Alex.
[22:59.000 --> 23:07.000]  To keep speaking out to and it does require material support, like I'm a supporter of what you're doing with info or his wife. Right?
[23:07.000 --> 23:16.000]  Absolutely. Billy, I want to shift gears and talk about this more deeply because and I use this analogy too much. I apologize, but it's so accurate.
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  I use it 20 years ago. You couldn't find organic food anywhere. It was very expensive.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  You could because there was no market as people began to demand it. It grew the market.
[23:24.000 --> 23:31.000]  The prices went down. It's now displacing all the garbage. It's displacing the high fructose corn syrup. They're taking it out of Hershey's.
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  We're taking it out of Heinz. Now look, there's still some fake organic or still problems.
[23:37.000 --> 23:46.000]  The point is we demanded quality. The market changed. And exactly if people go out and support independent artists that are speaking out against tyranny,
[23:46.000 --> 23:56.000]  that's great music as well. And buy your album at smashingpumpkinsnexus.com and then play it for friends and then ask that it be played on the radio or share it with their friends.
[23:56.000 --> 24:04.000]  That's how you bring the system down. You've got to go further and decide you want to promote cultures of liberty.
[24:04.000 --> 24:15.000]  I can't tell you historically how many kings, how many corrupt dynasties were brought down by a gesture telling jokes that became viral in ancient times.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  Or by the local band or even one guy with his, they didn't have guitars back then.
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  One guy with his little mandolin or whatever singing songs about the corrupt nobility, that would change it.
[24:29.000 --> 24:38.000]  So a song or an idea that isn't in the hands of the system could bring them down and that's why they target people like you.
[24:38.000 --> 24:48.000]  There was a reason the CIA was spying on John Lennon. At that point in time he was probably the most dangerous artist in the world.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  All that killed him, too.
[24:50.000 --> 24:59.000]  Well, I can't speak to that, but I'll say this much. If you look at the power that rock and roll had in the 70s,
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  vis-a-vis the power that rock and roll has now, I think there's been a concerted effort to drain those systems of their power.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  Because it's just too radical, it's just too dangerous.
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.000]  When you have the power of a John Lennon or a Bar Marley and they can literally have one song that will change the consciousness of the world
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  and get people to look at something different.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  And I would point, and I'm saying this from a very specific point of view,
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  look at the lack of political music in the world right now and compare that to the 1960s.
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  It is unbelievable the lack of political and social discourse in music right now.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  Do you think that's an accidental omission?
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  They came in and they took it over on record. Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins fame is our guest,
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com. We're going to send out a tweet of the website right now.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  We're going to post this video later today on Facebook and Twitter.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  It needs to go viral because he has a lot of courage saying what he's saying because they really come after people.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  I've got to be very careful here what I'm going to say about John Lennon.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  But they made a film six, seven years ago that won a bunch of awards that had the declassified documents.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  We're Strom Thurman, the senator, and others said we want him taken out.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  We know the suspicious way he was killed. I'm just going to stop right there.
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  But I've talked to the highest level people and been told stuff about what really went on
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  and then what happened to them afterwards and everything.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  And I can tell you the FBI and the CIA killed John Lennon.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  And then they went on a campaign to cover up what they did with their Patsy.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  And so that's why when we talk about this, folks, it's very dangerous.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  So we're not saying, hey, we're heroes here. We're just saying realize this isn't just your regular shuck and jive on CNN.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  I mean, we're really laying it out here.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  I think what's kind of funny about the modern life is I don't think they have to kill you anymore.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  I think they just digitally kill you.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  I mean, if anything, you're almost you're almost better as a sort of sort of living effigy,
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  which is why I think some of these people come out of the woodwork to try to like split my throat.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, criticize me as an artist. That's fine.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  There's there's plenty to criticize.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  But if you look at a lot of the subtext of the things that have written about an artist like me,
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  it has a lot of a lot of it's a lot of sort of false narratives,
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  moral equivalencies that have nothing to do with music or art or love or people's lives.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  You just said it. You just said it. They create straw men that aren't Alex Jones or Billy Corgan.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  And then they attribute things. We didn't say they have they have these campaigns.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  They send out fake emails that aren't for me insulting people.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  They call people up and say it's me and insult them famous people.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  They spoof faxes and I know it's the government corporation.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  So believe me, what Billy's talking about, it goes on here all the time in an attempt to derail us,
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  but it's not going to work because Billy Corgan and Alex Jones are just little bitty expressions like like a compound.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  I have a dragonfly. We're just one little tiny part of it. You can't chop off all the heads.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  Totally agree with you. And one thing I would add to that, because I know sometimes when I talk like this to people,
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  they think, well, are you saying that everyone who works at the local paper has done it?
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  No, if these systems are put in place and then they go out and they find people who are not free thinkers
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  to basically implement the program.
[28:18.000 --> 28:27.000]  They regurgitate the national story. They're already the little sycophantic type that'll go with whatever the mindless pop culture narrative is.
[28:27.000 --> 28:34.000]  Absolutely. And I've even had off record conversations like I know you have where people have admitted to me where they've had stories squashed.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Oh, yeah.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  You know, somebody makes a juice call and makes sure a story is squashed or a particular agenda is promoted.
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  So when you're looking at, you know, your local media and you see and you and you go, well, this smells like propaganda.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  Know that more than likely that person is not conscious.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  They are in a they put in and put in that position because they they're a proven bootlicker.
[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  Almost all local news is written in New York or LA or DC. This is on record and packaged and sent.
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  You tell them a local story and then they send down what you say or it's read off a teleprompter if it's a national story.
[29:09.000 --> 29:20.000]  Right. So so if there's a if you know, there's a man in a high castle somewhere, you know, there's not a lot of them, but they're they're able to through their their control and their and their media control sort of manipulate the storyline.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  We had your listeners know, you know, and I'm a listener.
[29:23.000 --> 29:34.000]  You know, we know these things are, I mean, we sit back with when when when when when Ferguson started to boil over and you, you know, you had a jacari and big down there.
[29:34.000 --> 29:44.000]  You know, I was watching some of the coverage and it's really interesting, you know, because and it's so important that you do that because you're giving us the real on the street perspective as opposed to propaganda perspective.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  Stay there. Come back and finish up with that thought. Let's talk about the record.
[29:48.000 --> 30:03.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network sold out for weeks to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation.

[33:40.000 --> 33:58.000]  That's one and all and you can hear Tommy Lee on the drums. The new album available right now at the Smashing Pumpkins Nexus.com website.
[33:58.000 --> 34:09.000]  We're going to send a tweet out to that website right now. Let's see everybody go there and buy the album because believe me they have targeted Billy and his organization because of them speaking out on a whole bunch of issues.
[34:09.000 --> 34:24.000]  What they call loose cannons, they want people that will submit and go along with their whole agenda. Billy I want to thank you for the gift of my Bohemian Grove security shirt and real badge, I mean real shoulder patch.
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  When I wear that out people say who in the world do you work for?
[34:30.000 --> 34:45.000]  That is awesome Billy. I want to get back to what you said about Ferguson and more on the album before you have to leave us in that airport you're sitting in right now.
[34:45.000 --> 34:55.000]  But Tommy Lee, I had heard from folks that he was awake. I had heard from somebody that worked with him on a TV show behind the scenes that he was all aware of the New World Order.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  I know you don't want to speak for him personally but can you repeat what you told me during the break?
[35:00.000 --> 35:15.000]  No Tommy's eyes are wide open and you talked a lot of artists off record and I've talked about that. I think the general public would be shocked how much of the entertainment world is awake and it's because they're behind the Wizards curtain.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  Joe Perry is fully awake. I need to call him today but a lot of folks are. Go ahead.
[35:23.000 --> 35:31.000]  I think the difficulty is these paradigms have been set up where it's like you have to stare down the barrel of a particular gun in this case your career.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  Like I said, what's the new paradigm? You're going to get digitally assassinated.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  I know there would be some people particularly in Rock and Roll World that will roll their eyes at these kind of assertions but there's a reason that the great artists get marginalized.
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.000]  They're sucked into things that have nothing to do with their music and I'm literally everything I say now is trolled for quotes.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  And I'm not saying it's all political, some of it's just dumb stuff.
[35:58.000 --> 36:08.000]  But the fact of the matter is this whole business has risen up around entertainment and big business but it ultimately is about the disenfranchising of the artist's vote in the culture.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  In that sense the constant message is artist's voices don't matter.
[36:13.000 --> 36:22.000]  When you look at what Jimi Hendrix represented as opposed to your normal average politician, you tell me who's the more honorable person.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  Well it's obviously Jimi Hendrix following his soul, his heart, trailblazing, creating heavy rock, heavy metal. I'm a true pioneer.
[36:32.000 --> 36:46.000]  Right and so that's what I'm trying to say is from cradle to grave there are systems in place, you pick them, now it's common core, the scholarship programs.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  They're meant to take anybody who's too bright, too smart and make sure they're corralled into a system from the get-go.
[36:52.000 --> 37:01.000]  And God forbid you exist outside that system and prosper as you and I have and bless the Lord for the gifts he's given us.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  And I think both of us, and I know we've talked about this, we feel a great responsibility to turn those gifts around to serve others.
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  And if it kills us, it kills us but at the end of the day we've got to trust the band upstairs.
[37:14.000 --> 37:28.000]  There's a greater purpose here at play and if what we watch on the old systems, the mainstream media systems, if that's truth, I don't want to live in that world anyway.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  That's beautifully said, I don't want to live in that world anyway because it is a fraud, it is a lie. I feel so empowered, not that I have all the answers, I make a lot of mistakes.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  I say stupid stuff sometimes. I hear my show rebroadcast and go, oh my God, that sounds horrible. I don't mean that.
[37:44.000 --> 37:53.000]  But at the same time, my heart's true. I'm trying to tell the truth and more of what I say turns out to be accurate than what dinosaur media says and it resonates with people.
[37:53.000 --> 38:01.000]  And then I just don't want to let them down. It's humbling to know there's so many good people that are awake now and looking for me for leadership or whoever.
[38:01.000 --> 38:12.000]  I don't think that's where the leadership is. It's in our hearts, it's in our souls, it's in following our gut, it's in doing the right thing and it's in doing the opposite of what mainstream dinosaur media says.
[38:12.000 --> 38:21.000]  I want to ask you about this. Where do you and your gut, Billy, as you said the world's on fire, the previous album, where do you and your gut think civilization's really going?
[38:21.000 --> 38:29.000]  Are we going to survive? Will we make it to the next Renaissance and beyond? And what do you think that fight's going to look like?
[38:29.000 --> 38:43.000]  I hold my breath on that one. There's a big fight coming. It's one thing to listen to you talk about, seeing the documents and executive orders that we don't know about.
[38:43.000 --> 38:52.000]  And yesterday, I think you had on your site about this idea that it's now legal to spy on everyone everywhere for the end time and all this kind of stuff.
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.000]  These systems are going to double and triple down because they have no alternate plan, you understand?
[39:00.000 --> 39:11.000]  They've been in power for a very long time and whoever's pulling those levers, when a baseball team loses, they go, we'll come back next year and we'll rebuild.
[39:11.000 --> 39:22.000]  These guys are in it to win. Sometimes when I'm sitting around a table and your name comes up, I say some things that I've learned through you and through other people.
[39:22.000 --> 39:31.000]  They get into games about accuracy. How can you know that that's true? And all I got to say again and again is, look, come on, something's off here.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  Something's wrong. And people like you, people like me, we don't have to be accurate. It's not our job. Our job is not to be perfect.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  We don't hold ourselves up to be perfect. We don't hold ourselves up to be capers or tooth tellers or something like that.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  We're just pointing, as you often say, you know, you're just pointing and saying, do you see that big thing that's coming down the road? I do.
[39:51.000 --> 39:59.000]  Exactly. And they say, well, what exactly is it? How do we know your eyes are authorized to say that's a juggernaut with fire shooting out of it out of Road Warrior?
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  And I'm like, well, I came by another village. They said something that looked like that blew it up.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  So that thing looks scary. What are we going to do about it?
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  Yeah. And again, I would recommend anybody the same thing. We don't, we, I'm just like, you know, the collective world that's awake.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.000]  You know, let's extend it even beyond your audience. We don't have to be right. We don't have to be accurate. We know what wrong is.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  We know what wrong is and we know a lot of what's going on is wrong, you know?
[40:28.000 --> 40:42.000]  So they have the fake moral authority where, where accuracy in media or where media matters, remember the White House or where they have that truth detector site or Snopes, you know, run by a couple in an apartment.
[40:42.000 --> 40:53.000]  They sit on the mountain and they say what reality is. And I mean, anybody that starts telling you they have a corner on reality, well, that's what you really got to watch.
[40:53.000 --> 41:02.000]  If we reach a point as a race where we do not grieve the loss of every child, I don't care what color, I don't care where they're from.
[41:02.000 --> 41:11.000]  You know what I mean? If we don't grieve the loss of our child, that's an indictment of us, you know, and we've got to be protesting for every child, every situation.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  You know, we need to have moral outrage where there's injustice everywhere.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  And then when we see agendas at play, we have to step back and say, why is this more important than everything else?
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  We have to grieve for all of these things. We have to grieve for the GMOs. We have to grieve for the chemtrails.
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  We have to grieve for all this crap that we have to face down and we have to pull together.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  And that's what I mean. We don't have to be right. We don't have to be right. We just have to know.
[41:37.000 --> 41:46.000]  As long as we know that's the power. And I'm blessed to be one voice in the wilderness, at least a free thinker.
[41:46.000 --> 41:55.000]  There are times where it's very difficult in a musical life to struggle where, you know, the numbers don't add up and you don't get the advantage that you think you should get in all these things.
[41:55.000 --> 42:04.000]  And those are those hard days where you've got to stare in the mirror and say, would I rather be on my knees, subjugated to some system that would ask me to be a robot and up at something,
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  or would I rather be a free thinker? And that's what I would say. I'm proud to be a free thinker.
[42:08.000 --> 42:15.000]  And if that means what it means, you know, a half full hall somewhere, that's what it means, because I can't go down any other way.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  Well, you know my favorite quote by Mark Twain. He had a lot of great ones.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the temant join him, then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[42:27.000 --> 42:37.000]  I was on over a hundred radio stations that was just unheard of when I was like, you know, 26, 27 years old, and 9-11 happened.
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  And it was just unheard of. And I was on a hundred stations, small mom and pop, some of them, but high ratings.
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  And I was growing, and then the towers got blown up and I said, no, the government's clearly involved, and those stations all called, most of them.
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  They said, we're going to turn you off next week, or we're going to turn you off next month on the contracts, up using monthly contracts.
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.000]  If you don't, stop it right now. And you know what? I didn't feel bad at all.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  When Ted Anderson came in and he said, all these stations are turning you off. He just lost 10 to day.
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  They're warning you, you got to stop now. And I said, Ted, I just can't stop. And it's the truth.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  And he said, I really respect that. Alex, he goes, fine, you know, you have a place here on the network.
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.000]  You know, we're going to lose at the network at that time, millions of dollars over the, you know, years.
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.000]  And back then I was making hardly any money. And he said, you know, you would get, you know, that.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  But he goes, I respect that. And he goes, so I'll lose millions. You're going to lose millions because I just hit the zeitgeist.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  I had just gone from like 20 stations to over 100. It was boom, spreading all over the country because it was hardcore libertarian.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  The right wingers liked it. But I came out and spoke bad about their God, George Bush.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  And I didn't even say he did it all. I just said, look, the government's running Al Qaeda.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  They let them attack us for a minimum. And I'm proud of that. And it's just like I'm proud of what you've done.
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  But then I only got bigger down the road, but then it only gets scarier because then it's not even about being on the air or being famous.
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  It is all about the struggle for reality and trying to find that truth. I think that's what you're saying.
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.000]  It's not that we're perfect or always right. We want the truth and we have goodwill towards others.
[44:09.000 --> 44:14.000]  I think we're talking about the philosophy of those of us that want to be free.
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  Well, I think it was back to your question of what do I think is going to happen?
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  And this is where it gets into a very tricky juncture.
[44:22.000 --> 44:29.000]  We have to see what's happening, but at the same time, we have to be able to kind of step back and look at the larger narrative at play.
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  If there are nefarious forces in the world, they are willing to use our humanity against us.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  They are basically sociopathic. They don't care that babies die somewhere in the middle of some desert.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  They don't care that kids are taking vaccines with horrible things in them.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  They don't care about the rise in autism rate. They're willing to do whatever, however.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  I mean, they've proven that again and again and again.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  So this is where we cannot get sucked into these false moral arguments.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  Those arguments are important.
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  Like in talking recently about some of the things that have gone on at the protests that are happening post,
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  is it Mr. Garner with the man's name? It was choked. Terrible.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  And then the horrible situation, and then obviously what happened in Ferguson.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  And you know, you can use these discussions, like I said, around the dinner table,
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.000]  and people think that you're unsentimental or unfeeling, and no, these are horrible.
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  Of course there's injustice in the inner cities, of course.
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  You know, does that mean every cop's the bad guy? You say it all the time.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  I know lots of great cops. I know lots of great cops are family people that would never do these things.
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  Does that mean every cop's good or bad? No. We have to judge every person on their moral character.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  I'm, you know, somewhat friendly with the police chief of the Chicago Police Department, Gary McCarthy.
[45:44.000 --> 45:52.000]  Incredible man. Incredible man. I watch where he grieves over every situation because he's a man.
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.000]  He's a father. He cares. Does that mean, just because he puts on the uniform, does he mean he's a bad guy?
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  I mean, what about our soldiers? Are all our soldiers bad?
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  Absolutely not. This narrative that's spun out all of a sudden. Also, we got to be afraid of the soldiers.
[46:05.000 --> 46:12.000]  I'll take a soldier over anybody any day. Exactly. They've tried to dumb it down to the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  Judge people on their deeds and what they stand for, what you just said.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then if you don't support all the rioting or whatever, you support the First Amendment, but not rioting,
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  then you're bad. If you don't say kill the cops randomly, well, I don't want to be killed randomly.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  I don't want to see the blacks killed just because they're black or whites killed.
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  I mean, it just comes down to civilization and basic common sense.
[46:35.000 --> 46:43.000]  Now, Billy, let's talk about your album. We just downloaded it the other day from your site, smashingpumpkinsnexus.com.
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  I can't wait to listen to the whole thing. I'm not just saying this. I love all your albums and I really love your old stuff.
[46:48.000 --> 46:55.000]  This has a lot of the old sound, but even better lyrics. I think this is almost like classic Smashing Pumpkins 2.0.
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  Everybody should go there. How do people get the record?
[46:59.000 --> 47:08.000]  It's on all the typical Illuminati systems. It's easy to find. That's not the issue. But thank you so much for that.
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  Sure. I mean, it's in the stores. It's on CD. It's downloaded at iTunes.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  Folks can go find those links at smashingpumpkinsnexus.com.
[47:15.000 --> 47:22.000]  How do people support you? I guess they come to the big shows. They spread the word. I mean, how do they do that?
[47:22.000 --> 47:31.000]  You know, that's a difficult one because there is the commerce, which is important. But honestly, it's more the streetcashing.
[47:31.000 --> 47:39.000]  And that's what I'm saying is, if not me, please find artists that you support. Retweet them. Share them with your friends.
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.000]  The artists are the bulwark. There's a reason most totalitarian regimes kill the artists second.
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  Of course.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  They kill the weakest first, and then they go after the strongest, which are the artists because they are the X-factor.
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.000]  They are the voice and the wilderness that can point out the obvious. Like, hey, look at that over there.
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  And they can do it in a very clever way. If Jesus spoke in parables, so can we.
[48:05.000 --> 48:15.000]  And it's very powerful. Music, as you know, penetrates typical stuff, which is why I'm able to go to countries where people don't even speak English and play music and communicate.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  Music at the heart. And I'm blessed to, you know, 25 plus years here and going. Still, strong.
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  Billy Corgan.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  Stronger than ever.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  Billy Corgan is our guest, smashingpumpkinsnexus.com. Retweet that. Put it on Facebook, folks. The establishment's scared of him.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  And anybody the system's scared of, you better know we need to get behind because they promote terrorist groups. They fund Al Qaeda.
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.000]  They fund all these radical groups. They get caught funding the Klan. They get caught funding radical racist black groups.
[48:43.000 --> 48:55.000]  They want us all killing each other, just like one of the singers that, you know, he just mentioned from Jamaica said they want to see us go on killing one another top ranking.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  And that's, of course, Bob Marley. We're almost out of time. I'm going to let you go so you can get that plane or get on down the road, Billy.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  I hope you'll come down to Austin soon and come in studio. Maybe I'll come up and see in Chicago.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  But I really know your interviews here resonate with everybody.
[49:09.000 --> 49:17.000]  Again, one more time, the new album. Tell us what the name of the album means. Monuments to an elegy. What's that mean?
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  Oh, I don't know, Alex. These things come out of my brain sideways. I don't know.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, sounds cool. I just wondered if there was some inside baseball to that.
[49:26.000 --> 49:34.000]  You know, to me, it's a bit of a kind of a wave to what people thought the band was. And, you know, I'm just trying to move on into the future.
[49:34.000 --> 49:42.000]  And, you know, thankfully with people like you, new media, like you creating these new systems, I'm able to speak freely and speak to an audience
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  and just, you know, try to find like-minded souls. We have to build these new systems. You are.
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.000]  And I'm trying to do the same. You know, we have to build basically systems that are stronger than these systems of propaganda control.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  And we will. We will survive and we will be.
[49:57.000 --> 50:07.000]  Well, it's happening. And, you know, as you said, we need to support artists, whether it was in Nazi Germany or whether it was in any other humanitarian regime,
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  Pol Pot, Cameron Rouge, they would kill 95% of the artists, even ones that served them. They didn't like having them around.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  They were scared of them because that beauty, that touching people through music, through art, through images,
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  that communication of art types that artists have innately. You don't even know what you're doing. You just do it.
[50:23.000 --> 50:30.000]  And it reaches people. They are scared of that. And that's what the tyrants are, is little men behind the curtain who want to run the whole show
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  and really, I guess, don't feel loved or liked. They feel rejected, so they want to dominate.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  Billy, I'll say bye to you during the break. 20-second final comment.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Just God bless everyone. Just keep fighting. Keep the faith.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  I got to say, the new album is amazing. It sounds like old stuff you've done, but stuff I've never heard before.
[50:48.000 --> 50:59.000]  I mean, as you said, you've gone to the next level with the new album and a monument to L.A.G. available at SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[51:18.000 --> 51:35.000]  Your house is dark, vacant. You must be gone on vacation for a while. Thanks for all the jewelry.
[51:35.000 --> 51:43.000]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in. Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  Don't these people ever leave?
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  Starting at 24.95 and there's free shipping, go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store,

[52:58.000 --> 53:20.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[53:20.000 --> 53:46.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[53:46.000 --> 54:08.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[54:08.000 --> 54:37.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[54:37.000 --> 55:03.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[55:03.000 --> 55:32.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[55:32.000 --> 56:01.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[56:01.000 --> 56:30.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[56:30.000 --> 56:59.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[56:59.000 --> 57:28.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[57:28.000 --> 57:57.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[57:57.000 --> 58:26.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[58:26.000 --> 58:55.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[58:56.000 --> 59:25.000]  Go to faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store, faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[59:26.000 --> 59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  We are now into the second hour.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  William Benny is joining us coming up after the next break, former head of technology at the NSA.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  He was one of the directors of the NSA and we're going to really do something special here.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  He doesn't do a lot of interviews, does like the London Guardian, things like that.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  He's been on with the years truly twice, I think David Knight two or three other times and he's going to come on and give us the latest on the Panoptagon spy grid.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  He's going to come on and give us the latest on the police state and we're going to open the phones up then at the bottom of the hour for your concise focus please question directly to the biggest NSA whistleblower out there, way beyond Snowden.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  They tried to indict him, they tried to set him up, they tried to put him in jail, they failed and he has a lot of courage.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  William Benny who has been called even by Nightline the NSA's greatest code breaker ever.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  They've got movies out about breaking the German enigma code and stuff, true stories. This is one of those type of guys.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  This is the big brain guy and he's moral, he's at the NSA, he learns they're illegally spying on the citizens.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  He resigns in 2002, shortly after 9-11, keeps his mouth shut about it, tries to work internally through the Congress, never happens, starts going public.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  So this is a big deal. I know it's not pearls before swine when we have folks of this magnitude on the broadcast.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  This is a big, big deal and in fact guys, I want to get into some other issues.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  You guys pulled me, I know it's somewhere here in my stacks but I saw some more over the weekend where Google, Facebook and others are spying on the public for the government.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  There was an article about the British NSA spying on just workers to stop workplace violence.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Oh, we've got to spy on you all without warrants and violate the law so we stop any violence.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Everyone must live in a glass house to stop the violence.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  GCHQ to snoop through office emails and we'll go over all of this with William Benny coming up and then after he's gone we'll have open phones yet again
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  and I want to ask the listeners, what do we do about the Republican Party and the former President Bush, one and two, 41 and 43, running around saying how much they love Bill Clinton,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  this blue blood, Rockefeller Republican, traipsing arrogantly in our faces when there's a political realignment, can't we get rid of Jeb and Hillary in our political process?
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Do we have to look at them forever? Do we always have to have these people hanging on and now they've got their kids all getting ready to run for office or winning office?
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Just dynasties, that's what North Korea is, is an imperial hermit monarchy with a toddling soft third generation maggot feeding on tens of millions of people quite literally.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  So disconnected from reality thinks he's cool with Dennis Rodman visiting.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  This is the madness of turning government over to centralized systems, it is anathema to a free and open society.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Truly, truly, a pox on us all.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones, you can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones, see our Facebook and more at infowars.com.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  Please remember, they want this shut down, don't take it for granted, keep spreading the word, that's why we're reaching more people every day and I want to salute and thank you all, stay with us.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  For how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor dot com. Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  In 2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail, make this year different. By equipping yourself with oxypowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  Using super oxygenation, oxypowder, available through infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxypowder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Even infowarsnightly news director Rob Dew has been using oxypowder with incredible success.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Oxypowder flushes it out. Secure your oxypowder at infowarslife.com, as infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Pulled out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive infowarslife secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  In the last limited shipment of 2014, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  It's taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed. No needles, no injections. Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  And secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality vitamin B12.

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Activist on the tape goes on to suggest that discarded ballots could be collected from what she called ghetto aurora, saying that African Americans and Mexicans tend to throw out their ballots.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And as for those programs we do need, I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Thousands of federal workers are issued taxpayer-funded credit cards so long as they buy items that cost less than $3,000 or micro-purchases.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  Our review found about $20 billion. It's just about the course of a year.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  We'll save billions by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies faced here in D.C. for their micro-purchase shopping lists. And all, refute.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  The Independent Congressional Budget Office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington doesn't get its spending in check.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  Deciding to pay the price, not listening to advice, deciding in your view on the policy of truth.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells. Ebola is primed to be able to have respiratory transmission.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones. You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  William Benning, he's just four miles from Fort Mead, headquarters of the NSA, where he was the technical leader and director for intelligence with the NSA
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001 after more than 30 years with the agency. Benning has been described as one of the most prolific and best analysts and code breakers in NSA history.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  Benning continues to speak out about the NSA's illegal data collection policies and continues interviews in the media regarding his experiences and communications intercepts
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  by government agencies and American citizens. In a legal case, Benning has testified in an affidavit that the NSA is in deliberate violation of the U.S. Constitution.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Exposedfacts.org, whistleblower.org, and he's part of the government accountability movement, and we really appreciate him spending so much time with us.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  This is his, I guess, fifth visit with InfoWars, his third visit on this radio show. Remember, they would always say the NSA was not spying on American citizens.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  And talking to a lot of other whistleblowers and people from Wayne Madsen right through, for all intents and purposes, that was the case until 9-11.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  And Benning's testified to that. Now, they're listening and watching and controlling and grabbing almost everything. Now, it's totally illegal.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  And it's being used politically. They've been spying on Congress. It's just over the top. It's like living in a glass house.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  But then, oh, the group's doing it. They're totally secretive. So you go to jail for espionage if you go spy on the CIA or NSA.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  But if they do it, oh, well, it's okay. And I asked Mr. Benning what he wanted to get into first, and it's the fact that the courts have been rubber stamping this.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  I mean, there won't even be a need for courts soon with all this. And, you know, they've caught with parallel construction, these other agencies, like the DEA, creating fake investigations to claim they got evidence one way when they got it illegally another.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  And then these agencies have all been caught planting evidence physically at the crime lab at the FBI. We've had the former head of the crime lab on Dr. Whitehurst many times.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  He was getting back on, had been on years, to digital fingerprints being planted.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  So this is a tool of total social control in his words and that London Guardian headline.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  And William Benning joins us. I want him to get into the biggest threats, the breaking news, how private industry is part of this, ways we can try to stop this.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  And then I want to open the phones up. We'll give out a hashtag here in a few minutes where you can tweet at real Alex Jones on Twitter and you can then send your questions in.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  You can also read on air for William Benning, but I'll give the number out coming up in about 20 minutes. And that's your chance. We'd love to hear from you to call in with a quick question or comment for William Benning.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Exposedfacts.org, whistleblower.org. Again, thank you so much, Mr. Benning, for coming on the show.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Well, thank you for having me.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  You've got the floor. Get into what's happening with these judges.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Well, see, it's basically a continuation of what's happened in the Supreme Court.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  When the government gets boxed into a corner where they're threatened by the test of a constitutionality, if any of the programs they're running, they lie to the courts and the courts are letting them get away with it.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  For example, in Amnesty International versus Clapper, that case, that case was at the Supreme Court when the solicitor general lied to the court saying that, well, if any NSA data was going to be used against an individual, either in court or anywhere else,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  that the individual would be told so that they could contest the, basically, it's the right to contest discovery of information that is libelous or otherwise implying criminal activity on the part of the individual.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  But that was a lie. Nobody had been told.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  When we talked to the President's Civil Liberties Oversight Board several months ago, we talked about that and raised that issue, and they said, well, from now on, all of those, all the people where that data is being used will be told.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  Well, I mean, that right there, I mean, and we still have no guarantee that anybody, anywhere, has ever been told, and by the fact that they're giving us assurances, how can you trust them?
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  And after what they've been doing, lying to us outright, how can you trust what they're saying? You can't.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And so there's no real oversight in government. There's no checks and balances anymore. They don't work.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  And that's the fundamental problem with our government. Our whole process is failing us.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  The courts seem to be going along with it. That is, if I were on the Supreme Court and the Solicitor General did that to me and I found out about it, the first thing I would do would be to reinstate that case back in the court.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  I mean, after all, you don't permit perjury to let you get rid of a genuine concern of the public. I mean, that's what they're doing.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  They're allowing perjury by the government to determine what, in fact, is tested in the courts in terms of constitutionality. And that's, in my book, that is what treason is all about.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  You're fundamentally going after the foundations of this government and corrupting it. That, to me, is real treason.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  It certainly is treason. And now, if they're able to do this, then the sky's the limit. What comes next? I mean, it's just a total overthrow of our system. Please continue.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Well, I mean, that's the whole point. It's a total destruction of any of the rights you thought you had under the Constitution.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I mean, it's simply a matter of we no longer have a Constitution. And that's the real problem that I see. I think we need to stand up.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  I mean, I can't understand why these judges on these courts can actually look themselves in the eye when they shave in the morning.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  I mean, after all, they know what the law is. They should know. They know the Fourth Amendment says you don't have data.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  The government doesn't have data on a U.S. citizen unless you state the citizen's name, the date of your after, and also show a probable cause of why you're going at it and where you're going to get it.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Now, all that, none of that is happening with the hundreds of millions of U.S. citizens that they're collecting data on. None of that's happening.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Sure. And the argument is, well, we're doing this to stop bad guys. But the truth is...
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  Well, that's why I, too.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Well, well, exactly. They're using it to consolidate the takeover. Well, from your expert view, what is it really being used for, sir?
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  Well, it's being used to set up the way and means to control the population.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  I mean, I call NSA as a central repository of knowledge on the U.S. citizens and everybody else on the planet, by the way, for the U.S. government, all departments of the U.S. government.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  So I've been referring to it as the new Stasi Agency, because that's exactly what the Stasi did.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  They had files on everyone, and they had people spying on them right and left.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  Now, even your neighbors would spy on you. Well, that's what's happening internally in NSA now.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  They're talking about having people, if you see something, say something.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  That's the kind of thing they're talking about internally in NSA now.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  Well, I mean, you know, that's the Stasi in states.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  I mean, Tom Drake was over in Germany a year or two ago, and he met up with an older German couple, and they said to him, they said, well, you know, we, the Germans, we are a post-Fascist state, and we know it.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  But you are, in fact, a pre-Fascist state, and don't even know that.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  So, I mean, the point is, we have to wake up here.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  What do you do, though, when you're faced with true tyranny?
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  This is classical tyranny, not just with the warrantless, ubiquitous, omnipresent spy grid,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  but the fact that major corporations have lined up to seamlessly trojan-horse surveillance into every device, into our cars,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  taxed by the miles coming out, all the smart meters spying, all the new appliances,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  with the former CIA director bragging that your washing machine, you know, will listen to you.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  This is already going on, and it's becoming ubiquitous, and then it's being used illegally, and it's being used to rig markets, rig the stock market.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  I mean, this is really a 21st-century takeover.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  Yes, it is, and that's something that we need to all stand up and object to.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  I mean, if we don't, it's going to happen to us.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  If you don't stand up, it's like the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Well, if you don't become the squeaky wheel, you don't get satisfaction anywhere.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Certainly not in our, you can't really call what we have now a clear democracy,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  because after all, it's more like a police state.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  William Benny, a former director and leader for intelligence with the NSA,
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  joins us, the biggest whistleblower in NSA history, hands down.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  But he's just giving you the general view of none of the classified stuff here.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Even though they've tried to put him in jail, we'll talk some about that.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  We'll also get his view on what he thinks the culture is like inside these agencies that are illegally doing it.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  What's the morale like at the NSA and beyond with William Benny?
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.

[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.

[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  A major director of the NSA here with us today.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  So there are good people from the system telling the truth.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  There are so many, but mainstream media tries to ignore them
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  or vilify them or demonize them.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  I want to talk about the morale at the NSA.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Listeners can tweet at hashtag NSA insider,
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  capitalize NSA and then lower caps insider, hashtag NSA insider.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  For your questions, those are coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  Toll free number to join us.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Your chance to talk to a very honorable person in my view
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  who has a lot of courage and sacrificed their career to try to defend our republic.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  And who worked at the NSA trying to defend us from foreign enemies.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Which is what it was set up for.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  William, what about the morale at the NSA from your view
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  and what about your former colleagues?
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  What are they saying to you? A, and then B,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  tell folks a little bit about the persecution you've gone through
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  just to understand the level of tyranny we're dealing with.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Well, I think I don't talk directly to anybody that works at NSA still
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  simply because if I did, you know, I'm a target I have been for quite a while
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  so they would of course be targeted by the FBI and interrogated
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  by FBI and internal security at NSA.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  So I don't do that to them.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  But I know that they instituted programs that get agency employees to spy on one another
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  which simply means that it's just like East Germany.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I mean, your neighbors are spying on you
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  and here at your neighbors you're working with and trying to do the job.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  That's a very hostile environment.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  You're basically shaking the trust of individuals
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  that are trying to do a job internally in the government.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  I mean, that makes a very unhealthy atmosphere to work in.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  I mean, that's simply unproductive.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  It destroys initiative and so on
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  because nobody wants to do anything for fear that somebody will think it's something wrong
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  and so they'll get informed on and be interrogated.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  That's the way it was in East Germany.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That's why their whole society stagnated.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  So that's the real counterproductive process for them to set up.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  And I know internally that people from who have retired from NSA
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  come through the retirement chain.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  We get the word back from them saying basically that there's an awful lot of people there
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  who are kind of upset at what they're doing at spying on domestically
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  but they're so afraid to do anything because they've looked at what they've done to us
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  which gets into your follow-on point there.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  In order to try to silence anybody from objecting internally in NSA,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  what they did was they threatened us with persecution and up to 35 years in jail
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  using the 1917 Espionage Act,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  which we at that time were simply, we were all staying at the point.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  The only one who was outside the government complaining about it was Tom Drake
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  and he was talking to the Baltimore Sun but he didn't release anything classified
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  and that was agreed to by the government in court.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  So they were really coming after us just to shut us down
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  from exposing the corruption, fraud, waste, abuse that was going on
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  as well as all of the unconstitutional activity.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  They used the FBI first to raid us and take all our property
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  and threaten us with guns, some of us directly.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  The follow-on was the Department of Justice used all their power
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  to try to indict us and put us in jail
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  so that we would be out of sight and out of mind permanently, so to speak.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Literal political prisoners, and of course you describe,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  you talk about being raided at gunpoint, what was that like?
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  It's really strange to be coming out of your shower in the morning
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  and have somebody pointing a gun at you so you look at the end of a barrel of a pistol
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  as you're coming out of the shower having no idea why they're doing this to you.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  After all, we were trying to work within the government all the way up to then
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  but they just didn't want us doing it, that's all.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  It was just too embarrassing.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  They didn't want anybody in government to know what they were doing
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  and that's important too because that gets back to checks and balances now.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  If that's the case, how can any part of government check any other part of government?
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  They can't.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  That's right, you're doing your job as one of the top code breakers in history,
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  running the NSA, you leave honorably, try to work to the government
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  and then their answer is to send a SWAT team to your house to intimidate you.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  If this isn't oppression, I don't know what is, but the good news is it's coming out.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  William Benny's our guest.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Your questions from Twitter at Real Alex Jones and your phone calls straight ahead,
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  long segment coming up.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  What an incredibly honorable good man.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  We need more liking, don't we?
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  The next level in cleansing the body naturally.

[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  12 pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  And I've been able to keep it off too.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good and I'm like, I know, I guess it's this oxy powder.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  2015 can be different.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  Oxy powder flushes it out.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  Secure your oxy powder at InfowarsLife.com.

[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  Analysis. Infowars building independent media operation.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  You got to set your eye on the enemy.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Get electrically. It's begun. You can fail it.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Just might get it.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  When your crown king nothing, it all crashes down.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Historically, we know what happens time and time again.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Society stagnate.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  The spy grids are used to start persecuting people.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  And the society devolves into something like North Korea.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  And we see that now happening here.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  And no one is safe.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Whether they beat Chalcescu of Romania or Joe Stalin.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Centralized systems are incredibly dangerous and unstable.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  They sit on one leg.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  We're going to go back to William Benny.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  I've got a bunch of Twitter questions from real Alex Jones
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  at hashtag NSA Insider.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  And loaded phone lines with Michael, Peter, Dominic, Julio, Joseph, and many others
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  that are patiently holding.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  Before we go back to our guests, please remember we are not funded
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  like a lot of mainstream media through government bailouts
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  and banker bailouts or NPR, you know, getting taxpayer money.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  We're funded by listeners like you, supporting our local M&F and affiliates,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  spreading the word, supporting our sponsors.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  And we self-fund, selling high-quality, pro-liberty, Made in America apparel,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  Molan Labé, come and take it back in stock, the long-sleeve camo that is so popular,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  though some sizes are already selling out again.

[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  If you order this week, we can get it to you basically anywhere in the world
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  where UPS or USPS ships or to Alaska or Hawaii.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  But get your Christmas or holiday orders in and these are high-quality products,
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  whether it's a Molan Labé ball cap or high-quality Silver Bullet colloidal silver
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  or whether it's the nation high-quality iodine that so many people are deficient in.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  It's all available at infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  But get the Molan Labé belt buckles and Silver Coins while you can
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  because these are all limited edition, 500 each, and once it sells out, we never sell them again.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  We've already had one series of Molan Labé belt buckles.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  This is the second series. We'll have one more and then that will be it for at least a couple years
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  before we even have a new design.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  Like I said, we had the Joker shirt and would bring it back. Never did.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  William Benning, I want to go to these calls.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  I want to have you be able to speak to any topic you wish.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  But to imagine you with all these commendations and medals you have,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  you know, called by Nightline and other operations,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  the most successful code breakers and scientists ever helping defend this country against the Soviets
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  and terror groups and many others.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  What is it like when you got raided, go back to that and describe the persecution that goes on
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  when you weren't even going public at that time to try to basically imply that you were a bad guy
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  so they could disappear you down the road?
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  I mean, if they can get William Benning, they can go after anybody
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  and then I want to get your view on Snowden
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  and he says that a revelation is coming out that would bring down the political system
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  or he said, be careful, I have a revelation that would bring you down.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Well, what type of revelation could that be?
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  William Benning.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  Well, he may simply be talking about, like for example,
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  the CIA was spying on Feinstein's intelligence committee when they were preparing that report on terror.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  The report she's trying to get out here recently,
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  I think if they look a little closer, they'll find out that that spying is much more extensive than they even think.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  So in other words, I think if they look fairly closely,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  Russ Tice has said this for several years now that they have been spying on senators, House of Representatives,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  judges of the Supreme Court, even in the White House and also generals and other federal judges and so on.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  So they're spying, the spying network that we've created inside this country
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  is actually spying on the leadership of this country, the ones that have power over them
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  so that they know what their position is and can adjust accordingly and prepare for it.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  I mean, they're spying on everybody, our leadership in this country as well as everybody else on the planet.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  So this is an uncontrollable, these are uncontrollable agencies.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  They have no way of verifying anything they're doing and they let them continue that way
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  when in fact they should all stand up.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  The problem is you don't know, and they don't know, the House of Representatives and senators,
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  they don't know what kind of evidence the intelligence community has accumulated about them and their activities.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Is it something like J. Edgar Hoover had over the entire Congress?
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  He used that power too and it was actually the power he had,
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  wasn't that he may not have known anything about you but you may think he did
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  and that gave him power over you.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  But he certainly knew a lot about the leadership in Washington.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Well, we also know those files were a form of internal governmental defamation and slander and libel
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  because they were also filled with disinformation and garbage and that goes to my next question.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  What about the problem of planted data through the system?
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  I mean, we know that goes on.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  Well, I mean, yes, that plus in our case, at least in the cases that we had,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  we knew they were fabricating data and in Tom Drake's case when they indicted him,
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  the data that they had there was fabricated.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  It was retroactively classified and then he was charged for having classified material.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  Well, I mean, that's like framing him.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  I mean, that's a felony and these people should go to jail for that.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  Even Thomas Tamm back in 2003 when he was the lawyer in the Department of Justice that was the source of the New York Times article on warrantless wiretapping.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  And when he was, his job at the Department of Justice was to prepare the warrant request for the FISA court, the secret court.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  And so when he was going through that, he was discovering that they had wiretaps already on people that they hadn't gone through the FISA court to get.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Well, that by definition or by law at the time was a violation of the federal felony.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  In other words, if you didn't have a FISA approved warrant to get a wiretap on a U.S. citizen for the intelligence community,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  then you in fact were committing a federal felony and they were doing that by the thousands.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  It never got in trouble.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  Wasn't that really part of a larger parallel construction where they only go get the warrant later once they want to go back and claim that they got the information with the warrant?
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  Yeah, that was all part of that.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  And that had been going on since at least 2001, since after 9-11.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  And Director Mueller of the FBI said they were using that program, Stellar Wind, which is the domestic spying program.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  He said they were using it since 9-11 in 2001, which is October, which is when they created that, the name Stellar Wind.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  William Bennett, top NSA whistleblowers, our guest.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  I mean, I'm just a layperson, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  A, when you start snooping on everybody, you create giant troughs of information that could be stolen, hacked, or taken.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  B, you're focusing on so much that you miss the real threats that are specific and can be tracked and focused in on.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  So you blind yourself in a way having too much data.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  It's like having a billion phone messages. You can't listen to any of them, basically.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  And then C, and I think this is probably the most important, it creates a whole system of blackmail domestically and will convert you to a tyranny.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  So it's like suicide.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  I mean, what did Congress think?
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  It's already come out for decades.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  They use the NSA, the British NSA GCHQ to spy on parliament.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  And now they're using all this data on each other.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  And it just, I mean, why would the political elite create such a thing and think that they could control it?
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  And the point is that what it means is you're giving all this knowledge and power to a set of individuals that aren't controlled.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  And they're sooner or later, they use it.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  I mean, that's just human nature to have that happen.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  So, I mean, you know, it's only a matter of time, like you say, is to when, how long it's going to take them to take advantage of all the data they've gotten.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  So, I mean, it's just a very bad situation and a very bad path that we've chosen to take here down the dark side with Dick Cheney.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  Sometimes you got to work on the dark side to quote Dick Cheney.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Yeah.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  In fact, guys, find that clip if you can. Well, that's what's so crazy about this information's power.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  And they've taught so many people in public school and in colleges and TV that, oh, if you don't have anything to hide, don't worry about it.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  Well, why not have a glass house?
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  Why not leave your codes to your computer out publicly?
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  No, we all know that bad people will take advantage of that information.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  Well, it's the same thing with government or corporations.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  What about corporations?
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  I see them almost as a bigger threat now because they're all in a race with government to be the ultimate spy.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  I mean, isn't Google really the ultimate spy in the final equation?
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  I think part of the problem with their mining of Gmail is getting close to what the government's doing.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  But they don't have the resources to see that part of the problem is that Google doesn't have all the data access that NSA does, for example.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  NSA can get into any business activity like banking or travel or anything like that.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  And Google doesn't really have access to all of that.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  It also doesn't have access to all the emails.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  They have a good number, but they don't have all of them.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  And they don't also have the cooperation of other companies around the world and corporations to give them the wiretaps to get the transactional relationships between people.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  It's not all of it anyway. I mean, they certainly have a great deal of it, but it's not to the degree that government is.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  So government brings it all together and in the darkness binds it?
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  Right.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  And the point is that Google and companies do not have the power that government does when it comes to arresting people or putting them in jail or fabricating evidence or framing them like they've tried to do to us.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  So, I mean, there's quite a bit of difference between government and at least in terms of power and capability.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  I want to go to some phone calls for William Benny here and also go through this huge list of Twitter questions that we have.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in Texas.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Joseph, you're on the air with William Benny.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  Hi.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  I wanted to call in and talk to you guys about, I'm a hairdresser in Dallas and I had a client for a little while this year who was a, he was a VP for the manufacturer that created the MSA Center in Utah.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  And he gave me a lot of, you know, he told me as much as I guess he could about when they were building it and about this data center.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  And I also have another friend of mine who just recently met, he works with AT&T on the neural networks collecting the data.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  So, I wanted to ask some questions and just see if, you know, I get an answer from him.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  I was basically told just that the MSA data center, you know, that was that, you know, they were spying on, you know, everything from our cell phones to our banks, everything connecting at all.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  You know, and after I heard that, I actually heard a documentary with, you know, from, it's like the operations fellow wind documentary.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  And I just wanted to hear about that.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Mr. Benny.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  Yeah, that's the, that's the whole point of why they had to build Bluffdale with all that storage.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  I mean, it wasn't for metadata, it was for content of communications, you know, like all of your emails and phone conversation recordings and transcripts and things like that.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  The point is, if you wanted to, if you wanted to put together all of the relationships of everybody in the world on metadata relationships and build those kind of what they're called graphs or simply social networks of everybody in every domain,
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  phone calls, emails, banking, all of that, then you could do that and store it in a room 20 foot by 40 foot.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  That's all it would take to store all of the relationships and all the domains of everybody in the world.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  So, and you could keep it there for, I mean, you know, 50 years, perhaps, something like that.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  And so the real point was the hundreds of thousands of square feet of storage was needed for the content and that's where the bulk of data is.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  That's where the bulk of information is and that's what it, that's what takes an awful lot of storage up.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  The rest of it is not, doesn't take that much storage.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  That's right.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  In Utah and Texas, that's a key point when they lie and say we're just keeping metadata.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  They consider everything to be metadata.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  It's a lawyer's game they're playing.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Thank you, Joseph.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  Let's talk to Dominique in California.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  You're on the air.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Hey there, William.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  I got a question about who they're kind of watching now.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  Video taped a jet laying some geoengineering trails out the other day and some webs started falling from the trail.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  And I got it all on tape and I got a lot of samples of these webs falling from the sky.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  And my question is, are they monitoring geoengineering activists such as myself?
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  Because I've been telling a lot of people about this and trying to get the word out there.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  I'm kind of getting a little worried.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  I don't think you heard him.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  Everything's being recorded and monitored.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  And now I don't think they mind that it's out as a chilling effect.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  It's illegal what they're doing.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  We need to stop it, but it doesn't intimidate me and doesn't shut down my speech.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  William Binney, do you have any information?
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  Thank you, Dominique.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  Do you have any information on geoengineering climate manipulation?
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  Well, I would think that that's one of the things there.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  They're certainly monitoring all kinds of research done around the world.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  For example, one of the best ways to find out who's working on quantum computing is to, for example,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  go to a quantum computing conference around the world and just go around and collect business cards.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  And you find that that sets up a community and then you work the transactional relationships you're getting across the network
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  to build their social network of who they're working with to work on quantum computing.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  And I'm sure they would do the same thing for any kind of climate alterations and so on.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  I mean, any kind of serious research that's going on that would have implications on a wider scale,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  they certainly would be monitoring just to watch to make sure they knew what was happening.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  Let's go to Julio in Wyoming.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  Merry Christmas to you all. It's funny, Mr. Benny.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  You mentioned about collecting business cards and going to those conferences that caller that mentioned geoengineering.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  That's what I've done, Mr. Benny.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  I've gone to these conferences, collected business cards, spoke to people in geoengineering,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  and I agree people need to do that.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  I want to mention this document briefly before I get to my question.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  I think it's cute.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  The NSA is trying to attract children through their Change the World program, which includes solving fun puzzles
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  and exploring the world of cryptology.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  I think that's kind of cute with the Change the World program.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  You mentioned about blackmail.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  It's quite clear bureaucracies and totalitarian agencies like the NSA are using blackmail to their advantage.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  My question is, how deep does that rabbit hole go?
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  I spoke to someone who's a contractor in Colorado Springs last week who told me there's a lot of movement from these types of agencies
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  moving towards Colorado Springs and other parts of the way.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  Sure. That's where the alternate government's based.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Thank you for the call.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  That's a lot of questions there.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Blackmail, you already spoke to that, but what else can you tell us about blackmail, William Benny?
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  The problem, of course, is that once you have all that data, that's the power that that data gives you.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  Let me use an example.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  I was on the Elliott Spitzer show on current TV when he was on the show there.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  He never told me this, but I've been inferenced to him.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  He was after the bankers after the 2008 banking fiasco.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  A lot of people lost a lot of money there, and that was because of fraudulent solicitations by the banks,
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  passing around packaged mortgage groups and things like that.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  He was going after them criminally.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  He was, I think, the governor of New York State at the time.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  As a part of that, all of a sudden the FBI was going through all of his emails and my financial transactions and so on.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  They found where he was engaged with the prostitute, and they used that to get rid of him.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  The point is that the FBI didn't even show probable cause to why they were doing it.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  The probable cause was they wanted him stopping.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  They didn't want him criminally prosecuting the bankers in Wall Street.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  That's what the whole motive was.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  The people who did that, Mueller was the director of FBI at the time, and Alexander was the director of NSA.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  The FBI went into the database of emails that Mueller testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had access to.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Back in March 30, 2011, he testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had access to this database where he could make a query
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  and get all past and future emails as they came in on a person.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  When the FBI goes into all of his back emails looking at data, for example, against the Petraeus,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  I mean, L.A. Spitzer to get rid of him, then they were the ones who helped the bankers out to keep them out of trouble.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  Then you have Mueller and Alexander after they retire, and they're selling their expertise in cybersecurity,
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  and who are they selling it to at the rate of $600,000 a month or something like that.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Originally, it started at a million, but now they're selling that to, I believe, the last I heard it was the bankers.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Well, to me, when I took contract law under government, one of the first things you made sure you did not do
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  was to give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  Now, that sure smells like a conflict of interest.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  Sure, you've got a select group of banks to control the Federal Reserve that already issue and control the currency.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  Now they're using the NSA that they help government build to domestically target everybody, steal data, corner the markets,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  and just take everything over.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Get rid of people that were trying to hold you accountable.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  It's a criminal takeover. There's no debating it.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  Ex-Zach Camount asks, that's his Twitter name, ask William Benny, what does Mr. Benny think about people waking up to spying, but also the smart TVs that,
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  for those that don't know, Samsung admits that they, quote, record what you say in your house and send it to third parties for, quote, marketing.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  What do you think of just the mainlining of total spying?
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  I mean, for me, that is an intrusion, an unauthorized intrusion, and it's a felony, and they should be charged criminally with it.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  Kavik on Twitter asks, how closely does Canada's CSE work with the NSA, or is it more a data sharing agreement?
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  Actually, this has been documented. It's in some of the documentation that Snowden had provided and has been published.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  They are basically the, it's an outgrowth of the World War II effort of the English-speaking countries.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  That's the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Now, the U.S. is called first party and the other four are called second party.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  That was the closest relationship in history in World War II.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  The most common, they work together, jointly, on breaking enigma codes and also the Japanese purple code and the JN-25 naval code.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  And those relationships only expanded from there, and the cooperation has been very close.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  It's the closest cooperating group of countries in the world.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  Mikhail Thalen, infowars.com, writer at Mikhail Thalen on Twitter, asks, others have mentioned power struggle between the NSA and other intel groups, such as the CIA.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  Can you expand on that, hashtag NSA Insider?
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  Yeah, there always was. I mean, even before 9-11, I mean, that was part of the, I think the 9-11 Commission's report was they need to work a little closer and be a little less rivalry.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  They can reduce the rivalry. The point is that there are certain charters that these agencies have, like the CIAs, to do human NSAs, to do signals intelligence, and they jealously guard their charters.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  And if they come up with information in their areas, that's like knowledge they have, that they can directly provide to senior leadership, the president, and so on, for decision making.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  So that makes them, that gives them the sense that they have greater influence in the government and what it does and what the president would decide to do by being able to control or to have the most significant intelligence information to present.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  So that creates a rivalry between the agencies, and that's been going on for decades. I mean, that's nothing new.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  The CIA does it, NSA does it, they all do it, so to a certain degree. And that was part of the problem at the 9-11 Commission.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  So, you know, yeah, certainly an issue, a rivalry between these agencies is one that destroys some of the capabilities that they should have in terms of sharing knowledge so that everybody can be leveraging the same set of information.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  William Binney, we have another question for you from Twitter. FW Partica asks, how would you change the NSA so it would be a positive department?
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  First of all, I mean, we submitted 21 recommendations to the president of the United States in January this year. It's an open letter, it's on the web. And those recommendations, the two primary points in those recommendations, one was to do, to force NSA to make a directed selection of information on known targets and things in a zone of suspicion defined around it.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  So that would mean that they would only pull in maybe, they would let 99.99999% of the data pass by and only pull out and store that data that was relevant to targets that they were after.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  I'm going to blow up the Eiffel Tower, that would be grabbed.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  That would focus them in on their targets and that would make a rich environment for their analysts to succeed and we would actually be able to stop things like the Boston bombing or even 9-11. I mean, they had all the data to stop 9-11.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  William, you've been so gracious giving us 50 something minutes. Let me talk to you during this break and see if you can stay a little bit longer to finish that statement and take a few more calls. I don't want to put you on the spot, but can you stay with us?
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  Yeah, sure I can.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  Unbelievable. Third hour coming up.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  Welcome to GCNLive.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:51.000]  Welcome to GCNLive.
[01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will. We've got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies if we're going to be successful.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  That's the world these folks operate in and so it's going to be vital for us to use any means that are disposable, a disposal, basically, to achieve our objective.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  It's bigger than it's ever been and it's renamed ISIS and our own government funded it and William Benny was beginning to get into 9-11 and I've had Colonel Schaefer on, I've had C. Bell Edmonds on, I've had the translators, the colonels.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  I've had so many angles of this covering classified and unclassified information and leaked information that we know they knew about 9-11 and bare minimum stood down. Six of the 10 commissioners have said that. William Benny, without giving out any classified information, obviously, what can you tell us about 9-11?
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  Well, it's more like after we left NSA because of the domestic spying way. Tom Drake, who was still there working, ran a program we were developing on the entire database in NSA and he found all the data that was necessary to stop 9-11 in their databases prior to 9-11,
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  which simply meant, very simply put, that they could easily have stopped 9-11 if they were doing smart things. But what was driving them at the time? Well, it was a matter of getting more and more money and building a bigger budget and that's really what their emphasis was on.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  So they weren't trying to do smart things, they were trying to do things that would build their empire. And that to me is why I keep saying every time I give a talk anywhere, I keep saying they traded the security of the people of the United States and of the world for money.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  And I guess when you make multi-million dollar purchases from big tech firms for their supercomputers and fiber optic and cables and you end up getting nice president jobs a few years later with that revolving door, it just turns into a giant boondoggle.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  Yeah, that's that incestuous relationship that exists between government officials and private industry. That close relationship building between them so that they can move from one senior executive job in government to a senior executive job in industry.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  What do you think about moves to cut off electricity and the water supply in Utah to the data center?
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  Well, I mean, they could certainly try to do that, but I would think that they would call up the National Guard, nationalize things and go in and make sure that they could continue to keep the power going.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  To me, the more important way to attack this problem is to go after them legally by the voting and by getting rid of them and firing their worthless personages from Congress.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  Well, you would think that there would be rolling this back with all the lies coming out that they were deceptive and they're using it against Congress, but instead, like you said, they're just getting the courts lined up to legalize it.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Right, and they're feeling more confident because some of the judges are getting behind them and backing it.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  And I think that's through fear as well.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Right. You never know what kind of blackmail they have on those judges because of the collection of data they've got.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  The word is, is that Justice Roberts was being blackmailed on the Obamacare situation.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  Yeah, well, that could be. I mean, after all, he changed it from a penalty to a tax, and that's changing the law.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  And he should have thrown that back to Congress for the Congress to fix that, not the court.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  The fix is in. Wow. Final segment with William Benning, a ton of Twitter questions and your calls. Michael, Peter, Shane, Anthony, Jay, your calls straight ahead for William Benning.

[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  It's our final segment with top NSA whistleblower William Benning.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  They tried to charge him, they swat team rated him, you name it.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  When he was just trying to quietly, legally work through the federal government and Congress to try to stop the illegal spying,
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  they instead tried to throw him in prison for it and many others.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  It's a testament that we've still got some justice in the court systems, but not much, that he and others have escaped prison. Others haven't.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  They've been trying to put journalists in jail that talk to somebody at the Defense Department at a press conference about North Korea.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  And they say, well, we don't want you getting the opinion that we don't think or we do think they have nukes.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  We're going to arrest you.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  I mean, this is really a major power grab and who would want to do this to our country?
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  Who would want to do this to our children?
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  Who really wants to do this?
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  They are using the NSA and other agencies to target the general public.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  It's a weird feeling when I went to cover Bilderberg and they had plain clothes marines threatening us, flipping us off, pulling dirty tricks on us.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  And it later came out and was confirmed that their diplomatic security corps was there.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  They saw us as the enemy.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  They had been trained, the marines, officers, officers all, some of them like 45 years old, to harass peaceful journalists that they knew were peaceful.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  This is the government we built and paid for being turned against us and the press is being persecuted.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  It's clear where this is going.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  We're not troublemakers up here just saying, oh, come on.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  It's all been proven.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  William Benning, before we take some final calls, what do you think hurts the NSA most?
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  Because the fact that they lied and denied they were spying on citizens and non-terror-related cases and the fact that it's now come out.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  I mean, is that the biggest blow to the NSA and where do you think this fight's going?
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  Actually, I don't think it's, in the long run, I don't think it's been a blow to them. I think they got it to the point where they simply don't care what the public thinks.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  It's the arrogance of power.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  Hubers.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Yeah, and so I don't think they really care.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  I mean, the one thing that could really hurt them is cutting their financial money, cutting the budget that they have.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  That is the thing that would hurt them.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  That's why they got so nervous about representatives.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  They, in Washington, conures their coalition group to unfund, and as they flashed July, I mean, I don't think I told you this on the programs before,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  but I was scheduled to brief that coalition prior to them voting on unfunding NSA.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  And when they posted that on the congressional record that I was coming down there to testify to them,
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  what happened was that President Obama called a meeting of all the members of the House, all the House Democratic members at the same time,
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  so that basically killed that meeting.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  And so that was delayed, but we never rescheduled.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  So they never got, and then they had the vote on it, and they lost the vote because of lobbying by the president and also General Alexander.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  Heavy lobbying to try to stop it.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  They lost by 12 votes.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  But that was pretty good from a first cut.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  I mean, the basic motivation that started all this was the fact that they began to realize that they weren't being told the truth by the intelligence committees
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  or by the agencies or by the White House so that they were being lied to all along.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Because it's illegal.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  Yes.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  So simple.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  Let's talk to Michael in Ohio.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  You're on the air.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  Hi, I think there might have been a mistake there. I'm actually calling from FEMA Region 5, but I just kind of wanted to talk to Mr.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  Benny about what he thought about the racial divide that they're bringing up to kind of distract us from what's going on with the NSA.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  That's a great point.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  We're all having our rights to privacy taken.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  And meanwhile, you take the only issue in the world is race.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  William Benny.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  It's a standard thing that a dictator does when you are having internal problems in your country, you create an external threat.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  So in this case, what they're doing is creating other threats or other conflicts to deflect the interest and focus away from core issues that are fundamental to everything we do.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Absolutely right about that.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  Anything else, Michael?
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  Yeah, I think it's funny that the issues like Ebola and ISIS have also been kind of swept under the rug and no one wants to focus on that.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  But they sure want to focus on the race issue of what exactly what they want us to focus on.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  Thank you, Michael.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  Peter in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  Yes, I have a question I know it's about before your time, but what do you think of Alan Dulles? Do you know anything about or heard anything about him with regard to how whether he was not so bad or really bad and so forth?
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  No, I didn't know anything about him or when he was in office, I wasn't aware of what he was doing.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  All right, Peter, appreciate your call.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  Let's talk to Anthony in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  Hello?
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  I got a question for Mr. Benny.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  Has it been possible for a long time that the NSA has the capability and technology to actually watch, for example, somebody walking down a street?
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  Sir, let me tell you, since you're hesitating, they have satellites with infrared and other things can track people in real time.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  They're tied into a lot of the cameras nationwide that have face scanning software on them.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  That's all admitted.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  They're getting ready to get attacked by the mile using these systems.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  What is your specific question?
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Oh, like the NSA for a long time has had the capability to actually see people even before the decades.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  Wow, that's amazing.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  Anthony, please elaborate on that to Mr. Benny.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  Well, I mean, it's like the overhead photography, that kind of thing.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  You've seen those pictures.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  I mean, you can see they've had that capability for decades.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  I mean, that's how you watch things on the earth.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  That's how the photo interpreters are at the National Photographic Centers.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  The National Center used to be called NTIK. I can't remember what it was called right now.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  But there's another agency that handles photography.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  They've been doing that for decades.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  Space Command and all of it.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  But they couldn't see for two weeks Al Qaeda, renamed ISIS, pouring in out of Syria in long convoys.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  They couldn't stop that, but they'll go arrest some teenager on Twitter that makes a threat.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Don't worry.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  Don't worry.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  Did you see the case where supposedly the NSA called a high school to tell the school to start watching one of the kids?
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  No, I didn't.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  But, you know, see, this has been my major contention that the domestic spying, the reason they're doing it is not because of terrorism.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  It's because it's for law enforcement and internal security, domestic security.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  That's what they're doing it for.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  That gives them, see, when they look around after 9-11, they have to look around for a customer set.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  What would be the biggest customer set they could go in for?
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  That would be law enforcement because it involves local law enforcement, state and federal law enforcement everywhere, as well as all around the world with other law enforcement.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  And then you set up threat fusion centers where you slowly see which cops will go along with illegal spying and then you recruit them in.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  Last year, I was at Barton Springs, a big public natural spring.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  There were three cops, well, three male cops and three female cops.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  I think they were all police or in criminal justice.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  They were all laying out, talking about how they were going back to get more courses because two of them already worked at the NSA center in San Antonio and all the rest of them wanted jobs there and how great it was and how powerful they were.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  And that's what's crazy.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  It's how these people just brag about what they're involved in and are just so undisciplined on top of it.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  It's just really pathetic.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  And then back last year in August, I think it was, Reuters published that article about the Parallel Construction and they did an interview with one of the federal agents involved in looking at the NSA data and doing parallel constructions and things like that.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  And he said, this is such a great program.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  I just hope we can keep it secret.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  Isn't that cute?
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  Yeah, that's our secret government and operation.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  How about I come to their house and watch them in bed and read their email?
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  No, they don't freak out.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  These people are sick.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  I mean, something's wrong with them.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  Let's talk to Shane in Michigan.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  You're on the air.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  Go ahead.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  Mr. Binney, you mentioned that the NSA might come in with the National Guard to nationalize resources in Utah if that state turns off the water.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  My question is, does this mean that the NSA is, in fact, reliant on resources that are provided at the state and local levels and that if we can't get the Congress to do anything, this might be a last ditch effort to put a choke hold on them and stop what they're doing?
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  Yeah, but I would not advocate that.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  I mean, I would advocate hitting your state and local government employees and making sure that they stand up and resist this and also hit all your people representatives in Congress.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  And then if they don't start going along, we need to have a unified effort to fire them, get rid of them.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  That's right.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  I mean, I'm not normally for just standard civil disobedience, and I agree with what Mr. Binney's saying in general, but the state triggering a constitutional crisis,
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  blocking water, cutting off electricity, force the National Guard in to restore the water and the power to draw attention to it.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  I think these are the type of stunts we need to start seeing be pulled.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  I think the state government could do that, but I wouldn't advocate individuals.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  No, no, no.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  We don't want to be put on a terrorist list.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  And they'll call it terrorism.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  In fact, they might even bomb themselves and look like victims, false flags.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  The sky's the limit, but this has gone too far.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  It is time to have state governments peacefully start moving with injunctions and kind of like Texas is suing over Obamacare with 17 other states.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  Yeah, right.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  It's time to say no.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  Or like I think we talked about in an earlier program that they could have a constitutional convention where the states would hold it and keep everybody in D.C. out of it and then modify the Constitution and operate from that.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  Sure.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  Is it fair to say we now have a rogue federal government?
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  Yes.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  In my view, that's exactly what we have.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  Yeah, it's like you come back from being on vacation.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  Your employees have changed the locks.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  They're telling you that it's their business, their house, and they have no legal standing, but they got a bunch of guns.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  Yep.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  And they're just staring at us, telling us we're terrorists.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  And then we don't confront them.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  We go home and try to figure out how to be peaceful.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  And then they send a SWAT team to our home and get us out of the shower.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  That's right.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  That's what happened to you.
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:08.000]  I mean, it's just, it's craziness.
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  And now John Corzine and Goldman Sachs can take billions out of bank accounts and not give it back and MF Global and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  I mean, it's just, we're in trouble, people.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  They are out of control.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  And historically, that means they'll just power grab and power grab until everything starts collapsing.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  Jay, in California, you only got a few minutes left with our guest.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  Jay, thanks for calling.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  You're on the air with William Benny.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  Yeah, I'll be real brief, Mr. Benny.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  I just had to dish out a little bit of gratitude to yourself and obviously Alex Jones for bringing up this kind of stuff in this media operation for years and exposing kind of what's going on.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  And now it seems that it's an agreement.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  It's the consensus among the republic, among the public in this republic that we're being spied on illegally, that these judges are being, you know, basically with inside baseball blackmailed into changing laws and the rest of it.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  And I was just curious what you would advise people.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  And I know I'm not asking just for myself.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  I'm asking on behalf of others that I talked to that don't feel that there's real government.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  We can all agree it's a real government.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  We don't believe it can be put back together.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  Don't think it's broken and can't be put back together again.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  What would you say about that?
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  Well, I would say that there are ways we have some ways to try to help save and salvage our country.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  And one of the primary ways is to get active in politics and stand up and make sure you're, if you're going to elect somebody as a representative that they stand up and defend the constitution and foundation,
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  founding principles of this country.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  That's something that the current crop of people we have down there in Washington aren't doing right now.
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  They're violating every way they possibly can and they're getting everybody they possibly can to support what they're doing and cover up for them.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  That's right.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  They're circling the wagons to use the whistleblowers and the political awakening as a way to actually legitimize this giant usurpation of our basic freedoms.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  And if we don't start backing them off at this point, the sky's the limit.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  We've already basically reached the sky.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  We're now going out into outer space.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  These are our final calls and we're going to let our gracious guests go. Mike in Wyoming, you're on the year worldwide.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  Hi, Mr. Benny.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  My recollection is that Perry Truman created NSA just with the stroke of his pen that Congress never actually created that agency by statute.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Why isn't it entitled to funding in the first place?
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  That's correct.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  Funding comes out of the Department of Defense, so the Department of Defense splices out a set of funding for them.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  But it's under, since the FISA laws, they've now had committees overseeing them and overseeing their budgets.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  But those committees have been basically usurped and are basically advocates for these agencies.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  And they tend to support them no matter what, which means that their committees get to manage larger budgets as the agencies themselves grow.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  So from their perspective, they look at that as a positive contribution when, in fact, they should be standing up for our rights
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  and stopping these people under the FISA law alone.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  That was the reason the church committee said that's what the church committee came up with.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  That's what they said, and this is how we're going to try to set up checks and balances.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  Well, those checks and balances over time have proven to just outright fail.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  They're nonexistent now.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  I mean, the FISA courts have rubber-stamped the intelligence committees or advocates for the agencies to do domestic spying when, in fact, they were created.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  Their founding principles for the creation of those were to prevent spying agencies in the United States from spying on United States citizens domestically.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  And that, they totally failed at.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  It is a criminal big brother revolution by bureaucrats and corporate and government interest to openly execute fraud upon us until it becomes common law precedent.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  And it is just over the top.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  They're getting away with it. Mike, anything else?
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  No, that's all. Thank you.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  Thank you very much.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  Well, folks, we are basically out of time with our guest, William Benny.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  We've got Chris, John, Truth, Raider, Frank, and many others holding, all trying to answer your questions as best I can.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  Mr. Benny, people constantly say, where are the whistleblowers?
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  Where are good people in government, good people in corporations?
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  Well, whether it's John Perkins, who was an economic hitman for big banks, or whether it's Colonel Schaefer or General Benton K. Parton, or countless other people, we have had on this broadcast, Tosh Plumlee, Celica Steele,
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. Terry Reid.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  It's got to be over a thousand now.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  Whistleblowers from state, federal, international level.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  Wolfgang Wurdar, the head of the EU vaccine program admitting the vaccines are tainted.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  I mean, the truth is, we actually have more people in major corporations and governments that do go public, and then the public doesn't get behind them or listens to mainstream media demonizing them.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  To the point of now, where they're arresting and persecuting the press, not just people that internally blew the whistle and gave up your career heading up a major agency.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  I mean, it's just, I think it's the immorality and the laziness of the American people that at the end of the day is allowing this.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  I don't think we are the progenitors of it, but we're the people that allow it.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  And as Eric Hoffer said, propaganda does not deceive people, it merely helps them deceive themselves.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  And men have to ask, do they really only want sports center and fantasy football over a free country and a future?
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  Do women only want to go out and party and act like tarts?
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  Or do they want to have a future for their children?
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  Because we're going into bondage.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  This is only the beginning.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  We can see the fruits of this tyranny as our country and the world goes down the drain.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  We've started a global spy race now.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  So who knows what's going to come out of this?
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  It's destabilizing our world.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  It's discrediting our country.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  It's discrediting our tech companies because people don't want to do business with us.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  I'm kind of ranting here at the end.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  It's just why are we allowing this to happen?
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  It is so insane.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  Final comment.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  You're pointing out some of the very short-sighted, finite thinking that people went through when they first decided to do these kinds of things.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  And I start with Cheney and his dark side business.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  Instead of focusing on doing the intelligence business and the military business in a focused, disciplined way,
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  he went on a scatter approach, let's go after everything and do everything we possibly can to ensure we get information.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  Well, I mean, it's been shown for a long time by any numbers of studies and examples,
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  testimony from various people that torture doesn't work.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  And if you torture people, they'll tell you anything you want them to tell you.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  And so what that means is you need to do a disciplined approach.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  And I think the FBI had at one point, anyway, they were thinking that torture was not the way to go either
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  and that there were other ways to get the information and get it reliably.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  Certainly, we knew from the second business that that was true and they went down a very bad path there.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  They went down a very bad path everywhere.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  I think the dark side is just the bad path, that's all.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Well, sir, you are a modern hero.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  You have gone through hell, lost your lucrative job, done so many other things to warn us.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  You raised the alarm as a modern Paul Revere and now it's up to us to try to carry them all.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  But I appreciate you working so hard and still going through the persecution.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  I hope you write a book.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  Now we know about all the illegal spying, but just write a book about your experiences.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  They can't stop you from writing about the persecution you've gone through.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  Really, I see it as a modern jungle, just like the jungle exposed child labor and the Rockefeller factories.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  I think your book or another big whistleblower book, not so much getting into the spying even, but just the response to it could be made into a film.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  You name it and things like that will turn around our society.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  William, Benny, thank you so much.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  Thank you for having me.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  All right, folks, there he goes.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  I'm an amazing individual and there's so many of them and I'll tell you what's humbling about my broadcast.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  I get to talk to people like that every day and I get to talk to you.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  And sometimes I get frustrated, sometimes I get rude and mad.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  It's because this is real for me.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  I've been doing this for 20 years, I know a lot.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  And to look at one story, I make all these connections in my mind to other data.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  It gives me a headache.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  To look at one article gives me a headache like this article.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  UNICEF calls 2014 one of the worst years on record for the world, New York Times.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  Why does that give me a headache?
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  I'll tell you when we come back.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  Why does it make me feel rage?
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  Why does it make me want to cry?
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  I'll tell you when we come back.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  And we'll continue with your phone calls straight ahead as well.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  Benny did an hour and a half with us.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  I skipped two network breaks.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  You name it, because that was such important information.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  And I hope when the video of this gets posted at infowars.com tomorrow,
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  I hope it isn't pearls before swine.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  I hope we get it out to everybody else because you are the resistance.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  You are the answer.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  You are the Paul Revere.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:17.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000]  We're on the run.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:28.000]  10's of thousands of individuals have use oxy powder to cleanse their bodies
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000]  and aid in their transformations.
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:37.000]  Even Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Doe has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  It took me that first day and I took it for six more days after that.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  12 pounds melted off in about a week.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  I'd say a week. Seven days.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000]  2015 can be different.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  Diet and exercise are important but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  flushes it out. Secure your oxy powder at infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:33.480]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:38.040]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and two

[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:33.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:42.840]  In the heat of the night, UNICEF calls 2014 one of the worst years on record
[02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:50.040]  for world's children. And they go through all over the world.
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:57.000]  15 million children starve to death a year. Other 20 million adults, they go through war.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:06.040]  23 million children live in countries and areas riven by armed conflicts. And this is the UN
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:14.280]  that goes around sterilizing people, goes around engaging in massacres, goes around destabilizing.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:19.720]  But every time you're at the shopping mall or something, if a woman looks like she's a model,
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:23.640]  she's wearing a UNICEF shirt. Because that's how, that's what models do.
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:28.280]  Miss America, what do you want to do? I want to help UNICEF help the children.
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.440]  It's like give your money to the Red Cross and half of it goes to gun control, basically.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:36.760]  I'm not against you if you ever helped the Red Cross.
[02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:42.520]  What you did was good, but the organization itself is a globalist crime syndicate, in my
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:48.680]  opinion. Same thing with United Way. But the UN makes them all look like angels.
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:56.200]  And it says they've been orphan, kidnapped, tortured, recruited, raped, and even sold as slaves.
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.400]  The same New York Times two years ago admitted that the UN in the Congo
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:07.000]  was going in and killing whole villages of people that wouldn't leave their own ancestral land
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.440]  because they had promised it as a carbon sink under the UN. Oh, you can have mines over here
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.720]  for big corporations, but there has to be an offset now. This land can have people on it.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:23.480]  So we're going to force you off. I mean, I remember, had to be like 1998, if somebody's got
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:28.360]  National Geographic, you say find it for me. I was like 98 because I covered it on air a
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.400]  bunch, maybe 99. It was articles about Burma and a couple of the places about UN
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:41.880]  buffer zones in those countries and it showed UN troops and it said they shoot anyone trying to
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:48.200]  come in, period. And how they'd run people off their ancestral lands there. I mean, I know that's
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.560]  on record they did that, the UN reportedly killed tens of thousands in Burma alone, but
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:57.960]  there it was in an article about how good it was with liberals reading it.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:04.920]  So see, I see an article where the UN's trying to save the kids again.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:13.080]  Remember, Prince Bernhard founded the World Wildlife Fund, the other cause celeb thing of every young
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:22.920]  college girl. He used it on record as a front. Look it up for running giant poaching operations
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.240]  in Africa. You know, how much you can get for all that ivory and stuff, especially in China,
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:32.040]  where they grind it up and eat it as a medicinal for tiger claws and all the rest of it.
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:37.480]  Last time I heard, I think a tiger claw is something like
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:47.000]  $5,000 a gram or something ridiculous. The point is, is that it'd be like Count Dracula running a
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:57.640]  blood bank. It's just the, uh, the USO. Let's say you pronounce it right. What's the group they set
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:03.240]  up during World War II where the celebrities go play for the troops? Yeah. Great organization.
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:08.680]  There's a lot of great stuff. Bob Hope, whole nine yards. Nothing against entertainment for the
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:14.440]  troops or whatever, but it was founded by George Herbert Walker Bush, his dad, Prescott Bush, when
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:20.200]  he was about to be indicted by the McCormick-Dickstein committee basically for being the main Nazi
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:25.320]  collaborator. So he comes out with a thing for the troops. You know, that's the thing about
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:30.680]  knowing history is that it's so frustrating. You see one article like this and then it makes
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:37.000]  you think of all the stuff they're doing and it's always irritating to see the very people involved
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:47.880]  in all this evil posing as the good guys. Here's another New York Times. Bush and CIA
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.920]  ex-officials rebut torture report, the new Senate report that's a whitewash,
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:57.960]  which admits the torture. The Democrats are just trying to score some political points.
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:03.640]  That's why the CIA was spying on them illegally. But it doesn't make Diane Feinstein good that
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:09.000]  she's being spied on. See, it's just a ship of rats fighting with each other. But the issue here
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.240]  is back when they thought they had America eaten out of their hand, they admitted torture on television.
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:17.400]  Why Jack Bauer tortured every night on 24. He was always right. He was a good guy.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:26.440]  But they didn't torture somebody like give us, you know, you capture a code
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:31.320]  expert who knows how the German code works. Show us how this machine works. We're going to start
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:38.120]  chopping your fingers off. What really works is we're going to hunt your kids down in Germany
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.840]  and kill them. We've got hit teams inside your country right now. If you don't tell us, that's
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:49.080]  bad enough. But that would work sometimes in an absolute emergency situation where you know what
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:54.600]  you're going after and I'm against torture. But the claims that torture doesn't work. It's not
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:39:00.760]  really completely true. What it really works for, though, is false confessions and to flip people
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:07.960]  over to be double agents and do whatever you want. That's what torture is really all about.
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:13.000]  And it's what tyrants do in upright countries don't do it. George Washington, if he caught his
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:18.040]  troops torturing, because the British troops would torture to get intel, he would hang you.
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:23.880]  Look it up. And you know why he hang you? Because he wanted the moral high ground. If you got caught
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:30.760]  raping a woman, George Washington would hang you. And foreign generals from Germany and others came
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:40.040]  over here and really admired the colonial army because it didn't engage in war crimes and everybody
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:46.680]  else did. And that's one reason they ended up winning the public support and winning the war
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:53.960]  because there was a moral high ground that had to be attained. George Washington wasn't a wimp
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:59.080]  because he didn't torture and he didn't rape and didn't elude. He knew he had to have the moral high
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:06.120]  ground. Now he did sit down every morning and sign death warrants on traitors that were working
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:17.800]  with the British who would be assassinated. That's not torture. So that's the difference,
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.840]  ladies and gentlemen. And it's a guarantee that we're going to Hades in a handbasket
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:32.600]  with all the garbage that's going on. And I've got three children and I love them and I want
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:35.320]  them to have a future with your children. And that's why we got to turn this around.
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.760]  Now there's a story up on DrudgeReport.com. We also have it up on InfoWars.com. I'm going to
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:50.920]  tweet it out at Real Alex Jones. And Compton on Obama. He launched profanity lace tirades against
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.800]  the press according to ABC News Journalists and Compton. Rock Obama launched a profanity lace
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:01.160]  tirades against the press and off the record meeting with reporters. I've been watching Obama. He
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:06.840]  used to seem real slick and happy and kind of bebopping as a narcissist. He looks really upset
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:13.800]  now. Now he has acid reflux on his stuff in a C-span interview. Compton also derided the president
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:19.480]  for leading the most opaque. That means hard to see through administration of any I have covered.
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:23.160]  And this is just the degeneration of government. It's going to get worse and worse.
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:28.200]  The journalist who retired in August of her 40-year career revealed to C-span's Ryan Lamb,
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:33.160]  I have seen in the last year Obama really angry twice. Both were off the record times.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:38.840]  I got a question. What is she doing bringing up an off the record discussion? I don't like Obama.
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:42.760]  But if it's not a crime he's committing, you don't bring up an off the record discussion.
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:48.200]  These journalists are a pack of rats. They're just as bad or worse as Obama.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:54.120]  They go along with the sellout of the country and when they retire they dish dirt on people that gave
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:59.400]  them confidence. Let's go ahead and play the clip. Here it is. I have seen in the last year
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:06.920]  Barack Obama really angry twice. Both were off the record times. One profanity laced
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:13.960]  where he thought the press was making too much of scandals that he didn't think were scandals.
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:21.400]  Another where he took us to task for not understanding the limits he has with foreign policy
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:28.200]  in the way he's dealing with the Middle East and Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't find him apologetic
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.080]  but I find him willing to stand up to the press and look them in the eye even though it was off
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:43.240]  the record and just give us hell. From his point of view he may but we cover what we are allowed
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:49.000]  to cover and when policy decisions and this is all about how the press is in a fight with him and
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:56.520]  how how she was there and she's not going to let him boss around all about her, her, her.
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:02.760]  Do you understand folks? She was in an off the record meeting.
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:08.520]  She's not a journalist. See I don't claim to be a journalist first and foremost but if you're in
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:14.280]  an off the record discussion with me it's that. I don't even tell crew about it.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:19.880]  Sometimes I'll have guests during the break start telling me stuff off the record. I go
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:24.360]  I trust my crew but this isn't really off the record. You got a bunch of people listening to
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:30.680]  this and to watch them all these swollen people because they work for mainstream media acting
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:38.760]  like you know they're sycophantic journalists and I'm not. I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:44.760]  People like this woman couldn't get a William Benion and have him say exactly right precisely
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:49.800]  right. You know why I'm precisely right about the NSA? I've studied it for 20 years. I've interviewed
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:58.040]  scores of whistleblowers and I'm just so sick of these sophistic, swollen, dishonorable pieces of
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:03.720]  trash up there about how their big journalist is there on ABC News. You're a joke!
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:11.400]  Does she ever say in here why she's opening up about something that's off record?
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.720]  Man you know why I get mad by her? I'm so sick of telling people something's off the record
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:23.720]  and then they go and blabber it everywhere because a lot of times you'll tell somebody
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:28.920]  something off the record to help them or to give them a little tidbit and in this dishonorable,
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.960]  unshivered society people then take that as ooh I better spread this because it's really off the
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:44.760]  record. I want to go back to your phone calls. Briefly ladies and gentlemen I want to thank
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:51.720]  all the listeners for your support. You make the broadcast possible. We have special offerings of
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:45:00.120]  collectibles in groups of 200 to 500 that only come around once at maiden1776.com or m4store.com
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:06.680]  is the main site. You can find it under the maiden1776 area. We have bronze and nickel
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:14.920]  belt buckles, one of the m16 with the molon labé with the traditional texas star. We have the
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:20.680]  molon labé with a spartan helmet and two cross 50 cows and again we've already had one version
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:27.640]  come out sold out of those. This is the new version. There's only 500 of each and there's
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:32.920]  500 silver coins that are stamped. In fact I'm told they're more than double stamped.
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:37.240]  These are the finest grade coins we could buy. I wanted to put out something really special
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:42.920]  that's a collectible and there's only 500 of the molon labé. Come and take it,
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:49.240]  spartan double cross swords with five spears. This is what you frame and put on the wall
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:54.920]  and the purchase supports the broadcast. Just to give you an idea these coins cost us to make
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:46:01.240]  $50 a piece so there's not much mark up there. I mean these are one ounce 999 whatever you know
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:07.720]  Troy silver. We're very proud of those. The belt buckles are 50 bucks a piece and they're made in
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:13.160]  America. Forged in America. We bought them in China. You know we could have gotten them for
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:18.840]  $10 instead of $20 a piece or $25 a piece and you know doubled our profit but and we do have
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:24.280]  the camo long sleeve molon labé back in the women's molon labé back in infoar store.com

[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.080]  guess that was to have on your show on info wars mr william benny cia
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:40.280]  and i say yeah but but you're right go ahead my apologies the point i wanted to ask and i thought
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:45.880]  that would be appropriate for mr benny but i'm sure you will appreciate also is the attorney's
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:52.440]  skill of the black arts word crafting uh they seem to want to deem to term this uh
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:49:00.520]  uh warrantless data that they came without any probable cause for future prosa s contusions
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:07.240]  as data instead of warrantless evidence that's being gleaned for future prosa executions that's
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:12.760]  right they call it metadata when it's everything including full recordings of everything patently
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:19.400]  felonies every one of them well and the prostitutes of course they uh like to
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:24.040]  tout the different things they've gotten from the torture projects but if the truth is they
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:31.960]  provided no actionable intel well it's designed to actually make us blind from real threats because
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:37.640]  the globalists run those while spying on good people in government you heard him the main focus now
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:43.160]  is spying on good people imagine william benny is secretly testifying to congress
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:50.280]  trying to fix things internally the former head of the nsa and they swat team in that his house
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:57.000]  when he's in the shower in the morning to mess with him i mean imagine being the fbi swat team
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:04.600]  i mean shame to themselves well i mean anybody knows the guy has no criminal record he's got
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:08.440]  all these medals you go knock at the door if you got a search warrant and you come in and get the
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:14.920]  computers even that is an abuse i mean it's purely how out of control is the justice department and
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:20.760]  the obama administration and all these agencies if they're arresting people like drake and others
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:26.600]  i mean it's not like they're snowden who ran to russia to release the info but see what was
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:31.960]  snowden supposed to do then if they're arresting people for nothing then he he did the right thing
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:38.760]  i'm sorry go ahead well i was just going to bring up the fact that valrigan red in the white house
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:45.240]  who's never been vetted is actually the colonel edwin mandel house for this administration
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:50.600]  you're right and that's another thing as long as you're with the system you can leak intel everywhere
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:56.360]  you can blabber it's just this country's in danger just for the incompetence of these crooks

[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:53.800]  let's talk to john in california you're on the air go ahead john yes alex uh the i want to make a
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:59.400]  correction the government is not rogue it is totally criminal and the only way to deal with
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:06.840]  criminals is by force now who is going to force them out alex not us the u.s military must get
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:13.400]  involved and implement operation balkary because we're running out of time the ballot box doesn't
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:19.640]  work anymore it's broken okay and if you are familiar with your history of staufenberg and the
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:26.120]  co-plotters they had assembled a committee of german civilians to take over as soon as they
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:31.480]  got rid of hitler and his henchmen this is what the u.s military can do we're running out of time
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:36.520]  they're going to start a war with russia they're itching to do it we must reach out to the
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:42.680]  military and the pentagon and have them remove the criminals well there'd have to be a larger
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:48.200]  discussion about constitutional convention the state's coming together the bankers the globalists
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:52.120]  the federal reserve have been so smart they've got all the pension funds invested in the derivatives
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:57.880]  they've got us so dependent it's it's like half our heart is cancer so if we cut the cancer out
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:05.160]  it cuts half our ventricles out and we die so we've got to like find some way to reduce the tumor
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:11.400]  and then remove it in pieces or something because i agree it's going to go towards heart attack and
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:17.720]  death anyways the tumor keeps growing but if we chop it out at one time it'll kill us as well
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:25.240]  uh you've got to first educate the public and you got to support whistleblowers uh but i hear
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:31.400]  you man i hear you it's it's serious but it's not just the u.s it's a global group of criminals
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:37.880]  that one major tentacle has grabbed us so see that's the thing i mean if the military took over
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:41.480]  and they convene the governors and the states decide to what to do and i mean what would you
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:46.280]  do with congress congress won't even do its job they're all bought and paid for by the same people
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:51.560]  well then who decides who to remove and who to keep usually those type of things get worse not
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:58.200]  better so it's a very sophisticated problem i appreciate your call you know what i've got
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:04.200]  it ended here i'm frank and chris uh chris in kentucky real fast go ahead final caller
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:09.000]  yeah alex uh we just had an article in the courier journal about these after all this
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.320]  Ferguson new york city uh problems that we've been having now the the local police department
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:17.080]  here is all of a sudden we're going to get cameras on our chest my question about these
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:21.320]  things that i'm concerned about this is all digital database is that what does that information
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:28.040]  go into those cameras yes they are going to basically keep all of it and i'm not against it
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:33.320]  overall problem is cops just turn them off and say they malfunction when they feel like it uh so
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:37.160]  you know that's the problem and then pretty soon do we have to have cameras on us to prove we're not
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:51.880]  bad this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
