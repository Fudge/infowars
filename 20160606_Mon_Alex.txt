[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  The Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  I am live in studio coming to you from deep in heart of the good old state of Texas Austin
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  David Knight will anchor the fourth hour again under host Alex Jones
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  Hard to believe it's already Monday the sixth day of June 2016
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  We have several very informative guests joining us today Rob do is in Deutschland to cover Bilderberg
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  2016 the global government meeting every four years since its inception
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  Every fourth year meets in the United States on the East Coast. This is the first time they are meeting in Europe on the fourth year
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  And that's obviously because Europe is in such crisis and world government is tottering on the edge of collapse. It wants to collapse our civilization
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  But exempt itself, but it's getting the blame. It's not able to pose as the savior
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  And so this great crisis is starting to go to waste
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  And Rob do along with Josh Owens are on the ground
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  Paul Watson is now traveling to Germany as well, but Bilderberg doesn't kick off until Thursday
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  They're obviously going to be covering the grounds of the hotel before they get thrown out
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  They're gonna be getting intel out to the public about one of these world government shadow meetings
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  This is very pinnacle of control
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  But just as important they're gonna be showing the project of the globalist
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  Opening the borders advertising that you can come to Germany advertising that you can come to Europe and everything paid for
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  That's part of the EU admitted program. They're going to the so-called refugee centers
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  And the German police and security showed up. We have the video of this and said listen
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  You are not allowed to show this camp without permission
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  So certainly no free speech in Germany where they're arresting people for the first amendment style rights that we have here
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  That they supposedly have over there but don't where they are arresting people across the board
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  Who even mildly criticize the open borders
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  And so here you can see our crew at the entrance to the camp if you're watching on TV being pushed out by the security
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  And I've had members of the UK parliament on who are liberals
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  Who have pointed out that what they're doing EU wide including the UK is
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  Getting the immigrants that came in maybe five ten years before
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  That have been inducted into government service and that they are now the informants
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  They are now the enforcers. They are now the controllers
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  And you notice that it appears to be Africans not in Muslim garb
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  Who are the security for the Muslims
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  And then it will be the Muslims that are the security for the Chinese or the whatever next group they bring in
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  This is a real admitted pattern where the social workers the police you name it are not from the UK
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  Are not from Germany and I don't mean you have some people in every police department to reflect the makeup of the nation
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  That only makes sense to be able to communicate with those communities and to make sure they get integrated into society
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  They don't want a melting pot. They want vulcanized groups with basically social workers that come and take your children
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Now in the UK it's mainly Eastern Europeans and I'm not bashing Eastern Europeans the other great folks
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  But a lot of them have come out of socialist and communist and authoritarian societies
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  And most of the social workers in the UK that come and take your children
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  I've had members of parliament on that have written articles for a lot of telegraph and you name it about this
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  Are not even really from the UK. They hardly even speak English
[04:00.000 --> 04:11.000]  And an alarming number of the police chiefs in Sweden in Germany and France and in the UK are also Muslims
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  And they hardly even speak English. They weren't even born in the UK but they're now your enforcer
[04:17.000 --> 04:26.000]  In fact this was pointed out that most of the security at the De Gaulle airport, Charles De Gaulle airport there in Paris
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  Are Muslims and full hardcore practicing Muslims with hijabs
[04:32.000 --> 04:41.000]  The women are there with only their eyes showing and they're running security and then up goes the plane and it blows up
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  Same thing in Cairo but of course that's a Muslim country but they've got the radical Muslims there running it to a certain extent as well
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  This is the fox guarding the foxes entering the hen house and the hens are being tied up and having their blood sucked. We'll be back
[04:57.000 --> 05:08.000]  Bilderberg 2016 is kicking off Thursday June 9th and InfoWars is already there to cover the event. This year the Bilderberg Global Elite are meeting in Dresden, Germany
[05:08.000 --> 05:18.000]  Where they're likely to discuss how to stop the UK from leaving the EU for growing resistance against the destruction of western culture and a mass invasion of Muslim migrants and the rise of Donald Trump
[05:18.000 --> 05:24.000]  The mood at Bilderberg would be very grim as both populism and nationalism rise up across the world to stop globalism
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  Europeans in particular are tired of having their lives controlled by the unelected bureaucracy known as the European Union
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Which was based on Adolf Hitler's plan for a European super state which eradicates national sovereignty
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  Bilderberg Group has been nurturing the EU the life since the 1950s and now they see their despotic regime dying
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Maybe it'll be a wake up call for some of the elite. There's more to existence than simply controlling others
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  And humanity could explore the universe if individuals were left alone to brew innovations which advance the human race
[05:50.000 --> 05:58.000]  Keep checking Infowars.com and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube for the latest breaking developments on Bilderberg and the migrant crisis in Germany
[05:58.000 --> 06:21.000]  This is Kid Daniel supporting

[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure. That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  Take action now before we sell out
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  We've got it!
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Thank you for your space and coming to you
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  Waging war on corruption
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Oh, thank you, I'll go
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar
[08:18.000 --> 08:34.000]  This controversy started about a week ago and I never even covered it despite the fact that Infowars.com is at the center of it
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  And I'll be honest with you, I have a real blind spot to news that we are the center of
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Because I don't want to just be a gonzo journalist and report on myself
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  Even though every day we are reporting on some big news story that Infowars.com, myself and my reporters are related to
[08:56.000 --> 09:09.000]  If we wanted to, we could fill Infowars every day and this radio show and this TV broadcast with news stories that are about us or about stories we're breaking
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  In fact, sometimes it's obnoxious how much we talk about ourselves to begin with
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  But when you are on the leading cutting edge of things, you've got to discuss it because you have to respond to the attacks
[09:20.000 --> 09:30.000]  You also have to respond and point out how new independent media is so much more prolific, successful and fast moving than the dinosaur media that's on its last legs
[09:30.000 --> 09:40.000]  But coming up at the bottom of the hour, I will spend a few minutes on this whole Klamath Falls, Southern Oregon, Northern California controversy
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  And it's a synthetic controversy with headlines all over the news and on TV the last week
[09:47.000 --> 10:13.000]  That Donald Trump has been caught red handed using Infowars material and he's a total yuckook saying that there is an invasive species fish in several major reservoirs that were built to supply water
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  Two farmers in Northern California and Southern Oregon
[10:20.000 --> 10:31.000]  And you could do an entire college education course on the media manipulation deception just off of this
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  From the photos they use, the images, how they twist it, how they lie
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  It's admitted this fish is invasive, but then they say we don't want it to die
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  So we're not going to let you lower the level of these reservoirs
[10:46.000 --> 10:56.000]  It's true that that's what's caused much of the businesses to go out of business and the towns that service the farmers to go out of business
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  And it's a fact that there's a federal project to push people off their land all over the United States
[11:01.000 --> 11:11.000]  Look at the Red River where thousands of square miles on both sides of Texas and Oklahoma with people in some cases that have had the land for over 100 years
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's not like it's public land that they have grazing rights to for 100-something years like the Bundy's surface rights
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  They own the alloidal title
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  Some of these families have the old ancient title
[11:27.000 --> 11:35.000]  And so all we do is point out the fact that all of this is going on, thank you Niko
[11:35.000 --> 11:44.000]  And then they think their viewers and listeners are so stupid, they go out and lie and say Donald Trump's discredited, he links to Infowars.com
[11:44.000 --> 11:54.000]  And they do that not to actually act like he's discredited, but to make people think Infowars is discredited because it's actually hitting right on the zeitgeist
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.000]  And so they're saying, oh look, you know, you're talking about something that doesn't exist because they think you're stupid
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  And don't remember a decade ago, right through to about two or three years ago, Sean Hannity was there every couple months
[12:11.000 --> 12:23.000]  Bill O'Reilly, we've been out there repeatedly in areas of Southern Oregon, Northern California, showing the towns going from 5,000-10,000 to a couple hundred
[12:23.000 --> 12:36.000]  And imploding and going out of business because they were based on the reservoirs, the lakes, the mountain lakes that were built in the 40s and 50s to be able to settle that area
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  But there's this whole rewilding about tearing down the dams and having things go back to nature
[12:43.000 --> 12:51.000]  And then all we do is report on what's happening and they come out and say it's a hoax and that Donald Trump is crazy
[12:51.000 --> 13:04.000]  And then they link to our stories that Trump linked to and that Trump tweeted to act like he somehow did something wrong because they're scared to death
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  He's already so radical compared to the establishment, that's why he's winning
[13:08.000 --> 13:18.000]  What if he really gets radical and picks up the entire Infowars agenda, which is just one of the most fact-based, on-target worldviews out there
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  But frankly, nothing even that special
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  It's like a person that has 20-20 vision versus someone who's blind
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  We understand what we're talking about
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  So they sit there and say, it's a drought in California, that's what's causing the problem
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  Yes, we know there's a drought, California's always had many areas that are arid and desert-like
[13:42.000 --> 13:53.000]  That's why we use artificial systems to green it so that during the drought periods, the communities have a backup plan and aren't a one-crop economy
[13:53.000 --> 14:04.000]  That's why they built dams on the Colorado River here in Austin, Texas to help create a lush water system to supply the 2 million people that now live here
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  And when they built that dam, guess how many people lived in all of this area of Central Texas in this county? About 40,000
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's 2 million
[14:16.000 --> 14:24.000]  And now they stand around and go, the answer, literally, tear down the dams, tell no one come live here because there's too many people
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  Oh, don't innovate, tear things down, that's Agenda 21, and then charge you more money for it
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  I want to talk about it later in the hour, I always say something's coming up and I start getting into it now
[14:36.000 --> 14:48.000]  It's just amazing how they sit there and deny to people they have an anti-human agenda shutting off our plants, not letting us build new plants, tearing down dams, not letting us build new dams
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  And people say to me, Alex, this isn't really a big election issue, why do you harp on it so much?
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  We need to make it the issue, that's what I was trying to say Thursday
[14:56.000 --> 15:07.000]  We have to focus on what is truly important, define it, cover it ourselves, and not always just chase the story that the MSM is putting out
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  Because that's the only power they still have
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  They have a skeleton audience compared to what they had, a shadow of a shadow, they are discredited, they have a 6% trust rate in scientific polls
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  And other information shows that that AP poll is very, very accurate, common sense shows it
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  But still, when they cover topics, we're forced to respond
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  And we still kind of act like it's a big deal to be on CNN or something
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  Every day people say, I saw you on CNN, I saw you on Fox, I could care less
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  They're playing clips of this show on those shows every day
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  I don't even sit here and play clips of my own show now, 95% of the time
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Because again, it's not about us
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  But when they're sitting there totally and absolutely deceiving people, we have to
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  Because it's illustrative of how they operate and how they get their job done
[16:01.000 --> 16:09.000]  Oh, shutting off all these big reservoirs in Northern California and Southern Oregon, it didn't cause anybody to go bankrupt
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  There's nothing happening
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  Why, can you believe that Donald Trump said the moon was made of cheese yesterday?
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  And where'd he get the disinfo from?
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  Why the bad guy, the king of conspiracy
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Who actually has been out to Northern California to talk to these farmers
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  And my reporters have been there many times just last year
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  And we've been all over the story and had scientists on to talk about it
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  But none of that matters because CNN, MSNBC, Salon and all these other groups
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  They came out and laughed at us and said it didn't exist
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  It didn't exist
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  Just like families never existed
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Next, they're gonna say that
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  Not just that father and mother is bad, but that it never really even existed
[16:57.000 --> 17:02.000]  They're already coming out and saying, you know, it was always really a village that raised the children, not a family
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  See, that's, which is true
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  But that was your other extended family, you could trust them
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  Then the state came in and said it's not good to discipline your own children
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  Then they said it's not good to have your neighbors watch them
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  And your kids can't be in their front yard, their backyard unattended
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Even when they're 11 or 12 years old, they will arrest you
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  See, they kill the village, they build artificial systems
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  And then they tell us the state is the village
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  And they take away our farms and give us big factory farms
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  Everything is about total and complete control
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  Alright, I've already digressed at the very start of the broadcast
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up after the break
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.000]  Look at this, Donald Trump uses Alex Jones as an actual news source
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  They are so scared of what we cover, they are so scared of how we read the defense bills
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  Where they say they have reeducation camps, they actually use that term
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  They are so freaked out that we know how government works
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  They're so freaked out we know about shadow government and COG
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  They're so freaked out we understand the larger battle plan and have read their white papers
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  They're so freaked out
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  They're so freaked out
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  Environmentalists cause California drought to protect this fish
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  Ah, California, the place where liberalism is wrecking real-world havoc on people
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  And they make fun of this article
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  Think about that
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  It's well known that the high taxes are making people leave California
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  It's well known the regulations are making people leave California
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  It's well known California is in deep manure
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  And most of its counties and cities already bankrupt
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  Just like so many other cities and counties around the country
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  And so many protectorates of this republic
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  Like the one out there straddling the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean that just went belly up a month ago
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Puerto Rico
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  It's so incredible
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  There's one country out there that's doing well
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  And that's because it won't take any global funding or money and it's independent
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  And it's the eastern half of what was Hispaniola
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  Dominican Republic today
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  But again, I'm digressing into a topic I was going to get into a little bit later
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  In the transmission
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Obviously we're going to get into all the way to Donald Trump news
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  Obviously we have our reporters in Germany
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  Covering Bilderberg that kicks off in a couple of days
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  But they've already been to migrant camps with explosive results
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  Migrant camp freaks out on reporters asking questions
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  Rob do for infowars.com
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Also medieval Trump wall found in Germany
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  Very powerful report
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  That's up on infowars.com
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  Also another clip, Hillary Clinton says government has a right to regulate the Second Amendment
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  We're going to be covering all of that
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  We also have another article up on infowars.com
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  Written by Paul Joseph Watson
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  That's going viral via drudgereport.com right now
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  Video. Obese woman starts crashing store after EBT card gets refused
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  You never know when there will be another Katrina
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  An economic collapse or a serious drought
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's a home freeze dryer
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  With the product you can preserve the food your family loves
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  And the best part is the food will last 25 years and still taste great
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  I've tried it and it's amazing
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  You can literally freeze dry anything you eat
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Even things like ice cream
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  To learn more call Harvest Right today at 800-594-4635

[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  This is Dan Pilla, do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you

[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt

[22:23.000 --> 22:32.000]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  He wasn't a rich man by any means
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  At less than $107 per month
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  Don't wait. Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones

[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family

[23:56.000 --> 24:09.000]  Goberkey.com
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  Roger Stone did not tell me who the VP choice of Donald Trump is
[24:18.000 --> 24:33.000]  For Vice President, but he did concur with my prediction of who it will be
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  He said no one knows but Trump at this point
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  He's not going to talk about private meetings that he's been in with the shortlist
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  Hearing what Trump thinks and Trump bouncing it off Stone and others
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  He doesn't want to talk about Corey Lewandowski, the embattled head of the campaign
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  Who really is just a glorified trail manager right now
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  But when Lewandowski goes on television and says that he's heading up the vetting process
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  That is not the case
[25:08.000 --> 25:17.000]  They brought in former top lawyers for Ronald Reagan who are doing the background checking and research on who Trump likes
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  So it's Donald Trump
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  And I came up with my own list of three people
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  And Stone actually his eyes got big, he gulped
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  I've got to know him good, he's such a character
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  I just like him as a person
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  And he just said, well you said that on air, you didn't get that from me
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  And he visibly kind of turned a little bit red and was concerned that Trump would think he told me
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  So we've got an interview where he actually goes further than he ever has on who he thinks the shortlist is
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  That's going to air at 1.33 today
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  It's a 20 minute interview
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  And then that ends the hour or so and then David Knight comes in
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  But that's coming up today, we have our reporters from the migrant camps
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  They're in Germany, they're just everywhere
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  And that the government's trying to keep the press from documenting
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  Good luck stopping drones
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  That'd be confiscated, we'll just go buy another one
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  And we're just going to transmit it out right after we get the data
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  So in fact we already got it
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  So get ready for a bunch of stuff to break on that
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  We've got Rob Dew and Josh Owens in Deutschland
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  He's on the left of it for the next 10 days
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  Bilderberg kicks off on Thursday
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  They'll run right through Sunday
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then more migrant camps and come back next week
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  And I appreciate Rob Dew's wife
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  He's our news director making the sacrifice to let Rob be out on the road so much
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  He wants to do it
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  And I'm really good friends with Rob and his four children
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And my children
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  But we vacation together some and hang out a lot
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  So he's a good friend, a great guy
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  And so's Josh Owens, just wonderful, all these people I've gotten to know so well
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  They're my family at the end of the day
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  But they're over there, so pray for them
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  By the way, I'm going to come back and hit the news here in a moment
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  This is a short segment
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  It's not a story about Roger Stone so much as it's about life
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  Because I'm going to come back and briefly talk about Muhammad Ali
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  I was here on Saturday to tape three different segments
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  That were going to air Saturday, Sunday, and then today
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  On big topics with Roger Stone
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  The real reason he came to town was to discuss a lot of inside baseball things
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  Coming up with Cleveland
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  And to fill me in on a lot of things off the record
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  So that I could navigate into the future
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  And he's filled me in on some things off record about a year ago
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  That all came true and then again about six months ago
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  And then a few months ago when he came back to Austin, Texas
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  So this is pretty important stuff obviously that I got briefed on
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  But I can't talk about it until the future
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  But
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  We were talking about an hour back there in the conference room
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  Just he and I and he got a call from his wife
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  And his 93-year-old mother had come home from the hospital
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  And they had just said, look, she's going to die any day now
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  But she's still all there
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  She's an excruciating pain with lung cancer
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  We're going to give her morphine
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  She wants it
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  And he said, I need a minute or two
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  And then he went around out in the foyer area
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And I walked by and I saw tears in his eyes
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And he got off the phone
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  He goes, that was the last time I probably ever talked to my mother
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  While she's all there
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  This is Saturday at about noon
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  She's about to go on morphine to super high dose
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  She'll probably die in the next 48 hours
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  I've got to go finish a Trump speech on Sunday
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  I'm going to leave here early now
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  I wasn't going to fly out Sunday morning
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Because all the storms I'm going to leave this afternoon
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  And he pulled himself up
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  I mean, he wasn't even really crying
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  He pulled himself up, we came in here, shot the segments
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Went out to lunch, talked about his mother
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  And what a great lady she was
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  And I always loved hearing about people's mothers
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  And then left
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  By the way, I want Steve Pachennik to come on soon
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  To do a whole hour on his mother
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  In this book he's written about her
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  What an amazing lady
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  You know, Pachennik actually did make it out of the Holocaust
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  And his family, most of them were actually killed
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  And that's why he actually can't stand the ADL
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  Or those other groups
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  Is because he documents what they really did
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  The groups before the ADL
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  Not letting Jews get out of Germany
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Unless they paid big bounties
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  For Jewish mafia organizations
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  That's why Pachennik comes on air and exposes
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Some of the more criminal elements
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  Of things going on in Israel
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  That's why it's so credible too when he does it
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  But he's written a book about that
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  They wouldn't let him get into the U.S. though
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  They had to get into Cuba first
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  And then they got into the U.S. via Canada
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Into Cuba, into the U.S.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  But then Roger Stone called me
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  Or texted me in about 3.15 last night
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Saying, yeah, my mom just died
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  You know, thanks, pal, for all your support
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  I'm gonna be up at that time too
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Strangely, I'd woken up
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  But that's a classy guy right there
[29:49.000 --> 30:14.000]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  The book reveals a real personality of Hillary
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  Not the fake one you see on TV
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  And it's already at number one at Amazon
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  Despite not being released until June 28
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  But what's in the book?
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  Well, it portrays Hillary as quote
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  To erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  Violent to become president
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  One moment, then raging the next
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  The possibility they would have to protect Bill
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  From his wife's physical attacks
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  And the couple had one violent encounter
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  The morning of a key presidential address to the nation
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  Byrne wrote quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  To become the Democratic nominee for the president
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  Of the United States
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  But she simply lacks the integrity
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  And temperament to serve in the office
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  And you can find out more at infoworse.com

[32:24.000 --> 32:28.720]  the crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today. I was there telling you how to prepare
[32:28.720 --> 32:34.800]  yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning
[32:34.800 --> 32:39.760]  the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be
[32:39.760 --> 32:45.080]  the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.360]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[32:49.360 --> 32:59.360]  any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[33:19.360 --> 33:32.160]  Alright, in a moment, before I plunge into the political news, the geopolitical news,
[33:32.160 --> 33:40.480]  the military news, the war on the family news, as we chronicle the globalist operations in
[33:40.480 --> 33:47.440]  their attempt to fully take over all life on Earth and set themselves up as technocratic
[33:47.440 --> 33:54.080]  demagogues. But before we do that, I want to talk about Muhammad Ali, because I was just
[33:54.080 --> 34:02.160]  discussing Roger Stone, who was here talking to his mom on Saturday for what he said will
[34:02.160 --> 34:04.840]  probably be the last time. He said, I got to go out here and call my mom, probably talked
[34:04.840 --> 34:09.000]  to her the last time before they put her on morphine. I hope she holds on to, like, you
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.600]  know, get back on Monday, but I got to give a Trump speech, a Trump rally on Sunday. She's
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.720]  totally committed. That guy works like 18 hours a day during a campaign. He's a machine.
[34:18.720 --> 34:23.120]  And you know, then learning that she died last night about 315, people say, well, she's
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.960]  93 years old. Sure, you're just celebrating the interesting life of someone. And then
[34:27.960 --> 34:37.400]  you're also reflecting on how her son responded to it and continued, you know, moving forward
[34:37.400 --> 34:42.800]  in his overall mission. And that's really the essence of perseverance. And that's the
[34:42.800 --> 34:49.160]  human trait in men and women that I tend to admire the most. And I think that goes hand
[34:49.160 --> 34:55.200]  in glove of being an honorable person. But Muhammad Ali raises his fist for the last
[34:55.200 --> 35:01.920]  time in his final ever photos. And we'll show some of these really, really amazing, amazing
[35:01.920 --> 35:12.760]  photos of Muhammad Ali, who obviously fought way longer than he should have. That's perseverance.
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.200]  And had massive brainstem damage that led to the neurological disorder that finally
[35:18.200 --> 35:25.240]  took his life. And it's when we admire people like Muhammad Ali, even though I think we
[35:25.240 --> 35:31.360]  obsess too much on sports, it's a healthy thing overall, because it's about celebrating
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.120]  humanity and everybody that's come before us, currently who we are and what's going
[35:35.120 --> 35:38.440]  to happen in the future. And that's why I hate the globalists so much because they're
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.680]  all about telling us how bad we are, how evil we are, how stupid we are, and how we can
[35:43.680 --> 35:48.760]  only attain success by modeling ourselves and conforming to their systems. And their
[35:48.760 --> 35:54.600]  systems are admittedly designed to make us weak, to make us stupid. And so some will
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.640]  say, well, do you support what Muhammad Ali did? And I said, yes. Even though this sport
[36:00.640 --> 36:10.400]  ended up taking his life, it is only through testing the body and going through great trials
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.400]  and tribulations that the overall species stay strong. And men, more than anyone, are
[36:15.400 --> 36:23.360]  designed and meant to go out there and break our backs, working, fighting, whatever the
[36:23.360 --> 36:33.680]  case may be. We are that section of the species. That doesn't mean that women can't do that
[36:33.680 --> 36:39.440]  as well and that when women stand up and fight, it's amazing. But they really are the caregivers,
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.720]  the protectors, the nurturers. Doesn't mean that men don't have that aspect as well, but
[36:43.720 --> 36:49.840]  they want to basically outlaw rodeo writing, they want to outlaw the NFL, then they're
[36:49.840 --> 36:57.160]  going to outlaw even Bush League football because potentially you could get a concussion.
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.400]  Potentially you could get hurt. Well, potentially you could get hurt driving in a car. So they
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.000]  want to restrict that and have driverless cars. You see where this goes. Removing humans
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.760]  from the environment is like removing gravity from the environment. It will turn the entire
[37:11.760 --> 37:22.160]  species into boneless jellyfish, literally and figuratively. That which doesn't kill
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.320]  you only makes you stronger. And in the end, it may not have made Muhammad Ali physically
[37:27.320 --> 37:38.040]  stronger, but it made his spirit and his image and his icon stronger than almost any of us.
[37:38.040 --> 37:44.880]  And the wealth and the success he brought to his family and his community made the whole
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.880]  species stronger. And so Muhammad Ali, you could say, is a real man. I mean, you watch
[37:50.880 --> 37:58.480]  some of those clips where he dodges 28 punches in 10 seconds. I see that. I admire that aspect
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.240]  just like I can admire Ludwig von Beethoven or I can admire Werner von Braun. Even though
[38:04.240 --> 38:10.800]  he was a Nazi, I don't admire his politics. I admire his brain, his vision, that is the
[38:10.800 --> 38:17.800]  space shuttle program, the International Space Station program. Everything we basically
[38:17.800 --> 38:25.320]  have currently in the main NASA mission, it'd be like if some painter was a horrible person
[38:25.320 --> 38:33.560]  but was able to paint. I could admire that aspect of their mind, but not the whole person.
[38:33.560 --> 38:37.320]  And part of this whole politically correct movement is it lets the system say who someone
[38:37.320 --> 38:47.400]  was in some limited stereotype, some limited cliche, and we're all guilty of it. And then
[38:47.400 --> 38:52.480]  we're supposed to ignore the body of work of everything someone did before or after
[38:52.480 --> 38:58.400]  that moment because of one thing they said joking around on the radio or TV. Again, it
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.960]  shuts down debate, it chills discussion, it chills real intellectual pursuits and creates
[39:03.960 --> 39:10.640]  a nightmare civilization that will not be a civilization for very long. So chilling
[39:10.640 --> 39:21.520]  photos of Muhammad Ali, formerly Cassius Clay, those photos are linked up on infowars.com
[39:21.520 --> 39:29.080]  from the UK sign. Now here's what's really important. Let's talk about our real future.
[39:29.080 --> 39:34.520]  UN adopts education plan to indoctrinate children in globalism. Alex Newman has an article for
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.080]  the New American magazine up on infowars.com. I want to get him on the broadcast sometime
[39:38.080 --> 39:44.880]  this week or next week to talk about this plan for at least 30 minutes. The UN is demanding
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.440]  a demanding planetary education regime to transport children around the world into social
[39:50.440 --> 40:00.040]  justice warriors. And the United Nations is also setting up a system called Strong Cities
[40:00.040 --> 40:06.760]  Initiative worldwide in every major city, getting government taxpayer money through
[40:06.760 --> 40:14.080]  block grants, just like Akron, to run around and stir up racial and cultural divisions
[40:14.080 --> 40:20.080]  which are then managed by the UN and the local Democratic Party who then politically bully
[40:20.080 --> 40:25.880]  government into installing their people in the police departments mainly. Then the political
[40:25.880 --> 40:36.160]  persecution starts just like we just witnessed out in California. In San Jose alone, the
[40:36.160 --> 40:39.720]  mayor comes out and says, oh yeah, these people deserve what's happening to them that are
[40:39.720 --> 40:47.800]  getting beaten up. And the police came out and said in tweets Sunday, no, it's true.
[40:47.800 --> 40:56.320]  Yes, we stood down and let hundreds of people get beaten up by the anti-Trump demonstrators
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.720]  because we quote didn't want to escalate things. When you don't arrest people that are beating
[41:01.720 --> 41:08.040]  up women, men beating up a woman and beating her bloody in front of everyone, in front
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.400]  of police and reporters, that sends a message to criminals and thugs that you can go out
[41:14.400 --> 41:21.880]  and do it anytime you want. And I see the images of fire hoses and police dogs attacking
[41:21.880 --> 41:28.280]  women and men in Alabama and that makes me sick because those are humans organized with
[41:28.280 --> 41:32.680]  force attacking peaceful people. And I have empathy for them. But when I have empathy
[41:32.680 --> 41:38.240]  for white people or a white woman being beaten up by a mob of racist Hispanics waving Mexican
[41:38.240 --> 41:44.160]  flags, I'm a bad person. And the New York Times comes out and says the Trump people
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.480]  deserve it. I have the articles right here. I covered them yesterday on The Sunday Show.
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.960]  And they defend it and they say it's a good thing. Truly sickening. So you see where your
[41:55.960 --> 42:01.680]  free speech is going there, don't you? You see where the social justice warrior model
[42:01.680 --> 42:08.200]  is going. Remember San Francisco a few months ago there at the college, at the state college
[42:08.200 --> 42:16.960]  a young white freshman has dreadlocks, has adopted all the fake culture superimposed
[42:16.960 --> 42:29.520]  by Hollywood, even talks with a made up social justice warrior inner city dialect and gets
[42:29.520 --> 42:40.120]  beat up by two trendies who look like they're part African. And the video just says it all.
[42:40.120 --> 42:48.760]  It's just an excuse to be nasty, evil, mean thugs. And I have seen with my own eyeballs
[42:48.760 --> 42:55.400]  the KKK act like this to me not once, but twice. But there was a different response
[42:55.400 --> 42:59.760]  then. No fight happened. As I said, let's go. Your brains are about to be all over the
[42:59.760 --> 43:03.040]  ground. That's actually what I said. I'm not proud of it. That's how I was when I was
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.360]  16, 17 years old, especially four or five people, you know, just jump out of pickup
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.320]  trucks go, we're going to beat your butt, Yankee. I'm like, we'll get ready. But this
[43:12.320 --> 43:18.520]  is an effeminate man being a total trendy with total hate. And then this hateful guarantee
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.960]  I bet money she's got Mao Zedong books at home, probably hadn't read them though, literally
[43:22.960 --> 43:28.760]  bullying and getting in the face of this white person that's trying to be black. But you
[43:28.760 --> 43:36.360]  notice the groveling didn't get you any assimilation. And they don't support the free speech rights
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.880]  of the person with the camera. Let's put the article back up. I'll give radio listeners
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.000]  the name of the article from info wars.com if you want to see it. This is how these people
[43:45.000 --> 43:53.960]  operate. An exact same smirk of people that think they found a wimp of people that think
[43:53.960 --> 43:59.600]  they found somebody they can push around of people that think they're tough guys.
[43:59.600 --> 44:09.520]  Because granted, you know, when I was 16 years old, I probably weighed 170 pounds. I didn't
[44:09.520 --> 44:15.400]  look like the toughest guy around still three or four guys, not too smart. I mean, I'd look
[44:15.400 --> 44:21.940]  like a wimp. But if they wanted to fight, they would have gotten one just like the many fights
[44:21.940 --> 44:26.120]  people did get. And I'm nobody special. I'm just a man. You come looking for a fight,
[44:26.120 --> 44:32.400]  you put your hands on me, you're going to get a problem out of that abortion rally.
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.320]  If they wouldn't have pulled that guy off, you can see the video I was cranked back and
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.560]  in a split second was going to uppercut because the guy had already tried to hit me once and
[44:40.560 --> 44:47.560]  pushed me another time. And another time I saw him pushing some guy on crutches out
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.840]  in the road and I went over there and I couldn't but by then they ran off. They also ran away
[44:52.840 --> 44:56.880]  from jacari when I could tell jacari had had had enough because these people are cowards,
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.800]  ladies and gentlemen. I don't care if it's a bunch of devil worshiping communists that
[45:00.800 --> 45:07.920]  love abortion clinics. I don't care whether it's white supremacist. I don't care whether
[45:07.920 --> 45:16.840]  it's a bunch of trendy so-called black kids. I mean, those two black people, if you call
[45:16.840 --> 45:23.480]  them that, that's what they call themselves, getting in the face of that white kid, that
[45:23.480 --> 45:29.440]  white nerd. I mean, they don't look black to me. I mean, maybe 20% African. It's like
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.240]  saying I don't look Native American, even though I'm like 13% or something. I mean,
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.920]  this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with, like saying, you know, you're not Native
[45:38.920 --> 45:41.680]  American, I'm going to beat you up and be like, we don't look like that either. It's
[45:41.680 --> 45:48.200]  like, what are you appropriating? Who's that famous lady that thinks she's black and lied
[45:48.200 --> 45:53.640]  about it and then turned out, you know, that she has no African heritage? What's that woman's
[45:53.640 --> 46:00.920]  name? Yeah, Rachel Dozol, they put makeup on all this stuff. I mean, this is just crazy.
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.600]  Just be who you are. I get why they're saying they're mad at the white kid trying to appropriate
[46:06.600 --> 46:16.560]  their culture, but that's what freedom's all about, I thought, right? But this is the disaster
[46:16.560 --> 46:27.080]  zone that we've become. This is the system where all of our real freedoms are scrapped,
[46:27.080 --> 46:32.480]  but we're giving all these faux rights. But look at these headlines. Reuters, Hillary
[46:32.480 --> 46:38.640]  Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points. And everybody's freaking out about this, folks.
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.720]  That is a totally fake poll. There are scores of scientific polls out where he's three to
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.880]  four points ahead or a dead heat or two points behind. And a lot of people are intimidated
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.200]  and wouldn't say in a poll whether they're going to vote for Trump or not. This is the
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.560]  demographics that they are targeting for these polls. So don't let it create the perception
[46:56.560 --> 47:01.840]  that he's a loser. So then people turn against Trump because they want to be betting on the
[47:01.840 --> 47:08.560]  winning sports team. It's a well-known phenomenon that when a team is in the playoffs, you know,
[47:08.560 --> 47:12.480]  they double triple quadruple the sales. And if they win the playoffs and win the Super
[47:12.480 --> 47:20.960]  Bowl or win the World Cup or win the World Series, boom, they sell 10, 20, 30 times. You
[47:20.960 --> 47:25.640]  never know for a period of times. Everybody wants to be associated with winners. And that's
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.880]  how they create these fake political ideas and tell you, you're going to be a winner
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.680]  if you adopt this lifestyle, if you adopt this culture, if you adopt this system, if
[47:33.680 --> 47:40.760]  you go out and get two degrees, it doesn't matter if 90% of time those degrees are worthless.
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.680]  It doesn't matter if you adopt the political view. It's meant to disenfranchise you. You
[47:44.680 --> 47:49.320]  still feel like a winner, but wonder why it didn't make you successful. It must be because
[47:49.320 --> 47:57.920]  you didn't accept whatever you were being sold even more.
[47:57.920 --> 48:03.600]  Obama compares San Jose violence to bad habits of Republican Party and says it's the Republicans
[48:03.600 --> 48:11.560]  fault. Isn't that nice? Well, here's one. San Jose police, we held back from protecting
[48:11.560 --> 48:16.200]  Trump supporters from attack so as not to incite further violence. We started saying
[48:16.200 --> 48:19.200]  this back on Friday. We had the video, our listeners sent us video, two people said,
[48:19.200 --> 48:22.160]  oh, you're making that up. They, they didn't stand down. Really, there's video folks getting
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.200]  beat up right in front of the police 10 feet away. And here are the police tweet out that
[48:25.200 --> 48:31.840]  yes, they did that. What they're saying is we're going to allow this to go on. We're
[48:31.840 --> 48:38.160]  going to allow people to be sucker punched and women to be attacked. Homeland security
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.720]  using private contractor vans to transport and release illegal aliens inside the US.
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.400]  Judicial watch. Yes, judicial watches confirmed two years after a non Salazar kid Daniels
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.360]  and Jakari Jackson went down to the border and had the head of emergency management
[48:51.360 --> 48:57.040]  in McAllen, Texas, say it on tape in front of the buses being loaded up with the illegals.
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.400]  And then a month later, the board patrol came out and said that report is true. We are,
[49:00.400 --> 49:05.960]  we are ordered to complete the smuggling process. So I'm glad judicial watch got some documents
[49:05.960 --> 49:09.920]  to confirm that we already know with our own eyeballs. We don't need the police to tell
[49:09.920 --> 49:15.560]  us, yeah, we stood down. We know you stood down and you stood down because your bosses
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.960]  in the police department are anti American totalitarians and they want to shut free
[49:19.960 --> 49:25.120]  speech down in this country. Homeland security using private contractor vans to transport
[49:25.120 --> 49:30.560]  and release illegal aliens inside the US. Boom. Video shows same Mexican thug sucker punch
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.880]  two different victims in San Jose. People then say it is racist to say he's Mexican.
[49:35.880 --> 49:39.720]  It's like saying a white thug or a black thug. If it's racial, you point that out. It's like
[49:39.720 --> 49:46.640]  people say, Hey, the info war is the daily caller and Donald Trump are talking about
[49:46.640 --> 49:50.960]  this Mexican judge that keeps ruling against him and keeps ruling for illegals. The guys
[49:50.960 --> 49:56.600]  of is for Mexican nationalism. He's high level. La Raza. That's what it means. That's what
[49:56.600 --> 50:01.760]  it is. You're calling Trump a Nazi with no Nazi affiliations or connections. You've got
[50:01.760 --> 50:09.240]  a La Raza judge and the media says, well, it's okay for us to racially organize Hispanics.
[50:09.240 --> 50:15.840]  No, it's not. If we're going to be this plural society, then you have to go with that. You
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.200]  can't sit there and organize around racial policies and racial groups claiming you're
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.800]  a minority when you're a super majority on two continents and going to be 60% of the
[50:25.800 --> 50:31.560]  population in like 10 years. Most areas are to that. That's fine with me. We need to have
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.680]  folks adopt liberty, private property and things like that, which culturally, these
[50:36.680 --> 50:43.880]  groups are ready to do. That's why the globalist anthropologist and sociologist are in there
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.680]  at the school level, creating chip on the shoulder, race based nationalism at every
[50:48.680 --> 50:54.360]  perceived slight and real slides to forge people into a group you contain in race based
[50:54.360 --> 51:00.840]  barrios run by local mob boss chiefs who want to keep people under their control. Here's
[51:00.840 --> 51:06.800]  Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books and founder of the national chain
[51:06.800 --> 51:11.640]  Meyer clinics to tell you about to your health liquid vitamins. I've been taking these every
[51:11.640 --> 51:16.800]  day for over a decade now and I try to encourage every one of my clients to take them every
[51:16.800 --> 51:20.520]  day and there's a number of reasons. First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get.
[51:20.520 --> 51:24.240]  It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients in it. And then the most important
[51:24.240 --> 51:29.000]  reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients is because it's got brain
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  food in it. It's got the essential amino acid. It's got trypsin, philolamine, tyrosine,
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.280]  and choline, vitamin B6 and these chemicals that are all natural from food. Turn into
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.760]  the brain chemicals that make you happy. To your health is delicious. Find out more

[51:59.240 --> 52:05.600]  Hi, I'm 54 years of age and at Christmas time last year, a resident I take care of at work
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.240]  accidentally rolled over my right foot with his motorized skier. I was back into a corner
[52:10.240 --> 52:14.920]  and he put it in reverse and did it again. The bones in my foot weren't actually broken
[52:14.920 --> 52:19.120]  but damage was done. The remedy was to just let the foot heal on its own and this was
[52:19.120 --> 52:23.920]  expected to take many weeks. As a caregiver, I do a lot of walking and I was sort of okay
[52:23.920 --> 52:28.680]  when I was in motion. It's when I stopped to rest that I really felt the pain. The
[52:28.680 --> 52:33.720]  pain was there getting out of bed in the morning too. So I got on the one-world way and I just
[52:33.720 --> 52:38.800]  had to write this testimony. No more pain. Nothing. I can only attribute this to the
[52:38.800 --> 52:43.180]  one-world way since I haven't introduced anything else into my life. This product is a true
[52:43.180 --> 52:48.520]  God's end. It gives me energy and did whatever magic this stuff does to heal my poor foot.
[52:48.520 --> 52:56.640]  I will take one-world way for life. Mr. Lee Holly. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.

[53:11.240 --> 53:15.480]  statins, pain meds and antidepressants. And no, water treatment plants are not equipped
[53:15.480 --> 53:19.440]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out. Protect your family's water supply with a

[54:17.920 --> 54:30.480]  Look at this. It's up on infowars.com. Communist Angela Davis. We have to do whatever is necessary
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.600]  to stop Donald Trump, 1960s radical supports, Black Lives Matter. This is at a meeting with
[54:35.600 --> 54:41.800]  Gloria Steinem of the Central Intelligence Agency. That's declassified. People think I'm joking
[54:41.800 --> 54:49.440]  when I say that. Look it up. And they go on to say here are the tweets. All you Warchester
[54:49.440 --> 54:54.880]  gangsters and whatnot, you clearly have a mission on Wednesday killed Donald Trump.
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.320]  That's what one of our supporters at the meeting said. And people just tweaked this by the thousands
[54:59.320 --> 55:05.200]  and nothing's done. And then all these ignorant people show up at Trump rallies believing
[55:05.200 --> 55:11.280]  they're confronting racism because the media has branded the Tea Party movement as racist.
[55:11.280 --> 55:16.440]  So anyone promoting free market is now racist forever. You are walled off now to be controlled
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.920]  by communist and globalist programming at the university level. They're telling you
[55:20.920 --> 55:27.840]  your role. They're telling you who you are. You're a woman, so you support Gloria Steinem.
[55:27.840 --> 55:35.040]  You're Black, so you hate Donald Trump. You're Hispanic, so you hate Trump. Because Trump
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.120]  pointed out that Mexico is completely nationalist, controls its own borders, and says it wants
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.200]  to quote reconquer the Southwest and is dumping its criminals on us. Now, does that mean you
[55:43.200 --> 55:47.920]  don't have a bunch of people going to Trump rallies, maybe 10% that they're racist? Absolutely.
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.880]  Probably. So what? Anybody who's Black, Hispanic, whatever, you know there's tons of people
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.320]  in your quote group that are racist. And generally, the more uneducated and dumb they are, the
[55:58.320 --> 56:07.560]  more they're into that. And I want to be clear. Anglos are not having children anywhere in
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.520]  the world. Neither are the Japanese. Any advanced civilization stops having kids. Is it a project?
[56:12.520 --> 56:16.840]  Is it a program? Who knows? It's a little of both. People get lazy. They don't want to
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.960]  take care of kids. And the whole world's being set up to where it's hard to take care of
[56:21.960 --> 56:28.520]  kids. But then you come in and inherit a civilization freedom. It isn't perfect, but better than
[56:28.520 --> 56:32.680]  what you've had. Do you want to inherit that? Or do you want to go buy what the universities
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.520]  tell you? That you want to inherit Mao Zedong? And Obama comes and tells you in Argentina
[56:37.520 --> 56:42.840]  you know, you need communism. Yeah, like you need a bullet in the head. How's Venezuela
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.040]  working out? They're just sitting there selling you a slave system as if it's trendy and
[56:48.040 --> 56:58.240]  cool and using race-based systems to control you and to flavor the bait. That's it. And
[56:58.240 --> 57:03.880]  these are people that use race-based politics before, but it failed in the 50s and 60s.
[57:03.880 --> 57:07.560]  And so now they're desperate trying to do it from a minority perspective because you're
[57:07.560 --> 57:12.480]  the majority. And if they can sell a racist agenda on that, it'll work great because whites
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.520]  on average will still be per capita the wealthiest group because they had the brainchild of a
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.560]  system that made more money. They were taught to save money. Now they'll have to be protected
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.840]  by the political class. They will go into a hardened defense mode and a new apartheid
[57:27.840 --> 57:34.320]  will be set up over everyone else. And you're all walking into it. You're walking into a
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.600]  total trap. Then down the road, the apartheid system won't be called that. We'll be shut
[57:39.600 --> 57:46.800]  down and the whole civilization will be imploded. Let me stop right there just briefly. If you're

[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.600]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:18.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. We've got Rob Do and Josh Owens out in Germany
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.880]  covering Bilderberg in the migrant camps. They're coming up in the next segment. We've
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.320]  got a bunch of our crew, including Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs out on the west coast
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:29.000]  for the anti-free speech hysteria there. We've got a bunch of other crew being sent
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.400]  out. I am a skeleton crew here and I'm not literally liking myself to Hitler except
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.840]  for the fact that I'm in my bunker and have limited forces and I'm trying to give orders
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.780]  to armies that don't exist. But there is so much I want to do. We're working seven days
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:50.000]  a week right now. I worked seven days this week. Nico Acosta worked seven days a week.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.920]  Ali did. Matt, this whole great crew back here. I just want to single them out for your
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.600]  support, your prayers. You name it because people send me all this fan mail, big stacks
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.480]  of it every week. I appreciate it. I look at it. It's great. All these gifts. Hey, think
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.080]  about the crew, reporters or whoever. Everybody should adopt somebody on the crew and just
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.920]  tell them what you think about them because we love you. You can hear from us that we
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.640]  care about you. I just also just thought that's another way to point out how important this
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.960]  crew is and the work they're doing. Now, it just hit me during the break. Something
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.520]  that I know, but that I really need to say loud and clear and say it a lot and something
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.680]  that I'm going to advise Roger Stone to do the next time he talks to Donald Trump or
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:43.360]  the next time that let's just say I'm able to talk to folks with a campaign. But before
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.080]  I do that, I just want to get Darren McBreen's attention who has taken on, you know, the job
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.560]  of like three or four more people while the crew is out of town. And then that goes for
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.600]  Jacari and everybody else. They're all just really up in their game even more to help
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.640]  get all the videos out, the reports, the research, the articles, just everybody in this crew.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.800]  But it really hit me during that 72nd break and it's so profound. You know, a thought
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.120]  can be in just a split second, but it's like a volume of material. So I'll try to crystallize
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.440]  this down.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.320]  The most powerful weapon Donald Trump has isn't just these anti-political correct. It
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.440]  isn't that he just speaks like a common person. It isn't that he's just pushing basic common
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.560]  sense populism. It's that currently at his rallies that I've seen the raw footage of
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:38.480]  that we have on M4s.com. It's got to be a third or 40% of the people going in the doors
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:50.600]  are Hispanic. And it's got to be 10, 20, 30% are black and a lot are Asian. Now, this is
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.200]  so exciting because they have pushed this racism narrative to the 1000th degree. And
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.360]  quite frankly, people are scared. There's a little bit of xenophobia going on. That's
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.960]  pretty much common sense at a point when people are saying, ah, foreign flags are going to
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.320]  get you. I kill you and the government's running. And I mean, people that haven't been, quote,
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.560]  racist are getting a little bit, hey, I'm scared, which I wouldn't call racism. It's
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.520]  just called normal tribalism. That starts getting activated.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.600]  And so Trump pushed a little bit of those buttons. Let's be honest about it because
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.440]  of the left pushing them on their side. And I'm not even defending that. I think you went
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.040]  a little too far sometimes, but that's just because I just straight shoot folks. I can't
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.280]  sit here and think up what I'm going to say. It's just whatever I'm really thinking you
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.520]  get it. There is no filter with me to a really bad point because if I want to use cuss words,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.280]  I've never been a big cusser, but now I get really upset about things. I will start cussing
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.160]  and they have to lay it out because it's just I'm so real that when they got salon pushing
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.440]  pedophilia in one article and then saying, I'm a liar in the other, listen you people,
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.680]  I'm tired of you. I mean, I've really had enough of it. I really disdain you. I'd detest
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.600]  you, but it's a complex thought, but super simple. I want to try to just put it out there
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.680]  as best I can.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:09.800]  The fact that they've done everything they can for 10 years to say the Tea Party is racist
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.360]  is very successful last four or five years and almost having no quote minorities at Tea
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:23.200]  Party events. When I can tell you the Tea Party is a libertarian based grassroots prohuman
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.920]  overall movement.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.880]  And the fact that the media could brand it that minorities aren't welcome there and then
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:37.160]  they don't go and then minorities see there's no minorities there. That is how you run a
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.520]  con job. That's their greatest victory because now you've branded anything Americana, anything
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:49.720]  freedom based, anything free market progine, whatever as white and evil. You've just stolen
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:56.720]  a birthright from all these people and done a huge mind job on them. And may all the white
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.600]  people think communism has a brown face.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:10.160]  This year the Bilderberg global elite are meeting in Germany where they'll likely discuss how
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.600]  to stop the UK from leaving the EU, the growing resistance against the destruction of Western
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.400]  culture and the mass evasion of Muslim migrants, and the rise of Donald Trump. The mood at Bilderberg
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.600]  would be very grim as both populism and nationalism rise up across the world to stop globalism.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.000]  Europeans in particular are tired of having their lives controlled by the unelected bureaucracy
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.920]  known as the European Union, which was based on Adolf Hitler's plan for a European superstate
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.680]  which eradicates national sovereignty. The Bilderberg group has been nurturing the EU
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.360]  the life since the 1950s and now they see their despotic regime dying. Maybe it'll be a wake
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.600]  up call for some of the elite. There's more to existence than simply controlling others.

[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:19.160]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:29.640]  to Alex Jones. Coming up, why is there suddenly such a huge push for Mark of the Beast technology?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.120]  Michael Snyder, the American Dream blog, asked that question. Storiesuponinfowars.com. And
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.600]  I'm glad somebody pointed that out because I used to harp on this 20 years ago, 15 years
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:45.040]  ago I made films about it. Now it is just all over the news. ABC News, NBC News, Fox News,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.600]  like microchips for your kids. You know it's inevitable. That's the talking point because
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.560]  they're getting rid of cash. They're bringing in this control grid. They're going to use
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:59.480]  flooded borders, massive al-Qaeda, ISIS sleeper cell attacks in the future to push this idea.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.480]  Huge identity theft scandals where governments and big corporations dump your identities
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:09.360]  out there by design so that you've got to be face scanned or biometrically identified
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.160]  to make sure your credit card or number is really being used by you. That will then also
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:21.160]  be an internet ID and be used to track, trace and control everything you do. The power to
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.200]  tax is the power to destroy. But then on top of that, they'll be able to kick you off the
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.000]  internet with three strikes and then your identity will basically be gone. No one will
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.120]  be able to basically speak for you. They will have total control. That is their admitted
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:45.400]  master jewel in the crown plan. And boy, I tell you, if John the Revelator on the Isle
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:55.960]  of Patmos envisioning all of this 2000 years ago wasn't psychic, time traveler, super
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.800]  clairvoyant, you know, given a vision by God, he was one of the greatest science fiction
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:09.280]  writers of all time. No, no one started writing science fiction like that's the last sixty
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:18.080]  seventy years, folks. He wrote it 2000 years ago. But it doesn't matter. Depeche Mode has
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:25.160]  a song making fun of him saying he stole his God from the Muslims. The Muslims didn't
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.240]  exist for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:35.080]  hundreds and hundreds of years until after he died. In fact, can we go out with John the
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:41.840]  Revelator, put him in an elevator, take him up to the higher? You know what's funny, though?
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.040]  I love Depeche Mode. Incredible artist, great music on my favorite bands. It's just I hate
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.720]  it when I'm singing along to a song that sounds so good. I love it when it's a lie. But you
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:11:03.200]  know what? It feels good, doesn't it? John the Revelator couldn't even hardly walk while
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:11.240]  he was having those visions for days. By the way, you read about Ezekiel. In Ezekiel, this
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:20.120]  was written 3000 years ago, at least. And he sees giant craft with four spinning wheels
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:28.200]  of fire, land and huge blue craft come off with crystal coverings over their heads and
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:36.840]  blue skin. He gets on his knee and the angel tells him, take this so you understand him.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:45.240]  He takes this pill and then has these visions. I mean, what is that? And it's all hiding
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.840]  in plain view. And the churches all go, we'll explain that. It's all figurative and we don't
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.320]  want anyone to look at it. Don't go there. Okay. That's what the maces at the higher
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.600]  level are covering up, folks. Because the public, they don't think and handle it all.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:08.760]  And I'm not even going there. I'm just saying this is what the elite actually believe. And
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.720]  a guy 2000 years ago said, when you start seeing this, look out, they're going to set
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.720]  up a world government with 10 sub regions, three mega regions and this number of leaders
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:25.240]  that give their power to a God man who will be seen everywhere in the town squares and
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:36.240]  in the homes as a 3D creature that is see through holograms. The next rollout, the next
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.080]  televisions are all hologram based. It's all happening. Speaking of technology, we take
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:49.800]  you now live to Germany. Do we have the guys in place yet? They're a little bit late getting
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.560]  in place where they are. They were in Dresden. Yes, they're there. We've got the feed. Let's
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:03.480]  let them get in place. And then as soon as dues ready, give me a Roger, okay? Copy that.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:10.720]  Good. Think about somebody 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, watching a slash radio show.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.560]  No wars. It's radio you watch. And I would say that I would be in studio in Austin talking
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.040]  to anybody that wanted to dial in in the world that has the technology that's ubiquitous
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.560]  and that we could be in Dresden, Germany at a nationalist rally. We're going to see if
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.120]  these are all white supremacists like we've been told. I don't see one white supremacist
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.560]  there. If you don't want your country wide open, people coming in that rape your women,
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.800]  telling you you've got to submit to them. I don't see any Nazi regalia except for that
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.200]  skull and bones flag. I don't know. That's a Nazi flag, but usually the death set is
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.240]  associated with that. So we'll see exactly what it says. Probably the Fed there to discredit
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.640]  them because if there's one of those flags there, Merkel then claims she can shut down
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.880]  the whole event. But then she's gone further than that just shutting them down, period.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:08.200]  And reactivating the Stasi. I see some state flags. I see some we're going to go to them
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.720]  live here in just a moment. You're going to be a radio listener in full wars.com forward
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.440]  slash show. And then coming up, I'm going to get to the attacks on free speech here
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.360]  in the United States that are intensifying. I'm going to get into Hillary Clinton, obviously
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.720]  in deep trouble with another Secret Service agent with a book coming out that basically
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.080]  documents everything that an FBI agent 16, 17 years ago said he witnessed there. Remember
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.240]  the crack pipes, the mousey tongue stuff hanging on the Christmas tree. People said,
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.680]  that's crazy. And then later the White House said, okay, we did it just for fun. It's a
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.720]  joke. Just like Google a few weeks ago had mousey tongue stuff on his front page celebrating
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.800]  mousey tongue on their front page. You know, on December 25th, they show a Christmas tree,
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.440]  not a cross. But when it's a mouse a tongue holiday, they show us mouse a tongue worship.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.320]  A guy that killed 80 plus million people. I mean, how freakazoid is that? Can't show
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:09.040]  a cross. We can show you mouse a tongue. Can't have me a little drummer boy. We can have
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.600]  us a mouse to turn greatest murder in history of his own people. I've actually seen news
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.680]  articles going Alex Jones was bashing mouse a tongue in the communist Chinese again today
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.400]  because he doesn't like Asians. Yeah, I don't like a guy that killed 84 million Asians.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.440]  And I'm not going to use my race card. I'd be like, who's this Korean girl? You say your
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.840]  sister suddenly on TV with you. We didn't know that. Well, that's because in my 20 years
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.000]  on air, I might have said it 10, 15 times because it's not a race card. It's my sister
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.560]  adopted. But I just, oh, I'm so sick of it all. I'm so tired of it. It's such idiocy.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:48.000]  You kill 84 million Asians. You're a great guy. You're against it. You're a racist.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.920]  We've lost our Skype fee. We're going to get back up in a moment and go to them.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.560]  Before I go any further though, obviously it is extremely expensive to have Rob Do and
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.640]  Josh Owens and Paul Watson who's about to be there in Germany. This is a news organization
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.480]  of over 50 people now. And I need to really get a couple more camera folks and I need
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.560]  to get some more editors to be able to just get the bottleneck done and also a few more
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.160]  writers to go through all the news we're gathering and actually get it out. There's a lot of
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.440]  bombshell stuff, but just, you know, throw up 15 videos in one article and not even have
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.080]  time to look at them. Just this is incredible. And there's just unbelievable gold exposing
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.200]  the new world order there. But that's when he listers to go through everything we do
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.160]  and flag it for us and help us and post it to other sites and write articles about it
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.040]  and put it on other video sites. And so many times, folks, you'll take one of our videos
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.720]  off our YouTube channel or our Facebook channel or our daily motion channel. You'll post it
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.560]  on your little YouTube channel that might have had a hundred thousand views over the
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.360]  years and they'll get 10 million views because they've got algorithms in there blocking our
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:05.840]  videos. Yes, we have a monetized YouTube channel. It doesn't pay for, it might pay for four
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.840]  days of operation a month. It might pay for the money I got to spend. That channel with
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:20.000]  and we're talking 25, 30 million views a month on one channel conservatively. And it might
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  pay to run this office three, four days. The money we make each month off YouTube helps
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.840]  fund a few days, maybe two or three. Okay, that's the nut I've got to crack. And by the
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.880]  way, I'm not complaining. We do this in Texas where it's inexpensive. You know, we try to
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.760]  pair people decent though. I need everybody to go to m4warstore.com and buy Hillary for
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.080]  the prison shirt. Why would you not do it when this witch is trying to take the country
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.040]  over and destroy free speech and in talk radio and the internet as we know it and saying
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.200]  she wants to ban guns today? I've got the video saying that, you know, the government can
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:18:00.160]  restrict them. Because if they haven't already done it enough. So go to m4warstore.com, get
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.160]  the limited edition Hillary for prison shirt. We also have two specials on the Alexa pure
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:11.040]  breeze that the sale ends 26% off that ends today. There'll still be a great deal at,
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:17.520]  you know, 220 something bucks. But it's over 25% off right now for stage filtration system.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.560]  It is $184 and 99 cents and the profit we make helps fund this operation that the air
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.640]  is so toxic, folks, you're crazy if you don't get one of these and put one in every room
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:32.120]  if you can afford it. We also this is the last day for 20% off on lung cleanse because
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.920]  it will sell out today. As I predicted, we won't get more in for a month. It's an amazing
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.400]  essential oil combination that is the best out there in my view. And when my throat scratchy
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.000]  or I've got a sore throat or whatever it just it works better than anything I've ever tried
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.880]  before and I'm in broadcasting. I've tried a lot of stuff in 4warstore.com and 4warslife.com
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:55.640]  or call toll free 888-253-3139. Tell do he's got four minutes. We're going to go to break
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:02.520]  and when I'm going to come back and go right to him. So again, infowarslife.com. Brain force
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.560]  is excellent as well. You've heard the Ray reviews of that survival shield X2, secret
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.120]  12. Most people don't absorb vitamin B12 in the gut anymore because of the toxicity, all
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.960]  the chemicals, the GMOs, for whatever reason, look up the studies. But if you put it under
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.280]  your tongue for about a minute, you absorb a lot of it almost like it's a shot. And this
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.840]  is the exact stuff people inject, but I don't inject this is not designed for that. It's
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.640]  methylcobalamin, 80% of its status. Another Acena dillcobalamin or however you pronounce
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:34.200]  it is the top type that helps you absorb the other. So it's designed for maximum absorption,

[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:56.520]  from Dresden, Germany, straight ahead at the site of a nationalist rally, which Merkel
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.820]  has said is illegal. These are people braving threat of arrest.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:06.440]  Are you concerned about the power grid, about the new war on the power grid? If so, this
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.280]  will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable. Here's
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.760]  why an important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just

[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.720]  Fresh liquid way was so valuable to the improvement of health that in the 1800s, there were 160
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.640]  spas set up in Germany, Switzerland and Austria to dispense fresh liquid way to the sick and
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.080]  aged. The results were restored health and a return of youth. Fresh liquid way supplies
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:18.800]  the most easily digested of all proteins and ranks higher in protein value than the egg.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.760]  Unfortunately, the current methods of processing the way causes proteins to twist, fold and
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.880]  become denatured. This makes them non-functional in the body. Like a lock and key, proteins
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.040]  do not work in the body unless they retain the shape that nature gave them. We at synergistic
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.960]  nutrition believe that our technological enhancements restore the protein structures
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.120]  of our way to the shapes that nature originally gave them. The results that One World Way
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:46.000]  has generated for so many over several years now testifies that One World Way is producing
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.520]  very positive results. For a limited time, one or more of the flavors or sizes of One

[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.320]  Rob Doe is in Dresden. They've just started meeting at the town center and have just started
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:32.480]  marching and there I'm told it's going to be marching into some of the illegal alien
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.440]  invasion centers. We've had the German police and security forces try to tell Doe and crew
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.520]  they're not allowed to interview people or allowed to cover things even from outside
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.760]  the refugee centers. This is the attack on free speech. We now take you to Rob Doe. Rob
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.520]  Doe. Thank you for joining us. How was your trip to Germany and what have you witnessed
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.800]  so far? Well, I feel like I haven't slept much. We've been doing a lot of traveling.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.440]  We started off in Munich and as you saw from the video yesterday, we went to one of the
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.360]  migrant centers. We went to a couple and there weren't any people outside. The third one
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.960]  we went to, there were several people outside. We went and tried to talk to two men from
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:14.080]  Afghanistan, fighting age men of course, young men and immediately the staff tore out of
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.280]  the building at us, started screaming at us, grabbing us, pushing our cameras down. It
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.520]  was a pretty hostile situation. We happen to be with an activist named Michael Studentberger
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.440]  who's with the Free German Party, a very small group but very anti-immigration. In fact,
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.240]  he was just speaking at the event here in this town square. You can see he was flanked
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.520]  by women wearing hip jabs who obviously they were fake. They were there for protesting.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:44.680]  But now it looks like everybody's about to march around the city. There's a lot of flags,
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.320]  a lot of German flags. I think I'm not sure what that is. That might be a Bavarian flag.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:55.960]  I also see also see Merkel depicted as a Nazi. So I haven't seen any exactly Nazi flags.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.560]  I did shoot a, I shot a quick video of that. Merkel as a Nazi, there's a guy wearing a
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.120]  shirt right there as Merkel as a Nazi. Maybe we can get a close up shot of him. There's
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.960]  a sign right there. Josh, see the sign?
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]  Yes, I see it. Good job.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.960]  Sorry about that.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.840]  Did you have any trouble getting into Germany when you told me you were there to cover Bilderberg?
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.240]  No. No one has said anything yet. In fact, when we went through customs, it was, how
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:20.960]  long are you going to be here? Where are you going? And that was it. They didn't really
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.360]  want to know much more. And so they, they sent us on our way. Have had no problems yet.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.240]  We are checking into the hotel Bilderberg this afternoon. We just arrived into Dresden.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.080]  We had a long, it was a little bit longer drive than we thought from Nuremberg to Nuremberg
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.800]  to Dresden. But we did have an interesting interview today. We stopped in a small town
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.080]  of about 40,000 people where they house about 11 migrant, 1000 migrants.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.080]  Illegal invaders brought him out of the EU to break the border. Go ahead.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:55.120]  Exactly. Josh, you can make it up here. We, we stopped and talked and this time we went
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.560]  and talked to him and one of the guys spoke English and he talked to us. We did a 25 minute
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.120]  interview that we're about to post. We're going to post half of it. And then right now
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.480]  edited down and then we're going to post the rest in a couple of days. But his name was
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.680]  Mohamed and he was from Syria and most of the people there were from Syria. And he explained
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.640]  why most of the men that were fighting age that were coming in from his point of view.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:20.280]  He also had some interesting things to say about Assad and how he is treated by the German
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.880]  people. They, they, he said, they were looked down on. We don't feel welcome here. And I,
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.200]  and I said, well, so what do you get? And they go, well, we get free housing. We get
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:33.080]  free food. We don't have to worry about anything, but I don't really like it here. So you're
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.040]  given these people pretty much everything to live and they still are not happy. But he
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.040]  said he does want to integrate and he is for, you know, people integrating. So there, it's
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:47.000]  a long interview. And I think this will put to rest any, any notion that, you know, enforces
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.280]  this racist opposition. We're just screaming at people.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.480]  Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal. That's fine. No one is ever going to stop saying that
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.040]  no matter what we do. So that's fine to show the big long form things and be fair. The
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.920]  truth is some of these immigrants aren't bad people, but they're being brought in to bring
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:07.120]  down the civilization. It's a globalist project. So they always make it about the people themselves
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.600]  instead of why it's being done. And so we're big picture. That's, that's what we're doing.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.160]  The truth is they don't, you're not even allowed to go to Saudi Arabia, Rob. Okay. And we're
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.160]  across around your neck. They have police that will come up and tell you cover it up.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.040]  So these people aren't inclusive to us and we're not here to pay for everything because
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.360]  the EU wants to break our countries. Yes, totally agree with you, Alex. 100% with
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:34.440]  you on there. And from, from what I'm gathering, this happens every first Monday of the month
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.400]  is what you could see is going on right now. People mass demonstrating against the anti
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.400]  immigration, anti migration policy. And what is that?
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.640]  By the way, I don't see any skinheads, any Nazi flags. He's like normal people.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.200]  What is this sign saying in English? Well, as I said, make up for the cruel and the votes
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.520]  on the backup. All right. That's an anti builder burger sign right there. Exactly. Oh, yeah,
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.480]  we know we're here to cover it. So some good job. So you got anti globalist to get the
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.240]  program. You got a bunch of nationalists, people with state flags. I saw one that has
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.760]  a skull and crossbones, but it says something on the top that could be fascist related,
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:16.360]  but that's their right. If they have any free speech, but let's find out.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.920]  I saw at least two, there's one there and I'll see if I can find another one close. I have
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.320]  a sneaky suspicion. That's just some party, but and I did see a couple flat of the Nazi
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.040]  symbol with a slash through it right now. So you can see everybody's spotting out now.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.480]  They're going to march around the city. We also have an interview we did in the Munich
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.040]  train station with the free German party candidates about to come up. Those interviews take a
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.120]  little bit longer because we've been driving and editing, you've done a fabulous job. You
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.600]  guys get to the hotel now that that's been announced because they had thrown me out of
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.000]  that because they're a week early now. Get in there, get that Intel, go to the migrant
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.480]  camps. Great job. Stay there. My friend, we'll come back to you on the run. Alex Jones and

[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:17.800]  against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know, a bunch
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:38.880]  of, you know, it sounds funnier. The tweets are provocative. He's trying to make Trump
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:43.600]  look bad, but he won't be debating Trump. Hillary will. Well, first of all, they're
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.760]  just words. She reads off a teleprompter. You notice she's reading off a teleprompter.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:53.600]  She always does. She really doesn't have her own words. It should be fun.

[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:29.120]  The Germans are waking up to globalism in the new world order. Marches every day across the country, the same thing in France. It's a globalist project to destroy Europe and merge it with the Middle East accelerates facing total extinction. Will the West?
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:34:10.120]  At least get up on its knees and attempt to fight back. The answer is yes. Going back to Dresden, Germany, we're there to cover Bilderberg coming up in three days. We'll cover Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right through Sunday. Rob Duh and Josh Owens are there. Our other reporters are going to be popping into Mara at big rallies out in California.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:26.120]  The president of the United States, Michael Duh, has been dispatched. She wanted to go and she said, hey, that's a little sexist. I was like, why don't you get beat up? Okay, yes, I don't send a woman where she can get beat up. I send guys. And I guess it's true. I said, okay, Leigh Ann, but she goes, well, how far should I go? And I'm like, yeah, exactly.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:39.120]  I mean, I don't want Leigh Ann to get her nose broken or something, but she went. She went. Okay, well, I don't think Gloria Steinem's going to be pleased though, because these communists are targeting women, but Joe Biggs is there to protect her.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:54.120]  Oh, I'm sorry. That's sexist. A man's going to help a woman. Going back to Rob Duh and Josh Owens. Rob, great videos you've been filing. Amazing. This one on the original Trump wall in Germany. Tell folks about that. Tell us what happened during the break.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:09.120]  Yeah, we found a medieval castle after we interviewed that migrant Mohammed down in Newmark. They're on this hill. There's like these ruins of a castle. So we went up to check it out and we decided to shoot a report there and we shot some amazing footage we'll be putting up as well later.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:20.120]  But Alex, take a look at this. Thousands of people marching for anti-immigration. Now watch this. We're going to turn around. I've found Bernie Sanders supporters here in Germany. German Bernie Sanders supporters right here.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:35.120]  You can see they have the refugees welcome sign. They've got their little sign. I guess they're against nationalism. But you can see maybe about 40, 50 at the most. They're chanting and they've got the communist flag right there.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:45.120]  So these are communist leftists here that are pro illegal immigration and pro migration. They want to fund this stuff. They want to basically sell their future down the river because they've been told.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.120]  Let's show a little more attention to that blonde police officer for a moment, please.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  Yeah, it kind of reminds me of Austria last year. So once again, they are wearing their jumpsuits. We'll get another shot over this way. But you can see.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  Now, let's show the sense of the numbers. You've got maybe 50 leftist and brainwashed mainstream media viewers, punk rockers, anarchist communists, stuff like that. Not even a 50, like maybe 35. And then across the street, it looks like a two mile long line of thousands and thousands and thousands of people marching.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:34.120]  This line has been moving for about five minutes. It's several, probably 20 people thick as it moves. And there's no stop. There's no sign of this line ending. So you can see the very small pro immigration rally. And then here in Dresden, you have this large.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  Let's go back to that female police officer.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120]  What was that Alex?
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.120]  I'm serious. Let's go back to the female police officer.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:51.120]  I'm sorry. I've had a little fun folks. I apologize. No, no. Feel free to ask anybody speaks English and see if they want to talk to her to see what she thinks.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:54.120]  I don't think they're allowed to talk. I could go.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.120]  I don't care. Just go talk to her.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.120]  But you know what? I think I'm going to go talk to one of these migratinium speaking.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:06.120]  It's like you're a Mars rover. I can't be there, but you're going up to check out the intelligent life here.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.120]  We're sending the rover in.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:12.120]  Anybody speak English? Want to come over and talk?
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  Freckles in Deutsch?
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.120]  Freckles.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.120]  Anybody want to talk? You want to come over here?
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.120]  Come over here. Speak for your people.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.120]  If anybody wants to come talk, tell me why they're a pro.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.120]  Why don't you go into them?
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  Okay. Here comes one of them.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120]  Speak English?
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.120]  All right.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.120]  This guy is a trendie. He's supposed to pick women up.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.120]  What's the name of your group? Why are you here?
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:39.120]  Pegida is versus the refugees, which come to Germany and to Dresden.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.120]  And we are here to say no to Pegida because we want the refugees.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.120]  We want to help the people who come here.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.120]  And these people just...
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:55.120]  So how many refugees do you want to come here?
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.120]  A million came last year.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.120]  I'm fine with that.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:06.120]  But I think German does not lose something on his image or his money or his culture because
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:07.120]  the refugees come here.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  I think the refugees are good for Germany.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.120]  He wants a tax raise to pay for them.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.120]  Is that what he said?
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  What about the taxes that it's going to take to house them?
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  Because right now they're housing them and giving them food.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.120]  They're not actually working.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120]  They're not integrating into your society.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:30.120]  They may not work. They are forbidden to work.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.120]  Ask him if he wants Sharia law.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.120]  If we should let them mediate their women and make them wear hoods over their heads.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  That's when it's okay how they treat their women.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.120]  What about in Muslim countries the way they treat their women?
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.120]  Do you think that's okay to do that here?
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.120]  What?
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.120]  The way they treat their women, make them cover up, they can beat them, they can stone them.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.120]  I think this is a kind of education which we have to bring them nearer.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]  That's right.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  They have to be educated.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  Explain that.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  They don't assimilate anywhere.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  Explain.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.120]  They're the most unassimilatable people.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.120]  Yes.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  It does change their religion.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.120]  Explain to this ding-dong that they're unassimilatable.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120]  You cannot assimilate these people.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]  Changing what they...
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  Tell them this.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.120]  Her dress like that would be illegal under these people.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120]  This woman would have to wear a hood over her head.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:24.120]  They really want to stay here and let their only way to survive or one of the ways to survive.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.120]  Where's the money going to come from though to pay for others?
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  Germany is rich.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120]  Germany has money.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.120]  No, you've got a deficit.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.120]  That's the problem with socialism.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.120]  You eventually run out of other people's money.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.120]  Do not think that the people have to stay.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.120]  Ask this guy what he does.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  Ask this guy what he does.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.120]  Germany is rich.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.120]  In fact, what do you do?
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.120]  What's your job?
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.120]  I'm student.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  You're a student?
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  Yes.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.120]  Really much, yes.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:03.120]  But the future, that were the people who want to live in this Germany with the wages.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  This guy will be given a job later over people that work.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.120]  This is a gun parasite.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120]  It's so stupid.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.120]  He doesn't know he's one.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.120]  Bring up the blonde police officer and she'll have to wear a beekeeper suit.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  Say, do you understand the Muslims take over?
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  This woman could even be a police officer.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120]  Ask the idiot.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120]  Ask the police officer?
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120]  No, ask him.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.120]  Ask him if he realizes she'd have to wear a hood over her head.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.120]  Do you realize if Sharia law happened here, if you brought in enough refugees that they would be the majority?
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  Women like this and over here would have to wear hoods over their heads.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  Because they're changing the laws whenever they become a majority.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.120]  They're doing this in Michigan, they're trying to institute Sharia law in some of the states in the United States.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.120]  It doesn't understand the question.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120]  Hey, interview that blonde reporter right behind you.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.120]  She's walking around beside you.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  Josh knows who she is.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.120]  To your left, Josh.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.120]  That's Lauren Southern.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120]  Hey, Lauren, we're live on the air.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.120]  Okay, we'll see you from Canada.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  So what have you been in your investigations?
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.120]  In my investigations, I mean, I've talked to a few people.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  They just seem like Germans concerned about the Islamification of their country.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.120]  And I mean, I've heard a lot online that they're racists, that they're Nazis.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.120]  But I interviewed a few people that have the giant anti Swastika signs.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.120]  And I asked them, are you pro or against Vegeta?
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.120]  And they said, we love Vegeta.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]  We love Vegeta.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.120]  And they were anti fascists, right?
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:26.120]  The people here that you're filming, no one is replying to me.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.120]  I don't know if they're replying to you.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  I talked to one guy.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120]  He's a student.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.120]  And I think most of the people here are students basically from the Bernie Sanders class.
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  It looks like, give us free, give us as much free as you can is what they seem to be saying
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.120]  because they think they could take more migrants.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.120]  Like baby birds, more free, never had jobs.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.120]  It's so predictable.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.120]  Bombs.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.120]  I've talked to a few students as well.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.120]  And one of the students, I just can't believe how racist this is.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:56.120]  A lot of people don't seem to understand that Islam is a religion and not a race, right?
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.120]  And the details that they're not interested in.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.120]  Or that it treats women like animals.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.120]  He's like, we can't judge people and we don't know about them.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.120]  And he said, I've never read the Quran, so I can't judge them, right?
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  I'm like, well, maybe you should talk to them.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.120]  Rob, do you announce where you are too?
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  Maybe there's a reason people are gathered in large numbers here at the rally.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.120]  Maybe there's a reason people are against the Islamification of their country.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.120]  Exactly.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.120]  Where we're at now is in Dresden, Germany.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.120]  We were at the town, one of the town squares here where they had a giant.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.120]  What do you estimate about 3,000, 4,000 people?
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.120]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  I mean, and the crowd kept growing the entire time I was there.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.120]  The march it got huge.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.120]  So I think we're going to go, do you know where they're marching to?
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  That way.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.120]  All right, I think we're going to go try to keep up with them.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.120]  This looks like it's dying down.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.120]  They're pulling up their banner.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:43.120]  I think they have to go somewhere else and beg for free food or something.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.120]  So we're going to leave the socialists alone.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120]  Gosh, they're so stupid and they think they're so intellectual.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  All right, well, it's good to see Laura Southern there.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  We just had her on last week.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  She was censored by Facebook for daring to engage in free speech.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.120]  And for just saying something might get censored.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  Yeah, they took her page away.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.120]  But then after people got angry and I guess enough people, you know,
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.120]  I put it out on the internet and I think we talked about it.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  We put it out on Info Wars.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.120]  They restored her page after that.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.120]  Yeah, we broke it and then Drudge picked it up.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  But see if we didn't have things like Brudge or Info Wars protecting the other reporters,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.120]  we wouldn't get squat.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  And I'm not asking for love back from all these reporters and groups,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.120]  but I'm constantly like defending other reporters at Daily Caller or Breitbart.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.120]  And, you know, and it's nice to see them, you know, defending us some as well,
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.120]  because we're all in this together.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.120]  In fact, we have a Tucker Carlson that owns the Daily Caller,
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.120]  popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour about how he's been censored
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.120]  and manipulated and how they misrepresent interviews that he gives.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.120]  So there's a lot of examples of that and the dirty tricks that they're engaged in
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  a la the activity of Katie Couric.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.120]  In fact, guys, I think I have it here, but will you guys pull that?
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.120]  Because that was a controversy a couple of weeks ago.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.120]  I want to refresh myself with the way Carlson was getting manipulated.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.120]  Tucker Carlson says, Glenn Beck sucked up to Zuck.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.120]  You're such an impressive guy.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:05.120]  He was in the meeting with Facebookhead, which I'm fine with.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.120]  As long as you don't roll over and worship what happened there,
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.120]  it's good to have somebody that was there,
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.120]  but they were sworn to secrecy in those meetings,
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.120]  so he will not say the name of Glenn Beck.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.120]  But he's been censored.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.120]  He's been manipulated on Facebook and other places as well.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.120]  So he's going to be popping in with us.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.120]  Rob, do you're doing such a terrific job?
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.120]  How about we just for two or three minutes here and I'm going to let you go
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  hand the mic and switch the camera to yourself so I can talk to Josh Owens.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.120]  Okay, give us one second.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.120]  We can do that.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.120]  Fantastic.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.120]  And then I do have to get to a bunch of clips, folks.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.120]  There are so many of these I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.120]  Hillary Clinton government has a right to regulate the Second Amendment.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:52.120]  You don't have a right to regulate private citizens that don't have criminal records.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.120]  That's why it says free men will not be debarred the use of guns.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  That's what that means.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120]  That's a founding father quote.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.120]  It's also in the Federalist Papers.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.120]  But yes, certainly private institutions do to a certain extent,
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.120]  as long as they're not open comments.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:12.120]  But your goal is to ban the guns and you've banned them everywhere else you've gotten control like New York, Chicago, D.C.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.120]  So stop saying you don't want a total ban.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]  So that's coming up.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.120]  We've got a bunch of other clips.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:20.120]  But Josh Owens always busted his butt and he's gone jihadi there.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.120]  He's got the beard so that he can infiltrate the camps.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  We're being, we're joking, we're joking.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.120]  I could ask you questions, but you've been in Germany 24 hours already kicked butt.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120]  What do you want to impart?
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  What have you picked up in day one of this 10-day operation info wars?
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:42.120]  Well, look, Alex, one thing that I don't think was conveyed in the video that we posted yesterday.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  When we went to this migrant camp, all we wanted to do was simply speak to people.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:51.120]  We wanted to show what the situation was there because that is our future.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:59.120]  If we continue to leave the borders open and allow anyone and everyone to come in under the guise of being peaceful and being, you know, nice people.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120]  And well, we just want to help them.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120]  That's not what it is.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.120]  That's not what it is.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:11.120]  First off, second off, my point in saying that is that in the video, they bumrushed us because we were trying to speak to people.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  I guess they were afraid that they might say something that would shine a negative light on them.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:25.120]  So this group of thugs and blue suits, I mean, I guess they were self-appointed security, ran up to us and Rob do had the microphone.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.120]  And I should have thought to unplug the microphone so I could get the audio on my end.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.120]  The guy was screaming at me, telling me to put the camera down, put the camera down.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.120]  They were going, they would erase the footage.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.120]  We will erase the footage.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:42.120]  And by the way, you're on the edge of it at the public interest to it and these guys look like they're from Nigeria or Central Africa.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:46.120]  Just to show they use the last wave to be the enforcers to cover for the next wave.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  I've had numbers of parliament on from the UK.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.120]  This is a tactic they've used there.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:55.120]  The government is bringing in foreigners because they're totally behold to the government and have no culture in the country.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.120]  They feel like outsiders.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.120]  The government's outsider.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120]  It's globalist.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.120]  So they work together in tandem.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.120]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.120]  And I was having a back and forth with the guy. You can see it at the end of the video if you watch the video.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.120]  It's kind of long.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:14.120]  But the guy that was worked for the city and was coming to clear things up, he was saying that, well, we don't want them to feel threatened.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.120]  There's a lot of people out here that want to get them and we just need to make sure they're safe.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:19.120]  And I made the point.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.120]  Oh, so it's okay if we don't feel safe.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.120]  It's okay if they attack us, but we just have to make sure that they have their fuzzy little blankets and they're nice.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  It's okay when that brings them teddy bears, it's okay if they're raping and killing and robbing and stabbing and the highway systems are shutting down.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.120]  It's okay.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.120]  Yeah, it's okay if regular citizens have to bust their butt to live, to feed their families.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:41.120]  It's okay if 85% of Germans and national polls don't want it.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.120]  They don't get it.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.120]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.120]  They get food for free.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.120]  They don't have to work.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  They get a place to stay.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.120]  And the interview that we did today with the guy, which will be coming out soon as soon as we get back to the car,
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.120]  he was saying how much he hated Germany, yet he doesn't have to work.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.120]  He doesn't have to worry about money.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.120]  And then at the end of the year, he was like, well, I kind of like it because I don't actually have to do anything.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:02.120]  And then do ask them.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.120]  He said, well, you're from Syria, so are you going to go back to Syria when you're done?
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.120]  And he was like, no, I'm not going to go back to Syria.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.120]  I'm going to stay here because I have more opportunities here because I can get things that I want here, not back in Syria.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:18.120]  I would say an arrogant Muslim invader says he hates Germany, but is going to stay and love the free stuff.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.120]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.120]  And that's the thing that people don't get.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:27.120]  These social justice warriors, whether it's in Europe, whether it's in the U.S., they don't understand that this is not some game.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.120]  This is not some, let's be nice to people.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.120]  Nobody wants to be mean to people.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.120]  That's not the freaking point.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.120]  That's not what's going on here.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  These people aren't all evil.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:41.120]  They're not all evil, but there is a system behind this that is making sure that they come over.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.120]  Absolutely.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:48.120]  It's Peter Sutherland, the guy that founded the EU on record 20-something years ago off their so-called trade deals,
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:56.120]  who is now the head of this migrant commission to open Europe up, advertise, bring them in, and then have them be a new political weapons system.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:57.120]  Get a cab if you have to.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  Catch up to that rally.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  This might get crazy.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120]  It's another about to mark through some of the immigrant areas.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.120]  Great job.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.120]  Josh Owens, Rob Do.
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:04.120]  I really appreciate your work.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  Our prayers are with you.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:08.120]  Stay tuned, everybody.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.120]  We're going to be covering this for the next week.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  Absolutely.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.120]  And call us if something hot happens or just listen.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.120]  Get a cab because, I mean, have you guys lost the march?
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:17.120]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.120]  Get in there, my friend.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.120]  We're going to catch up to it right now.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  All right.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.120]  All right.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.120]  Well, I tell you, there's no other media like this, folks, because Fox News, CNN, all of them,
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  they want to have producers there controlling everything and showing you what they want you to see.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  We're just teleprompter-free, live cameras worldwide.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.120]  We have built an organization thanks to your support that is unprecedented.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.120]  And I want to round it out with another 10 personnel.

[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.120]  But once we force it and Drudge forces it, then it all comes out.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:31.120]  Then it ends up being pushed out on the news and we are changing the narrative towards reality thanks to your support.

[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:28.120]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:34.120]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:39.120]  Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.120]  The answer is simple.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.120]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:50.120]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.120]  do you fear for your life?
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:54.120]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.120]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:21.120]  Don't wait. War on the grid.com.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:40.120]  Yeah, there's so many of these great videos that Rob New and Josh Owens have already put out that I'm going to play some of them later in the next hour.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:43.120]  But we have a lot of stuff to cover here, obviously.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:50.120]  Tucker Carlson's coming up about the whole Facebook meeting and I'm going to fair it more out of him and all the censorship that's going on.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:56.120]  We have migrant camp freaks out on reporters asking questions in Germany. That's up on info wars.com.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.120]  Medieval Trump wall found in Germany.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:04.120]  Now they put walls back in to stop the Muslims because see, they invade. That's what they do.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:11.120]  There are a lot of Muslims that are nice people, but it's definitely a religion of conquest big time.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:14.120]  But they teach in school, the Cursades were offensive.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:21.120]  No, they weren't. Were there atrocities in the Cursades? Absolutely. You think I'm defending medieval Europe?
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:31.120]  Yeah, that's a funny one too. It's like, I don't like the Aztec culture. It doesn't mean I don't like people that are from Aztec bloodlines.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:36.120]  Again, believe me, if you were a Mesoamerican, you didn't like the Aztecs either.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.120]  They're the ones that depopulated most of southern North America.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.120]  They went around killing almost everybody.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  And eating them until they ran out of people.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:56.120]  And by the time Cortez showed up, a couple hundred men took out thousands because they were just completely out of their minds.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:02.120]  But I am digressing, ladies and gentlemen. They were following a bizarre cult and taking hallucinogens every couple of days.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.120]  Over time, it makes you a little bit crazy when your central planners are taking hallucinogens a couple of times a week.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.120]  Very good idea.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.120]  Now, once a month, maybe it's okay. Okay, I'm being sarcastic. But continuing.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:18.120]  I want to play this clip since I mentioned it. Just remind us where Hillary Clinton is at right now.
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:27.120]  And you've got FBI agents that have been in there, other Secret Service agents. Dan Bongino would not tell me what went on in the White House.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:33.120]  It's time to get him back on. And he said, look, I'm getting threats. My house is getting broken into and stuff like that.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  And he's also called up and said, will you stop saying that I gave you info? And I said, I haven't. He went and saw the clip.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  He goes, oh, you didn't. I go, no, they're lying saying you gave me info. You did not give me info.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.120]  You said it's worse than people are saying on air.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:52.120]  I have talked to another Secret Service agent and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.120]  And it was done in an in-person way.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:03.120]  And all I was told was you are dead on, except it's worse than you think. And that was before Bongino told me that.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:11.120]  I said, what? And they just said, unbelievable. And I said, what do you mean? And so it's just unbelievable.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.120]  But this begs the question, at what point is it too big to fail?
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:22.120]  I mean, okay, you're sworn to secrecy. You'll get in trouble. You'll get fired. They're arresting reporters. They're arresting whistleblowers.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:31.120]  I get it. But if it's unbelievable and it's illegal, you're part of a Secret Service that's going to cover it up?
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:37.120]  Sure. Watch the President's back. Don't tell him if he's cheating on his wife. I get secrecy like that.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:45.120]  But other stuff, and that's why you've got them going after Secret Service right now with all these faux scandals.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:54.120]  Oh my gosh, some of them might have had a hooker or something. Okay, that's not good, because a blackmail. But is that selling out secrets to the Communist Chinese, missile secrets?
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  Is that selling us out to Al Qaeda and ISIS and Saudi Arabians? Is that having Saudi Arabian princes in the White House at midnight?
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:08.120]  Doing Heaven knows what? Or Hillary throwing fits, running around screaming at everyone?
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:15.120]  And we already know from the FBI agents and others that have gone public, Hillary Clinton literally chose the carpet.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  I'm sorry, I didn't get to this shit. I want to come back before Tucker Carlson joins us. I want to play this.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:24.120]  Hillary Clinton government has a right to regulate Second Amendment.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:31.120]  That's a big statement from her in the campaign, because that's what she intends to do. And you can regulate something until it's basically illegal.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:38.120]  And that's what they plan to do. Listen, I know you all know that, but they're coming for the guns. They want to break our will.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:44.120]  They've already taken everything else, and they want to get the Bible and the guns. They hate us. They hate Christians.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:59:09.120]  No matter what color you are, you're the target and your churches have been taken over. They won't warn you.
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:19.120]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,

[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:09.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live coming in dry because I want to play this report from Germany with Rob Doom. This is powerful.
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:13.120]  Rob Doom reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:17.120]  And as you can see behind me, we are in the ruins of Castle Wolfestein.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:24.120]  This is a medieval castle built on a large hill overlooking the town of Newmark, and I'll give you a shot of that in one second.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:28.120]  But we were here today because we got a tip from, I guess, an Infowarier.
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:33.120]  He sent me an email saying there's a refugee center and they gave me the address. We actually drove in there.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:39.120]  We had our body cameras rolling this time because as you know yesterday when we were in Munich and we approached the refugee center,
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:46.120]  a whole crew of blue shirt people, a blue shirt clad people came out, got in our face, were putting their hands in front of our cameras
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:52.120]  and just very angry that we were there just wanting to see what was going on and how many people, migrants, were at that center.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  This was a much smaller house and we have a full interview with actually one of the Syrian migrants came over and talked to us
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  and we interviewed him for about 20 minutes. He spoke OK English, OK German, and we had a pretty interesting conversation.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:08.120]  So I think people are going to be really interested in listening to that.
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:15.120]  But here around me you can see it's got really thick walls. There's a big tower here which it looks like it was recently rebuilt
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:22.120]  and on top they have some antennas and I guess cellular functions and stuff like that.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.120]  This is a very high point in the area. You can see, Josh, let's get a shot of this.
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.120]  You can see you have a view of the entire surrounding area.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:34.120]  So if you were to have invaders coming or anything you could see what was going on.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:40.120]  And over there is the town of Newmarket and it's about 40,000 people living there.
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  And when we talked to the refugee, his name was Muhammad, he said there's about 1,000 migrants in this city
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:54.120]  and they don't feel welcome in the city. He said for various reasons people look at them and he didn't seem to understand why.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:58.120]  I tried to talk to him about that and asked him a lot of different questions.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.120]  So it's going to be an interesting interview. We're going to have that.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:03.120]  We're actually on our way to Dresden, Germany today.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:09.120]  We started off in Munich, went to some migrant centers there, met with the head of the German Freedom Party
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.120]  and we have that interview coming up as well. We shot those on the iPhone so let's take a little, or on the cannons.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  So let's take a little bit of time to get edited down, put the articles on, make it look really good and put those up.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  Those will be coming up soon. But we're on our way to Dresden, Germany tonight at about 6.30 in the evening.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  There's going to be a large protest, an anti-immigration protest that will be taking place.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  They say between 3,000 and 20,000 people could show up.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  And with Bilderberg happening just in the next couple days, it's sure to be a raucous event.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:46.120]  So we'll be going live from there. I'll probably do a Facebook mention or two and we'll also be shooting video.
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:50.120]  Most of the speeches will be in German so I don't know if we'll be having those.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  But we will be there to see what's going on in Dresden, Germany and then we'll be there for the remainder of the week to cover Bilderberg
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  but also traveling to Berlin and Leipzig to see what's going on with the migrant crisis going on in Germany there.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:11.120]  I'll tell you one thing is for certain, the Germans definitely are more organized than say the French or even the UK
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  and they're in their way that they're housing the migrants. They're doing a very orderly job and it's not apparent really
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:24.120]  unless you're taking a real close look that you can actually tell there's a center or a migrant center anywhere around here or a camp.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:29.120]  So they're definitely keeping it more organized but you can tell they're stressed.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  The people here that we've talked to are very stressed and they feel that most of these migrants should go back.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:40.120]  They took a million in last year, 250,000 this year already and you can feel that they're at the breaking point.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  And there are several countries in from the Eastern European countries.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:49.120]  You've got Czech Republic down below us, Austria is getting flooded especially in Vienna.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:55.120]  And then you have Hungary. What is it? Macedonia is down there.
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.120]  The former Yugoslav, you have Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.120]  So all these areas are getting overrun and they're making their way into Europe.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  So we'll be filing more reports on the road but here's a pretty interesting look at Castle Wolfstein here in just outside of Newmarket, Germany.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  And we are in Bavaria right now. Very beautiful area.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:22.120]  And you can see all these interesting mounds out in the distance. They have these plateaued mounds on top.
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:25.120]  So who knows what is beneath those. There's a lot of history here.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:30.120]  And actually the Romans came through here and invaded around the time of Julius Caesar.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:36.120]  And when this was called Gaul. But a very beautiful land. Very nice people.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:38.120]  Everybody we've met so far has been really nice.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:42.120]  And even the migrant Muhammad we talked to today was very nice and very open.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:47.120]  So it's interesting to actually sit down and talk to these people and get their perspective.
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:51.120]  Because that's what this world is all about, getting different perspectives from people.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:56.120]  So this has been Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com. We'll be filing more reports from Germany.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.120]  That is Cutting Edge 21st Century Media, folks.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.120]  And occasionally violent to become president.
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.120]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:38.120]  In fact, secret service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:43.120]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:57.120]  Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the president of the United States.
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:24.120]  This is Kate Daniels reporting.

[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:37.120]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:43.120]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.120]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:51.120]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen.

[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:07.120]  Dave's Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.120]  If they're asked tough questions, others sucked up basically.
[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.120]  Like who?
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:16.120]  You know, just well-known talk show hosts who you think would be asking tough questions
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:19.120]  but have said things like you're such an innovator, you're such an innovator,
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:22.120]  you're such an innovator, you're such an innovator, you're such an innovator,
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.120]  you're such an innovator, you're such an innovator.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.120]  No, who said that?
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.120]  Come on, you know, you can imagine.
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.120]  But the point is they are conducting an investigation.
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:36.120]  They don't want to be seen as biased.
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  Of course, they're subjective judgments.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.120]  So are they going to change anything?
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:44.120]  Yeah, I mean, I think they're going to try to move as much as they can over to the algorithm
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.120]  and take the human element out to the extent possible.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.120]  But I think, you know, in the end, there's always going to be an executive judge.
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:54.120]  No, they did not admit that intentional bias occurred.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:58.120]  They did admit that Silicon Valley is very liberal and the people who work there
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.120]  by definition are probably mostly liberal.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.120]  Okay, now this is an important meeting obviously that happened a few weeks ago
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.120]  and folks are asking me, some of them are like, worry, I'm Tucker Carlson on.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:07.120]  He went to that meeting.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.120]  I would go to Bilderberg group meeting if they invited me.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  I would go to Davos if they invited me.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.120]  I would have gone to this probably, but I would have come out and said what happened
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.120]  and been critical of it just like Tucker Carlson did.
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:20.120]  People also say it's a minority of folks that go, listen, you know,
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:22.120]  Tucker Carlson's on Fox News.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:28.120]  We also created a daily caller that's constantly defeating enemies of our Second Amendment,
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.120]  defending our sovereignty.
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.120]  I judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.120]  So I'm not in defense of Tucker Carlson.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.120]  I disagree with him on some stuff.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  He disagrees with me on some stuff, but we believe in the First Amendment and America.
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.120]  And the fact that Tucker Carlson in my view is getting more hardcore over the years
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:46.120]  shows he's a good guy and also shows the Liberty movement is growing
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:52.120]  and it's survivable now to be able to openly talk about global government
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:57.120]  and all the corruption in a time when journalists are getting audited and arrested
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.120]  and censored off of Facebook.
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:01.120]  So Tucker's here with us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:04.120]  Then my exclusive interview with Roger Stone.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:05.120]  We taped this Saturday.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.120]  He had to leave because his mother died.
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120]  He said, I just talked to my mom for the last time.
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:10.120]  I got to go.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.120]  She's gone and she died last night.
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:13.120]  So a tough guy.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.120]  He sucked it up and came in here 10 minutes after he learned
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:22.120]  she was going any minute and did the interview to give us the inside scoop on the VP choice.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.120]  Now the headline here is and we're going to premiere it.
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:29.120]  Trump VP pick leaked.
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:31.120]  Now, now I'm not throwing stone under the bush.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  You're going to discover what really happened.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.120]  But you know, when I figure something out for myself, I figure it out.
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.120]  So and it's not 100% set in stone, but little birdies, not just stone.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.120]  Little birdies said 95%.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  So you're going to hear it here first.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll get Tucker's take.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.120]  He may know as well or have a good idea.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.120]  You know, it's kind of like when you guess it, you guess you can't help it.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:52.120]  Tucker Carlson.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  Great to have you here with us.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  Hey, how's this for having me?
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:57.120]  Wow.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.120]  Where do you want to start with the whole Facebook situation?
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:00.120]  What?
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:06.120]  I mean, I don't have much to add to it other than Glenn Beck behaved in a pretty self discrediting way.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:07.120]  I thought it was this.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:10.120]  I mean, it's interesting to see people around billionaires.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.120]  Nothing against billionaires.
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:18.120]  I'm impressed with people who make their own fortunes, of course, but I also don't feel the need to slavishly suck up to them to lick their boots.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:19.120]  And he does.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:22.120]  So that was kind of interesting.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.120]  Yeah.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.120]  I actually talked to somebody else that was there and they said the same thing that you said.
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.120]  How many people total refresh folks memory?
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.120]  Where did you meet?
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.120]  What was it like?
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  We met at Facebook HQ outside San Francisco, probably 15 people.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:41.120]  Some of them you would recognize some you wouldn't.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:54.120]  And basically we listened as Mark Zuckerberg and Cheryl Sandberg and Peter Thiel and a couple of the top engineers over at Facebook explained that they're really worried that they're going to be perceived as liberal.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  They understand that, you know, they're mostly liberals who work there.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:00.120]  Of course, that's the pool from which they fish.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:10.120]  And so they think it hurts their business if they're perceived that way and so they're going to try to be perceived to do everything they can to make conservatives believe they're not discriminated against them.
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.120]  You know, it was kind of what you'd expect.
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:17.120]  What I didn't expect was to see Glenn Beck stand up and say, you know, you're just a remarkable innovator.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:22.120]  You're an amazing person and anyone who criticizes you is obviously a fascist.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.120]  And it was, you know, it was ridiculous.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:27.120]  He humiliated himself, I thought.
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.120]  He also said that Zuckerberg looks you in the eye all the time.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.120]  That's what a psychopath will do.
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.120]  I get German culture.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.120]  They also can, I look folks in the eye a lot, but it makes people uncomfortable sometimes.
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.120]  So I start looking away.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:43.120]  It's not that I'm trying to hide something.
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:49.120]  It's that for whatever reason I found when I look people in the eye too long, they start basically, you know, bumbling around.
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:57.120]  You know, in some cultures it's considered really an invitation to physical violence.
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:59.120]  It's considered way too assertive, too aggressive.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.120]  I didn't notice him looking at me in the eye.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  I was sort of looking at Sheryl Sandberg and Peter Thiel and who I, you know, Zuckerberg was fine.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:12.120]  I didn't have a strong reaction to one way or the other, but there were more interesting people in the room in my view.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:15.120]  Now, I don't normally go on people's looks, but when we pull up a photo of Zuckerberg.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.120]  No, I do.
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  I'm being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, sure.
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.120]  He does look like he could actually play Nosferatu without any prosthetic fake teeth.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:26.120]  I mean, he does have vampiric teeth.
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:31.120]  That is hilarious.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.120]  He, you know, he didn't go for my neck.
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  I'm proud to say.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.120]  You know, we're not prepared for this, but guys, just type in his name.
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:41.120]  It's like the official photo they put out with his face leering.
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.120]  He looks completely scary.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.120]  And of course I'm being a little bit sarcastic here, but getting serious.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:49.120]  Tell us what you really think about Glenn Beck, because I'm not here just to bash other talk shows.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:50.120]  I don't really do that.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:55.120]  I read a lot of what Glenn Beck covers as opposed to libertarian, but he wanted to be the leader of the whole movement.
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.120]  He did a lot of stuff behind the scenes on affiliates we were on and with sponsors.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.120]  I mean, this guy really, I learned has been dead.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  It's for everybody and thinks he's the king of the universe and should run everything.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:11.120]  I was told that by people at Fox one time I was there to go on other shows and the Fox high level producer.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  A name everyone would know has their own show on Fox, but also produces stuff came over had a steak with me at lunch or part of a steak.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.120]  They had a smaller steak.
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:26.120]  And I sat there after I just been on the view and he looked right at me and said, Glenn Beck is climbing the walls that you're about to be let in to be on a bunch of shows.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  And I said, well, I've been offered a show.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.120]  They want me to a pilot with man cow.
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  I turned that down last year and I said, why does he care?
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  And he goes, look, trust me, he runs the whole place.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  He's probably going to get kicked out.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  He's crazy, but he thinks he's Jesus.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120]  And now that was the quote.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.120]  Now I've been told that by so many others.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:45.120]  What was your take on Glenn Beck?
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:48.120]  Well, I mean, my general view of Glenn Beck is that he's super talented.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  I mean, he's much, he's much more talented than I am.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.120]  That's for sure.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.120]  Radio, as you know, is great preparation for any kind of broadcasting because you have to fill all this air by yourself.
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.120]  And it takes a talented man to do that.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:14:59.120]  Again, more talented than I am.
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  Glenn Beck is a really talented guy.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:08.120]  But when he started to conflate his own radio career with some sort of religious mission, you know, he lost me.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.120]  And I mean, I'm a pretty mainstream Episcopalian.
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  Maybe that's, maybe it's my fault.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:16.120]  I didn't understand it, but there was this mystic element that crafted to his rhetoric.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.120]  I mean, it made me uncomfortable.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  I will say that he had this weird rally on the mall.
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:25.120]  It wasn't clear what it was about, but it had something to do with elevating him as a spiritual leader.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.120]  And that's where you kind of lost me.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:31.120]  I'm a kind of meat and potatoes cable news guy, journalist have done it for 25 years, pretty straightforward.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.120]  You know, here's the story.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:33.120]  Here's what I think it means.
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.120]  I mean, it's, you know, I'm not here to redeem people or to save them from hell.
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:46.120]  Well, the really creepy part is him saying he has the only answer and that, and that Cruz is this anointed one and that the children are their new priest.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  And that if we don't do what they say, we're going to hell.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.120]  That is Jim Jones territory.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:53.120]  Well, it scared the hell out of me.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:54.120]  I got to say it again.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:57.120]  I don't want to be judgemental, but it freaks me out when people talk like that.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:58.120]  I mean, this is politics.
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  The point of politics is by definition, it's a secular endeavor.
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:08.120]  We're trying to solve differences without violence, without reference to the hereafter.
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:14.120]  We're trying to do this in a sort of reasonable way using logic, reason, right?
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  And when you all of a sudden start imputing religious motives or significance to the politicians you support, that it gets way too heavy and weird for me.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:30.120]  And also, by the way, the implication is if my guy is the Messiah or I'm the Messiah and you disagree with him or me, you're damned.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:33.120]  You're literally looking at eternal damnation.
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:41.120]  And that's just a level of discourse I'm not comfortable with because once you believe the person you're competing against is not just wrong, but evil.
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:44.120]  It justifies almost any kind of action, including violence.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.120]  And so it makes me uncomfortable.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:53.120]  Sure, and that's why the reason he got suspended off Sirius XM and more and more I disagree with it because it's the premeditated nature of it.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:54.120]  He's powerful.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.120]  He's got tens of millions of listeners.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.120]  He's messed with me hardcore.
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  I mean, like, not even the government's done this much stuff as people told me back behind the scenes.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:10.120]  And I've experienced losing the affiliates and, you know, the sponsors and stuff with him personally trying to lean on me over the years.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:15.120]  And I can't prove all of that, but he's attacked me and said I'm dangerous and said I shouldn't be on the air and stuff like that.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  So he's on record with some of it.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:19.120]  He moved to Texas where I'm at.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.120]  I mean, he copies a lot of stuff we do, but twist it.
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:24.120]  But he said once, you know, let me on the stage with Trump.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.120]  I'm going to stab him a bunch.
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:26.120]  I wouldn't stop.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:28.120]  Then he said, oh, I didn't mean that about Trump.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:33.120]  And then he has this other guy on to say, well, we mean this hypothetically, but somebody needs to take him out.
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:37.120]  Trump and it's the sneakiness of it that makes it so creepy.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  He's not just talking about killing Trump.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:42.120]  Like, say, somebody needs to take care of this problem.
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  Okay. Yeah, he needs to die, but we need to watch how we say it.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:48.120]  And this is a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars, or at least he used to have it.
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  That's dangerous.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.120]  Well, and also in this moment, which is a very combustible moment.
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  I mean, anybody paying any attention or all can see where this is going.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:59.120]  There have been outbreaks of violence at Trump events.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.120]  They're going to be more.
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:02.120]  Unfortunately, I hope it's not going to happen.
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:05.120]  But I suspect and everyone watching suspects that it will.
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:09.120]  This is exactly the moment when you need to kind of pull back a little bit.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:13.120]  Let's not talk like that because there are an awful lot of crazy people out there as you well know.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.120]  And some of them are on the edge of action.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.120]  I was joking saying I want them.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.120]  But you know what?
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.120]  We were talking earlier about being a little bit crazy.
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:24.120]  I don't act on it and I'm in control of my eccentric side.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.120]  These other people tend to get some power and they get more eccentric until they go off into La La Land.
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  I'm personally worried that Glenn Beck has something like a borderline personality disorder.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:38.120]  I personally, you know, in study and life have researched that.
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:43.120]  Let's just say I read a few books on it and talked with some psychologists about it because I know some folks that have it.
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:49.120]  And let me tell you, there's some things that they diagnose that don't exist like, you know, oppositional to authority disorder, whatever.
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:19:00.120]  But let me tell you, schizophrenia, things like people that are OCD, agoraphobia, borderline personality disorders are basically like a grab bag of all that.
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.120]  And if you experience it, folks, you start recognizing it.
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.120]  And I think Glenn Beck really ought to get some medical help. I'm serious.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:16.120]  Well, I think what all of us need in order to maintain sanity is to have a small group of people whom we trust, who have our best interest at heart and whom we listen to carefully and act on their advice.
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:20.120]  I mean, you know, we need to bounce things off, folks.
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:28.120]  Well, of course, people that you actually listen to whose opinions you care about, you know, I only have three or four people in my life whose opinions I really listen carefully to.
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:38.120]  But if two or more of them tell me to do something, I do it because I know that my mom, my dad, my cousin Buckley and a few other people all of a sudden say something.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:41.120]  I know I'm wrong and I go, OK, but that's only a couple of times a year.
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  That's exactly. I've had that exact experience.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  And the funny thing is in my life, one of them is named, but also Buckley, my brother Buckley.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:52.120]  You've come and visited us and hung out. You're a great guy and you were just blown away.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:54.120]  Wait, Buckley's really named Buckley.
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:20:00.120]  I know. I've never met. I have a son and a brother named Buckley and I had a grandfather named Buck.
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.120]  I've never met anybody else with that name.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:08.120]  Well, he has a name that sounds like it's something right out of the Wolf Wolf Wall Street, you know, the Oat Monk Stratley or whatever.
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:11.120]  But with him, we've tracked it back. Both are family names.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:14.120]  But then they were fans of William F. Buckley as well, his dad and mother.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.120]  So that was the coup de gras.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:20.120]  But the Buckley and the Stratton and the Hammond, those are all family names connected.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:22.120]  So, yeah, who knows.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:23.120]  That's amazing.
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.120]  We did. I don't know.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.120]  Now, again, Tucker Carlson here, we're looking at a massive climate of censorship.
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.120]  It's clearly intensifying.
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.120]  They're calling for it in Europe.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.120]  Facebook's working with them in Europe doing it.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:39.120]  So when Facebook says, oh, we've just got a few employees doing this, I don't really buy it.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:51.120]  I mean, we've been given the three day suspensions for really simple stuff like sending out a link that Navy Seals sent out about Benghazi saying, you know, she didn't act and they died with just photos of their faces.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:55.120]  And I don't see how I'm not allowed to post that on my own supposed site.
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.120]  No, that's a great point.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:00.120]  And look, the problem with Facebook is its scale.
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:06.120]  I mean, Facebook has more power than any media organization in history of the world has ever had.
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:17.120]  It has a virtual monopoly on disseminating news, you know, close to it, closer than any newspaper baron ever had, bigger than William Randolph first by, you know, 10X.
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:27.120]  It's a really, really big company. And so whenever you vest that much power in one organization, you run the risk that they can choke off dissent or views that they disagree with.
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:37.120]  I mean, my real concern with Facebook is the agreements it enters into with foreign governments to go along with their censorship of what they call hate speech, which is, of course, speech I disagree with.
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:39.120]  And that's not allowed.
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:48.120]  And Facebook really, I don't think, and Google's the same, and Twitter as well, should not know American companies, should play along with censorship in other countries.
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:55.120]  I mean, look, we have laws here that govern the conduct of American businesses abroad, and they say really clearly, you may not engage in bribery.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:00.120]  It may be legal in Nigeria, but it's illegal here and American companies can't engage in it.
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:02.120]  Why do the same standards not apply to the First Amendment?
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:09.120]  Here, of course, we all have to abide by the Bill of Rights, and the first part of it is the First Amendment, which guarantees our right to say distressing things.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:15.120]  But American companies, when they go abroad, can collaborate with the censorship of foreign governments in order to make money. Why is that okay?
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:26.120]  Exactly. And then it allows them, my biggest concern is, it allows them to beta test that kind of voice of Mao Zedong, voice of the Stasi control over there with a soft rollout and then do it here.
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:32.120]  And that's what I'm seeing is the soft rollout and the media pushing it, oh, well, they're allowed to. It's their site.
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  But you're advertising it like a commons, and then you're selectively enforcing on conservative or libertarian ideas.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:44.120]  To me, that's so dangerous. Your dad, you know, headed up a voice of America back when it really was, voice of America.
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:51.120]  From that perspective, I mean, why don't we recognize this as real Soviet-style evil? Very threatening.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:23:00.120]  Because the speech for which people abroad are being punished is speech that our elites, the left, that runs this country, doesn't believe ought to be expressed.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:02.120]  They agree with the censorship. That's the bottom line.
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:19.120]  So for example, in Canada and in Western Europe, civilized countries with, you know, market economies and real justice systems, there are a lot of people relatively speaking in jail for saying unpopular things, not for hurting anyone, but for expressing verboten views, views that the government doesn't like, and they go to jail for it.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:26.120]  And nobody ever says anything about it. I mean, this happens literally in Great Britain, in Canada, in France, in Germany, people are in prison.
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:31.120]  Now, I don't agree with the views, by and large, those people expressed, but it's in America.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:37.120]  But if they want to deny the Holocaust, that's their business, even though I find it abhorrent. Exactly. But now it's criticized open borders, you're arrested.
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:39.120]  See, once you set that precedent.
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.120]  Where's exactly right? Where's the line? And the line is always in the same place.
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:53.120]  It's whatever is unfashionable according to the people in charge. And that's the whole freaking point of guaranteed free speech of a First Amendment is to say, look, this doesn't change.
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:56.120]  It's immutable. It's a right written. Absolutely.
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:59.120]  That can't be taken away by whatever government comes in next.
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:08.120]  It's more important overall, I think, than the Second Amendment, because without the right to communicate, you know, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not, you're not going to be able to mount any opposition to tyranny.
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.120]  And you want to fix things with words first before you go to guns.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:14.120]  That's exactly right. That's why they're in that order. That's exactly right.
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:23.120]  First, we have the conversation and then, you know, obviously violence has got to be a last resort and all people of goodwill, very much including me, hope it is a last resort.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:26.120]  But if they get physical with us, if they get physical with us.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:36.120]  But you don't ever want to have to exercise your Second Amendment rights. I mean, there are kind of emergency, you know, bag that you keep just in case.
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:41.120]  First, you know, the bulwark against tyranny is the First Amendment. You're right to say what you believe.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:44.120]  And it's been totally eliminated in Western Europe.
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.120]  I mean, of course, it doesn't exist in most of Asia. We knew that.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.120]  But the fact that our closest allies don't recognize the First Amendment, nobody ever says that.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.120]  And I wonder why. And again, why?
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:01.120]  I agree. I agree. I think these movements are more scary than what we saw with the Communist over 70 years, because, yeah, they killed a lot of people.
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:13.120]  It's horrible. But as for the whole world being in danger of falling to tyranny, I literally think we're in the most dangerous period the world's ever seen for just basic rights, family rights, property rights, First Amendment rights being under attack.
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.120]  What do you think?
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.120]  I think, of course, and we're also in the most dynamic moment of our lifetimes.
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:25.120]  I mean, the whole post-Second World War order imposed on the world by the victors, mostly by us, is collapsing.
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.120]  I mean, all of it is collapsing. The EU on June 23rd of this year, I think Brexit is going to happen.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:34.120]  I'm for it, by the way, but I think that's just the first step to the collapse of the European Union.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.120]  This is an incredible time. Let me ask you that question in the minutes we have, because that's where I was going next.
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:51.120]  We're at a major watershed, obviously, across roads. The establishment everywhere, different establishments are trying to maintain control, use the crisis for more control, which I think is backfiring and making the awakening that much more explosive.
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.120]  I'm concerned about that. I'm not dreaming of some bloody revolution like the leftist and the Communist star.
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:03.120]  I've got this lady on infowars.com, Kurt Nemo's story, Communist Angela Davis. She says, black lives matter. This is what we've been waiting for.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:12.120]  And then goes in to basically say, you know, take out Trump, go after Trump politically, do whatever you have to, and then her cohorts start saying, yeah, let's kill him and tweeting, kill him.
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:19.120]  I see red flags all over the country now. I see communists coming off from under their rocks, dreaming of some weird jihad.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:25.120]  Well, exactly. Once these things get rolling, I mean, look, populism is always a reaction against something real.
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:32.120]  It doesn't happen by accident. These movements don't come from nowhere. They're a reaction against some injustice. That's real.
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:38.120]  Trump movement, black lives matter. I mean, it's all rooted in something. But once they get rolling, you don't know where they're going to wind up.
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:45.120]  That's the scary thing. Once these populist movements get underway, no one's in charge of them and they can end up in a really, really ugly place.
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:48.120]  That's just true. You're right to be worried. All of us should be worried.
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:53.120]  And George Soros openly admits he's using these movements to overthrow countries. So we're in trouble.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:55.120]  Scary.
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:01.120]  Dailycaller.com. Dailycaller.com. I got to tell you, Tucker, that's why they want to talk about Glenn Beck, but he's so dangerous.
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:05.120]  I have to try to, you know, obviously push him over the edge. He's doing that to himself. I wanted him to get help.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:11.120]  I wanted him to hit bottom so he gets better. But when I see Breitbart doing such great work and I see Daily Caller doing such amazing work
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:17.120]  and I see World Net Daily doing great work as well and Drudge helping magnify all that and some of the other good talk show hosts,
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:23.120]  Hannity getting more hardcore. I feel good. I feel safer. I feel like we might be able to win and turn things around.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  I don't think, oh, look, they're bigger than me or they have more. That big story on Dailycaller.com or Tucker Carlson making national news.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:33.120]  I feel good. And I wish other hosts were like we are, where we just want to try to change the culture.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:39.120]  It isn't about being the only, you know, big guy out there. We're all, like Kennedy said, rising tide raises all ships.
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:45.120]  And we have to do that because they are trying to take our freedoms. That's why I'm here to say, even though we disagree on some things,
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:50.120]  I appreciate the work you're doing and I sleep better at night knowing you and Matt Drudge and others are there.
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:55.120]  What's your view overall on that? And then briefly, what's your take on the Trump VP situation?
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:02.120]  I mean, I couldn't agree with you more. If you have some sincere beliefs, it pleases you to hear the truth spoken, no matter who it's spoken by.
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:11.120]  Always. I don't even care. I like you. I love listening to people put things, sum them up in a way that is true and real and affects outcomes.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  Sure. You're not in competition with other libertarian or patriot groups. You want to win.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:23.120]  I love it. I want more of it. As for his VP pick, I mean, obviously Jeff Sessions will always be my first choice because I think he's the smartest.
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.120]  He's the most impressive member of the Senate. I agree with him the most on immigration and trade.
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:30.120]  Okay. Have you heard that though? I mean, I'm asking you.
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:31.120]  No, I have not heard that.
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  We're about to come back with Roger Stone. We're going to get, I mean, I got, but I tell you, okay, so Jeff Sessions.
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:48.120]  Yeah, I mean, that's my hope. And I hope he doesn't try and stunt cast it. I mean, that my concern is he'll try to overthink it, get someone flaky who you've never heard of who, you know, isn't smart or interesting.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:53.120]  Yeah, they're talking about having war and with Clinton for the double stunt of two women. No, no more gimmicks. We need the real deal.
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.120]  Exactly. That's exactly right.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:07.120]  Pick someone who believes what you believe and might do a better job of articulating. I mean, Trump is this amazing figure. But if I could pick one shortcoming that bothers me is he's not a good explainer sometimes.
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:13.120]  He doesn't get deep into why different leftist groups might not try to assassinate even if they know Sessions is there.
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:20.120]  Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't know if, you know, I think Trump, I think anybody in politics right now is in peril because there's so many lunatics running around.
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:32.120]  I don't like to think about that stuff, but I do think that what I really think is that Sessions would be a guarantee that Trump will carry out, will follow through on some of these impromises he's made or implied.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.120]  And that's meaningful to me.
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:43.120]  Well, when folks spread the word about dailycaller.com or infowars.com or drugsreport.com, they're supporting free speech. We are under attack because we're telling the truth. So promote us all listeners. It's key.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:45.120]  Thank you, Tucker. Powerful interview.
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.120]  Thanks a minute. Thanks, millionaire.
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:51.120]  You bet. We'll be right back. Hey, thank you, Tucker. That was powerful. We're coming back with Roger Stone.
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:30:20.120]  This is gonna be big. Okay. You want to know the VP is get ready. Are we about to leak it? Find out in three minutes.
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:28.120]  Personal feuds and outright lies. Donald Trump fired back with a counter punch in a speech last night in San Jose.
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:44.120]  And remember I said I was a counter punch here? I am. After what she said about me today in her phony speech, that was a phony speech. That was a Donald Trump pitch up. I will say this, Hillary Clinton has to go to jail. Okay, she has to go to jail.
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:56.120]  After the speech, Trump sent out a series of tweets attacking Hillary. One which read Clinton says Trump is dangerous. Who's the one who killed four Americans in Benghazi?

[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:42.120]  Alright, I taped a 21 minute interview Saturday with Roger Stone that is going to premiere here in about two minutes. Then we'll go to break, come back with the rest of it. This hour will end and David Knight will take over in the fourth hour.
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:50.120]  He'll also take over at the end of this hour to bring you into the fourth hour. Just briefly, I was talking about defending free speech.
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:34:02.120]  It is a war that is taking place for your mind right now. It's an info war. And the globalists never intended that people would reverse engineer their operation, figure it out, read their own white papers by the hundreds and take action against them.
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  I've done that. And I've seen my perspective and my research that I got from patriots and the John Burt society and others. They put me on the trail. I did deep research as well.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  But I'm not territorializing that. The point is, I've seen myself in 21 years change the narrative massively. And the talking points and the specific angles and the nomenclature, the words, the lexicon that I've created now become adopted worldwide in intelligentsia and political circles.
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:46.120]  That's not bragging. That's as a battle report to you to say if some scrapper from Texas can change the world, you can change the world as well.
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:57.120]  And you are the info warriors. It's been my interfacing with you that has been 99.9% of the action. But it was my intention and my engagement and my will that helped light the fuse.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:06.120]  So we're winning. We're moving forward. But more than ever, when I tell Tucker Carlson, hey, people need to support what you're doing because they are under attack.
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:16.120]  This isn't just free speech that's under attack. These are the groups, the organizations like info wars that is attacked by White House mouthpieces and Clinton operatives all the time.
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:21.120]  Make no mistake, I take my life in my hands every day going up against these people.
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:28.120]  But I'm not a hero. I'm itself preservation. I'd be insane not to do that.
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:35.120]  So this video is not out yet. We're going to post it at the end of the hour to info wars.com red linked.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:43.120]  The big issue here is who is the VP pick. It's so important. And I am pretty much accurately predicted who is on the short list.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:53.120]  Let's just say that stone goes over it, but I have other sources and I want to be clear. Stone is not the source of this on record. He's not. But he believes my analysis is correct.
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:36:02.120]  Is the right thing to do and is where this is going. And so it's fair for me. He said to say that I think this is the best choice and I think this is who it is because that's his opinion too.
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:09.120]  So you're going to find out in a moment that he's been best buddies with Trump. These are running buddies. The other guys are political analysts.
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:15.120]  These are running buddies that argue with each other and everything else. I mean, Stone is the only guy that's not a yes man to Trump basically.
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:20.120]  He went to the inside baseball. He's a really interesting guy. God, he wanted to get to know me years ago and I was too busy.
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:24.120]  And now I want to be friends with this guy. I mean, no wonder he was like best buddies with Nixon after Nixon got out of office.
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:32.120]  And they hung out and everything a lot. I mean, like on a weekly basis because he's just really funny and really smart and fun to hang out with and fun to drink a beer with too.
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:42.120]  But please support the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, 20% off on Lunklin's in today, 20% off.
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:50.120]  We've got so much more coming up, but that's going to sell out today. We've got 25, it's actually 26%.
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:57.120]  They put 25 up there for this new great air purifier and infowars store.com, the Alexa peer breeze. Nobody else has that deal.

[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.120]  Okay, without further ado, we will go ahead and go to the Roger Stone piece.
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:54.120]  We're going to run this up to break. Come back in the next segment and finish it up and then David Knight will be taken over.
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  So here it is, the VP for Trump leaked question mark.
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:08.120]  And we are back. Roger Stone, Trump insider, former head of his campaign, Confidant, is here in studio with us. This is part three.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:15.120]  He came in Friday, was live on air with us over the weekend. We war-gamed, how to make this country free and great again.
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.120]  And I pressed him hard. Who is the VP pick, just as Trump decided yet?
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:31.120]  And he said, you know, I'm not going to tell you what I think or what I know until we do just a special report and we will put it out there in the public.
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:38.120]  But he said only one man knows and that's all from. And I said, okay, well, I have no dog in the fight against Corey Lewandowski.
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:44.120]  And I defended him when that woman said he pushed her down all that. It looked like he just kind of shoved her, but whatever.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:51.120]  But he is on Fox last Sunday and all over saying he's running it. He's deciding. So I ask you, hey, what goes on in these meetings?
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.120]  Who are we looking at? You go, I'm not going to say Trump hasn't totally decided yet.
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:02.120]  But then I see Lewandowski running around saying he's deciding. And I'm like, does Trump know that this is going on?
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:07.120]  Because you tell me Trump, you know, is all about being his own man. And I'm not attacking Lewandowski.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:14.120]  It just isn't congruent with everything else I've seen from Donald Trump that Lewandowski seems to say he's quarterbacking the whole deal.
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:25.120]  So I see who's commenting on info wars.com and on YouTube. I have staff who've come up with a name that when I said the name to you kind of gasped last night at dinner and said,
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:32.120]  don't say I said that. But yeah, that's I'll talk about it on air. So we're on air. We got 10 and a half minutes left.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:40.120]  You've got the floor. But people really want to know this is one of the most important things ever, obviously, not just the Trump campaign for the future of this country.
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:47.120]  He puts a globalist in it will be like George Herbert Walker Bush, the CIA, you know, shooting Reagan for those folks that don't know look into that.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.120]  So so Roger Stone, what's really going on here?
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:58.120]  My view here is very simple. And that is, I'm sorry if I have to scoff at Corey Lewandowski, but Donald Trump is going to make this decision.
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:06.120]  And he's going to play his cards extremely close to the vest. He's going to throw out some names that are really in contention.
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:12.120]  He's going to throw out some names of people that he wants to give a wet kiss to but really aren't on the short list.
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:20.120]  What is the short list? Only Donald Trump knows. I think the short list is in flux. I think that he is still considering his options.
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:23.120]  Now, you pointed out what I think is the most important criteria.
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  Look, Nixon saw the assassination of JFK up close. He told me personally, one of the reasons he chose Agnew was as an insurance policy against assassination.
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:41.120]  Trump is got to be mindful of that. Now, some will say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist. Really?
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:46.120]  They tried to kill Ronald Reagan. They did kill Jack Kennedy. So it's not an unrealistic question.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:58.120]  Trump has proven to be fearless, but I think it's essential that he choose someone who tracks his views, who is not a globalist, who is a nationalist,
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:02.120]  who agrees with him, particularly on the issue of immigration.
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:11.120]  Therefore, I think by process of elimination, one of the strongest contenders, the name you brought up, a guy that I like myself, would be Senator Jeff Sessions.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:16.120]  Now, I've known Sessions back to the Alabama Young Republicans in the 80s.
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:22.120]  That's how long I've known him and I've known his reputation for fortitude and his leadership capabilities.
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:30.120]  Am I saying Trump has chosen Sessions? No. I think Joni Ernst, the senator from Iowa, is one of the candidates under consideration.
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:39.120]  I think that Miriam and Sheldon Adelson have very aggressively advocated Newt Gingrich, who I like personally.
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:45.120]  I think there's some drawbacks to his tendency, but I think he is one that Donald Trump has under consideration.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:51.120]  On the other hand, I think the short list is an evolving list. Only one man knows.
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  It's not Roger Stone. It's not Paul Manafort. It's certainly not Corey Lewandowski. It's Donald Trump.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:04.120]  I don't even think Melania Trump knows. He understands the news value of this. He understands the blockbuster headliner.
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:09.120]  Sure, Roger, but your eyes did get big and you did gulp. I've never seen you do that before.
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:15.120]  We've hung out a lot in private. When I said Senator Sessions is who I think he's going to go with in my gut,
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:21.120]  and you gulped and you said, well, I'm not saying that. You can get that from me, but you had a physical response when I said that.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:28.120]  Well, here's why I think I may have had this response. I've seen the chemistry between Trump and Sessions.
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:35.120]  I'm very positive. I think that Donald appreciates Sessions. I think he is honored to have his early support.
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:40.120]  And they're copacetic on the single most important issue in this campaign, I think, immigration.
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:46.120]  So I'm reading the tea leaves. I don't know anything. No one has said to me it's going to be Jeff Sessions,
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:51.120]  or Trump has decided on this one or that one. We're not going to know until drumroll.
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:54.120]  He announces it at the Republican National Convention.
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:59.120]  But this I do know. I think Sessions is in contention. I think he's a strong candidate.
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:04.120]  From a personal point of view, Alex, that's who I would prefer. So maybe I'm projecting my own views.
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:07.120]  So when you heard me with my view, it just resonated. You were like, oh.
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:10.120]  Well, and I've also, I've personally seen the chemistry between the two.
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:15.120]  I was about to say, plus it's the cool guy. I mean, it's the cool fact that they're like buddies,
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.120]  and one's the Southern, one's the Northern. It's just good to bring America together.
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:24.120]  Well, and I don't want the gimmick of just picking a woman to get female votes. If a woman was the right choice,
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.120]  because she had views that were great and all this, I would say I'd support a woman.
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:30.120]  I don't care if the president's woman. I'd love it. And these women are great, I'm sure.
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:35.120]  But just the gimmick of leftist women having a woman just hoping they vote for you.
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:42.120]  I get it. I see the arithmetic. I see the calculus. But I just say, screw all the surface stuff. Go for what's real.
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:48.120]  I don't think Trump has ruled in or ruled out a woman. I think there are women on his personal list.
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:54.120]  Look, the guy's a master of public relations. He understands how to keep the public interested in this process.
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:45:00.120]  And therefore, he's thrown out names. Some of them are real contenders, I think. Others are, you know,
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:06.120]  he wants to give a wet kiss to Robert Corker, the Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:13.120]  Is Corker really a contender? Only Donald Trump knows. Personally, I doubt it. But that's just my opinion.
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.120]  I've watched Trump's body language with session four or five times. He doesn't do it with anybody else.
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:23.120]  He literally bites his teeth and savers and just looks at him like he's in love with him.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:30.120]  I mean, I'm sorry, the body language is something I've ever seen in Trump other than when he's, I mean, he really likes sessions.
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:33.120]  Three factors. One, let's go back to Nixon's advice.
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.120]  Don't look for someone who helps you. Look for someone who won't hurt you. Jeff Sessions.
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:38.120]  He trusts Sessions.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:41.120]  Sessions would be a safe choice. He'd be a good vice president.
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:47.120]  He could be counted on to carry the Trump policies forward if anything happened to Donald.
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:54.120]  Secondarily, he's perfectly acceptable to the Tea Party, conservative and liberty wings of the party.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:46:00.120]  And third factor, he's also widely acceptable to the party regulars, to the regular Republican structure.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:04.120]  He does no harm. That's why I think he'd be a strong contender.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.120]  We shall see. There's only one man alive who knows that's Donald Trump.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:14.120]  And I hope he takes a hypochritic oath and does no harm and does Senator Sessions of Alabama because that guy's a patriot.
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:21.120]  He's exposed all the treason. We know he's helping advise Trump on foreign policy to a certain extent about the Chinese sell out of the country.
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  Oh, you're racist against Chinese. Look, my sister's Korean adopted. I love everybody.
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:26.120]  Okay, I'm sick of this.
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  China's run by horrible murdering communists and the Clintons gave them missile secrets so they could destroy the whole United States.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:37.120]  And they're in here controlling Hollywood and the media and censoring Michael Savage's book.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  I mean, you know, I'm just sick of it.
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:46.120]  I don't want anybody, whether it's Russia or Israel or Germany or England or Mexico, coming up here dictating to us.
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:51.120]  If you're an American and you want to promote free market freedom and want to make this country great, I love you.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:53.120]  I love you. I love you.
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:56.120]  But if you are out to get this country, I'm done.
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.120]  And shifting gears into something that I don't like to cover because it's somewhat boring on the surface.
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:03.120]  It's key to victory is money.
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:11.120]  But look, our enemies want to mount this country set on the wall for perceived ills or the dominance of the West or whatever it is.
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:17.120]  They sold this whole cultural envy garbage and they're funding all these groups to balkanize the nation.
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:19.120]  That's what the multinationals are doing to make us a joke.
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.120]  Illegals running around on Mexican flags, beating women up, and the media says it's a good thing.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:26.120]  The mayor says in San Jose, it's a good thing. This is crazy.
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:34.120]  We need Donald Trump to counterbalance what's been going on and to make nationalism OK again and just counter the political correctness.
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  So that's my point on that.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.120]  But separately, money.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:41.120]  Trump didn't take any money in the first phase of the campaign.
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:43.120]  People are saying, well, he'll go back now if he does.
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:45.120]  He has to to win.
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:51.120]  So how do we juxtapose this saying I'm not going to take super PAC money or, you know, at least the primaries?
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:53.120]  Well, he's not the primary now. Hillary's got all the multinationals.
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:55.120]  They've conquered the country giving her all this money.
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:00.120]  You know, for me, it's essential that people realize if you're all in, you're all in.
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:01.120]  It's time to donate.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:04.120]  It's time to send videos and campaign ads to people.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.120]  It's time to get politically involved because they're coming after our free speech across the board.
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:09.120]  Drugs report, info wars.
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.120]  You know, the federal issues commission wants to shut us down.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:16.120]  So now it's use our political power, use our first amendment or lose it.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.120]  We got three minutes to break on the money issue.
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:19.120]  Roger Stone.
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:30.120]  I'm really glad you asked this question, Alex, because it's one I get every day from rank and file small donors, the people who give 25, the people who give 50, the people who give $100.
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:32.120]  Not talking about the fat cats.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  Now, the Clinton people are right because Trump did not take and raise money during the nomination phase.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:43.120]  There is a ramp up period in which he has to build a finance operation.
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  He would be foolish to leave money on the table.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.120]  This is going to be a billion dollar fight.
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:52.120]  So there were several developments this week that I think are crucial.
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  One, Tom Barrick, who is a LA based operator of a very successful real estate opportunity fund.
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:13.120]  One of Donald Trump's closest personal friends, truly a confidant, appear, if you will, has announced the formation of the America first pack and $37 million worth of hard commitments.
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:16.120]  I see this as the number one pack to help Trump.
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:18.120]  I think it is a hard money pack.
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.120]  I think it's a big money pack.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:25.120]  Then you have, as I'm sure you have heard, great America pack.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:30.120]  They're very aggressive out among the internet, email and so on.
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:31.120]  This is a scam.
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:33.120]  This is not the place to go if you want to help out.
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:35.120]  It is run by Jesse Benton.
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:39.120]  It is run by Jesse Benton, but more importantly, it's run by a fellow named Ed Rollins.
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:49.120]  Ed Rollins, while he may have worked for Ronald Reagan at one time, currently works at Tenayo Strategies, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Clinton Inc.
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.120]  So he's a turncoat rock type?
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:53.120]  I think this is a sabotage operation.
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:59.120]  I cannot in good conscience urge anybody out there to send a dollar to the Great America pack.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:02.120]  Then you have the Committee for American Sovereignty.
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  I think this is a legit operation run by a very skilled guy named Doug Watts.
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:13.120]  I think Watts really has the Trump campaign in his interests, in his sights.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.120]  He's trying to be helpful.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  There's an August Committee of Americans, including some former Trump executives, some retired military.
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:22.120]  We're almost out of time.
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  I'd go there.
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:24.120]  You know what?
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:26.120]  I'm going to skip the break so we have a few more minutes here with Roger Jones.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:28.120]  We're going to go to a break, actually.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  This is David Knight, and that's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:35.120]  If you want to see that video, it is up on the Real Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  That is Trump V.P. Pick Leaked, question mark.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:40.120]  We're going to play the rest of that when we come back.
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:59.120]  Amazing inside politics from Roger Stones and Alex Jones, and we'll be right back.
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:36.120]  Thank you for watching.
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:52:00.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:29.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:29.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:58.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:14.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, 6-6-16.
[02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:16.120]  Of course, I just mentioned that to Alex Jones.
[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:18.120]  He says, oh, we got to do Facebook mentions on that.
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:22.120]  We're going to come in and talk about what's going on with that because we've seen a lot of news this week.
[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:29.120]  We've had the Satanist in LA saying that they're going to set up a pentagram and mark out the five points around LA,
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:32.120]  claiming it for Satan as if that already hadn't been done with them.
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:36.120]  It's kind of redundant to do that for Hollywood and LA, maybe it is.
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:41.120]  But we also had, and we're going to cover this in detail tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:48.120]  We talked about it a little bit yesterday on The Sunday Show, but there was a very strange occultic ritual
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:52.120]  that was part of the Goddard Rail Tunnel that just opened in Switzerland.
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:54.120]  You won't believe the video of that.
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.120]  We're going to show that to you on the Nightly News and talk about what's going on with that as well.
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.120]  This will be coming in and joining us in the next segment.
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:05.120]  Now, that report where Alex was talking to Roger Stone about the inside politics.
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:07.120]  Who is Donald Trump going to pick for VP?
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:12.120]  And of course, Roger Stone is not going to say if he knows who that's going to be.
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:15.120]  But the person I would like to see is Jeff Sessions.
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:18.120]  And by the way, there's about seven minutes left on that report.
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:21.120]  If you want to see that, that's going up on our YouTube channel now.
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:27.120]  But if we go back and we look at Jeff Sessions, the only person he's ever endorsed for president is Donald Trump.
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:33.120]  And he's been working with Donald Trump since last August, filling him in on what's going on with the borders.
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:35.120]  And this isn't something that is new to Donald Trump.
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:41.120]  He was talking about the unfair trade deals going back 30, 35 years ago,
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:47.120]  running ads in the New York Times spending $100,000 to talk about how awful NAFTA was
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:53.120]  and these other trade deals, which by the way, we have now seen after 25, 30 years of NAFTA,
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:59.120]  we've seen what that has done to our trade with Mexico, with Canada.
[02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:04.120]  We've seen the jobs, the giant sucking sound that Ross Perot was telling us about.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:05.120]  It's now been verified.
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:07.120]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:09.120]  It is an accomplished fact.
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:13.120]  We had roughly equal trade with Mexico until they passed NAFTA.
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:19.120]  Immediately, it went to a $15 billion deficit and it has increased since then.
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:22.120]  We had $60 billion trade deficit just this last year.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:25.120]  So we got massive export of capital, of jobs.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.120]  We have the massive import of workers.
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:30.120]  This is something Donald Trump has been on for a very long time.
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:37.120]  But nobody has been on the Trans-Pacific and the Transatlantic partnership deals, these newest trade treaties,
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:44.120]  which are a major step towards globalization and they are far greater than just the economic issues.
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:53.120]  These two so-called partnership agreements have massive import for our sovereignty and Jeff Sessions understands that.
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:58.120]  It has massive impact on our freedom of speech, on control of the Internet, on so many different things.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:05.120]  Jeff Sessions is the only Senator to look at this, to study it, to create a presentation for his fellow Senators
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:08.120]  who were so disinterested they didn't want to look at it.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:15.120]  So he thought, well, let me explain it to them how awful this is, how we are turning over the management of our economy
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:21.120]  to a foreign organization that is not elected or accountable to us or any other government.
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:26.120]  And they're going to manage our economy and it is going to be a living document.
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:32.120]  And when you hear people talk about that with the Constitution, you ought to take the safety off of your gun
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:34.120]  because that's when it gets really dangerous.
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:40.120]  It's about an economic trade treaty, something that also controls the Internet, that is going to be a living document.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:45.120]  So he's tried to educate other Senators about this, nobody cared about it.
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:49.120]  But Donald Trump did care about it and he educated him on it.
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:51.120]  He's been tutoring him since last August.
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:59.120]  His former Chief of Staff is now, Stephen Miller, who is now the foreign policy advisor, chief foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:04.120]  I would love to see Jeff Sessions because you know what, there's also a geographical balance there.
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:06.120]  Somebody from the South versus somebody from the North.
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:15.120]  There's also a balance of temperaments there between the brusque, kind of inarticulate but in-your-face Donald Trump
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:20.120]  and a very careful, spoken, former judge, Senator Sessions.
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:23.120]  So if you want to see the rest of that report, we've got seven minutes of that left.
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:25.120]  You can see it on the Real Alex Jones channel.
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:33.120]  We're going to be right back. Alex Jones is going to be doing a live Facebook mention talking about 6-6-16 and what's behind it.
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:23.120]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:23.120 --> 02:59:28.120]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:36.120]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time. Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:41.120]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere? We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:52.120 --> 03:00:01.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:45.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is the beginning of the fourth hour, but as Alex was leaving,
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:52.120]  I mentioned to him the fact that it is 6-6-16 and all the different things that are happening with this.
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:57.120]  And of course, it's not just what's happening with the chip. Alex wanted to talk about that.
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:02.120]  But of course, Alex is also, Bilderberg is starting this week. We've got breaks at everything.
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  Is that the cusp? We've got world government that is breaking out or people trying to break out of it. Absolutely.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:11.120]  The Pope's calling for world government saying the Christian roots. He's ashamed of the Christian roots.
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:16.120]  He used a worse word. He had whores hearing about him. It's terrible. He dreads.
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:22.120]  We can pull up that exact quote. So I'm going to get out of here in five minutes, but I was leaving to a meeting that I'm already late for.
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:28.120]  And you were like, yeah, 6-6-6, all this weird occult stuff going on. That's what I'm going to cover coming up, which you're going to do in a moment.
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:33.120]  And I went, oh my gosh, that's it. Because I was on air Friday when this came out and Saturday and Sunday.
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:38.120]  And I read this article from infowars.com. Come on over here, Buckley, or maybe Doc McCammon there.
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:44.120]  Why is there suddenly such a huge push for Mark of the Beast in technology?
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:49.120]  And there's just all over the news, suddenly, yes, you're going to have a chip. Yes, we're getting rid of cash.
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:55.120]  So what would you think? And I got so excited about this, I'm even sweating all of a sudden. It's like 65 degrees in here.
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:02:02.120]  And it all clicked. These are their people pushing in the media and the system to throw it in our face, just like world government.
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:09.120]  We've seen more Mark of the Beast is good for you, get rid of cash, put a chip in your kids in the last month than I've ever seen in 21 years on air.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:14.120]  I mean, it has been a full onslaught. And the mystery is, it's 6-6-6. That's the day.
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:20.120]  It's June 6th, the month of 6th, the day is 6th, the year is 16th, and numerals are the last number.
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:25.120]  That's why they're doing rituals everywhere. That's why they're launching. I bet they pull something out of it.
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:31.120]  There's a mass killing or some big tragedy. They're doing all this garbage because they're bringing it in.
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:36.120]  Your mothers and fathers are bad. Jesus is bad. We abhor Christians.
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:43.120]  Bringing in the Muslims and the EU proposing an ID to use the Internet to tax it and track you and control you.
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:51.120]  Satan is planning to celebrate 6-6-16 in LA. This is their big coming out. This is their big push.
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:54.120]  And it ties into everything else we're facing, everything else we're seeing.
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:03:01.120]  I mean, undoubtedly, just open. Your kid will get a chip. It's inevitable. We played that clip a week ago, hauled it a viral video on it.
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:07.120]  We can cue it up and play it in the next segment. I mean, it's just everywhere. Your kid will get a chip. It's inevitable.
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:12.120]  If that isn't the mark of the beast, if a cashless society and parents being persecuted and being turned off the Internet,
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:18.120]  if you don't submit to the world government so you can't even have a job and it being digitally erased in an electronic concentration camp,
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:25.120]  if that isn't the mark of the beast, if the devil isn't real, they've taken the idea and they're doing it, David. They're manifesting it.
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:31.120]  Well, it's real to them or they wouldn't be putting a pentagram around LA today is when they're doing it in LA.
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:37.120]  David, this is just incredible. Your thoughts for a minute. I've made my point here. Tell us what you got coming up.
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:42.120]  One of the things we're going to cover and we're going to cover it tonight on the Nightly News because there's a lot of visuals about it.
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:51.120]  There was also Alex on June the 1st. There was a grand opening ceremony for this massive rail tunnel through the Swiss Mountains,
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:04:00.120]  the Goddard train, it's a railroad underground tunnel. But the ceremony Alex said they had was truly bizarre.
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:06.120]  It's one of the most bizarre occultic ceremonies you'll see. So we're going to show clips of that. We're going to talk about what's behind that as well as...
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:15.120]  Remember the all-seeing eye on the 9-11 event? Oh yeah. But this is really strange. People who've seen the movie done by Terry Gilliam Brazil,
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:25.120]  the dream sequences, they've got this topless woman flying with feathers and this big baby head on. They've got people marching around like they're in a trance.
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:32.120]  It is truly bizarre. They admit that these things are big mass rituals and that's how they program society.
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:37.120]  And they're doing it, folks. And most of these elites are totally mentally ill. That's why it doesn't make sense to a lot of us.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:43.120]  David Knight, great job, folks. That is the mystery of all this Mark of the Beast promotion. It has to do with the 666 Day.
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:50.120]  They're celebrating it. They're trying to bring it in. They're trying to bring in the Antichrist. They're trying to bring in the false New Age.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:57.120]  Because when Christ truly returns, that's when the true New Age begins for a thousand years. There's a real Illuminati. That's just for freedom and openness.
[03:04:57.120 --> 03:05:00.120]  There's a false Illuminati. We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:09.120]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign. Crisis of character, White House Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary, Bill, and how they operate.
[03:05:09.120 --> 03:05:14.120]  It was written by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, who was posted outside the Oval Office during the Clinton years.
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:18.120]  The book reveals a real personality of Hillary, not the fake one you see on TV.
[03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:23.120]  And it's already at number one at Amazon, despite not being released until June 28th. But what's in the book?
[03:05:23.120 --> 03:05:29.120]  Well, it portrays Hillary as, quote, too erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally violent to become president.
[03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:33.120]  Hillary describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:38.120]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:42.120]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:48.120]  Byrne wrote, quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the president of the United States,
[03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:51.120]  but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
[03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:54.120]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.
[03:05:54.120 --> 03:05:59.120]  And you can find out more at infowars.com. This is K Daniels reporting.
[03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:30.120]  As it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:37.120]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:43.120]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:45.120]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:06:45.120 --> 03:06:51.120]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[03:06:59.120 --> 03:07:03.120]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:06.120]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:12.120]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:18.120]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:21.120]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:26.120]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[03:07:26.120 --> 03:07:28.120]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:32.120]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:07:32.120 --> 03:07:39.120]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:42.120]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:49.120]  It's normally $220 plus, but right now, for limited time, it's less than $200 at infowarslife.com.
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:53.120]  And the small profit we make goes to find our reporters. This is a 360 went.
[03:07:53.120 --> 03:08:14.120]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[03:08:14.120 --> 03:08:26.120]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:30.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this 6-6-16.
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:35.120]  And as you just heard when Alex was in here, we're doing a Facebook mentions live.
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:43.120]  We're talking about the significance, not just to Christians, but to the Satanists who are putting a pentagram around LA this day.
[03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:54.120]  And as we pointed out tonight, we're going to have a special report of the strange occultic rituals that surrounded the grand opening of a train tunnel through the Goddard Mountains in Switzerland.
[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:59.120]  You will not believe the imagery of that. We're going to play a clip in honor of 6-6-16.
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:03.120]  We're going to play a short clip of a microchip report in just a minute.
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:11.120]  Before we do, I want to remind you that today is the last day that we have of 20% off of lung cleanse at infowarslife.com.
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:16.120]  This is the final day to get 20% off lung cleanse at infowarslife.com.
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:20.120]  This is something that I use to get my throat in condition.
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:24.120]  If I've got a little bit of a cough or something or some dust, it's a great throat clear.
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:29.120]  It's a great way to cleanse your lung. We have that. It's 20% off.
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:35.120]  And also we're talking about fresh air. We have a new product, Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.120]  This is the final day of our introductory cell on that 25% off. That's a huge savings.
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:44.120]  $184.99 will be your net cost with that 25% off retail.
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:49.120]  It ends tonight. This is the Alexa Pure Breeze. It is an energy efficient HEPA filter.
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:54.120]  It's ion cluster. It cycles the air through your rooms to get at.
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:59.120]  It basically takes out all the impurities and you're locked up tight as a drum house.
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:03.120]  Most of the houses are that way because you're trying to get it efficient for heating, for cooling.
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:09.120]  So you get everything tight for that. But then it keeps all the pollutants in your house circulating around.
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:12.120]  So you want to get that out of there. This is a great way to do it.
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:16.120]  It's very space saving. It's perfect for rooms up to about 800 square feet.
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:20.120]  It has very silent. It is less than a whisper.
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:24.120]  A whisper is 30 dB. This is 16 dB. Very energy efficient.
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:30.120]  And the end product is clean water. Check that out at infowarstore.com.
[03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:34.120]  We have an introductory offer of that 25% off the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:41.120]  And today is the last day for that as well as the 20% off lung cleanse that you'll see at infowarslife.com.
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:45.120]  Okay, let's run that clip on the microchip report.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:52.120]  Because this is something, as Alex pointed out, there's been a lot of pushing of microchips of a cashless society.
[03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:56.120]  This is the beginning of Bilderberg, which has been pushing world government.
[03:10:56.120 --> 03:10:59.120]  That's been the purpose of Bilderberg since its inception.
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:02.120]  We'll talk about that a little bit. We're also going to talk today about Brexit.
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.120]  We're going to talk about the push to confiscate land.
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:11.120]  This is another push by Obama, but even more interesting is the way the Washington Post is pushing it.
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:15.120]  But before we do all that news, let's play that clip on microchips.
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:20.120]  You know, chances are if you have a four-legged family member at home, it's already microchipped.
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:26.120]  And if the technology exists to save Fido in an emergency, what about microchipping your child?
[03:11:26.120 --> 03:11:32.120]  Before you say, no way, I would never do that. Hear one mom's story.
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:37.120]  It's the longest two seconds of your life, and it's absolute panic.
[03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:39.120]  I want my son back.
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:41.120]  We've seen it in movies.
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:43.120]  This is my son!
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:47.120]  Over and over again, children gone missing.
[03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:48.120]  It's terrifying.
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:55.120]  For Stephanie Rodriguez Neely, life is busier than ever, with four children including a newborn.
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:00.120]  She knows scary situations can happen in an instant, and for her, it has.
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:04.120]  If it'll save my kid, there's no stuff that's too extreme.
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:10.120]  Stephanie's teenage daughter is a special needs child, prone to wander off and trust strangers.
[03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:15.120]  For that very reason, Stephanie wholeheartedly welcomes microchipping a child.
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:17.120]  Isn't that special? All right, we're going to stop it at that point.
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:20.120]  And I would just say this. You've got a special needs child.
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:24.120]  You're concerned the child is going to run off and get into trouble. Understand?
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:30.120]  Also understand the health consequences of putting those transmitters on your dogs even.
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:36.120]  There's been a lot of increase in terms of tumors at the sites where they put these radio transmitters into dogs.
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:40.120]  I wouldn't do it to my dog, and I wouldn't do it to my child.
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:44.120]  And I wouldn't do it to my elderly parent, who suffers from dementia either.
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:47.120]  And I wouldn't do it to myself, because you know what?
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:49.120]  It's not just the health issues.
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:57.120]  It's also the issues of freedom, folks. We cannot continue to sell ourselves into slavery for the promise of security.
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:03.120]  They never deliver it. They tell you, give up your freedom. We'll make you more prosperous.
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:09.120]  We'll make you safer. Slaves are never safer. Slaves never get richer.
[03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:15.120]  When are we going to learn that? When are we going to learn that to the degree that we give up our liberty, we become slaves?
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:22.120]  They continue to offer us this Faustian bargain, and we never realize that the devil's got a trick up his sleeve.
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:28.120]  No matter how many times they skunk us, they keep doing it to us over and over again.
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:30.120]  And this is just another example of that.
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:33.120]  Putting this out there saying, well, it's great. It's for your dogs.
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:39.120]  It's for your special needs children. It's for your elderly people that we need to keep track of.
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:44.120]  No. No. There's an agenda behind this, folks. We've pointed that out many, many times.
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:50.120]  All right. Now, I've got a lot of disjointed news here that I just want to cover a little bit at a time.
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:54.120]  One of these things here is kind of, I think, is very interesting.
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:14:02.120]  As we look at the people that are being brought into this country by Obama, and I mentioned this briefly yesterday,
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:10.120]  how we've had situations in Vermont, and they reported that, hey, look, 35% of the people coming into Vermont have tuberculosis.
[03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:16.120]  Many people in America don't really get concerned about that because they've forgotten what tuberculosis is,
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:18.120]  because it only affects about 5% of the people here.
[03:14:18.120 --> 03:14:21.120]  But globally, the average is about 35%.
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:28.120]  And they're the places where Obama is bringing people in without vetting them, without doing any health tests on them.
[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:34.120]  And many of the Asian and African countries, it is up to 80% of the people who have tuberculosis.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:36.120]  Remember they called it consumption?
[03:14:36.120 --> 03:14:43.120]  Maybe you want to go back and look at some of the old westerns where they got doc holiday and he's spitting up blood and dying because it will kill you.
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:46.120]  And you say, well, we got treatments for that in the first world.
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:52.120]  Well, yes, but there are also drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis as well.
[03:14:52.120 --> 03:14:54.120]  Do you want to bring that in here as well?
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:58.120]  This is a deliberate move by Obama in so many different ways.
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:04.120]  It seems like he is hell-bent on destroying this country, destroying our way of life, destroying our health.
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:06.120]  And yet they keep offering us safety.
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:08.120]  Just take the chip, you'll be fine.
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:13.120]  But we're bringing in all these people who hate America, who want what you have,
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:20.120]  and in many cases who are coming in untested for disease, untested for being criminals, untested for being terrorists.
[03:15:20.120 --> 03:15:29.120]  And now we just saw this last weekend as it broke, we had workers in two Minneapolis and two Minnesota hospitals that were diagnosed with active TB.
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:35.120]  These are two workers, both of these hospitals were owned by one company, Alina Health.
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:38.120]  They say one hospital worker at each of these sites.
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  Now they're saying neither of these workers were involved with refugee screening activity.
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:51.120]  Sure, okay, except that last year, a local newspaper reported three employees of another clinic owned by this same company.
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:57.120]  Within 10 miles of these two hospitals where the two workers were just diagnosed with active tuberculosis,
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:16:03.120]  received awards from Anoka County, the fourth most populous county in the Minneapolis, St. Paul area,
[03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:07.120]  for their volunteer work medically screening refugees.
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:09.120]  Yeah, okay, okay, so there you go.
[03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:13.120]  They tell you one thing and they do another, and that's a report from Breitbart.
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:21.120]  But I want to focus on something else, and that is what if our government, as they bring in these refugees that don't screen them,
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:26.120]  we know that they are bringing in diseases to be used as weapons, as bioweapons.
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:35.120]  They call them select agents, and they try to give them what they call in Pentagon talk, gain of function.
[03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:41.120]  That means that they make them more deadly, and that means that they make them more easily transmittable.
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:48.120]  And these are the kinds of research that are being performed by the Center for Disease Control, the CDC, and other biolab companies.
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:55.120]  Now there's a reporter at USA Today, Allison Young, and she's done a lot of work following this.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:17:01.120]  This is her beat, and she does a lot of work talking about the biolab failures of the CDC,
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:03.120]  and she just had one that broke at the end of the week.
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:10.120]  And I want to read you a little bit of this scenario just to get you the idea of how dangerous this is.
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:15.120]  Now this is, the title is, Newly Disclosed CDC Biofailures.
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:19.120]  Biolab failures are, quote, like a screenplay for a disaster movie.
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:24.120]  And listen to this, it does read like a disaster movie, encased in spacesuit-like gear.
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:27.120]  Needed to protect them from the world's deadliest viruses.
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:31.120]  Four scientists at the CDC stepped into their lab's decontamination chamber,
[03:17:31.120 --> 03:17:35.120]  where a shower of chemicals was supposed to kill anything on them,
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:38.120]  and make it safe for them to exit into an adjacent changing room.
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:40.120]  But the shower wouldn't start.
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:44.120]  And warning lights appeared as a cascading series of safety systems began to fail
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:49.120]  inside one of the world's most advanced biosafety level four labs.
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:51.120]  That's the highest level, folks.
[03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:54.120]  She goes on to say that in the next sentence.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  Reserve for work with deadly Ebola and smallpox viruses and other pathogens that lack vaccines or reliable treatments.
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:08.120]  The gasket seal around the exit door in the changing room deflated to the point that the scientists could see light coming in.
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:13.120]  See, there's a positive pressure, so they have no air escaping from this thing,
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:15.120]  but the gasket seal just broke down.
[03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:19.120]  So they could see light coming in through this seal that is supposed to be airtight.
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:23.120]  As they held the door shut and they started an emergency chemical deluge,
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:25.120]  things got even worse.
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:31.120]  The shower's door back into the infectious disease lab forcefully burst open again and again,
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:33.120]  and they couldn't even hold it shut.
[03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:37.120]  Meanwhile, air pressure alarms were blinking and monitors displayed as a lab has read,
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:42.120]  according to records of the February 2009 incident recently obtained by USA Today,
[03:18:42.120 --> 03:18:44.120]  under a FOIA request.
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:48.120]  The CDC took three and a half years to fulfill the request.
[03:18:48.120 --> 03:18:55.120]  Why? Because they don't want you to know what a cock this whole thing is.
[03:18:55.120 --> 03:19:00.120]  They bring these things in, deadly diseases that don't even exist in our country.
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:02.120]  They're bringing them in as weapons.
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:06.120]  They're creating these weapons and they can't and won't control these things.
[03:19:06.120 --> 03:19:08.120]  You need to be very concerned about this.
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:10.120]  What do we do to stop this?
[03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:11.120]  How do we get control of this?
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:13.120]  This is the CDC's own lab.
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:20.120]  And, of course, the same reporter reported on what happened in the primate center about a year and a half ago.
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:25.120]  The national primate center, where they brought in a disease that's not endemic to the United States,
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:29.120]  a very deadly disease, they brought it in to make it more deadly, more easy to catch,
[03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:34.120]  and somehow it got out of a bio-level safety lab level number three.
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:39.120]  It got into the primates who were not even contained in a contained area,
[03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:43.120]  which had to be concerned about, is it getting into the soil and water?
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:46.120]  And then as they investigated it, they found workers who came down with it,
[03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:51.120]  but they said, don't worry, I'm sure those workers already had it before they started the investigation.
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:53.120]  That's the way they lied to us.
[03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:55.120]  You have to understand how dangerous this is.
[03:19:55.120 --> 03:19:59.120]  They are playing not only with fire, they're playing with a pandemic.
[03:19:59.120 --> 03:20:00.120]  Stay with us to be right back.
[03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:10.120]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life insurance.
[03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:14.120]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:14.120 --> 03:20:18.120]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:20.120]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:20.120 --> 03:20:24.120]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated,
[03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:31.120]  price competitive companies we represent and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:36.120]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:43.120]  experience and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:45.120]  How about you?
[03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:56.120]  Free quote, call 1-800-654-1632. That's 1-800-654-1632. 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:56.120 --> 03:21:00.120]  Or go to selectquote.com. We shop, you save.
[03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:03.120]  Are you concerned about the power grid?
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:05.120]  About the new war on the power grid?
[03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:11.120]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable.
[03:21:11.120 --> 03:21:17.120]  Why? An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just been written.
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:21.120]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies,
[03:21:21.120 --> 03:21:24.120]  but only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:29.120]  He simply asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:35.120]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:36.120]  Why do this?
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:41.120]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book? The answer is simple.
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:45.120]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:50.120]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:52.120]  do you fear for your life?

[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:17.120]  And there's a number of reasons.
[03:22:17.120 --> 03:22:19.120]  First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get.
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:22.120]  It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients in it.
[03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:27.120]  And then the most important reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients
[03:22:27.120 --> 03:22:29.120]  is because it's got brain food in it.
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:31.120]  It's got the essential amino acid.
[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:34.120]  It's got triptan, philolamine, tyrosine, and choline, vitamin B6,
[03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:37.120]  and these chemicals that are all natural from food
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:39.120]  turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.

[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:09.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:14.120]  I'm David Knight and we were just talking in the last segment about the latest revelation.
[03:24:14.120 --> 03:24:19.120]  Because we've had revelations before about breakdowns in biosafety labs.
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:24.120]  Of course, we've had the government shipping live anthrax virus through the regular mail.
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:27.120]  We've had the National Primate Center.
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:31.120]  We've had deadly bacteria get out and escape into the wild there.
[03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:33.120]  They still don't know how that happened.
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:39.120]  I just read you this report and it does play like the screenplay of a disaster movie.
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:41.120]  Because this is a disaster waiting to happen.
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:43.120]  And this is just the incompetence level here.
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:47.120]  This isn't even talking about the sinister stuff that they do.
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:50.120]  Like the Tuskegee experiments that we all know about.
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:54.120]  But the very fact that they're doing this is sinister.
[03:24:54.120 --> 03:25:01.120]  The very fact that we have with Operation Paperclip that we brought in these Nazi and Japanese scientists
[03:25:01.120 --> 03:25:07.120]  who had been doing horrific human experimentation and brought them in for our own weapons program.
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:13.120]  To give these deadly non-native diseases a gain of function.
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:16.120]  To make them more deadly, to make them more easily transmittable.
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:20.120]  So that's one of the things that's facing us and of course the breakouts of this.
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:22.120]  How do we contain government?
[03:25:22.120 --> 03:25:24.120]  It's a perfect metaphor for government, isn't it?
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:28.120]  Especially the government, the national security state, the Pentagon.
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:34.120]  How they create these weapons that are hanging over our heads like the sword of Damocles.
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:36.120]  And yet there's other problems as well.
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:42.120]  At the same time they're doing this and telling us that they have to have a national security state to watch everything that everybody does.
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:47.120]  We see that the federal government lost all of its personnel records to hackers.
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:48.120]  And now this.
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:51.120]  Coming out of, interestingly enough, Australia.
[03:25:51.120 --> 03:25:56.120]  Had a guy send this to me on Twitter because you know our press doesn't cover this kind of news.
[03:25:56.120 --> 03:25:57.120]  But Australia did.
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.120]  The US Federal Reserve was breached more than 50 times recently.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:08.120]  The US Federal Reserve detected more than 50 breaches to its network and systems between 2011 and 2015.
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:12.120]  With several incidents described internally as espionage.
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:16.120]  They say the Fed's computer systems play a critical role in global banking, of course.
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:22.120]  They hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets.
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:28.120]  Of course we're having that kind of discussion today as Janet Yellen is dropping hints about whether she's going to raise interest rates or not.
[03:26:28.120 --> 03:26:32.120]  Doing it at the same time, people are talking about Brexit.
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:40.120]  And we've got the prime minister of the UK trying to scare people about financial Armageddon if they leave the EU.
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:43.120]  And we're going to cover that in the next segment here.
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:51.120]  But with this, they say the cyber security reports obtained by Reuters, again through a FOIA Act, were heavily redacted by the Fed officials.
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:27:01.120]  They say the records represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the Fed because they include only cases involving the Washington-based Bureau of Board of Governors.
[03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:08.120]  They did not have access to reports of cyber security teams at the central bank's 12 privately owned regional branches.
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:14.120]  Disclosure breaches of the Fed comes at a time when cyber security at central banks worldwide is under scrutiny and under attack.
[03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:21.120]  After hackers stole $81 million from a bank Bangladesh account at the New York Fed.
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:25.120]  At the New York Fed. They went into the...
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:30.120]  This is bigger than Bonnie and Clyde. This is bigger than Jesse James.
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:37.120]  This is bigger than the Italian job. You know where they had those little minis and they went in and robbed the bank and they had little cars so they could get through the traffic jams.
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:44.120]  Now, they didn't do any of that physical stuff because of the digital cash.
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:50.120]  Hackers can go in and steal $81 million and they can do it at the New York Fed.
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:27:53.120]  Just hack into their account and take it right out of there.
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:28:05.120]  They say cyber thieves have targeted large financial institutions around the world, including America's largest bank, J.P. Morgan, as well as smaller players like Ecuador's Banco del Ostro and Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank.
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:10.120]  They also go on to say security analysts said foreign governments could stand again from internal Fed information.
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:26.120]  You think? You think? You think they could use that? You think China and Russia, as they say, for instance, major players in the $13.8 trillion federal debt market where Fed policy plays a big role in setting interest rates.
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:43.120]  So if you are a criminal individual or if you are a foreign government that wants to mess with our money supply, then you go to the people who are counterfeiting it, the Federal Reserve, and they're talking about whether they're going to pump or dump, whether they're going to do quantitative easing.
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:53.120]  Are they going to raise or lower interest rates? Having that advanced knowledge can get you a lot of money and it makes them a big target and they're not doing a very good job of protecting it.
[03:28:53.120 --> 03:29:05.120]  Of course, if you're a congressman or a congresswoman, then you can act on inside information that you have when you're going to pass bills to help a particular company or to shut down a particular industry.
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:19.120]  You can sell it short. If you're going to shut down the coal industry, you can make a lot of money selling short coal stocks or oil stocks, or if you're going to give a massive subsidy to a solar power company, it might be kind of convenient to have that information.
[03:29:19.120 --> 03:29:28.120]  Remember, that came out at one point in time and everybody was appalled that Congress just looked the other way and said, no, that's okay. We can do insider training.
[03:29:28.120 --> 03:29:37.120]  We'll lock up Martha Stewart for it, but we will do it ourselves. So they passed a little bill. They left it in there for about six months and when nobody was looking, they eviscerated that bill.
[03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:49.120]  They got rid of it. They're still doing insider trading. So why wouldn't cyber criminals do insider trading at the Federal Reserve? Stay with us to be right back.
[03:29:49.120 --> 03:30:00.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:19.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Teleprompter-in-Chief Unedited. If we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know, a bunch of...
[03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:35.120]  Okie-dokie. Just because, you know, it... It sounds funny or the tweets are provocative.
[03:30:35.120 --> 03:30:42.120]  Always trying to make Trump look bad, but he won't be debating Trump. Hillary will.
[03:30:42.120 --> 03:30:51.120]  Well, first of all, they're just words. She reads off a teleprompter. You notice she's reading off a teleprompter. She always does. She really doesn't have her own words.
[03:30:51.120 --> 03:30:53.120]  It should be fun.
[03:30:53.120 --> 03:31:17.120]  For infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:27.120]  The most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water.
[03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:33.120]  So this is non-toxic. It's a beautiful unit. It really looks good. I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:48.120]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan. It's super quiet.
[03:31:48.120 --> 03:31:54.120]  Because this one has a silent mode, which runs at 16 decibels. Go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time.
[03:31:54.120 --> 03:32:06.120]  Great job, Alexa Pure, infowarsstore.com. But we thank you so much, my friend.

[03:33:17.120 --> 03:33:45.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this 6-6-16. As we pointed out, we've had a couple of reports. We did the top of the hour with Alex Jones about the significance of what is happening in the world, what is being pushed in terms of biochips, in terms of internet IDs, the ceremonies that we're seeing being done by the Satanist throughout the country.
[03:33:45.120 --> 03:34:00.120]  On this day and at the beginning of June, we're going to have more on that tonight on the Infowars Nightly News. Tonight we're also going to talk about the billionaire's ultimate bug out bag, and that would be a rocket ship, folks.
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:17.120]  You know, you talk about these billionaires building these elaborate places with panic rooms, George Clooney's got one in the UK, other people setting up these elaborate and expensive compounds to protect themselves from some kind of a societal breakdown.
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:27.120]  Look, the ultimate bug out bag is a rocket to get off of the place once their disruptive technologies get so disruptive that they start destroying the earth.
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:34.120]  We've had multiple science fiction scenarios, but of course we've had scientists that we've interviewed. I've interviewed Hugo DeGaris who wrote the Art-Elect War.
[03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:43.120]  They talked about as people become, as the general public becomes aware of the danger of some of these technologies that are so dangerous.
[03:34:43.120 --> 03:34:53.120]  And we're not talking now about things like the gain-of-function bio-weapon programs, that's one of them as well, but also the autonomous killing robots that are being done by the Pentagon.
[03:34:53.120 --> 03:35:08.120]  Even just artificial intelligence, Hugo DeGaris is an artificial intelligence scientist. He talked about his concern that what he was creating and his fellow scientists were creating was going to get out of control and that it would squash us.
[03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:16.120]  The same sorts of things that Elon Musk has openly talked about. And of course, that's his bug out bag, trying to get to Mars, setting up his space program.
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:25.120]  We're going to talk about all these different billionaires and their different programs. I think the key guy that we need to look at is Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com.
[03:35:25.120 --> 03:35:37.120]  We're going to tell you what he's got going. I think he's the guy that's got the most interesting approach to all of this, and certainly I think he has the most advanced technology behind all this.
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:46.120]  We're going to talk about the other aspect of space exploration, and that is kind of a super agenda 21, if you will.
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:58.120]  And of course, agenda 21, the UN agenda for the 21st century, which says let's lock all the people up in little tiny concentrated cities and let's keep the rest of the world for the elites.
[03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:10.120]  Okay, that's now been changed and updated into something that's a little bit more specific, not just the 21st century. No, they've got the 2030 UN agenda, the 2030 UN agenda for sustainable development.
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:18.120]  So we're going to talk about that and how I believe this space exploration plays into all that. That's also going to be on tonight's nightly news.
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:29.120]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind you that today is the last day for two specials. If you want to breathe easy, we've got a couple of things here for you. Lung cleanse, 20% off at infowarslife.com.
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:39.120]  Today is the final day of that cell. And of course, lung cleanse is an easy to use spray bottle. It tastes great. It really works. It helps to get the, to cleanse your lungs.
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:49.120]  I use that to get my lungs cleansed when I get on the air. That and brain force are two of my favorite supplements that we have at infowarslife.com.
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:57.120]  And of course, we've got 20% off of lung cleanse ending today. Also, the final day for our introduction of Alexa pure breeze.
[03:36:57.120 --> 03:37:06.120]  Now this is an energy efficient ion cluster air purification system. We've just started doing this. So this is our introductory special 25% off.
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:16.120]  It's 184.99. That's a great price. If you shop and compare the features of this piece of equipment, I think you'll agree. This is an incredible price.
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:27.120]  Again, this is something that it recycles 120 cubic feet every 12 minutes. It does an air change. It's very silent and it's by product is simply clean water.
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:36.120]  So take a look at infowarsstore.com. Check out Alexa pure breeze and look at the statistics on that. We have a comparison with other similar products.
[03:37:36.120 --> 03:37:48.120]  You can see what a savings that is on that. And again, today is the final day of that 25% off that introductory cell and the final day of 20% off of lung cleanse at infowarslife.com.
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:55.120]  Let me see. Where do I want to go? I think I want to talk about the misinformation that we're seeing as I was driving in today.
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:38:03.120]  I heard yet again the narrative that Donald Trump has jumped the shark. How many times have we heard this?
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:13.120]  Because he criticized this judge who's doing very unjudicial things, by the way, in terms of releasing these transcripts as the trial is going on.
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:22.120]  Isn't that interesting that he would do that? But of course, there's no criticism for that. It's criticism for Donald Trump pointing out that this guy is biased and pointing out the reason for his bias.
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:28.120]  And he talks about his Mexican heritage. Now, Donald Trump was not saying that he can't get a fair trial from any Mexican, I don't think.
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:43.120]  But certainly this judge is somebody who bears looking at, not simply because he has a Mexican heritage, but because his Mexican heritage is so important to him that he joins that he's a key member of La Raza.
[03:38:43.120 --> 03:38:52.120]  Now, if you don't understand what La Raza is, let me read to you. And I read this yesterday on the Sunday show. But I want to read this again because it bears repeating.
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:39:05.120]  This is Cesar Chavez, the union organizer for the United Farm Workers, helping migrant workers. And he was very, very critical of La Raza, the race.
[03:39:05.120 --> 03:39:14.120]  Cesar Chavez said it was racist. The organization was racist. Here's specifically what he had to say. And you can see this on Wikipedia. You can see the quotes there.
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:28.120]  He says, I hear more and more Mexicans talking about La Raza, says Cesar Chavez, to build up their pride. Some people don't look at it as racism, but when you say La Raza, you were saying an anti-gringo thing and it won't stop there.
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:38.120]  Today it's anti-group. Tomorrow it will be, or anti-gringo. Tomorrow it will be anti-negro. We had a stupid guy who just wanted to play politics within the union.
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:46.120]  And he began to whip up La Raza against the white volunteers and even had some of the farm workers and the pickets and the organizers hung up on La Raza.
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:53.120]  So I took him on. He said these things have to be met on. On discrimination, I don't even give the members the privilege of a vote.
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:40:01.120]  And I'm not ashamed to say it. No, the whole business of discrimination can't exist here. So often these days leaders are afraid.
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:08.120]  They don't, they even feel strongly about racism, but they won't speak out against it. It's important that we call it what it is.
[03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:18.120]  That's why we had the videos up saying that this judge is a key member of Hispanic, they called him Hispanic Grand Dragon.
[03:40:18.120 --> 03:40:25.120]  You need to understand that's the case. Now let me read you something else here. You have a friend of his, Richard Garcia, who quoted Chavez,
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:35.120]  who said, La Raza, why be racist? Because La Raza literally means the race. He says, our belief is to help everyone, not just one race.
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:43.120]  Humanity is our belief, he said. And a friend, another friend, Stan Steiner, observed that when Chavez told Chicanos this,
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:54.120]  he said their faces fell in disbelief. They thought that he was a nationalist, not a humanist. That is what this is about, folks.
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:41:04.120]  This is a clash of nationalism. So at the top level, what the Wall Street people are doing is a clash of globalism versus nationalism.
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:14.120]  But at the level that we're seeing with these dreamer riots that are happening at the Trump rallies, where these people are waving Mexican flags and burning American flags,
[03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:25.120]  that is nationalism versus nationalism. That is what is behind all of this. And when you've got a judge who is a La Raza official,
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:34.120]  okay, highly connected in that. And then of course, the Washington Post says, no, no, no, the lawyers, the La Raza lawyers is not connected to La Raza National.
[03:41:34.120 --> 03:41:44.120]  It's like Bologna, Bologna. Just call them on that BS. I tell you, Washington Post has dropped to the lowest standards of just about any of the major newspapers.
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:53.120]  And of course, we've pointed out a lot of problems with mainstream media. But Washington Post is getting to be a true propaganda rag.
[03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:59.120]  And I've got another example of that coming up here in just a moment. But when we see what's happening here, this is nationalism versus nationalism.
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:07.120]  These are people coming here saying, make America Mexican again. They're burning American flags. They're waving Mexican flags.
[03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:15.120]  They're hunting people down like prey because they are pro-American or because they don't like their political beliefs.
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:20.120]  You're going to accept that? Are you going to accept the idea that we ought to just allow this to happen?
[03:42:20.120 --> 03:42:24.120]  We ought to just bring people in without any kind of vetting. And we ought to let everyone come here.
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:33.120]  Look at this story. I hadn't seen this. My wife sent this to me out of Fox, Atlanta. A woman in a burka attacks Lawrenceville family who had an American flag.
[03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:38.120]  She attacked them with her own flag. They said they were sitting there and they're staying there in the garage.
[03:42:38.120 --> 03:42:44.120]  The lady said, I was talking to my daughter. And all of a sudden, this woman in a burka comes out of the woods.
[03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:51.120]  And she stands there and looks at us for a second. And then she goes over and they had an American flag on a pole stuck on their mailbox.
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:57.120]  She grabs the American flag that's on the pole and rushes them to attack them.
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:43:03.120]  And as the daughter says, well, when she came charging, it was kind of like mama bear instincts kicked in.
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:10.120]  My mama had to protect her children so they got into a fight. These two women and then some neighbors came over and helped them.
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:18.120]  When the police arrested this woman who gave her name as Amina Ara 30, all she would tell them is she's quote from Africa.
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:25.120]  No other information. Not even what country she's from. No local address because, you know, we don't vet anybody who comes here.
[03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:34.120]  We bring in people who hate this country. Or as I mentioned yesterday, and this is another thing I want to repeat again because I think this is very, very important.
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:41.120]  We had Hillary Clinton going through California, doing her campaign stops. And of course, she doesn't do press conferences, right?
[03:43:41.120 --> 03:43:52.120]  So she does these dog and pony shows where she brings in people who are illegal immigrants, college age dreamers, talking about how wonderful all of this stuff is.
[03:43:52.120 --> 03:44:01.120]  And guys, if you got this from yesterday's show, I want you to queue up this clip number two where the lady says she's able to get scholarships and everything.
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:12.120]  She has sitting next to her, a South Korean student. And the student says, yeah, I go to Azusa Pacifica College and we're going to play that clip for you here in a minute.
[03:44:12.120 --> 03:44:18.120]  And as she's talking about what she's doing, Hillary Clinton is sitting there nodding and smiling approvingly.
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:29.120]  And what she says, yeah, I'm an undocumented immigrant from South Korea and I came here for college and I'm getting all of my scholarships and grants through DACA, the Dreamer program.
[03:44:29.120 --> 03:44:36.120]  And so I looked at that and I said, well, how much tuition are we talking about here at Azusa Pacifica College?
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:51.120]  Well, their tuition alone is $35,500 a year. But the college says plan on $44,500 because it's going to be service fees, room and board, housing and a meal plan.
[03:44:51.120 --> 03:45:05.120]  So figure on about $44.4 a year. Understand what's going on. This is called a full ride scholarship. This is the most coveted scholarship that American students have to work very hard for.
[03:45:05.120 --> 03:45:17.120]  American students don't get in state tuition unless their parents have lived in a state and paid taxes in that state to support these tax funded organizations as subsidized.
[03:45:17.120 --> 03:45:29.120]  That's why the prices are so expensive. This lady who comes here from South Korea, and again, five years ago, they're talking about how South Korean students are just balking at the high cost of college.
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:42.120]  I said, you know, it's really not worth it to get a college degree. I'm having to pay $7,000 a year to go to college in South Korea and I'm getting out of here with like $35,000 in debt that I can't do anything with.
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:58.120]  I said the cost of tuition is too high. It's not really helping me to get a job. They point out that 3 million South Korean students, which is about the number that they got enrolled in a given year, about 3.3 million, couldn't find jobs after they got their college degrees.
[03:45:58.120 --> 03:46:08.120]  Plus they had $35,000 in student loans that they had that they'd gone into debt for. So what's a poor South Korean student going to do?
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:23.120]  Okay, here's an idea. You can go to America because Hillary and Obama will give you a full ride scholarship. No questions asked. And you don't end up with a student loan. The American taxpayer ends up with a student loan.
[03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:36.120]  And over four years, that's $177,000 for this lady. All she did was just come here in defiance of our laws and demand this largesse.
[03:46:36.120 --> 03:46:51.120]  Which ought to make you spitting mad. It makes me really mad to see this going on. And when does it stop? Because we've got both Bernie and Hillary saying that they're going to continue doing this.
[03:46:51.120 --> 03:47:00.120]  Let's play that clip. They've got that clip ready. Let's play the clip. And this is what she said with Hillary and Hillary setting right there with her smiling and approving. Here we go.
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:09.120]  Others like Clara Kim, here illegally from South Korea, goes to Azusa Pacific. She was able to get help with tuition despite her legal status.
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:13.120]  I was able to get scholarships and grants through DACA.
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:16.120]  DACA and DAPA are government programs, which among other things...
[03:47:16.120 --> 03:47:26.120]  There you go. Okay, now let's get that other clip because I want to play for you how the press is playing along with this. This is a CBS out of LA.
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:32.120]  Let's get that third clip that we had from yesterday's show. We didn't even play yesterday where they wrap that up. Clip number three.
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:45.120]  But let's talk about this. This one individual comes over here and rips us off for $177,000, gets a full free ride scholarship simply because she's illegal.
[03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:56.120]  Again, in defiance of our laws, because she's illegal, we give her special benefits. It made me so angry to look at the Libertarian Party debating open borders and immigration.
[03:47:56.120 --> 03:48:05.120]  These people were so absolutely clueless. And of course, we've got Gary Johnson and William Weld throwing the Second Amendment under the bus.
[03:48:05.120 --> 03:48:09.120]  But on open borders, they were online with the Libertarian Party, I'm afraid to say.
[03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:17.120]  And saying, well, you know, it's not really a problem because even though we got open borders, and that could bankrupt the country.
[03:48:17.120 --> 03:48:27.120]  As Milton Friedman pointed out 30 or 40 years ago, people who are not citizens aren't going to get those welfare benefits.
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:34.120]  It's like, oh really? Tell that to the South Korean lady who came in and gave herself $177,000 in free college tuition.
[03:48:34.120 --> 03:48:42.120]  Why don't we just do that for all the South Korean people, all the students, all 3.5, 3.6 million South Korean college students.
[03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:46.120]  Let them all come here. Why should they bother to go into debt to pay for their education?
[03:48:46.120 --> 03:48:56.120]  Let them all come to America because that would only be $637 billion a year that they would put on us and then debt us and debt our children.
[03:48:56.120 --> 03:49:05.120]  Take our homes with property taxes to pay for this nonsense because, quite frankly, that is the policy that Bernie, that Hillary,
[03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:10.120]  that the Libertarian Party of Gary Johnson and William Weld, they all support that.
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:17.120]  Open the borders, we want free and open borders, and we want everybody to come in and we want to give them free college tuition.
[03:49:17.120 --> 03:49:22.120]  Free college tuition. And so, where does it stop? That's just one country.
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:31.120]  South Korea be $637 billion. Do we as American taxpayers have to have the IRS hold a gun to our head and force us to pay for the college education?
[03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:39.120]  I know what's pointed out this way. It's worthless. An American college education is mostly worthless unless you get something in engineering or medicine.
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:45.120]  It's a worthless degree. What are they teaching them? Hate white people. What are they going to do with that when they go back to South Korea?
[03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:51.120]  There's no white people there to hate. Well, I guess they could hate us because we paid for the college tuition, couldn't they?
[03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:54.120]  And then this is what CBS has to say. Let's play that clip.
[03:49:54.120 --> 03:50:01.120]  Both Aguilar and Mendez fully support what they heard from Hillary Clinton today, and they would love to support her in November.
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:05.120]  But given their status, they can't vote. They're part of the shame.
[03:50:05.120 --> 03:50:11.120]  There are 11 million people in this country illegally who can't vote in an election that figures to great...
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:16.120]  I want to bang my head against the wall. They would love to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:16.120 --> 03:50:21.120]  This is an issue that affects their future, and they would love to vote for her, but they can't because they're not citizens.
[03:50:21.120 --> 03:50:27.120]  Do you realize the absurdity of this? And that guy is smiling there for CBS and LA?
[03:50:27.120 --> 03:50:33.120]  It's pathetic. And then their article says, as Aguilar and other undocumented students at the event said they were committed to Clinton too.
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:40.120]  However, like millions of other undocumented immigrants, they will not be able to vote in next week's primary or the general election.
[03:50:40.120 --> 03:50:42.120]  Don't worry. They're going to change that.
[03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:46.120]  She said the central issue of her campaign, and she's got two central issues.
[03:50:46.120 --> 03:50:48.120]  We'll talk about the other one's guns when we come back.
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:50.120]  She said the central issue is immigration.
[03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:53.120]  Within 100 days, I'm going to make all these people voters.
[03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:55.120]  They will be reliable little minions for her.
[03:50:55.120 --> 03:51:00.120]  All she has to do is steal from you and give them a free college education. We'll be right back.

[03:54:14.120 --> 03:54:17.120]  But before I do, just real quickly, I'll mention one more time.

[03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:22.120]  Guns. Hillary Clinton said that immigration and making illegals legal is going to be the center part of her campaign.
[03:55:22.120 --> 03:55:25.120]  But of course, gun confiscation is a big part of it as well.
[03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:29.120]  She's talking about this throughout California. A very popular thing for her to talk about.
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:36.120]  One thing that she's hit Bernie Sanders on because even Bernie Sanders doesn't want the kind of gun control that Hillary Clinton does.
[03:55:36.120 --> 03:55:47.120]  See, he voted, as most other people did, for a reasonable law, the PLCAA, Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act.
[03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:57.120]  What is that about? That says simply that you can't sue gun manufacturers who aren't liable for the product that they make.
[03:55:57.120 --> 03:56:01.120]  They make a product and it's a gun and you can't sue them because you don't like guns.
[03:56:01.120 --> 03:56:08.120]  Well, Hillary Clinton wants to sue them. That's like saying, somebody got killed with a Ford, so we're going to come after Ford.
[03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:11.120]  Because we don't like cars. We know that Ford's got a lot of money.
[03:56:11.120 --> 03:56:16.120]  So we're going to shut down the automobile industry because we're inner city liberals and we hate cars.
[03:56:16.120 --> 03:56:22.120]  Well, that's what these people are doing with guns. So they passed a law just to underscore, I guess, the Second Amendment.
[03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:27.120]  Or maybe, you know, start to get the idea, don't you, that the Constitution is no longer in effect.
[03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:34.120]  That's another story for another day. But why do we even need to have a PLCAA?
[03:56:34.120 --> 03:56:37.120]  Well, one of the reasons we need to have it is for people like Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:40.120]  You can point to it and you can say, shut up, we've addressed this specifically.
[03:56:40.120 --> 03:56:49.120]  Just in case you don't understand what shall not infringe means, then we have passed a special law for you, Hillary, but she wants to get rid of it.
[03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:54.120]  And she said this yesterday on this week with George Stephanopoulos, one of the Sunday shows.
[03:56:54.120 --> 03:56:57.120]  She outlined her plan to abolish the Second Amendment.
[03:56:57.120 --> 03:57:04.120]  First, she says, I'm not seeking to abolish the Second Amendment. I'm just thinking to make it unapplicable.
[03:57:04.120 --> 03:57:10.120]  Okay, we're going to shut down gun manufacturers. We're going to track ammunition.
[03:57:10.120 --> 03:57:14.120]  We're going to make sure that you can't buy ammunition without a background check.
[03:57:14.120 --> 03:57:18.120]  All the stuff, you know, that the Libertarian Party candidates supported when they were governors.
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:23.120]  Okay, William Weld supported all this stuff and people called him out on it and said, wait a minute.
[03:57:23.120 --> 03:57:27.120]  The Libertarians are supposed to be pro-Second Amendment, pro-self-defense.
[03:57:27.120 --> 03:57:31.120]  And he said, oh, those weren't hunting rifles that I wanted to confiscate.
[03:57:31.120 --> 03:57:37.120]  Okay, but background checks and ammunition. Hillary Clinton says, I'm going to continue to speak out for comprehensive background checks,
[03:57:37.120 --> 03:57:43.120]  closing gun show loopholes, closing the online loophole, closing the so-called Charleston loophole.
[03:57:43.120 --> 03:57:49.120]  You know, these are not loopholes. The Constitution says, shall not infringe.
[03:57:49.120 --> 03:57:57.120]  That you don't take your fence and move it onto your neighbor's property by one foot and then leave it there.
[03:57:57.120 --> 03:58:01.120]  And then after a period of time say, that's mine now.
[03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:06.120]  That's what they're doing with your rights. They're gradually moving the boundaries.
[03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:11.120]  They're turning your fundamental rights into government-granted privileges.
[03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:14.120]  That's the way they always do it. That's what Hillary Clinton wants to do.
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:19.120]  That's what, unfortunately, even the Libertarians are supporting now in their ticket.
[03:58:19.120 --> 03:58:22.120]  Makes me just unbelievable to see what they're doing.
[03:58:22.120 --> 03:58:25.120]  Listen, join us tonight. We're out of time on this radio show tonight.
[03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:28.120]  We're going to talk about the billionaire bug out rockets.
[03:58:28.120 --> 03:58:31.120]  We're going to talk about Brexit. We're going to talk about Bilderberg.
[03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:45.120]  Join us then. 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
