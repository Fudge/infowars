[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Separating facts from fiction, piercing through globalist propaganda and the fog of their
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  deceptions.
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on this Monday, March 23, 2020, worldwide transmission.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  We are 224 days out from the election, which they're now openly saying may be suspended.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  We've got Robert Barnes who was on yesterday with a message to the president.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  The president responded to that in a tweet and so much more here today.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  This is America and the world in the globalist crosshairs, but we can defeat them.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  Here's an important report, a boot stomping on Liberty's face forever and we'll be back.
[00:55.000 --> 01:03.000]  The world is going into martial law and I want to quantify what martial law composed of,
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  the different types of it, around the different parts of the world, how it's implemented,
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  and where it tends to lead nations.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  The Democrats have followed the lead of the dictatorial EU and the communist Chinese
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  and their dictator and they have, by example, established martial law,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  welding them into their homes, making sure to show you the footage to scare you as much as possible.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  And then as soon as the West picked up the panic, China said, we're done, no more virus,
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  100% back to work, we were only shut down about a month or so.
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.000]  But in America, it's going to be 18 months, we're told, which will mean we will no longer exist.
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  The definition in Black's law dictionary is the proper definition under U.S. law for martial law,
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  martial law which is built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions,
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  is in truth and reality no law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a law.
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  The necessity of order and discipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  and therefore it ought not be permitted in time of peace when the king's courts are open
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  And the governor of New York, the tyrant, who said, if you're a Christian or a gun owner
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  or pro-life, get out of the state.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  He now has declared an emergency and told New Yorkers, don't leave your homes.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  Marion Webster, the law administered by military force that is invoked by a government in emergency
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  when the civilian law enforcement agencies are able to maintain public order and safety.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Wikipedia, the imposition of direct military control over normal civilian functions by government,
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster or in occupied territory.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  And it's the latter, we're being occupied by the crisis.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  We need to bend the curve in the state of California.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  And in order to do that, we need to recognize the reality.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  The fact is, the experience we're having on the ground throughout the state of California,
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  the experience it's manifesting all across the United States and for that matter,
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  around the rest of the world, require us to adjust our thinking and to adjust our activities.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  And notice they're telling you now, 18 months.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  It was two weeks in Europe, then it was a month.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  It was two weeks in China, then it was a month.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  But now we're told it's, oh, just 18 months.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  Now they're saying, no, no, no, that's not enough, maybe three years.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  And then checks will be given to you, even if you didn't want to be on welfare,
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  so that you can go by at the big box stores.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  And you've got to go out with your permission slip that you're going.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  You'll get from Walmart or Target.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  And then you'll drive in and the police will check you at a checkpoint.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  And then you'll go in wearing your mask and you'll get your food once a week when you're allowed out of your house.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  And you will go home or you will face six months in jail.
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  But criminals, armed robbers, rapists, they're all being let out of jail by the tens of thousands the day now.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  The homeless are exempt in New York and in California.
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  And the migrants and homeless in Europe, the Islamics, they're all exempt.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  Sweden's banned all air travel in and out of the country, except for Soros,
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  UN-funded aircraft that land multiple times daily from the Middle East and North Africa, bringing in military aged men.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  So the criminals can run around wild, the homeless can run around wild, the illegal aliens can run around wild.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  The borders can pretty much still be open and porous.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  But you are going to stay in your house, you dirty, stinking American.
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  And this is just out. Germany closes border to Europeans, but migrants still allowed in.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  That's been announced from France, Luxembourg and other countries.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  That's right, bring in the Islamists, but you can't leave your house.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  Our constitutions, our health, is our most valuable asset.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  It's what allows us to stay alive on this amazing planet that God's given us.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  And we've got to take care of our bodies, we've got to take care of ourselves.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.000]  And all the products at infowarstore.com have been researched deeply
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  and have been developed with some of the top experts in the country
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  to maximize what God's given us through Mother Nature to help our bodies
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  boost their defense against all the insane things that have been artificially introduced into our environment.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  So please visit infowarstore.com today during all this hysteria and realize
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  it's not toilet paper or flashlights that you really need.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  Sure, it's okay to have plenty of that, but it is high quality supplements and we've got the best.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  And during this crisis, I am discounting everything 40% at infowarstore.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  I can feel the magic.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  It's floating in the air.
[06:29.000 --> 06:30.000]  But it's fear.
[06:30.000 --> 06:47.000]  But it's fear. And you're here in calling you everywhere. Look out. There's no sight of the morning coming. There's no sign of the day.
[06:47.000 --> 06:58.000]  It's like all the 62 million aborted babies. 400 million in China.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  Rainbow in the dark getting hacked up by those surgeons. Nobody came to save them.
[07:05.000 --> 07:21.000]  Who had empathy for them? But now, less people died worldwide from coronavirus, the Chinese communist virus that died from the flu every year in the United States.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  Think about that.
[07:23.000 --> 07:34.000]  We have an extremely important plate here, but I just really want to take your calls.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  Robert Barnes was on last night and I said, what is your message to the president? And he issued one.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  And President Trump responded to Barnes a few hours later.
[07:47.000 --> 07:56.000]  So he is going to be on the broadcast coming up the middle of the next hour.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  But I want to go ahead and just give the number out now to take your calls.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  But I'm serious when I say this.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  And I'm really going to implement it today so we get to more people, but a little bit better, but not where I want to go.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  I'm going to give each person about a minute.
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  I love you to death. You love me if you hate me, call in too, but don't even say that.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  Just get to, in one minute, what you think about the virus or the topic or the issue.
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  You want to discuss in it with the crashing economy and the Democrats openly killing the funding package and celebrating it.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  And just the fact that this country is at war with the globalist and the tricombs.
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  I want to get your take, your first responder view. You're a teacher. You're a police officer.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  You're somebody in a factory that's been laid off. You're calling in from France.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  You're calling in from Spain. You're calling in from Japan. You're calling in from China.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  You're calling in from Brazil.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  I want to just get your minute and move the next person.
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  A little free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-ALIX or 877-789-2539.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  Or if you were calling international, have trouble calling 1-800-NUMBERS, some countries do.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  Some plans do.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Just the country code in 512-646-1776.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  512-646-1776 or 877-789-ALIX.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I'm going to your calls next segment.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  I'll play this later next hour when Barnes is on with us and we're taking your calls.
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.000]  But we can have a debate on whether or not we should add a trillion dollars they got announced last week as a spending package.
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  We direct payments to the American people and to workers with provisions that the big corporations couldn't do.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  Stock buybacks and give themselves money like General Motors did when Obama bailed it out when there was no need.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  We've gone past the Rubicon here, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  We passed the point over 10 years ago.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  There is a global race to devalue currencies.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  There is a worldwide program of devaluing them and it's going to happen.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  And so it's all about what currency is left standing at the end.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  I'm all for physical conservatism.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  That's all gone.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Now, when the trillion-dollar announcement didn't help, Trump announced four trillion.
[10:27.000 --> 10:35.000]  The Democrats looked at that and they know that would probably prop up the stock market and prop up the economy during this economic attack.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  And that's what this is.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  And they voted it down last night and this morning.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  They're just refusing.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  And the stock market, let's pull up CNBC, please.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Last time I checked, it was down 300 points.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  Let's just go to CNBC.com and we'll see where the Dow Jones industrial average is right now.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  So separate from debates about fiscal issues or is this right or is this wrong.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  The Democrats are everywhere saying they hope coronavirus tanks the economy.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  They hope it drives Trump from office.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that's the last few months.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  And now it's happening.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  It's down 840 points since I looked an hour ago.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  Isn't that wonderful for the globalists on the left?
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  Because they're all just going to buy it up at the end of this huge crash in this big freakout.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  And the more crooked elements of Wall Street are all in on this.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  So here's the headline.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  Democrat Senate, Republican, coronavirus stimulus plan that would send the cash to families.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Because we're going to have a bailout.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  Don't do trillions to foreign banks and, you know, all the Obama bailouts and then Bush would send an $800 check to people.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  Literally they was equivalent like 1% of what the people got to 99% of what the big banks got.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  Warren Buffett was the biggest recipient.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  He got $400 plus billion to his company.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  One company.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  And he lobbied for it.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  And then he talks about fiscal conservatism and how he wants to pay more taxes.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  What a sick joke.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  It's all a game.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates, all those guys are quote philanthropists.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  They put their money in the tax-free companies that operate with profits.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  It's a big club, as George Carlin said, and we ain't in it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  Senate Dems are to build a compel Donald Trump to invoke Defense Production Act.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  They want nationalization and the precedent to nationalize all the companies.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  So that once they remove him, they have full control.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  And boy, that's fascism when you've got the government running the companies.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  So the Democrats are pushing fascism.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Trump already has the private companies running it themselves.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  DeBlasio is on TV Friday, Saturday and Sunday saying Trump's not sending troops to New York.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  He's not sending medical supplies.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  All of it's a huge lie.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  The troops entered with huge medical convoys Friday.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  He's on the Sunday show with Chuck Todd saying he hasn't lifted a finger.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  No troops, no medicine.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's like saying I'm not wearing a Navy blue sports jacket.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  It'd be like DeBlasio's on TV going, I'm not wearing a Navy blue sports jacket.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  I'm not wearing a red tie.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  It's like him saying, I don't look like a pedophile.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  Well, yeah, you do.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  But the point is, is that he is wearing a blue sports jacket.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  He is wearing a red tie.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's lies so insane, so ridiculous that it's just the exercise of fraud in your face to destroy confidence.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  And that's why the press conferences and everywhere they're like, we're all dead.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  Everyone's panicking.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Right for the hells.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  We're all dead.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  You can argue all day how deadly is the virus.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  And it's great to protect yourself.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  I'm not against folks that are really concerned about it.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  Time will tell just how bad it is.
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  But the hysteria is being driven artificially.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  Now separately, the president, the very same Mother Jones outfit,
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  document cam shot, please a few weeks ago that said Jones is horrible.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  He says he has a cure for coronavirus.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  Never said that.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  About nano silver and its properties.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  Well, now the very same group of the very same riders at Mother Jones went after me.
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  They come out because their sorrows his mouth and says, Trump is giving medical advice.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  He shouldn't do that.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  And then now they've weighed in and they're saying he shouldn't say hydroxy.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  Hydroxy, chloroquine and ZPAC has been shown.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  The Europeans and the Chinese say absolutely to give you a 90 plus percent recovery rate
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  if you're even already sick.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  Now he's just stating what's known and they go, you're not allowed unless you're a doctor
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  to say that he's got all the doctors standing behind him nodding.
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  This is a cult of the left that the president can't even tell you things that are known
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  to help you and thank God.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  There's pretty much a cure.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  A major treatment that helps almost everybody.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  Not a hundred percent cure.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  The idea of that and then as soon as they paddle tailed, the media was all attacking him saying
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  there is no hope.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  You're all dead.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  By the way, what is hydroxy chloroquine do?
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  It injects and forces your body to push zinc into the cells.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  And if you've got enough zinc in you folks got to watch out to hurt your kidneys to consult
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  a patient at high levels, the viruses can't get in and replicate in the mitochondrial
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  engine.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And it also coats the cell.

[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  That's survivalcbank.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  It's been the globalists, the chai comms, and Democrats that they control that have been
[18:04.000 --> 18:12.000]  pushing for coronavirus hysteria and suspension of basic rights for the last eight weeks.
[18:12.000 --> 18:21.000]  And now Governor Newsom has come out publicly and said they're ready to declare martial law.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Well, that's a word game.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  When you tell 40 million people they can't leave their houses, period, and you scare
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  monger and say that almost 60% of the population will have it in just six weeks, you're engaged
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  in psychological warfare, and you've already declared martial law.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  About a seven on a one to ten Richter scale.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  Get ready, folks.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  The Democrats, just like the chai comms, are setting the bar for martial law.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  Full-on secret arrest, FEMA camps, you name it.
[18:54.000 --> 19:01.000]  But the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt.
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.000]  The globalists and the enemy of the people, corporate media, have worked overtime like
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  the devil to destroy all independent pro-America truth-based media.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  And chief amongst their enemy has been in full wars.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  But thanks to you spreading the word and thanks to you supporting in full wars, we are still
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  on the air and have actually expanded in the face of their tyranny.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  It is now more critical than ever that you take this opportunity to share Band-Aid video
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  and in full wars dot com and the articles and reports that are so critical because the
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  world is waking up and needs this information now more than ever.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  For yourself and the info wars crew, you have our undying pledge and commitment to fight
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  these tyrants harder than we ever have before and to defend basic freedom and justice in
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  the American way of life.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  This is the crossroads, America and the planet in the balance.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  Whatever you do, please take action and spread the word.
[19:55.000 --> 20:05.000]  God bless and good luck.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  To stop tyranny, well so does he.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  Live from the info wars dot com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  Well for me the biggest story is the democrats, the chai comms, the EU, the globalist big tech,
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  every new older operation saying this virus is the end of the world and then saying Trump's
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  not responding enough and then he tries to get four trillion dollars to actually order
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  companies to keep people employed and give them their paychecks going out at least three
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  thousand dollars on top of it and they say no.
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  I mean that's what the Bernie Sanders people, all of them want this.
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.000]  Separate from a debate about whether you want guaranteed income and all the rest of it.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  This is almost what AOC said where you get a couple thousand dollars a month even if you
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  don't want to work.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Remember that in a green plan?
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  Now Trump tried to turn the economy back on, did a great job.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  I get he's giving us adrenaline when we're going into a coma here.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  He's trying to wake us back up but you can debate whether that's a good thing or not
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  but what about them cheerleading the crisis, driving down the stock market, celebrating
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  that and then killing the aid package when they're the party that always wants to spend
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  all the money.
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  I say if we get the word out about that it permanently ends their party.
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.000]  It's bold to be on MSNBC CNN, HBO saying we want a depression, we want a recession,
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  oh we hope coronavirus hurts America, it's worth it.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  Oh we hope the president dies from coronavirus.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  I mean that's like a cartoon villain.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  I'll get you and your little dog too my pretty.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  Or the witch from Sleeping Beauty.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  She's like I'll get you and on your 16th birthday you'll prick your finger and die.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  I hope the economy goes down and everybody dies in the streets and there's a civil war.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  I hope the president dies.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all, keep the borders open but lock everyone in their houses.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  Oh we shouldn't treat the old people, there's too many of them, there's too many boomers.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  I hope they all die.
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  Pedophilia's good, Satanism's good, yeah we're Satanist.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  I mean they've just come out in the open.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  All the things I'm saying are real things they do.
[22:53.000 --> 22:58.000]  How dare the president say that there's a treatment for this that's almost 100% effective.
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.000]  How dare him talk about chloroquine, how dare him report what major institutions are saying.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  No, there's no hope my pretty.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  I mean this is getting ridiculous.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  I mean look at this, I see probably 50 articles a day without looking.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  There's everywhere where there were at least 1,000 prisoners here, 200 there, 700 here,
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  rapists, armed robbers but we catch you outside your house, you're going to prison.
[23:29.000 --> 23:36.000]  It's all Democrat cities.
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.000]  And then the latest article, Germany closes border to Europeans but migrants still allowed in
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  and I got stacks of these, this is the latest today.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  Germany has closed its border to visitors from Europe to the coronavirus but migrants claiming asylum
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  for the Middle East and Africa are still allowed to enter the country.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  Same thing with France, Sweden, Denmark, all of them.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  Aside from exemptions for people from France, Luxembourg, Switzerland who are providing
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  essential services, German authorities closed the country's border to all foreign citizens last week.
[24:07.000 --> 24:14.000]  However, according to the German Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Destroying Germany,
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  so-called a science seeker, is military age men.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  A catch-all term that basically describes economic migrants fleeing the Middle East and Africa,
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  are still welcome.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Welcome, my pretty, welcome.
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  At Germany's EU external border, airports and seaports, there has been no change in the asylum procedure.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  A representative of the Ministry of Interior told the media.
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  And it's the same everywhere.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  What a sick joke.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  We're four minutes to break.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  I'm going to take three calls, give the hair, lips, the admiral.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  So, and then we're going to come back and take even more.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Exxon, California, you're on the air.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  I just wanted to give everybody an update.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  I spoke to you on Saturday.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  I'm the one that, my dad goes to the dry cleaners and do the laundry for the sheriffs
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  and the police.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  And I was up at actually target this morning at 7am thinking there was going to be a line of people.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Just to get some, some paper goods and it was empty.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  The other thing is, is some of the stores aren't letting you get any cash back as of today.
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  I've noticed I tried to get cash back at a few retailers yesterday and they told me that yesterday would be the last day on that.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  The other thing is, is so far I don't see much difference.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  I don't see, I really see no police or sheriffs on the road.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  Highways are probably about 30%, 35% capacity, maybe 25%.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  I'd say the roads there are 10%.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  God bless you.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  You've got to jump one minute per person.
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  It fits all of you.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  There's a war on cash, a war on transportation, a war on your basic rights and liberties,
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  a war on the economy, a war on sovereignty, a medical tyranny forced inoculation.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  It covers and hits every base, creates hysteria, creates fear.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Shannon in Texas.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  You're on the air.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  Yeah, Alex, I was going to explain to you, I was going on a vacation to Hawaii last Monday.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  Made as far as LAX when my son was a little bit autistic, freaked out.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Everybody wearing a mask on the plane.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  So he had a complete meltdown.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  They had to take him off the plane on a, put him in a wheelchair.
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  None of the stewardesses, none of the pilots had any PPE on.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  None of the paramedics that came and checked out my son were wearing any PPE.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Nobody had worked in there.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  And by the way, they all have that stuff, but they all don't think it's a real threat.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  Right.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  And the other thing, Alex, I'd like to see a shirt.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Yeah, your phone's breaking up, brother.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  You'd like to see a shirt that says what?
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Gorka the orca.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Yeah, well, that guy's a failure.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  That guy's the biggest, you know, bloated primadonna the planet's ever seen.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  I mean, he's a joke.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  God bless you, Shannon.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Thank you.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  Go to New York.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  Go ahead, Baldy.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  Yeah, thank you, sir.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  So the history is going to record this as the April Fool's Day virus.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  And I'll be glad to explain, but first, after being behind the curve due to his misplaced
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  trust in the federal bureaucracies like the CDC, President Trump has already moved two
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  steps ahead of the deep state traders who are behind this outbreak.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  I started out calling this the Obama virus, not the Chinese virus, because the last time
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  I checked, the University of North Carolina is not located in China.
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  And it was Obama holdovers in the CDC who stand back to president.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  It was the CDC who wouldn't test.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  It was the CDC who then sent out failed tests so that now.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  And the CDC that shipped in thousands, they thought a coronavirus has spread it.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  Exactly.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  I could go on and on.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  But now I agree with you.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  If it turns out to not kill a lot of people, it's the April Fool's virus.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  Well, guess what?
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  The president is, again, two steps ahead.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  He put out the 15-day way to curve this.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Guess when the 15-day curve is over?
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  April Fool's Day.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  April Fool's Day.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  That's right, sir.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  And if you don't mind, I would love to go on if I could catch back up where I left off here.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Listen, listen, here's the rule.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  Baldi, we wouldn't have gotten you for 20 minutes at my normal rate.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  We got to you in like three minutes, brother.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Okay, okay.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Gotta go.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Call me back.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  It's a new system.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  We're gonna take a call each segment.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  And they get like five minutes today.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  Each person gets 60 seconds.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  60 seconds.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  What a powerful call, though, Baldi.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  Please call back again.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  Mike, Jerome, Jason, Billy, Collin, Big Mike, headhunter, Joe, Mark, Sean.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  You're all on the other side of this break.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker,
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.000]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[29:55.000 --> 30:00.000]  The talking points are all the same.
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  Everything is choreographed by the western media
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  and every authoritarian regime on the planet that lusts ever power and control.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  Their globalist system has been challenged.
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  Humanity has awoken to them.
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  And so they use the man-made virus to create scenes
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  out of a science fiction dystopian novel to scare the population into submission.
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.000]  And then they launch their global corporate strike
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  against the western world and against the average person
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  and the average saver, the average homeowner, the average small business owner.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  That's why the big megacorporations are exempt and they all get to stay open.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  The mom and pops all have to close according to them.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's a corporate strike against we the people.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  It's a corporate strike.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  The Wuhan virus and the whole operation is a globalist corporate strike
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  against the nation-stated individuals.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about,
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it,
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  it takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.000]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth or your throat and lungs are really thin.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  Not our lung cleanse.
[31:21.000 --> 31:27.000]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale,
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  and it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  It's just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family
[31:42.000 --> 31:46.000]  to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  Get your lung cleanse discounted at infowarstore.com
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  and get yourself and your family prepared while at the same time funding the Info War,
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  a total 360 win, infowarstore.com.
[31:58.000 --> 32:03.000]  I made four police state films more than a decade ago,
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  specifically warning of the plan to suspend habeas corpus,
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  the right to even have access to a court,
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  the right to not be secretly arrested and secretly disappeared.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  And I warned the Patriot Act they claimed was for terrorists,
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  was really for the American people.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  Well, now they admit it is.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  And bipartisanly, the Justice Department is now openly seeking to arrest
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  and disappear Americans whenever they want under the guise of coronavirus,
[32:31.000 --> 32:36.000]  but they just say during the emergency it'll be for every other crime you can imagine.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  It's the cherry on top of a nice big fudge sundae called Marshall Law.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  Oh, and the sprinkles on it, it's the big, great depression everybody's going to have.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  So folks that are all excited that you're getting time off work,
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  oh, you're going to get time off from your whole future, your family,
[32:52.000 --> 33:16.000]  your health and forced inoculations and gun confiscation.
[33:16.000 --> 33:22.000]  You've been doing great, Owen. You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  And of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour calls.
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.000]  Cruz volunteered to do it.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  So we're here live covering this, hoping everything deescalates.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  So the live coverage continues.
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  Everybody spread those links.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  The Globals are hacking us trying to shut this down.
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  Don't let them win.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  No BS.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Everything straight shooting here.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  See, I don't have some Mackey Valley manipulative view with me.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  It's all straightforward attack.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  That's the real power.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  Come on.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  Come on.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  Come on.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  We'll probably fact check this.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  This is fake news.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  We're attempting to deceive you right now.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  Yes, they now fact check comedy and memes.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  We did not attack clandestine.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  Trump is not a sergeant in the space corps.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  And he did not kill the bug with zinc.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Yeah, do not take zinc.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  There is no hope.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  There is no hope.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  There is no hope.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  Orange man mad.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  Again, for radio listeners,
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  this was a meme of Trump as a joke.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  It starts with cribbers.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  It's posted on info wars.com.
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  We'd like to see it.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  It comes from China.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  That's what it is.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  Golf arbitrary.
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  Medic.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  Nice moves.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  Gotta have some fun.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  By the way, Facebook has banned that.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  Calling it deceptive.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's right.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  Anything funny or interesting is spam or deceptive or fake news.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  They call memes now fake.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  They even fact check comics now.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  This is the joke of these control freaks.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Rachel Maddow, I played it last night.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  I'm not gonna play it again.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  She said the president should not be engaged in medical talk.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  He's not a doctor.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  And no one should cover his press conferences
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  because he's scaring everyone.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  No, it's you scaring everyone.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  Chloroquine is a 70-year-old drug
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  that pushes zinc into the cells.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  Just type in zinc and coronavirus.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  You'll get major studies on the whole family.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  They'll say, well, what has it been studied on?
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  This virus.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  Whatever.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  All viruses.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  Zinc is incredible for what it does to the body.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  And it's anti-cancer properties
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  and it's antiviral properties.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  And that's like saying the sky is blue.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  And people attack the president over this
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  and it totally and completely blew up in their face.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  He said, hydroxychlorine and Z-Pak
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  taken together have a real chance
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  to be one of the biggest game changers in history of medicine.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  The FDA has moved mountains.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  They're attacking him.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  Thank you.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  Hopefully they will both work together.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  And he goes from the International Journal
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  of Antimicrobial Agents, he links to a study
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  because they're attacking him.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  And the left responded,
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  you can take too much of the drug and die.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  And all these doctors came out and said, yeah,
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  you can take two milligrams of caffeine
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  and it'll kill you.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  Or nicotine or, I mean, it's just crazy.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Drug tied up by Trump for possible virus
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  kills with two grams.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  All these medical doctors came out and said,
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  yeah, Donald Trump Jr. said, what's your point?
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Two grams of caffeine can kill you too.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  But no one is planning on prescribing that much.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  This BS, as everyone hates it and doesn't trust the media,
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  they're trying to create fear for clicks
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  with misleading or all that info.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  You people truly suck.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  Here's medical doctors countering David Rothschild
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  and all the rest of it.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  So it's just over the top how these people operate
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  and what they do.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  They don't want you to know that there are things out there
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  that massively, massively mitigate this virus,
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  even if it's really bad news.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  But you've got to have the zinc in your body
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  at the studies I've seen or three times
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  recommend a daily allowance before you come in contact
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  with it or other viruses.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  I mean, just type in zinc colon cancer.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Type in zinc lung cancer.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  You'll get so many mainline top prestigious studies
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  that'll make your head spin.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  On the Sunday show I covered somebody
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  at a 30-hour special Saturday show,
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  probably spent 30 minutes of the three hours
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  just showing you studies and showing you where it says it.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  And they've got nebulizers.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  They use these fancy clinics in Europe
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  where they put this special type of zinc into the lungs.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  And it's incredible with people that are already sick
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  what it does.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  But instead, they want you to get really sick
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  and be on live support.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Oh, we need more ventilators
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  because you're going to be in a coma.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  And there it is, association between serum, zinc levels
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  and lung cancer, a meta-analysis of observational studies.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  Look at that.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  World Journal of Oncology.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Literally, when I say hundreds, it's thousands of studies.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  The zinc is unbelievable.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  But long-term taking high dosages of it
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  will eat your kidneys alive.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  So there's always a trade-off with anything.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  With a drug, with a vaccine, with a mineral, with a vitamin.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  I mean, there's a Dr. Wolfe tweeted back at the media
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  attacking Trump for saying, you know, zinc.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  And he said, yeah, too much water will kill you.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  Yeah, there's been cases where people run along marathon,
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  drink too much water, don't have enough minerals, and dead.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  In fact, some of the highest instances of heart attacks
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  are marathon runners.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  And it's not that their heart couldn't pump the blood.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  Their hearts were in incredible shape.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  They were out of minerals.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  And when you run out of minerals, bye-bye, bye-bye.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  And most disease is from lack of minerals and vitamins.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  Or the stomach stops absorbing them.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  That's the problem with old people is they stop absorbing it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  And then a recommended daily allowance isn't enough anymore.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  In the next segment, I've got Mitch McConnell's.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Well, I kind of went through that whole segment,
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  ranting and playing those.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  Let's have a little fun here during all this attempt
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  to make us scared and frightened and depressed,
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  which can lower your immune system in every major study.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  Let's look at it.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Let's play a fun little clip here.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  It's again for TV viewers.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  I'll tell radio listeners the whole point.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  We forget the mainly radio audience.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  It shows a guy going, there's no food in the grocery store.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  So one hour in the parking lot.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  And all of a sudden, this guy gave me this, this, and this.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  And then he holds up a gun.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  You realize he's robbed them.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  There's another one we're not going to play,
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  because it's got not really cuss words in it,
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  but it's not family-friendly.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  And I'm sure you've all seen it where the guys went out there
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  in the barn.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  This crack or came up the highway and she offered me some oral
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  sex and a donut if I'd give her toilet paper.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And then after that, she went over to my neighbor's house over
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  there and he lifts his hand up.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  He's got to have even donut in his hand.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  But here's the, here's the video on the man with the gun.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  Here it is.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  Well, I got to tell you, I went to the store to pick up a couple
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  items and once again, everything's gone because of these
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  damn hoarders.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  So I'm walking back to the car.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  I see this guy with his cart full of stuff.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  So I walked over to him and I asked him politely.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  I said, hey, do you mind sharing some of this stuff?
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  And look at all this gave to me.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  He gave me angel soft.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  He gave me Cheerios, milk, macaroni and cheese, bacon.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  You know, we apologize for that fake news.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  Again, the media will say we put out fake news.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's called a joke and they know that, but they want control
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  of all information because people aren't tuning into them
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  and people don't believe them.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  Democrats kill coronavirus rescue plan according to their
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  own admissions, accelerating U.S.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  economic death spiral.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  Democrats holding COVID-19 bill hostage over unrelated
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  demands.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Those articles are on m4s.com.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  They are incredible.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  When we come back, Mitch McConnell and some of what he had
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  to say about the situation and then I will take five of your
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  phone calls next segment and we will continue into the next
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  hour.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  Robert Barnes will join us at the bottom of the hour.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  He was on the show and I said, what's your message to
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  President Trump?
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  And boom, President Trump then tweeted Barnes when Barnes
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  tweeted out that information in some of the videos.
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  So he is joining us coming up with his amazing analysis of
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  the situation.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yes, a depression is far worse than the coronavirus.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Even it kills 200,000 people.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  But you're seeing real live hysteria.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  It is the hysteria of 2020.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  The great hysteria.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  supply chain has collapsed.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  It is a system-wide problem.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  And this country is facing a new depression unless Trump and
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  the American people work together to develop a plan to
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  expose this globalist operation.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  That said, people are calling and saying we wish you had the
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  supplements in stock.
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  We wish that wasn't sold out.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  They've confused that with the food.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  Everything we advertise, everything we sell, we have in
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  stock and we are only one day behind in shipping.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  That means if you order on a Monday, it's shipping out on
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  a Wednesday.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  And that's just as of today.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  Most days we are up to the day shipping, meaning you order
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  that day in the morning.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  A lot of times it ships out that afternoon.
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  We have everything in stock that is so good to boost your
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  overall defense against what's going on.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  The noose is tightening around America's neck.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  The supply chains have been cut off.
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  We are under globalist attack.
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  And President Trump understands this.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  I'm here to tell listeners now is the time to spread the word
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  while we're still on air.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  And infowars.com forward slash show and band on video.
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  And on local radio stations and TV stations, your area.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  And now is the time for modern Paul Revere's to also protect
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  themselves and their families by getting high quality
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.000]  nutraceutical products that boost your overall defense of your health.
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  Like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  We also have DNA force plus backing stock.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  We also have X2 and X3 that are so important and powerful.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  Research it for yourself and a lot of other great products that
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  in the future we may not be able to get from the suppliers.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  But we do have them in stock right now.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  Check out infowars.com and get ready and from the info war at the same time.
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  Good luck and God bless you all.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  The globalist and the enemy of the people corporate media have worked
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  overtime like the devil to destroy all independent pro America
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  truth-based media.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  Chief amongst their enemy has been info wars.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  But thanks to you spreading the word and thanks to you supporting info wars
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  we are still on the air and have actually expanded in the face of their tyranny.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  It is now more critical than ever that you take this opportunity to share
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  band.video and infowars.com and the articles and reports that are so critical
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  because the world is waking up and needs this information now more than ever.
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  For myself and the info wars crew you have our undying pledge and commitment
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  to fight these tyrants harder than we ever have before and to defend basic freedom
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  and justice in the American way of life.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  This is the crossroads America and the planet in the balance.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Whatever you do please take action and spread the word.
[45:55.000 --> 46:23.000]  God bless and good luck.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000] .
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  Many of them are about to sell out in the next few days to the next few weeks.
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.000]  Others are running out in the next month and we are not sure if we will ever
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  be able to get them again in the foreseeable future.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  That is how crazy all of this is.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.360]  So stock up on the supplements that you and your family need and fund the M4. Take action now
[47:00.720 --> 47:03.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:03.560 --> 47:05.560]  Oh
[47:20.280 --> 47:28.960]  It's a frontline report info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.920]  I'm Alex Jones your host here. All right. I want to go to your phone calls, but again
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.680]  The over-the-topness of the Democrats as they know the whole country in the world's turned against them as they know
[47:41.680 --> 47:47.620]  They only control the cities they control through election fraud as they know that their whole corrupt house of cards comes down
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.280]  They are going to just
[47:50.280 --> 47:52.280]  Fight like the devil in their corner
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.080]  And they're openly trying to crash the US economy. They're celebrating it
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.600]  I want to go to your calls. I'm not going to play the compilation. We played last week of the it's four minutes long of
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.120]  Seven or eight different national figures saying we hope this plunges the economy
[48:08.800 --> 48:12.440]  We hope there's a mass of depression. We hope coronavirus is really bad
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.820]  While they simultaneously say it's all Trump's fault. He's not doing a good job
[48:17.840 --> 48:24.720]  He hasn't lived to the finger governor Cuomo and the mayor of New York de Blasio have all said that I played it last night on
[48:25.480 --> 48:27.520]  the Sunday show
[48:27.520 --> 48:29.520]  outrageous
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.480]  The army entered thousands of troops with the huge convoys of
[48:35.320 --> 48:38.920]  medicine and commandeered government buildings and hotels and
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.640]  Had thousands of respirators reportedly all and they're just like he's not lifted a finger
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.120]  That's an outrageous lie, and I know we all know they lie, but man
[48:51.120 --> 48:56.080]  It's like saying Central Park is not in the middle of Manhattan
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.280]  Well, yeah, it is and you should be discredited when you make statements like that
[49:02.600 --> 49:05.920]  The nickname of New York is not the big Apple
[49:06.360 --> 49:09.320]  Well, that's another lie. These lies are beyond
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.760]  Whopper they're Godzilla sized and
[49:13.480 --> 49:18.320]  It's just gonna get worse because they want to kill confidence because they know low information people
[49:18.320 --> 49:24.440]  Hear that and they get scared the president's like hey, it's gonna be a problem. We're gonna handle it
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.040]  We've got medicines that treat it really well. No, you don't know you don't people are scared. What do you say to them?
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.040]  I mean, that's what's happening
[49:31.640 --> 49:34.440]  And of course there's the videos that people see tanks being moved
[49:38.160 --> 49:40.160]  Down to the port there in Houston
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.320]  Folks if there's martial law, they're not gonna use Abrams battle tanks for hood
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.680]  It's where they move the tanks to ships and move them out and the US is moving a lot of weapons to Europe
[49:48.680 --> 49:50.680]  And those are painted up for Europe, you notice
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.680]  There are some Bradley fighting vehicles
[49:52.680 --> 49:57.600]  They might use those but they use armored vehicles with wheels on streets tanks tear the streets up
[49:57.840 --> 50:00.480]  So no, they're not gonna need to have heavy armor
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.040]  If there was martial law, so there's always tanks getting moved around
[50:07.080 --> 50:09.080]  But the Democrats want martial law
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.480]  There's martial law. You've seen our armored vehicle. That's what you'll see you see a bunch of those
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.080]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls right after I play a few minutes the full videos up on info wars comms like nine minutes long
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.480]  But the first few minutes here's the leader of the Senate talking about what the Democrats just did holding America hostage
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  so that we can keep moving forward
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.520]  Because this virus is not gonna wait
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.200]  For politics as usual
[50:33.200 --> 50:40.840]  These past few days have brought unity and bipartisan energy here to the Senate. I think members on both sides agree
[50:41.840 --> 50:43.840]  It's been very encouraging
[50:44.840 --> 50:50.280]  Since Senate Republicans released our initial framework to give some structure to these discussions
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.880]  Both sides have worked hard to create something that can pass the Senate
[50:55.640 --> 50:57.640]  pass the House and
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.680]  Be signed into law by the president
[50:59.680 --> 51:06.600]  The bipartisan product delivers strongly on each of the core priorities. We identified at the outset
[51:07.600 --> 51:12.360]  It puts urgently needed cash in the hands of American workers and families
[51:13.400 --> 51:21.080]  It delivers historic and rapid relief to small businesses so they can make payroll and keep people employed
[51:23.080 --> 51:25.080]  It helps stabilize key industries
[51:25.080 --> 51:31.080]  To avoid layoffs wherever possible and preserve the greatest economy in the world for when we come out
[51:31.680 --> 51:33.680]  on the other side of this and
[51:34.280 --> 51:37.280]  Of course, it sends a massive
[51:37.880 --> 51:42.080]  massive new infusion of resources to the front line of
[51:43.480 --> 51:45.480]  The medical response
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.880]  That is what we have to do, Mr. President
[51:48.880 --> 51:56.480]  Inject a significant amount of money as quickly as possible into households small businesses
[51:57.080 --> 51:59.080]  key sectors and
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.280]  our nation's hospitals and health centers
[52:03.880 --> 52:07.080]  This bill would do that and it would do it fast
[52:08.880 --> 52:16.880]  The compromise product also contains many ideas that our Democratic colleagues brought to the Senate
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.880]  That our Democratic colleagues brought to the table
[52:20.880 --> 52:24.880]  It balances the administration's focus on sending direct cash to Americans
[52:26.880 --> 52:32.880]  It balances the administration's focus on sending direct cash to Americans as quickly as possible
[52:33.880 --> 52:37.880]  With our Democratic colleagues focus on bolstering state unemployment insurance programs
[52:39.880 --> 52:45.880]  It places conditions which our Democratic colleagues have sought on the loans that would flow to major businesses
[52:45.880 --> 52:50.880]  All right, so this was this was earlier Sunday. There's another newer clip we'll get to as well
[52:50.880 --> 52:55.880]  He's being very reasonable and nice. They they killed it later and then he goes through how it's bipartisan
[52:55.880 --> 53:01.880]  But then Schumer decided not not to do it and here's the deal once you get you in a bubble
[53:02.880 --> 53:04.880]  And once they over print money and issue too much debt
[53:06.880 --> 53:10.880]  Then you have to have more and more money to the people or the economy seizes up
[53:10.880 --> 53:15.880]  So we're already into this phase that leads in a year to five years to
[53:16.880 --> 53:22.880]  What you've seen happen in Mexico. It's more of a Mexican model where the currency is devalued, you know 10 times its value
[53:23.880 --> 53:32.880]  Not a thousand times or 10,000 times like Weimar Germany in the 20s and 30s or Zimbabwe where it's millions of times devalued
[53:32.880 --> 53:36.880]  But still very serious and we're just already down that road
[53:36.880 --> 53:41.880]  We have the depression right now or we can have it later
[53:43.880 --> 53:47.880]  The point is the Democrats wanted now to get rid of Trump and then really cause a riot in this nation
[53:47.880 --> 53:50.880]  Let's go to your phone calls who's been holding longest here
[53:51.880 --> 53:52.880]  That would be
[53:59.880 --> 54:01.880]  Colin in Arizona Colin in Arizona you're on the air
[54:04.880 --> 54:05.880]  Hey
[54:05.880 --> 54:06.880]  Welcome sir
[54:07.880 --> 54:10.880]  Hey, so I'm not gonna buy into this liberal hysteria
[54:11.880 --> 54:14.880]  Just you see the hype everywhere you go
[54:14.880 --> 54:22.880]  But communities are coming together like I haven't seen in my lifetime being 27 years old you walk in somewhere and
[54:22.880 --> 54:25.880]  People kind of stray away from each other this and that
[54:25.880 --> 54:27.880]  Your friends are gonna find out who your real friends are
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.880]  We're gonna go against these globalists
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.880]  We're gonna beat them cause Donald Trump doesn't lose
[54:32.880 --> 54:34.880]  He's not gonna lose
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.880]  He doesn't go to war to lose
[54:40.880 --> 54:42.880]  God bless you sir. I appreciate your call
[54:42.880 --> 54:45.880]  This is all meant to train you to be a slave right about that
[54:45.880 --> 54:49.880]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California Mike you're on the air. Thanks for calling
[54:51.880 --> 54:52.880]  Do you hear me?
[54:52.880 --> 54:53.880]  Yes sir
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.880]  Oh great so I appreciate you taking my call and now I kind of want to speak directly to the president
[54:59.880 --> 55:05.880]  And that is this is how he can take this crisis and put the good use
[55:05.880 --> 55:08.880]  Number one push for smaller government
[55:09.880 --> 55:13.880]  Number two get out the UN do not give them another cent
[55:13.880 --> 55:19.880]  Because we're actually funding the bureaucracy with all the money that we're putting into the UN
[55:19.880 --> 55:21.880]  They're not our friends
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.880]  And then probably the final thing would be to tighten the border up
[55:26.880 --> 55:31.880]  I mean it's ridiculous what's going on here in California. It's really sad
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.880]  It's still pretty much wide open just like Europe says people from the Middle East just come in
[55:36.880 --> 55:38.880]  Uncontrolled as Erdogan attacks with millions
[55:38.880 --> 55:41.880]  But citizens can't leave their houses Mike
[55:41.880 --> 55:50.880]  Yeah it's a serious problem I mean I don't know what the legality of securing our border requires
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.880]  But it's just it's a shame seeing my state go to hell man
[55:55.880 --> 55:58.880]  It certainly is brother we'll just get the word out that's the real power you've got
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.880]  Just share the links to infowars.com for the last show that's how we're waking people up believing the audience has tripled
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.880]  In just the last month so you guys are doing a great job God bless you Mike
[56:06.880 --> 56:11.880]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota the virus elite plan launched too early
[56:11.880 --> 56:15.880]  I'm intrigued by that Mark tell me more
[56:15.880 --> 56:22.880]  Well Alex I believe they've had this pandemic worldwide pandemic and plans for a long time
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.880]  But I think since they've been losing the globalists have been losing all over the world
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.880]  They launched it way ahead of schedule and I believe that it's going to wake up more people
[56:32.880 --> 56:34.880]  And they're going to lose on this one to also
[56:34.880 --> 56:38.880]  That's my gut that's my overall analysis I totally concur with you
[56:38.880 --> 56:41.880]  There's thousands of points that go into that but I totally agree that's what's happened
[56:41.880 --> 56:44.880]  They've always been pre-programming getting ready for it in the future
[56:44.880 --> 56:48.880]  But they launched it early because they're behind schedule go ahead
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.880]  And I think we need to ask more questions about these tests
[56:53.880 --> 56:57.880]  And get out the corrupt history of the CDC to people
[56:57.880 --> 57:03.880]  And I don't know if this was ever mentioned in the Bilderberg group
[57:03.880 --> 57:08.880]  But I don't know if they mentioned it last year a pandemic or not
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.880]  Oh yeah they did the Debo's group said five years ago and again a couple years ago
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.880]  They'll use a pandemic for world government and that's why world government will be accepted will be a pandemic
[57:17.880 --> 57:21.880]  Because that's their answer also economic collapses and migrant flows
[57:21.880 --> 57:24.880]  Which they themselves direct as a weapon system
[57:24.880 --> 57:28.880]  One more thing I want to mention about fentanyl that China's been sending over here
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.880]  I mean they've not also got it on street drugs and killing people
[57:32.880 --> 57:39.880]  They're actually using this in the hospitals and they actually killed one of my good friends with a fentanyl dose in a hospital
[57:39.880 --> 57:43.880]  So it's out of control we'll be right back God bless you hour number two straight ahead
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.880]  It was like a bad dream seven weeks ago
[57:49.880 --> 57:53.880]  The ghost cities in China that then spread to Europe
[57:53.880 --> 57:59.880]  And now San Francisco is a ghost city and we see fights and brawls taking place over toilet paper
[57:59.880 --> 58:05.880]  People don't need toilet paper to survive but people do need high quality water filtration
[58:05.880 --> 58:10.880]  And they need high quality supplementation by products like DNA Force Plus
[58:10.880 --> 58:15.880]  X2 and X3 bodies ultimate turmeric formula
[58:15.880 --> 58:23.880]  And of course our high quality silver gargle products and super silver toothpaste that has the nano silver tea tree oil
[58:23.880 --> 58:26.880]  And of course iodine as well
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.880]  There are so many other amazing products at infowarstore.com ready to ship

[58:47.880 --> 58:50.880]  The noose is tightening incrementally
[58:50.880 --> 58:56.880]  America is being put into hardcore martial law
[58:56.880 --> 59:01.880]  The globalists have already economically closed the noose around our neck
[59:01.880 --> 59:06.880]  And they're now saying it's not going to be two weeks or a month or three months but 18 months
[59:06.880 --> 59:10.880]  Bringing us into the greatest oppression that planet's ever seen
[59:10.880 --> 59:14.880]  China says everything's fine now and they're back to business
[59:14.880 --> 59:18.880]  They launched their hysteria, they triggered the insanity
[59:18.880 --> 59:22.880]  America took the bait and now we're going down
[59:22.880 --> 59:26.880]  Unless humanity awakens and understands the virus is man-made
[59:26.880 --> 59:31.880]  And understands that these restrictions overall are not being used to protect us from the virus
[59:31.880 --> 59:38.880]  But are being used to set the precedent for a giant controlled system and permanent martial law
[59:38.880 --> 59:43.880]  That will be used to overthrow Trump and bring in pure globalist tyranny
[59:43.880 --> 1:00:04.880]  This is the battle for the republic happening now
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:18.880]  But we're going to win
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:22.880]  This is the death rows of the globalists and the chikoms
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  As we route them out of all the universities as every day more professors
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:30.880]  Are arrested for being Chinese agents
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:33.880]  And charged with espionage
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.880]  We're rolling them up
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.880]  And Devin Nunes is not what these guys are saying
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:40.880]  We're going to get the Democrats in two weeks
[1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:44.880]  He's been on Fox News this weekend
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.880]  And he said within 76 days
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.880]  1776
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:56.880]  Hillary Clinton will be indicted
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  Very, very interesting
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:03.880]  Yes, things are on the move
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  And this is how modern wars are fought
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:11.880]  Billy in Georgia, the next coming depression due to virus
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.880]  Well, they're certainly hoping that's the case, trying to block the aid package
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:16.880]  What do you think?
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:21.880]  I think what everybody's forgetting is we got out of the first depression by industrialization
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:23.880]  Factories and farms
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:25.880]  We don't have that anymore
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:28.880]  So when this depression hits, I think it's going to be a permanent one
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:33.880]  And when that happens, like you said, the value of the currency will drop
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.880]  How are the elite going to pay their bodyguards and their soldiers and the cops that protect them?
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:39.880]  They're not, they're going to run to New Zealand
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:41.880]  That's their main escape route
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  Well, at that point, then we all just mobilize and start a new government and rebuild society ourselves
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:47.880]  That's what we have to do
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:51.880]  Well, that's what splokas do, is they come feed on you, eat things to bone and leave
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.880]  And as long as we have morality, we can always rebuild overnight
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  Just like the Russians have done
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:59.880]  By kicking out the Soviet communist, globalist, leftist New York poison
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:03.880]  That took them over in 1917, 1918, and rebuilding
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:04.880]  That's why they're the big globalist enemy now
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:08.880]  And Hollywood hates them so much because they had them down for so long, 80 years
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:09.880]  And now they don't
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:12.880]  But yes, it's the morality that builds civilization
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  Not the fiat banker, filthy, ass-wipe money
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:17.880]  Excuse my French, but that's what it is
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:22.880]  And they hope to use the depression to get full control and make us bow to them
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  I believe it's going to boomerang back against them all
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:27.880]  But it's going to be explosive
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:29.880]  Well, thanks again and keep up to good work
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:31.880]  Billy, I cut in 30 seconds into your time
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:33.880]  Yeah, finish up
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:35.880]  Well, I mean, that was my whole point
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:39.880]  Is that I don't think that this is going to go the way they expect it to go
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:43.880]  You know, they're going to lose control once this depression hits
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:44.880]  And it goes into a total crash
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:48.880]  It's not going to end up being a global government like they want
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:50.880]  Well, that's exactly what happened
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:53.880]  Trump's as smart as we are, smarter probably
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:56.880]  And he knew they launched it, he knew they were going to demonize him
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:59.880]  He knew that they were going to blame him for it
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:02.880]  And so then he shifted right at the right moment
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:05.880]  Put it on the governors and the Democrats to let them lead
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:08.880]  And then he's going to let them run around and try to cause the depression
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:10.880]  And then I think he'll come in at the last minute
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:13.880]  And be able to defeat them and stop the depression
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:16.880]  But even if he can't, it's hung around there next forever
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.880]  Well, keep up the good work
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  And I'm a longtime fan and I buy plenty of your products
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:24.880]  Brother, you kept us on air in defiance of these jerks
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:27.880]  And believe me, we got a lot of stuff going on beneath the surface
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:32.880]  In the fight, so your money's well spent and God bless you
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  Thank you, Billy
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.880]  Let's talk to Big Mike in New Jersey
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:38.880]  Go ahead, Big Mike
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  Alex, how's it going?
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  Thanks for taking a call, one-time listener
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.880]  Yes, sir, Big Mike
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:45.880]  Yeah, I just want to get your take on the latest comments
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  But Governor, out here in New Jersey...
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:49.880]  I saw him, he said, don't leave your house, we'll arrest your ass
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:52.880]  Yeah, he said he's getting ready to tighten the screws
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:54.880]  And that no action is too aggressive
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:57.880]  So I just want to get your take on it, how worried should we be here
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  And is this the first step towards a full lockdown?
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:01.880]  Well, it's funny you say that
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.880]  The next thing I was getting to is over in this stack right here
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:08.880]  During the break, I was fumbling around with it
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  And that's the misconceptions about what can be open, what can't
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  Is it constitutional, isn't it?
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.880]  And I'm going to briefly speak to that
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.880]  I've actually got your Governor's...
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:20.880]  Governor Murphy Vow's action to enforce New Jersey stay-at-home order
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:23.880]  And I've got just authoritarian sounding statements
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.880]  So I'm glad you brought that up, Big Mike
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:27.880]  In 30 seconds, what do you think?
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:29.880]  Well, I can tell you that we're...
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  The residents here in New Jersey, I know it's got the connotation of being a liberal state
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  But all the gun stores are empty, everybody's panicking
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:38.880]  And everybody's getting ready for a full lockdown
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.880]  Brother, everybody knows once Democrats take over, they know it's all election fraud
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  They only have token Republicans
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:46.880]  It's not, you're not patriots, we know you got seized by the Crooks
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  Yep, exactly
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:50.880]  Do you think the Democrats are really taking Texas over?
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  No
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:52.880]  God bless you, brother
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:05:18.880]  Well, they're right back
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:27.880]  Zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:33.880]  And that is the most anti-viral natural compound out there
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:35.880]  In thousands and thousands of studies
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:38.880]  By the most prestigious universities
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.880]  Including big studies on the coronavirus family
[1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:44.880]  So, do yourself a favor
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:48.880]  Search engine, zinc and antiviral
[1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:51.880]  Three words, zinc, antiviral
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:54.880]  Do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral
[1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:16.880]  Better make the friend a death
[1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:27.560]  you're going to meet it the angel of death is sent by the Lord and each of us will one
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:36.600]  day face God and account for the sum of our actions on this planet and never forget God
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:51.280]  hates cowards the globalist fear missiles that he can on destruction are already striking
[1:06:51.280 --> 1:07:02.440]  and more coming in but we're shooting them down we got motorhead bringing us in all right
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:06.120]  let me hit this I'm going to your calls and Robert Barnes was on the show last night I
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:09.960]  said why don't you give a message to the president I said I know the White House has
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:14.280]  like four people that are tasked to watch the show bring the president we calls the
[1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:22.240]  clips and notes and Barnes is on the Republican Party as well but the president responded
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:27.200]  to it last night and responded to his tweet so we're going to play a clip of what Barnes
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:31.520]  said last night and we got Barnes coming back on and then we'll continue with calls
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:34.280]  throughout the transmission but let me get this if you just joined us we had a caller
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:39.920]  a big mic in New Jersey and he said have you seen what our governor said that no measure
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:43.560]  is too strong and don't leave your house and if you don't have a place to go an absolute
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:47.520]  reason we're going to lock your ass up but if you're a rapist or you know criminal we're
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:52.280]  going to let you out I'm not going to bore you playing the clip I mean it's it's our
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:57.480]  piss you off I should say but I could sit here for 10 hours and read you California
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:02.680]  declaration New York declaration New Jersey declaration Texas declaration Austin declaration
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:11.080]  Houston declaration Dallas declaration but I get it most people aren't like a news person
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:14.800]  or a lawyer they don't actually go look at it and I love my crew they're awesome but
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:17.800]  even they last week are like really we're allowed to stay open if they do that awesome
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:23.400]  I go yeah critical infrastructures media you can't be North Korean shut that down and we
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:26.880]  have a warehouse with food distribution and all that and a whole bunch of food items we
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:32.640]  sell that's in the code we got satellite up links I mean we just we got it all we got
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:38.320]  we got four of like the 15 exemptions but I don't even want that exemption I heard they
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:45.440]  closed Academy in Dallas because they didn't sell food they sell cook stoves and binoculars
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.360]  and clothing and survival gear and and all sorts of stuff you need I was planning actually
[1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:58.320]  go to Academy this week it's still open in Austin that's a great store but but the point
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.920]  is is that the city said it can't stay open man that's BS and a lot of companies like
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:07.800]  well we're allowed we'll make more money I don't like that I don't like that I don't
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:11.720]  like getting ahead at the expense of other people's free market because I'm not a fascist
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:20.160]  or a communist it's sick you know I'm smart we had a stockpile of zinc because zinc's an
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.320]  amazing thing and people buy it it's in our top 20 sellers real red pill red red pill
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:29.800]  plus two different formulas out of the other day on Thursday I'm like why is it in the
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:39.360]  top four sellers it's got zinc in it boss oh it was at full price I said drop it 50%
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:42.120]  even though we won't get any more for about three months then put it in the order and
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:47.160]  even to get it yet we're probably sell out in a week now at current rates you want a
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.440]  great multi-vitamin mineral that all the studies show boost your immunity massively that zinc
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:59.720]  actually goes into the cells so the viruses have huge trouble I mean just massive trouble
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:03.640]  getting it and having the mitochondria taken over to then order the mitochondria to produce
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.480]  more viruses and it coats the cell we've got it and amongst the other minerals do that
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:12.480]  too but zinc is the best in all the studies look at it for yourself but they're even
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:17.840]  telling the president don't talk about zinc shut your mouth there's no hope well just do
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.040]  your own research on zinc and antiviral type in zinc antiviral into a search engine your
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:26.240]  own study real red pill red pill plus it's an amazing the best multi-vitamin mineral
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:30.280]  with preglonol you're gonna find but it's not for children preglonone you probably don't
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:33.200]  want to take preglonol unless you're 20 or older that's what I've read in the literature
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:37.640]  it's a precursor to all the hormones it's over the counter and it just basically boosts
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:43.160]  all the juices you know what I mean in a layman's term believe me it's something else remember
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:46.160]  my dad a few years ago when I got on preglonone he goes man your muscles have gotten bigger
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:49.840]  you've gotten stronger you're you're more aggressive are you taking something I said
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:56.200]  yeah pop preglonone these are chemists and other things and he goes oh yeah yeah absolutely
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.600]  they don't promote that because it's so cheap that's like the biggest used to be prescribed
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:07.200]  since the 20s for all these different types of arthritis but again anything that's cheap
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:10.560]  and works good they don't want you to know about what do you think chloroquil does pushes
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.560]  zinc into the cells and you take too much of it it can make you go crazy by the way
[1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:21.720]  because chloroquil will jack your brain well and by the way zinc is psychoactive I knew
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:26.760]  this but I said if I'm saying from what I read in literature 30 milligrams three times
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.680]  recommend alien islands they say safe but really antiviral that's what I've been taking
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:36.960]  I said let me see what this is like if I take 200 milligrams I took 200 milligrams which
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:42.880]  again you probably should I tell you do that and I did piss green and I did let's just
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:51.000]  say you know I mean zinc's amazing okay let's just say I had a good time I mean vitamins
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.200]  and minerals are amazing and the system doesn't want you to do that so you take your recommended
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:59.600]  daily allowance to consult your physician but I as a citizen I'm telling what I do real
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:07.080]  red pill real red pill plus info or store.com or triple a 253139 before your children and

[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:46.520]  all the mojo big guy can give me I don't I mean believe me I we we we really bust our

[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:33.720]  silver toothpaste sold out it's just it just is a different names that's tea tree oil and
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:38.480]  iodine in it so it's really even better than the super silver that's really a tooth whiter
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:41.440]  toothpaste because it had the name silver it all sold out don't know when we're getting
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:47.840]  it back to supply chain issues but super blue is in my view better it just you know is old

[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:54.960]  out at current rates in a couple weeks but I'm still discounting it despite that okay

[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:20.480]  how you break the spell of a sleeping lion is to hear a real lion fight overwhelming
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:28.560]  odds and win and win and win and win and then fall the great art type of the alamo or so

[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:44.160]  going to release this segment because i want to get a few things together before i cover
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:48.840]  it but just disgusting you knew it was coming next segment robert barnes joined us will
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:52.920]  continue with calls let's go to calls right now let's go to shawn in pennsylvania thanks
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:59.920]  for calling thanks for holding you're on the air thank you sir appreciate it what's on
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:05.120]  your mind my friend that's on my mind is chloroquine right you agreed that the president said
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:11.000]  that it really works i've looked at all the studies if you're taking it particularly before
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:16.600]  uh you you uh come in contact with it it's extremely effective yeah because it has client
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:23.800]  on it's a synthetic quinine exactly most people in this world they can get a real one right
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:27.640]  over the counter anyone in the world seven point seven billion people can go grab it
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:32.840]  right now and cure themselves and explain what its brand names are because i was familiar
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:36.240]  with that they've been taking it for hundreds of years what the british discovered it and
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:41.520]  it's an anti-malarial you take before you go into the malaria area right there there's
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:47.360]  several there's many many studies anybody can go to wikipedia you can look up uh chloroquine
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:52.760]  and on there is you know it gives you credit about your zinc quotes about how it helps
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:58.360]  the cells how it gets inside the cells and kills it's an antiviral definitely works and
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:02.800]  then you have the quinine if you look on wikipedia and quinine you'll find a very interesting
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:09.000]  thing on the right side it's in yellow it's canada dry conic water it contains quinine
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.800]  i forgot that i remember when i was a kid yeah my dad said that's why the british would
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:22.400]  drink it with their gin and the british navy would issue officers quinine filled tonic
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.560]  added to it with their gin so they wouldn't get malaria because they knew the officers
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:32.280]  and men wouldn't take the the stuff they were supposed to you got it you're right i forgot
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:35.760]  all that and that's just like they used to put limes is why the british had the name
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:40.080]  limey because the british secretly discovered hundreds years before anybody else that vitamin
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:44.400]  c will keep from getting scurvy so the british so sailors were always ready to fight when
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:50.520]  others weren't spanish you know dutch uh chinese you name it the boobies because the british
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:56.120]  would come racing up 7 000 miles from home in great shape but the men didn't like limes
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:59.240]  they had a superstition that that was bad for him because the doctors wanted to make
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:03.600]  him take it so they would squeeze it into the rum which was done one part rum two parts
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:10.280]  water the grog so i totally forgot that exactly the british would put it into the alcohol the
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:16.200]  quinine you're damn right and all you got to do is get seagram's um tonic not soda water
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:22.080]  and it's got quinine man i'm glad you called yellow labels his tonic water and says contains
[1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:26.440]  quinine everybody in the world can go grab it right now and start taking their feet away
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:33.360]  and i totally forgot that brother yeah and that awesome because we can save everybody
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:36.960]  in the world right now all they have to do is go to the store and get canada dried tonic
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:42.480]  water it's a yellow label it says it contains quinine not the diet but the diet contains
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.160]  aspartame we don't want exactly just like they've patented fish oil and make it a four
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:50.800]  hundred dollar drug you said a 40 bucks and 30 bucks they went and patented was it 60
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:55.400]  70 years ago the quanta quill or have you said and that's just a prescription version
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:00.920]  of what's in the canada dry that's right i'm telling you 24 hours your fever will be gone
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:06.520]  in four days you'll feel like a million dollars again we don't have to wait for everybody
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:12.120]  to panic brother now they want everybody to panic i know it's a shame but what i'm trying
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:16.200]  to get on say to you so you can get out there as many people as possible so stop the panic
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:20.480]  don't get this take it for yourself see their argument is trumps son of doctor not a doctor
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:25.520]  you can go to wikipedia it says that it's the best malarial thing still but they don't

[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:39.920]  you might get diarrhea but he was talking about if you take hundreds of times the level
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:44.560]  you basically can't get sick what do you think about that right that's right the quinine
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:49.040]  too i also want people to take a look at fever tree dot com there's a hyphen between fever
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:53.240]  and the tree if you go on there you also read about quinine and what they're doing in their
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:58.480]  drink which also contains quinine saving people around the world well you know more than i
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:02.280]  do obviously you got a better memory bring up some of the other things that are documented
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:09.000]  to be antiviral well mostly right now for us because that you know this virus contains
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.920]  whatever it's made of or whatever or whoever put this all together it does contain like
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:20.880]  pneumonia it does contain a fever it does contain cough it does contain body aches and pain
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.920]  and i think it's as close to malaria as you can get that's why i think just the canada
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:31.000]  dry alone two liters a day you know you don't have to drink it all down at one just drink

[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:12.880]  mother nature gave us why are they mad at trump for telling him i think because the
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:16.760]  drug companies aren't making any money we all know that so this is a natural thing and
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.960]  anyone can go get in the world seven point seven billion people can go grab this right

[1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:16.800]  running out of the raw materials for food and things like high quality supplements that

[1:30:54.000 --> 1:31:01.320]  war take action now we've all heard of the strike it's a socialist and communist tactic
[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:07.200]  but sometimes populist movements have used the strike you can have labor strikes you
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:13.400]  can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a company or a service and many times
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:18.640]  when the people actually get together and move and master the strike it has a great
[1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:26.240]  effect and some good things have come out of it but now we are seeing a globalist corporate
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:34.040]  strike by shutting down key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:39.840]  to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world
[1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:47.200]  but notice the big globalist corporations in the big box stores they are all exempt
[1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:51.760]  this is more than just martial law training this is the globalist trying to create a worldwide
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:57.280]  depression they can blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it last sunday info
[1:31:57.280 --> 1:32:03.440]  war is exclusively reported from white house sources that trump was considering an interstate
[1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:09.640]  travel ban inside the united states a form of martial law that's never been implemented
[1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:15.040]  in our history some folks said when it didn't come true that we made up what we said was
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:19.520]  he was considering it and days later it came out in mainstream news that indeed that was
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:24.560]  happening well now we're getting intel that trumps looking at declaring a national emergency
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:30.720]  this sunday and doing just that but is it sure if it's the right move and boom governor
[1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:35.400]  newson comes out says 40 million people can't leave their houses that's martial law and
[1:32:35.400 --> 1:32:41.440]  says he may officially declare martial law the globalist the leftist the chai comms the
[1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:48.240]  eu they're all setting the bar for massive martial law or trump hasn't done his job and
[1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:53.440]  they'll blame every death on trump this is extremely dangerous time we're covering it
[1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:59.600]  live on the radio right now
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:01.600]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:51.120]  america is facing a scythe but america will take the bull by the horns and do a judo
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:34:04.240]  move and this attempt to bring us down because we are now awake and awakening further will
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:09.400]  fail we're gonna robert barnes here in just a few minutes i'll continue with your phone
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:16.680]  calls as well right through the fourth hour than gerald salante takes over i want to be
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:21.600]  clear this virus does kill people it is man made it came out of a lab so they can track
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:27.200]  and know what it's going to do you release a weapon that's been field tested it's designed
[1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:35.680]  to hit the old it's very communicable but the hype has been concerted in choreographed
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:43.040]  to take the economy the democrats have blocked the attempt to have this rescue aid package
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.120]  that probably would turn the stock market around they're trying to destroy our supply
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:54.320]  chains are trying to have china that's ramped up not cut back now take over this is the
[1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:59.560]  globalist who invested in china's desperate gamble with their corporate globalist strike
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:04.240]  against our economy by shutting off their industries it's a strike against we the people
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:12.280]  economic warfare a form of total war known as siege the oldest form of war but first
[1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:17.760]  i wanted to hit this everything's been standardized using cell phones to track and control people
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:23.000]  and their every movement everyone has to have an alibaba app to move in china a private company
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  the government took it over a few years ago and then the alibaba app has to authorize you
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.600]  to leave your house now europe's doing that with apps now they're saying it here drones
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:37.400]  in china controlling people drones in europe's own people and now california police to use
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:44.240]  chinese made patrol drones a battle tested with night vision cameras during coronavirus
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.600]  lockdown and it's all the socialist globalist countries that have open borders and sanctuary
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:54.680]  cities illegal aliens are above the law they're letting the prisoners out but boy don't let
[1:35:54.680 --> 1:36:01.120]  us catch you out after the curfews that's coming next germany closes border to europeans
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:09.960]  but migrants still allowed in so now chinese programs chinese drones interface with police
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:19.640]  communications and control battle tested against other humans now our machine miners are here
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:29.520]  rolling out a california police department is planning
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:37.600]  on using drones equipped with cameras and loudspeakers to monitor a coronavirus shutdown
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:43.320]  the chula vista police department recently doubled its fleet of drones purchasing two
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:48.040]  more of the machines from chinese company dji police department told the financial times
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:55.600]  they would be outfitted to sell 500 times london with night vision cameras we have not
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:59.680]  traditionally mounted speakers to our drones but if we need to cover a large area get an
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:07.400]  announcement out well we'll do that so there you go the robot controllers are here now
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:13.440]  i want to play a few minute clip from last night when robert barnes was on the broadcast
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:19.120]  where this constitutional lawyer and folks know the white house watches the show not
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:22.480]  going to say exactly who watches it reports the president will try to fire them you see
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.160]  them trying to fire these folks all the time in the white house that are patriots but everybody
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:30.760]  can take a guess and i said to barnes i said give your message to the president white house
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:36.160]  also follows his twitter and he said if trump saves us from the depression everyone else
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:41.360]  is leading us into by reversing the country's course on this i am going to build a statue
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:47.600]  to him in my front yard paid for by successful bets he has won for me barnes won the biggest
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:53.040]  bet ever just an iron alone 300 plus thousand dollars or the equivalent on betting on trump
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:58.240]  and of course he was talking about the democrats killing the rescue package and killing the
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:02.640]  package for emergency money from first responders and medical equipment while they bitch and
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:08.520]  say he hasn't raised a finger the president trump responded robert we will end up stronger
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:14.240]  than ever before thank you here's some of what barnes had to say last night the full
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:22.440]  clip is posted on band on video president trump responds to robert barnes's statement
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:27.160]  here it is your message to the world your message to the president your message on the economy
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:30.720]  and what do you think the president as you said the only person right now that might
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:36.560]  be able to turn this around the president has to reverse course within 30 days or we
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:43.080]  may be sunk our economy is entirely dependent on confidence and credit and often overnight
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:50.240]  confidence and overnight credit in the wall street repo and other debt markets and if
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:55.960]  those collapse then with it comes capital access and consumer confidence and with that
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:01.120]  comes the collapse of the economy itself that was the script for 1929 and people need to
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:06.280]  remember what happened within short order the the not only was there a u.s. depression
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:13.000]  there was a global depression and that birth nazism fascism communism world war two the
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:18.600]  cold war so the end a decade of depression around the world so those people who think
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:23.760]  you can just turn the engine of the economy back on like you just turn your car engine
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:29.400]  on do not understand the scope and scale of what's happening economically in addition
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:34.760]  to that the liberties that are being lost or endangered are extraordinary right now
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:38.920]  your first amendment right of political activities being suspended your first amendment right
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:43.240]  you can't do a public protest you can't do public association for political purposes
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:47.000]  you can't do religious association for religious purposes your second amendment rights are
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:53.400]  being effectively suspended New Jersey California New York Illinois Pennsylvania these states
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:57.920]  that are imposing shutdown orders are excluding gun shops from those orders so that from being
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:01.160]  necessary businesses so they're not letting them be exempt what does that mean it means
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:05.560]  you can't purchase a gun and while you can't purchase a gun we're seeing unique levels of
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:09.880]  release of prisoners uh there's a judge in montana talking about releasing prisoners
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:13.960]  orders out of philadelphia new york california other places they're talking about releasing
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:19.480]  people from rikers island so the most dangerous people in new york city so while you can't leave
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:23.400]  and you can't protect yourself by purchasing a gun the only thing that's happening is they're
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:28.120]  basically shutting down background check departments so one of the long time concerns was that background
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:33.400]  checks were just a guys both for surveillance purposes but also ultimately to use them as
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:38.840]  a pretext to deny people access the guns where you have state governments across the country in
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:43.240]  different places effectively shutting down furlough let's stop right there he then goes into his
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:46.760]  advice the president in the second half of the video it's a band-aid video we just posted it
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:53.160]  20 minutes ago it's already got 8 000 views so be sure and share that uh barns the whole world's
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:58.440]  watching co-host with me into the next hour will take calls but the democrats are really i think
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:03.560]  getting caught with their pants down by their own actions killing this aid package with the stock market
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:09.480]  down a thousand points earlier let's while he's talking pull up cnbc uh what's about to happen
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:15.080]  where are we at this crossroads in history i think the president trump is taking his back from the
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:20.440]  precipice we were clearly right on the precipice of a economic collapse that we haven't seen since
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:30.920]  1929 there were reports yesterday of 30 unemployment coming in the next month uh the the be estimated
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:36.040]  to be 30 in just one quarter which would be almost uh half by the time we get to the middle of the
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:42.040]  year uh this was a disaster uh people were noting the studies and surveys that showed the rate of
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:47.800]  suicide and deaths that skyrockets when the country simply goes into a recession uh and when it went
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:54.280]  into a past depression and those numbers of deaths far exceeded the realistic estimates of this virus
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:59.000]  so i think trump unlike almost anyone else i mean there's a theory out there called antifragile
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.120]  that there's certain unique personalities uniquely situated to handle situations and
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:09.400]  circumstances like no one else in the common stature would and that is president trump and
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:14.760]  because he is reversing course and i think he will by next week i think when the 15 days expired
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:20.280]  he's reopening america for business reopening america's economy we are restoring our fundamental

[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:14.520]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide and i want to be one trillion percent clear here
[1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:16.680]  infinity clear here
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:24.520]  i saw a joke meme on the internet without looking this morning alex jones says don't panic over
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:30.040]  the virus panic over the panic one of these leftist you know radio shows have like a hundred
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:35.480]  thousand views going that doesn't make sense either they either they're stupid either those
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:40.200]  guys are super stupid or they think their viewers are stupid their listeners are stupid
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:48.040]  that makes perfect sense don't panic over the virus but you should be concerned over the hysteria
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:54.200]  that's the dangerous thing it's like they'd be on cattle drives on the chism trail here in texas
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:48:00.360]  that runs up from mexico all the way up to chicago and kansas city on its way and that's
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  what i35 naturally is a big rut a canyon where the cattle you'll drove
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:14.520]  it like water created the grand canyon and you read the history books and articles about it
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:20.200]  somebody would misfire a shotgun or something and one cow would bulk ahead another cow and you'd
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:25.160]  have 10 000 cows running for four or five hours running over everything on their path running
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:33.160]  over other cows is the shotgun blast the problem didn't hurt a cow scared them and then it causes
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:42.440]  a stampede and so it is the hysteria like at a rock concert where somebody pops a firecracker
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:46.680]  and then everybody stampedes and a hundred people die you see that all the time
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:53.480]  so the hysteria killing the economy the hysteria creating all this fear people calling in texas
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:57.480]  in california new york the police on their neighbors because they heard them coughing
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:05.880]  and people not knowing the laws of the rules and saying hey only walmart's allowed to be open
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:11.400]  your warehouse can't be open your studio can't be open and and little you know average people
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:15.880]  enforcing because now they feel big they're part of the system but let's get back to the president
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:20.600]  you're on yesterday you send the president your message i don't get into this but we're under
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:23.960]  a particular attack trump will tweet an info or his article or tweet one of our reporters
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:28.120]  i know the white house does watch the show i know the white house is already aware of your work
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.720]  and you meet up there with some of those guys but you're really the fact that you're saying trump's
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:35.800]  got to act now they're trying to create a depression the chai comms are ramping up their economy
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:39.960]  we need to get this message to trump and then trump you know tweets and says robert we're
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:45.400]  going to do that robert we will end up stronger than ever before thank you you know it's just
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:49.800]  trump's message to the base that he's the real deal but we know he is because the democrats
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:56.760]  are trying to blame him i don't see how they get away with cheerleading the economy plunging cheerleading
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:01.640]  corona lying and saying he's not responding lying and saying troops aren't new york three days after
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:08.360]  they're there the mayor lying this is just next level deception uh so what's your latest message
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:13.800]  to the president and what do you make of him uh responding to you like that well it's great uh
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:17.880]  it's always great to get a thank you message from the president these uh there's no doubt that the
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:22.840]  president's taking the right steps and there's also no doubt that there will be a massive pushback
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:27.800]  you will see like what you're talking about a propaganda effort of an unparalleled proportion
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:34.760]  to try to intimidate him into not taking down not going down this path they'll be there'll be
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:39.080]  highlighting death stories they'll be highlighting hospital stories they'll be highlighting uh
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:43.720]  virus panic stories they'll be putting all those red dots on the screen to terrify people
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:49.000]  they'll be doing worst case scenarios from italy in spain uh the they'll be attacking the president
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.040]  non-stop the democrats will hold up cash and capital to reach the american public to hope the
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:51:00.200]  wall street markets continue to crash in the attempts to get him to induce him to keep going down
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:05.320]  this path that they wanted to which not only would result as we as you've talked about alexand an
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:11.480]  economic depression here in the united states but would also be a long-term shift of power as we
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:16.840]  talked about on sunday to china this gives uh today there were uh videos from beijing where
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:22.200]  everything's back to normal in china china is clearly ramping up uh the what's extraordinary is
[1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:27.960]  all the same media types who said who said pay attention to the chinese data that came out during
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:33.800]  the first 30 days of the virus then when all of a sudden the data started showing and actually
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:38.520]  then that that the chinese data after the first 30 days was often not from china but was from other
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:42.760]  people who are in china who had been allowed into china that showed all of a sudden the virus was
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:47.960]  dying off of its own accord all of a sudden then the press said oh you can't actually listen to data
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:53.480]  from china anymore uh but that's because they want this to be successful they think that the pandemic
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:57.560]  can take out the president the panic from the pandemic can take out the president sink the
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:02.520]  economy and shift power to china i mean well exactly remember the the data came out that they
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:07.960]  grossly overestimated the death rate there's now like a hundred cases in austin texas no deaths as
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:14.520]  of this morning so soon we're going to start finding out what the real death rate is no data for
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:18.840]  example a data guy from silicon valley simply looked at all the data in the metalcore reports and
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:24.040]  stuff that i and some others have been pushing out he aggregated together in a medium post uh
[1:52:24.040 --> 1:52:29.240]  several of us including people well with info wars pushed it out all the a lot of the mainstream
[1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:35.640]  big establishment types started paying attention to share again uh the president saw it other people
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:39.960]  saw it and showed that that all of these hysteria panic hysteria was an overreaction that there
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:44.680]  wasn't going to be a spanish flu type reaction and what happened was medium then took it down
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:49.640]  and twitter is now defaming him whether there's a zero hedge put it back up uh and twitter is now
[1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:54.440]  telling anyone who tries to even look at it oh this is a dangerous story to even look at and all
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:59.320]  he did was take data from published sources uh people forget back at the time of the swine flu
[1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:04.360]  the same people who try to push this pan panic pandemic now tried to push it then it just didn't
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:09.000]  fit as well within obama's agenda which was that they said there was going to be 10 times more deaths
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.720]  that actually occurred with the swine flu peter hitches talked about that in a daily mail so the
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:17.080]  president's on the right tack president's trying to figure it out they're trying to take him out
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:20.920]  they're trying to take america out and he wasn't going to let it happen and he let the world know
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:24.840]  he's doubling down and he's coming back and he's going to reverse course and now there's going
[1:53:24.840 --> 1:53:29.480]  to be massive pushback and he just has to stick with his instincts stick with his guns do what needs
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:36.840]  to be done in a week's time reopen america tell everybody we're being america require the governors
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:43.240]  and mayors to reopen america and allow don't allow fear and hysteria and media panic uh to that's
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:47.960]  right marge stay right there i totally agree with you even if it's super deadly panicking and doing
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:52.840]  all this is not the answer i saw all the panicking and china scripting this and the media getting
[1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:57.000]  ready to blame from i said you better take it serious drop they're gonna say you didn't respond
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:01.480]  then he kind of over responded now he's gotten pulled back this is a balancing act big announcement
[1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:09.560]  tokyo olympics the olympics the summer olympics coming up have been postponed next stop us elections
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:15.240]  they're getting ready for that barns how do you see that unfolding so the state and local governments
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:20.520]  control the timing of presidential elections but the constitution requires that the electoral
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:26.280]  college act in a certain manner within a certain time frame including the new president be inaugurated
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:31.320]  in january constitutionally uh so i think there's limits on what the state and local governments
[1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:36.680]  can do uh but i think the president as long as the president takes a firm tack they will be hard
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:42.280]  pressed to try to undermine them uh and the allies of the president have supported uh me and some
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:47.240]  others taking legal action against some of the cities and counties and states with these unlawful
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:53.160]  unconstitutional uh stay home orders and so when you combine those efforts i believe we'll be able
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:57.960]  to prevent that effort from happening but this is clearly the path they were on they were on a path
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:02.520]  to try to take out the president take out the economy of the country sink it to china and they
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:07.000]  were happy with that outcome and happy with that result even if it meant extraordinary economic
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:12.600]  social civil and physical pain to millions and millions of americans and billions around the
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:17.800]  world uh luckily we had a very unique president who was able to stand up to it and stand back to
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:22.200]  it hillary clinton was president we'd already be doomed and be figuring out you know where our new
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:27.000]  tent was going to be at the fema camp so it's a radically different mindset that's exactly have
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.160]  you go to the big tracker sites that are fed into the u.s government and a female show listeners
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:40.680]  and tv viewers some of this infection 2020.com you can say go to travis county where we are 79 cases
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:47.640]  and zero deaths and you start clicking on other counties there's no deaths and then you'll have
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:52.360]  one person dying it's like international news but how does that mesh then with italy that's had
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:57.800]  less deaths if you believe china uh than china what in the hell's going on over there uh the
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:02.440]  reason why they were going to highlight italy from day one is because italy has a disproportionate
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:07.880]  problem responding to the flu three particularly northern Italy in the lombardi region and the
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:14.280]  reason for that is threefold first very old population second it's a population that smokes a
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:19.640]  lot and there's a lot of smog in the air a lot of air pollution and third their social nature of
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:24.680]  interaction transmits flu like diseases at an extraordinary rate to give you an example just
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:32.280]  two years ago uh italy had about 70 000 people die from the flu which was about a rate five times
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:39.160]  higher than the rest of the world so that's why the media was always going to highlight italy
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.080]  because they knew by highlighting italy they could scare and terrorize the rest of the world
[1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:48.840]  notably almost all of these deaths are in lombardi uh i did a comparison to the normal death rate
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:54.680]  and the published rate is that for all of italy the death rate increase over last year is the
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:57:00.520]  same uh growth the same rate of growth as the year before so it's only in lombardi that they
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:07.160]  have a problem robert barnes stay right there critical information will start the third hour
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:11.480]  we'll talk more with robert and take your phone calls straight ahead remember the globals are
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:16.200]  ringing around the clock to shut us down to try to not get the word out but you can overpower them
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:21.480]  anytime you want by telling people about the local tv and radio stations you're watching and listening
[1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:26.920]  to and telling folks about band dot video put the left hand corner pull down the menu for all the

[1:59:43.000 --> 2:00:00.440]  think they own you and now they're about to show you you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:09.400]  you are either with the republic or against it resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's
[2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:15.240]  alex jones uh robert barnes next segment i want to take calls with you and get your take on the
[2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:20.920]  great points they bring up but in the short segment the crew are really doing their own
[2:00:20.920 --> 2:00:25.480]  research you're like oh barnes is absolutely right look it up just a couple years ago they had four
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:30.360]  million people with the flu like you said 70 000 died they're pulling up those statistics right now
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:36.920]  and then it turns out it's this big issue uh that italy has so many problems italy is in the grip
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:44.120]  of its worst flu season in 14 years and then it happened in 2004 happened in 2016 i mean they have
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:51.640]  big big problems what on earth is going on that recap that information so the first part is that
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:56.200]  it generally hits northern italy in particular so italy has one of the oldest populations in the
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:01.400]  world so those are the people most susceptible to flu like viruses in the first place secondly in
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:06.680]  northern italy in particular there's a lot of air pollution and that air pollution further causes
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:11.080]  problems and uh and actually tends to be an increased transmission rate just like china
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:18.120]  exactly uh third is that the the elderly the the culture of italy there's a lot of
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:22.520]  intergenerational house living styles so a lot of kids living with grandma and grandpa
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:28.840]  and so kids are often uh transmit transmitted a high rate particularly in very sociable
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:35.240]  communicable uh culture so like for example with this virus it is most highly communicated
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:40.440]  it where where people have close continuous contact with one another such as in a confined
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:45.160]  setting well basically that is the culture of northern italy uh so you have they're living
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:50.520]  in old rotting castles exactly and they're just old people that hug each other all the time kiss
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:55.000]  each other all the time are next to each other all the time a lot of intergenerational family
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:59.560]  communication style i have friends that come from that for that region of the country so it
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:06.040]  is a perfect petri dish for flu like viruses and even more so for this virus now it's interesting
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:11.720]  is the media knew all that yet hit it and the reason why they hit it is they knew italy was
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:17.160]  going to have a breakout problem and so italy was the perfect place to create a pandemic panic
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:24.440]  for the rest of the world uh and whereas they hid information related to germany very low rate of
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:30.360]  transmission korea very low rate of transmission singapore very low rate of transmission finland
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:35.800]  very low rate of transmission all these other countries where it's not transmitting yet anywhere
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:40.760]  near the rate it is in italy uh they've hid that information and the true petri dishes the diamond
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:46.200]  princess cruise ship where people were were locked in together for three weeks with circulated air
[2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:51.240]  where all the chefs and the cleaners all had the disease and yet 83 percent of the people
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:56.920]  never got the disease and if you adjusted the infat infection rate as a stanford scientist did
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:01.320]  he projected that the death rate for the u.s. would be no higher than the flu
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:07.080]  so when nuisance says 56 percent are going to get it and 20 percent are going to go to the hospital
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:12.520]  that is just horse crap not only that you have a dallas county guy up there the the guy who runs
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:18.680]  dallas county there in texas just issued a shutdown order and he put out a completely bogus chart
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:23.640]  that said that as long as he did a shutdown order they would save almost all these lives
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:28.680]  whereas if they didn't all these lives would die a disparity that made zero cents altogether
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:33.160]  so you're seeing people predict these for example even the spanish flu
[2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:38.680]  when we did not have good facilities when we had bad air pollution throughout the western world
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:44.200]  we were fighting a world war in europe at the time i mean horrible conditions for a flu to spread
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:49.560]  even millions of men in the western world run down to just the lowest immune system ever
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:55.320]  they've been getting exactly mustard gas they were starving to death and yet still only 30
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:00.600]  percent of the people got the spanish flu so the idea that over 50 percent we're going to get this
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:06.760]  flu at least in any consequential manner in other words any sort of severe illness hospitalization
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:12.680]  or death was always absurd so the uh the other reason why they the other reason why they always
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:17.480]  focused on testing too by the way is because they knew that flu like diseases most people don't know
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:24.200]  they have it so testing would panic them the the flu itself they the cdc estimates has a hundred
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:28.120]  times more people that have it than ever test for it that's why they focused on testing they knew
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:32.040]  it would create the panic and that's what their whole goal has been along has been all the way
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:37.320]  through and luckily we have a president able to push back able well listen i hope you're right i
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:42.680]  hope you're right that that that we can turn this panic back but i gotta tell you it is just bonker
[2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:47.960]  land and you're really finding out who the boys from the men are and who the i mean it's just i
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:51.880]  hate panickers man i just cannot stand it they're right back stay with us
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:05:02.200]  i made four police state films more than a decade ago specifically warning of the plan to suspend
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:08.280]  habeas corpus the right to even have access to a court the right to not be secretly arrested
[2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:13.080]  and secretly disappeared and i warned the patriot act they claimed was for terrorists
[2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:18.440]  was really for the american people well now they admitted is and bipartisanly the justice department
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:25.960]  is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear americans whenever they want under the guise of
[2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:32.600]  coronavirus but they just say during the emergency it'll be for every other crime you can imagine it's
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:39.880]  the chairing on top of a nice big fudge sunday called marshal law oh and the sprinkles on it
[2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:44.120]  it's the big great depression everybody's gonna have so folks that are all excited that you're

[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:49.960]  social score has been set up by the big tech companies it's the testing ground now they're
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:54.120]  just moving it to europe and here this is the rollout they're admitting it i've got stacks of
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:57.960]  articles every day saying they're getting an app ready through the blue cities for you to be able
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:02.280]  to go outside your house it's going to track social distancing this isn't coming it's here

[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:22.120]  allowed to move here's another one singapore's big brother fights against coronavirus same thing an
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:30.120]  app this is all a plan it's no longer a debate robert barnes no doubt about it in fact what was
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:36.360]  on pace to occur was for effectively not only would we shift political economic and manufacturing
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:41.880]  power to china that while our factories were closed their factories were ramping up and they
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:45.640]  could replace us in the world market and the supply chain such that when we came back we no
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:51.240]  longer had a competitive edge but in addition the chinese method and the chinese modus of operation
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:57.000]  the social credit system was already being looked at for applied throughout europe and throughout
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.560]  the united states like you look at all this talk about look at how the chinese are helping europe
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:05.720]  yeah why are they helping europe what's their goal and objective their goal and objective
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:10.440]  throughout the rest of the world has been able to use the guise of charity to acquire economic
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:16.520]  leverage and technological access to control of that country's technology and the the apps that
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:21.240]  work that's why we have the dispute with hawaii that we do so here that the same protocols are
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:25.000]  being applied in europe their goal was ultimately to apply in the united states to where we were
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:30.600]  going to be under the guise of panic of pandemic protection virus protection was going to be their
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:37.560]  new scheme for imposing these extraordinary degrees of social control and a social credit system
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:43.960]  the march that's right and now they're going after the cash everything else stops breaking up
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:47.240]  but robert you're absolutely right we got to get you about our skype connections your dynamite on
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:53.000]  there but that damn skype is coming out of great points let's go ahead and take another call here
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:56.840]  let's talk to joe in north carolina you're on the air with alex jones robert barneson
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:05.000]  hey alex um i just had a quick question or possibly a theory about the how the coronavirus
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:10.440]  really started bill gates with everything that he does you know which is all glorious in its nature
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:16.840]  of course um he's always talking about mosquitoes uh being sort of a entry system for whatever he
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:22.200]  wants to use um you know that day i guess and he released him and they mutated and gave people
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:28.440]  zika that's confirmed yes and uh with this it seems like the sort of the time of year that
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:33.960]  that could possibly have been or have been or be used for the same thing oh you're right the
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:38.040]  mosquitoes are coming out right now what a perfect time yeah i wonder if this virus we don't
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:42.920]  be spread by other animals whatever it can be spread by mosquito what do you think uh joe uh i
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:47.240]  think that's a big possibility if not whatever vaccine he would like to put in there could be
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:51.960]  used for that and then it doesn't matter what people want to do to get that by mosquito you're
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:58.680]  done um and at the same time as well uh just everything that he seems to be doing he's he's
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:03.960]  it's been pretty quiet recently from the bill gates side surprise oh he is a real live super villain
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:10.280]  yeah and then you know when him seeing it's how he knows everything i'm curious that he's quiet i
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:16.680]  guess like the you know the the dark that doesn't bark i guess to say um and with everything that's
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:21.240]  going on i'm surprised that he's not up there given the daily greetings because he knows so damn
[2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:26.120]  much about the well his dad ran the eugenics operation for a secret army program at cold
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:32.040]  springs harbour he don't miss that and ran plant baronet he is the real deal god bless you sir
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:38.040]  are real bad i mean you talk about a demon elf he's it um the real deal folks that is not a very
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:45.560]  he doesn't play well with others uh barns you want to comment on uh the event 201 and disease x
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.960]  and all the pre hyping of this and then all the weird bill gates funded tv shows and movies
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:54.840]  that all just aired perfectly as this happened that have been in production for a year well
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:59.320]  those who had concern about the intentions were highlighting the fact that so many
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:06.520]  many high-ranking ceo's resigned or stepped down in just the last six months uh and that
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.960]  struck a lot of people as odd and peculiar bill gates stepped down from microsoft this month
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:18.600]  then there was the unusual connection between him highlighting the fears over a pandemic
[2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:26.200]  about corona virus the many months before this virus broke out which you highlighted
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:32.520]  early on uh identifying that this may be reason for cause as to whether a pandemic panic will
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:41.560]  take place within the press and the politicians due to fear and concern uh that the uh this kind
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:47.160]  of ideology was being planted in people's minds and now we're seeing it come to fruition the eager
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:52.600]  wish with which politicians around the world are using this as a pretext to grab and seize
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:57.000]  unprecedented but i agree with you the end game is the force of vaccine gates it turns
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:02.440]  out has a digital tattoo that's like sewn into your skin pure able it's all here but there's
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:08.040]  going to be a huge backlash it's already beginning you can see it oh no doubt about it i think ordinary
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:14.520]  people are not interested in this goal if there was a a legitimate pandemic about a legitimate
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:19.880]  virus that was not disproportionate in its response where the cure was not worse than the
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:24.600]  problem as the president and the politicians weren't openly looking like you're having orgasms
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:29.560]  other than trump i mean they are just loving it no doubt about it the excitement i mean
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:34.520]  well the dallas county was just the latest example i mean the the excitement that they have they
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:39.240]  want to be our saviors and they look like they've just won the super bowl and they're just like
[2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:44.280]  strutting around smiling the governor of texas isn't trump isn't but every all these other people
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:51.160]  are acting like they are on five hits of ecstasy the people you would most fear having power
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:57.640]  particularly unchecked power are the ones seeking right now the pandemic as the pretext to seize
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:03.160]  that power and that's what threatens the liberties of people around the world uh here in the united
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:08.840]  states uh throughout parts of western europe uh and that's why the president's reaction today was
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:15.000]  key the president is the only thing saving us from going off the cliff from going off the precipice
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:21.160]  he is the only one standing pushing back by the way that's true that's actually true but he's not
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:25.880]  just the only guy in power we're here as well and that's why the globalists are so pissed and
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:32.040]  tumor in them now blocking the aid package totally reveals them doesn't it i know that about it
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:36.280]  exposes their real agenda their real agenda had nothing to do with protecting the public
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:43.400]  it was entirely a power grab and now the american people get to see it in live time thanks that's

[2:20:54.600 --> 2:21:05.320]  things she's talking about pretty cool man stanley kubrick was a remote viewer ladies and gentlemen
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:14.600]  oops i didn't say that that uh let's stop right there he had the cia vis even they go how do you

[2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:23.080]  some of it but a lot of it i'm not going to get into it on air but i believe it some of the other
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:27.560]  stuff she told me man and i looked up some of the pieces were there but why he made the shining
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:33.640]  why he made all these movies but uh why he made eyes wide shut and he would not cut the last 24
[2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:41.320]  minutes and he died and they think he was killed he was very haunted by the things he knew and he
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:45.320]  would also like have these basically visions and then he would experience it being around people
[2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:50.440]  later found was true highly psychic folks anyways let's just stop and move on from that area
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:54.520]  robert barnes is our guest here we're taking your phone calls he's been very nice to give us a lot of
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:59.160]  timer today and i knew he's a statistician i mean the guy i know when people are bs-ing
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:04.840]  everything he's saying we're looking it up and it's true i i i didn't know idly had the record
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:08.360]  flew right in the world i knew they had one of the oldest populations the oldest replacement like
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:12.760]  right in europe i knew they had problems i know they were the leader in flue deaths
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:21.560]  i had no idea that was hired 70 000 like he said some years so of course that's what's
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:25.240]  happening i do know they all live especially northern italy and like old houses the average
[2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:30.120]  house is like 400 years old a lot of folks have castles because you had to was always get invaded
[2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:35.720]  so a lot of families live in the family castle and and it'll be two three four generations in there
[2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:39.720]  there's a lot of money really old and that's viruses come through they wipe you out so that's
[2:22:39.720 --> 2:22:46.520]  what's going on here but i want to just remind listeners i lost my uncle my dad's uncle my cousin
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:52.920]  who all lived in the ranch houses and our family ranch in east texas in the same month three different
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:23:00.200]  houses my cousin died my uncle died and then my dad's uncle died and my uncle was only 69 and looked
[2:23:00.200 --> 2:23:05.960]  like papa he was in great shape army the uh was hero the whole nine yards and it just killed him
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:12.360]  and when i was at the palestine that's the name of the town near there giant hospital it's a big
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:16.840]  catholic hospital there he was at and they were just like everybody's dying they were just like yeah
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:21.800]  they were spraying silver everywhere and there were people in the halls and just funerals everywhere
[2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:27.560]  that was not on the news haulers were calling in from all over the midwest and texas and Louisiana
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:32.760]  and arkansas oh man we're burying half our relatives around here nothing on the news when
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:37.320]  that was under obama when you got a real pandemic you're not going to hear about it in my experience
[2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:42.360]  that's why you better be taking zinc in the fall and the winter in the spring every year anyways
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:46.280]  that's why you should be doing all these things and we sell a high quality product that's all the
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:51.080]  vitamins and minerals and the preglinone you need to boost it real red pill red real plus
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:56.200]  that has a good dose of high quality zinc in it zinc sold out almost everywhere we're shipping

[2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:12.840]  supposed to sell it for one reason or the other but whatever so this is the topical bottle the
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:19.320]  other bigger bottles are for ingestion same thing but this is proven same company american
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:25.480]  biotechs where a lot of hospitals use this is it and the pentagon found at 2.5 times better
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:30.840]  than alcohol and alcohol only lasts a few hours this lasts until you wipe it off it just stays there
[2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:35.720]  okay so this is selling out no need to even plug it will be sold out before more comes in
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:40.280]  info or store.com going back to barns take a few calls in this segment but next segment
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:46.440]  what else is on your radar what else do you want to get into just one other component on italy italy
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:53.320]  also has a history of over reporting deaths from specific causes so for example if you're elderly
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:59.080]  and you die of a heart attack but you also had the flu bug they'll often list both as the cause
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:06.200]  of death so they tend to and so they're doing it really bad in this context everybody who dies
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:13.800]  who happens to have coronavirus their listing is as dying because of coronavirus rather than
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:19.400]  when you look at the underlying details they usually had three or four other possible causes
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  of death independent of and separate from coronavirus that's why outside lombardi the
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:31.160]  overall death rate in italy is actually growing at a smaller rate than it did the year before
[2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:34.920]  now in lombardi they clearly have a problem but outside lombardi that's not the case by the way
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:41.480]  i looked that up during the break that's italy's oldest city oldest population by far not only that
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:47.000]  bad pollution in particular in lombardi and a lot of intergenerational housing dependence you have
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  people living in three bedroom apartments where you've got six six people living there multiple
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:55.400]  generations in close continuous and that's because the taxes are so high unbelievable all right let's
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:26:01.320]  jam in a call malcom thanks for holding on the air with robert barnes go ahead hello yes sir thanks
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:07.240]  for holding hey um i'm gonna try to be real quick about this i got a sticker idea for you
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:14.760]  covid slash 9 11 you should make one of those man but um i was just wondering uh could you
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:20.120]  elaborate more on 5g and how that possibly can make the coronavirus even worse because sir there's
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:25.560]  no possible about it instinctively we've gotten more calls more emails about this than any other
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:32.120]  one thing 5g and the fact that they rolled out 5g first and we want in all the studies 4g 3g 2g
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:39.480]  all of this electromagnetic microwave radiation lowers the blood brain barrier and pushes viruses
[2:26:39.480 --> 2:26:45.080]  across and pushes viruses through the cell membranes in every study and increases the
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:50.920]  incidence of bacterial and viral infection just just type in uh cell phone radiation
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:58.120]  and blood brain barrier and infection rate it's a fact it does it and so yes it is a contributing
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:04.520]  factor yeah i feel like that needs but notice everyone without even ever saying this the the
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:08.200]  allisters went and found out wuhan was where they rolled it out and they have it everywhere i didn't
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:11.960]  even know that everyone's just instinct let me ask i'm not going to hang up on your mouth i don't
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:14.920]  want you to have another question here but barns what is it what do they call the knowledge of
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:18.360]  the crowd because that's what they fear the population we have this electromagnetic they
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:25.960]  proven group consciousness i always notice it's the the crowd that's engaged always knows what's
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.280]  going on even though they're not sure why they always put their finger on it and then we go check
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:36.360]  it out and that's it yeah i mean it's the equivalent of crowdfunding except in the context of ideas
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:43.080]  and can and new ideas in particular and uh proper interpretations rather than actual cash or currency
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:49.320]  but it totally revolutionizes the nature of a lot of your best ideas come from crowd-generated
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:54.040]  ideas and crowd-generated uh common sense it's really what the best definition really is common
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:59.880]  sense it's what it is it's it's experience combined with intuition of the masses put together
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:05.240]  and you get what real common sense is yeah you go for what's true for the species not what's true
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:09.160]  just to make money because if i come up here and said we're all dead i'd sell five times more stuff
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.680]  no i'm not going to do that oh exactly and no doubt about it and so the key is that you know
[2:28:14.680 --> 2:28:18.680]  people should be prepared and people should be ready that was always smart but the that's in
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.480]  response to the the the panic that was always going to come about uh but no question that what's
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:28.040]  happened here i mean there's aspects it's not a coincidence that all of this ends up being connected
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:30.520]  back hold on let's get that we got a little break Malcolm don't hang up let you finish up
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:33.720]  knock it to everybody else but that was the point i ever got to when i was talking about my family
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.840]  dying and then and then no one's saying it was a pandemic when it was and calls from all the
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:43.240]  country was you need to get your immune system boosted for all the real stuff that's out there
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:46.920]  and the real pandemics they're not going to tell you about it maybe trump will but i mean
[2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:50.920]  when it's obama's watch he'd want to panic on his watch we'll be right back

[2:32:36.040 --> 2:32:43.320]  seven on a one to ten rickshaw scale get ready folks the democrats like the chai comms are setting

[2:32:50.360 --> 2:33:13.000]  aliens are all exempt you're listening to the alex jones show oh we're getting the video on this
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:20.840]  you don't know much biology oh no much about the science yeah i think you haven't done an
[2:33:20.840 --> 2:33:27.640]  info wars don't know much about the french i took what i do know what about the fact that
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:37.800]  if you love me too world a wonderful world this would be you got any store and get the chemical
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:50.040]  that's in the quinine drug not in your soda no it's in it's in the other stuff the tonic
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:58.280]  absolutely they won't even tell anybody that you know that tonic knocks out malaria pretty much
[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:03.800]  can't get it if you're drinking two bottles up in a day i'm not a doctor that's like an established
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:09.960]  fact for 150 years like vitamin c keeps you from getting scurvy you know you don't get vitamin c for
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:15.560]  a couple months all your teeth fall out every old scar you have opens back up and you get bleeding
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:20.280]  pustulates all over you till you die and and then your heart ventricles it disintegrate you have a
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:29.880]  heart attack so only one mammal produces vitamin c that's the rat in its gut rodent stew whether
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:35.240]  the dominant male species we count the number of live forms we don't do that we have to have it we
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:41.320]  have to ingest it from green leafy things i'm digressing ladies and gentlemen we're getting the
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:46.600]  video right now it just happened it's bombshell here's the washington post democrats block key
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:54.120]  vote on two trillion coronavirus bill as senate floor erupts with partisan anger democrats block
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:00.520]  two trillion dollar corona rescue bill from the second day in a row as near pandemonium
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:09.400]  erupted on the senate floor pandemonium from pandora's box with lawmakers venting fury about
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:14.120]  the failed efforts to address the pandemic's impact on the u.s economy will get you about
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:21.560]  those clips definitely for gerald solente but it is just screaming yelling uh it's um what are the
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:26.760]  democrats thinking this is no money for big corporations directly to workers directly to
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:31.720]  keep them employed when they're furloughed uh directly to the senate directly to the medical
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.320]  workers directly for ventilators directly for masks directly and the democrats are blocking it
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:43.080]  barns this is this is near suicide except they just want to crash the economy and have china win
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:48.120]  because they are all invested in china and the cfr says it was a chinese century and america was done
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:53.240]  they're paid for by the chicoms half of them have chicom agents in there so they don't care how bad it
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:59.480]  looks because they're carrying out a military attack on our main generator uh the uh with the
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:03.960]  democrats response makes sense given what their strategy is and their strategy is just to sink the
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:09.640]  economy have the pandemic spread have it all be blamed on trump sees power and remember from the
[2:36:09.640 --> 2:36:15.240]  democrats perspective every time there's been a major economic downturn in the mart modern political
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:22.760]  era since 1932 democrats have profited uh in 1932 had seen the economy sink under hoover where they
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:27.800]  also you know did various obstacles to hoover during that time period uh made sure and guaranteed
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:34.920]  that they would have a 20 year period of complete dominance across the board then 1992 the economic
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:41.640]  collapse or decline led to bill clinton uh then in 2008 it led to barack obama obama care house and
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:48.280]  senate big majorities so their view is that a wall street collapse a economic collapse profits
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:55.000]  them politically secondly as you know uh there are deep ties between various aspects of chinese
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:01.240]  investors uh and pro chinese advocates within the democratic party trump has been going uh right at
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:06.840]  china to try to rebalance our uh manufacturing rebalance our jobs rebalance our economy this
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:12.120]  is how china has retaliated uh doing at a minimum even if you don't believe china had any intention
[2:37:12.120 --> 2:37:18.600]  ality in the role there's no question that china if china had not hid the the pandemic early on
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:22.840]  then we would not be in this position at all and could not be in so why would they i i guess
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:27.240]  because we're informed we have that blind spot we forget that half the public literally doesn't
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:30.920]  know what planet they're on i don't see that as an opportunity to screw people i see it as a danger
[2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:35.960]  to my children and myself and our species with these criminals manipulating them but the boldness
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:41.400]  of saying trump didn't send troops to new york three days after he did with huge medical supplies
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:46.280]  the boldness of blocking the funds the boldness of saying he's doing nothing when they're the ones
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:52.920]  doing something blocking it they are damn villains these people are over the damn top and i'm sorry
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:57.880]  a bunch of them need to hang i'm not going to go start a fight i'm not going to make them victims
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:02.600]  i'm not going to turn them into martyrs i mean due process they are chinese communist spies
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:08.520]  they are criminals they're doing insider trading the justice department but by not acting against
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:13.960]  the deep state keeps allowing these insane things to go on that are going to destroy them as well
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:22.360]  it's out of control stop them it's a pandemic of corruption within our main political institutions
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:28.200]  and legal institutions of the kind that has sunk great empires in the past whether we're talking
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:34.120]  about england in the early 19th early 20th century or talking about rome many centuries before
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:41.240]  it's always the the any great system tends to collapse from within not from without and here
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:46.280]  the combined corruption of sort of the deep state administrative government that has taken over large
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:51.960]  parts of law enforcement national security and intelligence operations combined with their
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:56.360]  political patrons and the think tanks and on the halls of congress now threaten the well-being of
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:01.400]  all americans and the entire world yeah we're not up here with talking points they are the most
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:07.320]  flagrant villainous supervillains that are that even our hunchback and act like skexies they even
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:11.640]  look like something out of a science fiction nightmare movie malcolm finishing up real quick
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:17.640]  on 5g what else you want to say brother i do have to ask do you find it very funny that some of
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:22.200]  these celebrities and politicians are getting this coronavirus oh they do it to make themselves
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:27.720]  look like victims it's all fake but do you think some of them acts if you however some of them do
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:33.080]  best with some Chinese opera maybe sir i don't know god bless you but i don't believe for a damn
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:37.560]  minute that harvey weinstein has as soon as he got convicted he quit using the walker i mean it's
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:42.920]  what do you think uh barns well i think the joke that's going around is that that harvey weinstein

[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.280]  is a perfect way to have that more deadly strains that burn out you know they've got those with the
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:01.960]  dna engineered rna now where they can uh for how it hits your dna you can only they spray it in your

[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:08.840]  silver silver million deals with bacteria but for some you know there's a lot of uh anti news out
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:14.440]  there that try to today this doesn't work alex jones is talking about this no no no i know a study
[2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:18.600]  because i do this a lot i work a lot with people with these there's a molecular science study in
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:24.840]  2011 and cbi that talks about silver with down particles that's used for antimicrobial bacteria
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:30.600]  and and against several types of viruses sir there are hundreds of studies that the the military
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:36.200]  uses this very stuff again they just don't want you to know what's out there we're not saying it's
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:41.000]  a cure we're not saying it's perfect but i mean the pentagon says that it's one of the most effective
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.880]  things out there right yeah and again i think with the viral thing there's people don't understand
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:51.800]  how virus work virus has a vibrant very similar like i can't there's a fireman of this coat that's
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:57.000]  why a lot of things can't penetrate it like cancer and what happens is the silver can attack the
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:02.280]  bacteria that contributes to this vibrant layer or a shell and what happens when that starts well
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:07.080]  that's right bacteria carry the viruses through the body and that's why antibiotics are actually
[2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:11.720]  anti viral good great point so i used to say why are they giving you an antibiotic for virus until
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:15.800]  i did the research we'll come back with barns thank you sir now we got to get to jefferson

[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:31.000]  the middle east welcome welcome welcome can't make that up robert barnes our guest
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:36.120]  i'll host a little bit of the next hour then jose lente takes over that's some amazing highlights
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:41.160]  the ongoing fight in the senate where mcconnell says expect us to act and really exposes the
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:46.680]  democrats i'll play that at six after and so much more but i'm pledged to go to your phone
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:50.520]  calls but i wanted to go to this analogy we had a guest on i forget exactly what was a few weeks ago
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:55.320]  he said the way the globalists are flopping around and freaking out is like the android the movie alien
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:47:59.640]  they find out it's a company android they're trying to get the species on board and take it back
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:04.200]  for the weapons division and when they start killing it killing the android it starts flopping
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:10.600]  around and spazzing out and you're throwing a fit and so here is the allegory of the new world order
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:14.360]  right now throwing everything they can at us and the democrats trying to crash the economy
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:21.640]  from the u.s economy right here world's best
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  gonna kill america he's gonna get it
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:39.560]  uh
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:43.400]  it's mission is destroy the economy kill kill
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:47.960]  can't reason with it get it off get it off get it off get it off
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:51.080]  this is what happens once it gets beaten it's really bad
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:57.480]  this is what the democrats are doing right now trying to attack the economy spewing poison every
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:49:05.880]  direction this is the point we've now reached even if they bring down the economy they get
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:09.640]  the blame now but they're following they're all blackmailed by the chai comms and others
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:14.200]  to see afar would get them to do deals with chinese which is espionage then they can blackmail
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:22.520]  them okay that's good now let's show you another allegory this is press and blade runner this is a
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:29.480]  biological android the decker has uh it has it has fatally wounded and it does the same thing
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:33.640]  there's another allegory of the globalist here it is she's flipping towards the economy she's
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:49.240]  gonna destroy it this is what happens here it is and that's all it is he's not gonna be president
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:58.040]  this is what happens i'm bringing out america i'm gonna go with me open motors bring in tv
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:06.280]  we're all being made to step down because trumps make them step down they go oh really bio weapon
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:11.800]  and the real thing is the psychological warfare weapon you like those allegories uh their barns
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:17.800]  yeah i think they're all apt i mean i think the we were really on the verge of being wiped out
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:23.960]  in ways that i don't think most americans had cognizance of and trump saved the country and the
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:30.200]  world from where we were going and the uh by being the harrison ford character by being the character
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:35.960]  that that steps up at the key moment and acts against all of what the people in power want to
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:41.160]  have happen and the uh and that's entirely thanks to him and entirely thanks to him that the country
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:46.360]  can actually have a future but you see the pushback today the pushback today from the democrats on
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:53.240]  the hill the pushback from the various deep state institutional operators the pushback from the press
[2:50:53.240 --> 2:51:00.360]  all trying to coerce them into a different path uh the path they thought they on the path they thought
[2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:04.360]  they had the country on that's right i was asking why your skype's so bad you were telling me there's
[2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:10.520]  so many people on the internet in vegas that it's all messed up yeah there's a vegas shutdown so the
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:14.920]  to the credit of the mayor in vegas the mayor in vegas has said that the governor's order is
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:21.240]  unconstitutional is vague and so the mayor won't enforce it but the but the mayor is not as powerful
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:27.320]  as the governor and so basically almost everybody's unemployed right now in los vegas it's uh it you
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:33.880]  know we would become like a mad max kind of world a babalon berlin kind of world if we didn't correct
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:38.840]  or remedy these things very quickly uh thanks thank goodness that trump did it otherwise we were
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:43.480]  going to be in a very different kind of environment you know i had friends of mine uh who are well
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:48.120]  connected investors who are people that are well connected to what's going on in china and they were
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:51.800]  you know sending me photos of their plane that they're going to be hopping on to get out of the
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:57.960]  country within two weeks if this didn't change uh these are people who don't overreact uh so
[2:51:58.760 --> 2:52:03.720]  that was on the scope of what we were facing but you think it's starting to turn around with
[2:52:03.720 --> 2:52:07.800]  trump saying he thinks the restrictions are too extreme he's letting everybody get a taste of
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:12.920]  democrat martial law then saying hey you really want to not have an economy you you you really
[2:52:12.920 --> 2:52:18.840]  want to live under you can't go outside what democrats want and here it is as economic uh told
[2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:24.600]  mounts nation ponders tradeoffs wall street journal and so people are starting to get it
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:28.120]  it's good to be prepared it's good to boost your immune system all that's great folks but
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:32.680]  running around panicking is not the creative land of the free home of the brave my god if this virus
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.800]  was killing 510 percent then i'd say stay home it's not folks and that's going to come out jefferson
[2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:43.320]  in virginia you're on the air welcome sir gentlemen yes we're doing your best to keep our
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:51.320]  constitutional republic alive uh the technocrats and the bureaucrats and the pharmacists are doing
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:55.880]  their best to create an artificial scarcity of this hydroxychloroquine right now they're saying
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:52:59.720]  that they have to keep it away from the public because they have to stay there for people with
[2:52:59.720 --> 2:53:08.280]  rheumatoid arthritis and lupus well all i know is is that anybody and i'm not doing medical things
[2:53:08.280 --> 2:53:13.800]  here this is tyranny to say i can't tell you what the caller pointed out that vitamin c goes after
[2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:22.040]  things uh like scurvy well you can go and get uh any tonic that has quinine in it and that's what
[2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:26.360]  they turn into the drug that is this and that's the antimalarial and that's why the british army
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:33.080]  made it a drink uh to have the tonic the amendment remember tonics were the old name of a medicine
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:40.840]  apothecary so it's called a gin and tonic because uh the troops were in uh africa they were in other
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:47.000]  areas uh that had malaria and so that's what they gave them with the gin the military gave them gin
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:52.200]  and tonic just like the british gave them lines with their rum and said you don't get rum unless
[2:53:52.200 --> 2:53:58.440]  you take lines so it was a medicating of the troops we can turn this around on tony fouchy
[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:03.080]  though he says he wants a large study before he's going to release this happily well we already
[2:54:03.080 --> 2:54:08.360]  have the population of people that are taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:14.920]  and lupus so let's see if those people are somewhat immune to the virus oh listen fouchy is
[2:54:14.920 --> 2:54:20.200]  total madness he contradicts trump constantly he's a hillary clinton worshipper uh jefferson
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:23.880]  what do you think uh thanks for the call jefferson what do you think
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:27.400]  prompt should do about the situation of how the fda and others are trying to block
[2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:32.040]  an emergency the president can order a drug open to the public in fact he's the very guy that can
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:36.520]  do it they're acting like the media says he can't even talk about medical stuff he's a shut his mouth
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:43.400]  well the very sort of fda approach has always been problematic the idea the i had a this debate
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:48.440]  with uh raffnader many years ago where i said that he was complaining that all the agencies that he
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:53.160]  helped create that he thought would protect the public from corporations had become the captive
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:55:01.640]  tool of corporations to keep out competition and control the public and but that was inescapable
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:06.920]  with the way big state operations work and so that's the problem the problem here is that the fda is
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:11.880]  hindering necessary relief and remedies that is far more efficacious and far less problematic
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:19.160]  than shutting down the economy and civil society and suspending our constitutional liberties is
[2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:25.720]  my friend well let's go to the call cornell no sarah's up next sarah in illinois and then cornell
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:32.440]  sarah welcome hi alec it's really great to talk to you um i uh actually have a message for uh
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:39.080]  governor pig face sorry chrisker of illinois um i'm a resident of champaign county and also for the
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:44.040]  record i'm a crippled blind woman i'm also asthmatic so prior to saturday i was content to stay home
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:48.920]  under my own volition however your order from marshal law violates your oath and is illegal
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:54.200]  and i do not obey illegal orders ever since you issued your edict i have knowingly and willfully
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:56:00.280]  violated your unlawful order on a daily basis in any and every way i'm able and i will continue to do
[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:05.320]  so governor when i finally do fall be it from virus or government another will take my place
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:09.720]  then another and then another for as long as it takes until this wrong is made right
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:16.120]  whether i live till the end of this chaos or not i will not under any circumstances relinquish my
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:21.880]  freedom and i would encourage everyone in illinois and across the country to peacefully but visibly
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:29.320]  resist this tyranny um alec also i'd like to say to you that bodies is awesome and uh for those of us

[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:47.960]  salinity takes over if they really start locking everybody down and arresting innocent people saying
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:52.440]  oh you don't have proof you were one of the store i'm gonna have to organize a big demonstration
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:57.080]  in front of city hall and get arrested because that's real marshal law how do they trump free
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:01.720]  speech when that's never been done in law i've got a lawsuit ready in case trump did declare an
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:06.280]  actual emergency as they said he was he didn't back down i don't think he was ever planning that
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:10.920]  now we might have been given some dis info uh but uh saro in your gut what do you think is
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:17.960]  going to happen i have an incredibly bad feeling about this and you know if we don't start resisting
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:23.240]  this now everybody who's cowering in their houses right now in all the states that have the the
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:28.280]  shelter in place orders you know what are you sheltering for what is worth protecting well
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:33.320]  that's it too many people are signaling that they want to bend over god bless you call me
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:38.200]  against saro we love you what a beautiful voice we're gonna come back and we're gonna have barns
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:48.360]  as take on how do we stand up against this stay with us france spain italy denmark sweden the
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:55.080]  list goes on and on they've all declared marshal law and said that if you leave your house without
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:02.440]  authorization you'll be put in jail for up to six months but they've been releasing by the tens of
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:10.040]  thousands per country the hardened criminals the rapists and murderers and cartes and home invaders
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:16.840]  and it's the same thing in democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well tens of thousands released
[2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:22.760]  and now governor newson says he made declare marshal law and has already ordered 40 million people
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:30.040]  in california to stay in their houses or six months in jail but publicly stated illegal aliens
[2:58:30.040 --> 2:58:37.240]  islamic invaders so-called migrants and of course the homeless are all exempt i'm not getting
[2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:42.360]  look it up welcome to slavery they think they own you and now they're about to show you
[2:58:42.360 --> 2:58:51.000]  you have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream
[2:58:51.000 --> 2:58:56.520]  establishment media news sites to find it i did extensive searches online with different search
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:59:03.320]  engines i i did a bunch of research looking at different tv archives and i couldn't find hardly
[2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:10.440]  anything except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc zinc
[2:59:10.440 --> 2:59:20.120]  the element on the periodic table that is essential to life and that is the most antiviral natural
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:26.360]  compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities
[2:59:26.360 --> 2:59:34.520]  including big studies on the coronavirus family so do yourself a favor search engine zinc and
[2:59:34.520 --> 2:59:42.920]  antiviral three words zinc antiviral zinc antiviral do yourself a favor zinc antiviral
[2:59:47.240 --> 2:59:50.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:52.440]  you
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:07.720]  uh robert barnes should have got him on more during the pandemic i get so distracted think of
[3:00:07.720 --> 3:00:11.400]  him just as legal stuff but his statistics his numbers are dead on we've got to have new more
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:15.400]  shows with us where you just get in studio and lay everything out maybe you'll get here before they
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:19.640]  lock everything down but i think we're gonna turn the corner in the next month on this i i agree i
[3:00:19.640 --> 3:00:24.280]  don't think the public's going to take marshal law uh while the leal aliens are still walk across the
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:29.880]  border uh but but but getting back to that point at an instinctive level i don't want to go have
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:35.320]  confrontations i don't want to get arrested but if the democrat sees on this in every city
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:40.760]  and he was shut down in dallas academy when it sells all the survival gear and is you know
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:46.120]  much more important than a walmart that's selling frozen pizzas uh academy ought to say okay we're
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:51.720]  selling food now you know uh this is just crazy that they could shut anything down media is
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:59.320]  protected under federal law so is our food warehouse we're covered uh but just the the hysteria
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:05.320]  of this and saying first amendment and and the right of the people to petition their government
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:10.760]  for redressing of grievances and to peacefully assemble that's been mixed and that's not in the
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:16.520]  constitution or in a ruling is it robert not at all in fact that one of the points that i made in
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:22.600]  the article i think was linked today on drudge was the fact that the founders were intimately
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:30.520]  familiar with pandemics and viruses and plagues and yet there is not one word in the constitution
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.560]  that says any of the bill of rights any of our protections any of our fundamental liberties
[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:41.560]  can ever be abridged in the name of public health in the name of a virus in the name of a pandemic
[3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:45.560]  in the name of a plague and those are people that were far more familiar with these things and
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:51.160]  experienced them at a worse level than we ever have uh so the that fact is we should not be
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:57.800]  quarantining the constitution of the united states from millions right now basically 167 million
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:04.200]  americans a little more than half the country currently has no constitutional protection
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:08.760]  under the first amendment second amendment fourth amendment fifth amendment sixth or seventh amendment
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:14.040]  in their respective jurisdictions as to core fundamental constitutional liberties they cannot
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:18.280]  petition their government in a public protest they cannot associate with one another for a
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:24.440]  political party in a public physical way they cannot join together for church and and they
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:28.840]  can't even have any kind of meeting more than 10 people in some places five and other places two
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:34.520]  and other places they cannot get a purchase a gun and half the country and half the states yesterday
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:39.640]  the pennsylvania supreme court said that was okay but three of the justices wisely dissented and
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:44.360]  said this is a clear second amendment violation so that's why what's happening is a clear constitutional
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:50.680]  violation there is an unfortunate history of courts turning a blind eye during pandemics
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:56.520]  to constitutional violations and that's why they're willing to test it and check its power
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:04.200]  now but that's why uh legal remedy has to occur if the president uh if the president pushes back
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:08.760]  and governors and mayors refuse to go along with the president's will then legal action will be
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:13.240]  coming uh will be well i mean i people reached out to me from across the country uh and we
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:17.880]  are putting together the legal research and legal basis for the legal plan norm patis suit they got
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:20.840]  ready when they're talking about banning interstate commerce we need to get our heads together there's
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:25.000]  an article on dredgerport dot com not just your great article but uh how you predicted weeks ago

[3:05:21.400 --> 3:05:29.560]  insanity america took the bait and now we're going down unless humanity awakens and understands the
[3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:34.760]  virus is man-made and understands that these restrictions overall are not being used to
[3:05:34.760 --> 3:05:41.000]  protect us from the virus but are being used to set the precedent for a giant controlled system
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:47.640]  and permanent martial law that will be used to overthrow trump and bring in pure global
[3:05:47.640 --> 3:06:06.200]  austerity this is the battle for the republic happening now live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show we've got our war room here our council of experts and

[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:52.360]  holding welcome hey what's up alex how you doing this is cornell from illinois you and robert barns

[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:05.160]  caller i am in the state of illinois can you please help us to expose this governor jb prister
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:13.320]  last week he was on the msnbc show the morning joe show and he stated in terms of what they knew
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:22.040]  about uh virus outbreak he said that we anticipated a virus outbreak from asia that's location
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:29.160]  specific number one what informational evidence did he have at that time that would allow him to
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:35.240]  state that too as an illinois in here he did nothing to help his citizens he didn't give
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:40.760]  any health tips there were no town halls there was no information no education put out to the
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:47.240]  small businesses here there was nothing done here to help save the lives that he's now pretending
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:52.760]  that he cares about i don't know if you know this or not but that he has been uh trump has been
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:58.440]  in a nasty political battle uh with uh some of the govern the governors and the mayors such as
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:06.200]  the blasio but this guy jb prister is just as bad as quomo and and the blasio he is evil well i
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:14.360]  agree with you and he also looks like a satanic version of bob's big boy uh look sorry sorry
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:20.280]  yeah look i can't keep track of all these guys i follow what he's doing it's all a big power grab
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:26.440]  and you know more about prisker than i do in illinois i just know that trump you know letting
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:30.680]  out the former governor is probably get a lot of dirt on all these people and and the reason they
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:36.840]  probably railroaded him what do you think about all this you're the expert of illinois cornell i i
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:42.680]  think that that he is part of some kind of cover-up i do think well listen it came out the cdc news
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:46.040]  is going on in november they hired a bunch of people they definitely didn't tell trump they
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:51.880]  brought the people in and fauci is bad news and and and it's coming to a head god bless you great
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:57.400]  points cornell all right john thanks for calling from maryland welcome to the air go ahead hey alex
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:05.560]  i was uh over at the frederick maryland cosco today noticed uh guy who's came up to the entry any
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:10.360]  he said hey i just got laid off you guys hiring and the guy cosco said yeah we're hiring like crazy
[3:12:10.920 --> 3:12:18.440]  and you wouldn't think that in the dc metro area uh frederick's about 30 miles north of of dc
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:24.520]  that that kind of stuff would be happening but you get west into the appalachia the western
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:29.000]  three counties of maryland it's probably already getting to the point where people are getting
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:36.440]  laid off like crazy frederick county is very much an agricultural and lou cauler county
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:43.640]  it's trump um area but what i have to say is people like bill maher ancy polosi chuck schumer
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:50.920]  lofner and others you know they may think that they're part of the club as um was said by um
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:55.480]  what's his name uh anyway but they're they're really not part of the club they're not the
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:13:02.840]  inner circle and if they think that antifa and others aren't going to start a french revolution
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:09.400]  if there's a complete collapse um then they're fools and as gerald solente says when people
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:15.400]  lose everything they lose it and they're going to lose it well gerald's coming up right now and
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:21.080]  you know trump's all over the news saying this is killing the economy do you really want this uh
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:25.160]  and and he's asking the public is do you really want to get into this fear do you really want to
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:30.200]  get on your knees and and and just believe all this stuff uh because you know it's going to kill
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:35.240]  some old people so's the flu so's so's everything else and and again we need to get ready we didn't
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:39.960]  know how bad it would be uh but i hear you john i appreciate your call wane in arizona you're on

[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:56.680]  this republic referencing the preamble to the u.s constitution preamble being the pre game
[3:14:56.680 --> 3:15:01.160]  showed before the three branches of government uh remember the three branches of government

[3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:57.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:14.440]  we are back live and i'm handing the baton to the great jeryl salente the trot trends forecaster
[3:20:14.440 --> 3:20:20.680]  here with us but he's been one of those saying that the cure is worse than disease trump put it
[3:20:20.680 --> 3:20:26.360]  out last night we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself at the end of the 15 day
[3:20:26.360 --> 3:20:31.480]  period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go he's saying you want a depression
[3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:39.080]  china's back to work so there you go jeryl salente takes over right now jeryl thanks for
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:44.440]  taking over my friend well thank you and thanks for all that you're doing to keep truth alive because
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:49.400]  it's really dying quick thanks for joining our war room here as you're part of the big round table
[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:54.680]  and so i'm going to be sitting back and listening thank you sir well thank you you know here we are
[3:20:56.920 --> 3:21:03.880]  in the in this crisis that as i see it the crisis that has been created by the global
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:11.880]  governments is much worse than the corona virus virus crisis i'm going to read to you this is
[3:21:11.880 --> 3:21:20.120]  from an article an associated press article it had to do about a week and a half ago when
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:26.840]  the mexican government wasn't closing down on everybody and there was still people out there
[3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:30.440]  for spring break and in the middle of the article they write this
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:41.080]  almost everyone recovers from the new virus which often causes only mild symptoms such as fever and
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:48.520]  cough but for some people particularly older adults and people with pre-existing health problems
[3:21:49.080 --> 3:21:58.520]  it can cause more serious illness such as pneumonia so all the dad is in there and people say to me
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:07.080]  well you know salente don't you care about all those people dying in italy okay i care about
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:15.560]  the people dying in italy how many died oh it's almost up to 4500 okay 4500 people died in italy
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:22.440]  it's concentrated in one area which they say is very high in pollution they also say that the
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:31.400]  fluid hit there earlier this year and who is dying well according to the data that's out
[3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:38.040]  about it's elderly people that have been chronically ill and that's depending on whose
[3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:45.480]  numbers you're looking at between 87 percent and 99 percent and that's from the italian health
[3:22:45.480 --> 3:22:54.280]  institute so they have this big thing going on about closing down the entire world and
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:23:04.440]  destroying the global economy when that not that many people are dying so here's the way i see it
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:15.080]  more people by the tens of millions are going to die from what the governments have done to
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:25.160]  to destroy the lives of people than the corona virus how are those people going to pay their rent
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:27.320]  how are they going to pay their bill

[3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:59.000]  we've all heard of the strike it's a socialist of communist tactic but sometimes populist
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:04.440]  movements have used the strike you can have labor strikes you can have people that also
[3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:11.480]  boycott and refuse to use a company or a service and many times when the people actually get together
[3:30:11.480 --> 3:30:17.480]  and move in mass with the strike it has a great effect and some good things have come out of it
[3:30:17.480 --> 3:30:27.640]  but now we are seeing a globalist corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times
[3:30:27.640 --> 3:30:34.040]  led by big tech over a month ago to then set the precedent to shut down small companies
[3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:40.120]  and businesses across the world but notice the big globalist corporations and the big box stores
[3:30:40.120 --> 3:30:46.520]  they are all exempt this is more than just martial law training this is the globalist
[3:30:46.520 --> 3:30:51.960]  trying to create a worldwide depression they can blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it
[3:30:51.960 --> 3:30:58.680]  there's a critical article on news wars dot com that links to press releases by the swedish government
[3:30:58.680 --> 3:31:05.240]  that all air traffic into the country is shut down except if you're in a asylum seeking plane
[3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:12.200]  funded by george soros landing from the middle east from north africa disgorging your payload
[3:31:12.200 --> 3:31:17.960]  and it's the same all over europe and bluetes cities in the united states where criminals illegal
[3:31:17.960 --> 3:31:25.720]  aliens all sorts of foreign invaders and the homeless are all exempt from the martial law
[3:31:25.720 --> 3:31:30.840]  that they've already implemented they just haven't publicly put that name on it yet except for the
[3:31:30.840 --> 3:31:37.160]  california tyrant nuesome he's come out and said he may declare it and that he catches you
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:42.440]  outside your house you're going to prison because if you're not a heart and criminal you are not

[3:32:18.840 --> 3:32:24.840]  to arrest and disappear americans whenever they want under the guise of corona virus but they
[3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:30.520]  just say during the emergency it'll be for every other crime you can imagine it's the
[3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:37.640]  chairing on top of a nice big fudge sunday called marshal law oh and the sprinkles on it

[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:13.720]  name the industry they're destroying the global economy and it was already in a slowdown before
[3:48:13.720 --> 3:48:20.920]  you know i had the the fax here one after another the reports were coming out about the slow down
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:29.720]  corporate debt yeah here we go this is from february 21st the organization for economic
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:35.720]  cooperation at 24th excuse me organization for economic cooperation and development oecd

[3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:52.120]  corporate debt and the dangers opposes for the world economy in the event of an unexpected rise
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:49:01.080]  in interest rates or a recession again this is before this all happened recession interest
[3:49:01.080 --> 3:49:09.880]  rates are in down to nothing we're in a depression debt hey how about that shale market huh again
[3:49:09.880 --> 3:49:14.520]  is all this is in detail in your trends journal that we've been writing about this on and on and
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:21.160]  on before this happened as you will know that i announced on david night show a year ago that
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:27.000]  we were going into the greatest depression i said it wouldn't happen until 2021 i also said we'd
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:34.520]  have near zero negative interest rates by november excuse me october of this year and now we have
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:41.320]  them already because it was escalated by the coronavirus the point that i'm making it was
[3:49:41.320 --> 3:49:49.160]  underway already and now they've made a terrible situation into a disaster so where is there going
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:54.200]  to be growth and where is there going to be decline i do not give financial advice but i want to tell
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:59.880]  info wars listeners some of the things we tell our subscribers to the trends journal and it's a
[3:49:59.880 --> 3:50:07.000]  weekly now we've gone from a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly because events are changing so rapidly
[3:50:08.600 --> 3:50:16.680]  for those who play the market think about shorting a number of industries think of all the stores
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:22.120]  that are closed down from the home goods the tj max on and on think of all the places that are
[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:30.360]  closed down what are they going to do with all of the stock in those places they're over stock
[3:50:31.800 --> 3:50:37.960]  now think of all the production that's backlogged as all the stuff has been made that hasn't been
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:56.920]  shipped out what are they going to do to all these products automobiles art vintage cars
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:51:07.640]  all the prices antiques down down southerby's see you later
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:17.960]  real estate way down by the way you know it's happening up where we are we're about
[3:51:18.680 --> 3:51:25.080]  there it is seen great recent yeah recession right that's how sharp the toilet paper is thanks
[3:51:25.080 --> 3:51:33.000]  for putting that up the people leaving the city i had a on the phone call last night with someone
[3:51:33.800 --> 3:51:43.320]  extremely in the higher echelons of the income bracket and of course they have places in new
[3:51:43.320 --> 3:51:51.400]  york city but also outside the city and he said to me would you go down the city what's going on
[3:51:51.400 --> 3:52:00.040]  now this infectious virus i said man i said i'd boogie down broadway but here's the deal
[3:52:00.760 --> 3:52:05.880]  people are exiting you're afraid to be living in these densely populated areas
[3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:11.960]  so you're going to see a flattening out rather than a steep decline in some areas
[3:52:13.080 --> 3:52:17.160]  in kingston new york maybe one of those where it's flattening out because this thing was booming
[3:52:17.160 --> 3:52:21.320]  because people were already leaving the city to come up here we're 90 miles north of new york
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:28.280]  in the most beautiful area around so people are afraid of the cities so you're going to see real
[3:52:28.280 --> 3:52:37.800]  estate really start collapsing i forecast in metropolitan areas densely populated around
[3:52:37.800 --> 3:52:45.640]  the world where the prices escalated really quick from vancouver to berlin from serif and
[3:52:45.640 --> 3:52:54.440]  cisco to boston oh boston here's another trend you know them college towns adios
[3:52:57.320 --> 3:53:04.200]  those college towns are going to go down the crapper closing down all the schools how those
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:12.600]  businesses that used to thrive and survive from college towns are going to make it they're not
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:18.680]  and i have to tell you i cry sometimes throughout the day thinking about what's happening to people
[3:53:19.400 --> 3:53:25.400]  and talking to people and seeing how hard this is hitting them people haven't realized most people
[3:53:25.400 --> 3:53:29.320]  how bad this is going to be shock hasn't even set in yet
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:41.400]  the other things to start looking at what stocks are going to go up i will tell you one that i
[3:53:41.400 --> 3:53:49.160]  would suggest you consider looking at in my book trends 2000 that came out 1996
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:57.720]  one of my trends was interactive you meaning university and how ridiculous the education
[3:53:57.720 --> 3:54:04.440]  system we have now that's invented from the germans following in the beginning of the industrial
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:11.720]  revolution when they people were no longer making their own products and things and they
[3:54:13.400 --> 3:54:23.080]  put them in centralized locations and taught them how to read write do math and follow orders
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:30.120]  that system stinks it's dead as you can see how terrible our education system is we don't even win
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:38.120]  places show in most of the world's ratings interactive university has begun it's a whole
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:43.560]  new world and again i'm not telling you what to do the motto of the trends journal is think for
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:51.640]  yourself and by the way as this whole everything i'm saying alex jones is saying anyone else is
[3:54:51.640 --> 3:55:00.360]  saying think for yourself look for the facts and the thinking for yourself is why i want to say to you
[3:55:01.640 --> 3:55:11.320]  consider if you're an investor or a gambler at the asian markets where they've already
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:18.360]  have in place interactive education because those companies are going to boom
[3:55:18.360 --> 3:55:25.800]  boom people are going to be afraid to send their kids to school the panic is on
[3:55:27.320 --> 3:55:31.880]  so these are the kind of things that are going to go up and again those college towns they're
[3:55:31.880 --> 3:55:39.160]  going to go down down down and all the small entrepreneurs are going to go down with them
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:46.840]  as i said quomo gave himself the right to be dictator of new york state about two weeks ago i
[3:55:46.840 --> 3:55:54.440]  did it in a trends in the news broadcast when he slipped in his piece of legislation that
[3:55:54.440 --> 3:56:00.520]  gave him full authority and boy he's playing god and the people are swallowing it guess what
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:08.120]  this guy's going to go down the crapper man quomo down the crapper as people go bankrupt
[3:56:08.120 --> 3:56:20.360]  as businesses fail as people can't pay wages or earn wages and they're out on the street
[3:56:20.360 --> 3:56:26.680]  oh and why are gun sales going up because the smart money knows the smart people know
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:33.160]  we're going to see a crime wave like we've never experienced in our lifetime and here's the other
[3:56:33.160 --> 3:56:40.600]  part of it when eventually things do open up again watch for a lot of theft going on as well
[3:56:42.360 --> 3:56:51.080]  a big story coming out in your trends journal tomorrow you ready we're going from quote dirty
[3:56:51.080 --> 3:56:59.000]  cash because that's what they're calling it to digital trash yeah they're going to steal every
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:06.760]  dime we have so they know every penny that you spent so they could get there they're cut of it
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:12.520]  because every penny that you spent is now going to be digitally monitored by
[3:57:14.600 --> 3:57:17.400]  the new dictators running the world
[3:57:20.520 --> 3:57:26.360]  this is a time to fight for freedom and that's what i'm going to do and that's what info wars
[3:57:26.360 --> 3:57:35.080]  does because if we don't fight for freedom we're going to die in a new concentration camps of hell
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:56.440]  call lockdowns this is gerald salenti see you next week
