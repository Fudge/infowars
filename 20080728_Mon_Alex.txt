[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:33.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  Welcome, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:41.000 --> 00:51.000]  We're going to be live for the next four hours on this live Monday edition, the 28th day of July, 2008.
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  We've got Dr. Stan Monteith popping in in one hour for 30 minutes to talk about the amazing interview he did with Lindsay Williams,
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  who worked in the oil fields and has really leaked a lot of key information that turned out to be very accurate about the oil companies.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  And we're also lining up, Lindsay Williams will probably be on today, if not today, tomorrow.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  But I wanted to get Dr. Stan Monteith concerning the report he broke last week with Williams,
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  who's been death-threaded and claims that he is going to soon suspend doing interviews.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  We're going to see if we can get him on before he does that.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  I don't know why you would quit doing radio interviews and shut down your website, which he's done, over death threats.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  I don't understand it.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  I mean, I get death threats all the time.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  I've had all sorts of things go on that just, you know, people calling up my wife saying,
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  the little dogs in the backyard, you're in a little white house, I'm watching you right now, you went to the store today,
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  you effing bitch, I'm going to cut your throat.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  I mean, you know, that's the kind of things that have happened over the years.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  And my wife never backed down.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  In fact, she was getting death threats when she was my girlfriend.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  And because she instinctively realizes this stuff doesn't go away if you give in to threats.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  It doesn't go away. You have to go in through and beyond the New World Order.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  You have to fully commit to it.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  I'm not knocking Lindsey Williams, we're supporting.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  Just this intimidation business, once they figured out that I wasn't going to back down after I'd physically been attacked by four hired thugs
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  after all sorts of other things that happened.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  Once that had taken place, the enemy realized I am never shutting up.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  They can kill me today. I will never shut up. I will never back down.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  I will never surrender.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  For a lot of people out there who haven't been tested by the fire yet, you know, they still question, oh, is there a New World Order,
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  despite the fact that Barack Obama was calling for it from Berlin last week.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  A lot of you are still in denial despite the fact everything we've talked about is real.
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  Let me tell you, when you get visits from the FBI, when you get visits from the Secret Service,
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  when you get all sorts of other things happening to you over the years,
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  or when you pull up in a parking lot and special forces guys jump out and run over and threaten you to your face,
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  oh yeah, that happened to me nine years ago.
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  When things like that happen and when they let you know that they'll kill you whenever they want,
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  then you realize just how real this is.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  This is as real as it gets, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  The New World Order is attacking every single one of you right now financially.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  They're destroying our treasury. They are annihilating our currency.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  They have debased our industrial capacity down to almost nothing.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  One in 40 homes is in foreclosure.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  Ford and General Motors are preparing to collapse according to Bloomberg and other major publications.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  The New World Order has engineered all of this, as we told you they would,
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  when we got the IMF and World Bank documents that were leaked in 2002.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  They are raping you.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  I told you three months ago that oil would peak out at $145 a barrel.
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  It did exactly that. In fact, it went up to $149 and that it would then drop down to about $120 a barrel
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  until next summer when it will go to $200 a barrel.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  They do this each year. They run it up and then when it drops,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  first they run it up to $2 a gallon.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  Then you get mad three summers ago and they drop it back down to $1.75 and they run it up to $250.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  Then they drop it back down to $2 and they run it up to $3 and they drop it down to $250.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  Then they run it up to $350 and they drop it down to $275 and they run it up to $450 a gallon.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Then they drop it down to $390.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  Pavlovian psychological conditioning, they're training you.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  We know the ball game. We know the enemy's playbook.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're here telling you exactly what's going on.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  We've proven it. We've got the inside scoop.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  This is the place to be. We'll be right back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  Gas prices are out of control.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones show have done.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  Introducing SFRs protect a complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  One bottle increases mileage for up to six months. Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  Protecta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tank full and is safe for all cars.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.000]  Test conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[05:38.000 --> 05:46.000]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a protecta fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.

[06:00.000 --> 06:10.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[06:15.000 --> 06:26.000]  For thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[06:26.000 --> 06:34.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[07:00.000 --> 07:09.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[07:15.000 --> 07:25.000]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:07.000 --> 08:19.000]  I want to open the phones up in at this first hour at 1-800-259-9231. We want to discuss the impeachment hearings of last Friday that turned out better than we thought.
[08:19.000 --> 08:29.000]  The chairman and Mr. Conyers and of course Mr. Smith tried to frustrate things as best they could.
[08:29.000 --> 08:45.000]  Want to discuss all the new economic developments that are unfolding for the fact that the Miami Herald reported that bin Laden's bodyguard right hand man was picked up by special forces and then ordered release by the Pentagon.
[08:45.000 --> 08:55.000]  Just one of thousands of CIA operatives working under al-Qaeda cover that accidentally have been picked up and released more than 6,000 according to the Times of London.
[08:55.000 --> 09:05.000]  I mean all of this major news unfolding. I'm getting a lot of emails. In fact, I'm getting hundreds of day phone calls, people showing up at the office and that's fine and dandy.
[09:05.000 --> 09:19.000]  Saying, are you going to have some type of anti-war, anti-attack on Iran event, 9-11 truth event for the first responders?
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  And I am not going to give you the answer to that until Wednesday at noon. And Wednesday at noon I will give you the answer to that.
[09:27.000 --> 09:39.000]  Okay? I mean I know the answer now. But Wednesday I will, I want to fully nail some things down and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[09:39.000 --> 09:54.000]  I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag as they say because I want to be doubly, triply quadruple sure of some of the things that we're going to be discussing here on air.
[09:54.000 --> 10:06.000]  And I will let you know if it's going to be happening, give you some ballpark about when it's going to be happening Wednesday if it is going to indeed happen with Willie Nelson.
[10:06.000 --> 10:23.000]  How did this start? I had wanted to get Willie Nelson on last week to help with media attention to try to create more interest out there in the grassroots
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  to put pressure on the mainstream media to report on the impeachment hearing coming up Friday that indeed did happen.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  I think the listeners out there helped by calling Conyers office and others on the Hill and the Judiciary Committee and pressuring them.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  And I called Willie up, meant to have him on Thursday and he said, no, let's just do it Wednesday. So he came on the day I called him, you heard it for an hour.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  And then a caller called in and said, why don't you have some type of 911 treat slash antiwar rally?
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  Willie said, I do that in a minute. So I talked to him privately the next day and then the day after that.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  And Saturday I got my answer. I'll just leave it at that from Willie.
[11:05.000 --> 11:19.000]  And so now there's just so much involved with it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:27.000]  I will let you know what's going on Wednesday here on the radio show.
[11:27.000 --> 11:36.000]  But well, I'm not going to let the cattle bag. We will. We will talk about it on Wednesday here.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  Anthony Hilder joins us in an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  Of course, so we're going to have Dr. Stan Monteith popping in to give us a scoop.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  He's the guy that broke the big Lindsey Williams story about him being threatened and told to shut up and what Lindsey Williams is saying.
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  And what Lindsey's always been accurate in the past. He's been saying the same thing for 20 years and it all came true.
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.000]  And now he's really thrown us a curveball, not just with the threats he's reportedly gotten and the fact that he's saying he's not going to do any more radio interviews.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  We've got his home number and his cell phone. I kind of have blind spots.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  I didn't think to get him on late last week because everybody was calling me because I had my mind on so many other issues.
[12:15.000 --> 12:25.000]  But we're trying to get a hold of him this morning and he may be on today or tomorrow. Lord Wellin, because he has been doing a few radio interviews and we'll get his take on things.
[12:25.000 --> 12:42.000]  For those that don't know who he is, Lindsey Williams was a oil field chaplain and the CEO of Atlantic Richfield had dinner with him a few times and got to know him and saw the work he was doing in the oil fields.
[12:42.000 --> 12:57.000]  He was a Baptist preacher and hired him to be Atlantic Richfield's chaplain and to sit in on all the meetings and to pray before the meetings and that's kind of the old fashioned way most companies did things.
[12:57.000 --> 13:07.000]  This is back in the 70s and they discovered, of course, oil fields with more oil than some of the biggest fields in Saudi Arabia.
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  And they were so excited and then literally aircraft helicopters landed. Other executives showed up and they told them this is going to be secret.
[13:17.000 --> 13:30.000]  All of you are sworn to secrecy and there have been a lot of other events like that. They found oil fields that rival Saudi Arabia or may even be bigger in the Gulf of Mexico that the United States cannot have access to.
[13:30.000 --> 13:44.000]  Large sections of those were given in 2001 by George Bush, one of his first major acts to Mexico. He just seeded territorial waters through executive order to Mexico, thousands of square miles.
[13:44.000 --> 14:05.000]  China is drilling in many of these waters. It's incredible. It's absolutely incredible. The oil companies are trying to have a world monopoly and in trying to, with government, they can do this because Mexico owns most of the land the government does.
[14:05.000 --> 14:17.000]  And that means the private families that control the government control it, known it through fiat. That means our government controls what is it, 87%?
[14:17.000 --> 14:31.000]  Last time I checked in Alaska, the state has most of the rest. What is it? Like 3 or 4% of Nevada is private. 10% of Utah is private.
[14:31.000 --> 14:50.000]  And I know it's right around 4% of, you can debate where the lines are drawn. Alaska is private. And it just so happens, these are the major treasure troves of oil and clean burning coal and uranium and gold and silver and bauxite and aluminum.
[14:50.000 --> 15:08.000]  And I mentioned diamonds. Back in the late 80s, they found a huge diamond field. What was it? More than 20,000 acres in Arkansas.
[15:08.000 --> 15:23.000]  And the DeBool family, not DeBeers, DeBool, a South African French family, swooped in. The reason I know about it is my dad was friends with some of them, went to college and knew them and then knew them in business.
[15:23.000 --> 15:34.000]  Some of the brothers, I remember hearing about this at the dinner table before it was ever on the news because they lived in Dallas and that they had gone in and bought up all these tracks of land from the landowners.
[15:34.000 --> 15:45.000]  And then the environmentalists were sick on them to stop the mining of the diamonds, very clean type of mining. This is just where they just go in and get the ore and extract the diamonds.
[15:45.000 --> 16:00.000]  It's not like gold or silver mining, especially gold mining, where they do put the ore into these giant lakes of cyanide filled water that etches away and eats away all the rock and then leaves the gold ready for separation.
[16:00.000 --> 16:15.000]  Oh no, those are all fine and dandy, very toxic, very dangerous, very deadly to the water table. No, no, no, this is just going right in directly and just sending miners in into deep mines to remove the diamonds.
[16:15.000 --> 16:31.000]  And they said, no, you, you can't have the diamonds. And so from the late 80s until the mid 90s, there were lawsuits involved. And finally, the bull brothers.
[16:31.000 --> 16:40.000]  I forget, was it? I can have my dad in here as a guest.
[16:40.000 --> 16:53.000]  I forget the bull brothers first names. I forget which one predominantly ran that operation and own that. But the point is, is that I remember they got paid three and a half billion dollars to the US government.
[16:53.000 --> 17:06.000]  They said, okay, you got to buy this then as Parkland and Bill Clinton, I think it was 96 or 97 paid them more than $3 billion to walk away. So those diamonds would sit there.
[17:06.000 --> 17:21.000]  And of course, later, there was a article in, I believe it was April of 2000 bragging about it in the New Yorker magazine admitting that the Oppenheimers through the beers, it's just one of the names of one of the mines in South Africa.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  They chose that name under Cecil Rhodes.
[17:27.000 --> 17:37.000]  That then, of course, lets them continue their monopoly, which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profits. And Diamond Empire, we had the British lady on, she's married to a Lord.
[17:37.000 --> 17:51.000]  She's a royal. We had her on a few years ago. I need to get her back on. She made the film Diamond Empire, which I remember when I was in high school, my dad had us all come in the night at air.
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  And we ate dinner in front of the television set, something we normally didn't do because he knew a little bit about diamond businesses from the sidelines in Dallas.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  And he was like, I can't believe they're going to air this. This is the big secret.
[18:00.000 --> 18:25.000]  And I remember watching Diamond Empire, where, what she produced, where they allowed her in to the big warehouses in France and in the Netherlands and in England, huge warehouses full of giant chests of diamonds where they stockpile them because there's too many of them.
[18:25.000 --> 18:40.000]  It is a semi precious stone. You have the ultra precious precious. There's a scale down into semi precious and then you have your stones that are considered like quartz and things just to not even be precious.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  Diamonds are in the middle of the semi precious chain.
[18:45.000 --> 18:56.000]  So you've got this top down gauge of the ultra precious down to the non precious stones and diamonds are in the middle of the entire spectrum.
[18:56.000 --> 19:05.000]  They are at the middle of semi precious right along with things like agates.
[19:05.000 --> 19:15.000]  You can go to the Great Lakes and walk along the beach there and it's just agates everywhere, just piles of these beautiful rocks, but they're not precious.
[19:15.000 --> 19:26.000]  They're semi precious when you've put time into them, cutting them and polishing them. They're essentially worthless unless they've been cut and polished.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  So it's not even worth it to put the time into them.
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  Well, it's the same thing with oil. It's just everywhere. It's everywhere. We're swimming in it.
[19:36.000 --> 19:49.000]  But through global government, through international agreements between countries, they are able to monopolize it to a certain extent and create an oligopoly, a cartel.
[19:49.000 --> 19:57.000]  And that's a fact. I mean, OPEC is a cartel, but OPEC is only one sector of it with Latin America and the Middle East and Central Asia.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000]  It interlinks with the British Anglo-American system.
[20:02.000 --> 20:10.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[20:10.000 --> 20:21.000]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[20:21.000 --> 20:29.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us. I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've been robbed.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  How so, Clyde?
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet. Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your card is still in your purse. Just watch.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  Nope. With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune. As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.

[24:21.000 --> 24:40.000]  Your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[24:51.000 --> 25:19.000]  U.S. headed for hyphened alert stage, exclusive major events on the horizon prompt a surge in anti-terror efforts.
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  Government officials have been quietly stepping up counter-terror efforts out of a growing concern that Al Qaeda,
[25:28.000 --> 25:37.000]  our similar organizations might try to capitalize on the spat of extremely high profile events in the coming months.
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  Sources tell ABC News and they say because of the election and because of the heightened tensions with Iran and a possible strike by Israel or the U.S. or both.
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  And because of what's happening with the economy that Al Caeda, I mean remember when you watch the newscast we have a link to on this,
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  it's the head of the FBI who clearly, the FBI at the highest levels is fully involved in the attacks of 9-11.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  Remember this is the terrorist telling you look out terrorists are going to get you.
[26:06.000 --> 26:15.000]  And we got different White House memos and other Republican memos from the 2004 election where they admitted they fearmongered for political gain.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  And you're going to see the same thing with the Democrats if they get into office.
[26:18.000 --> 26:28.000]  You're going to see all of the new mechanisms of the Patriot Act and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and the killing of Posse Commentatus and the warrantless wiretapping.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's going to be their bag of tricks.
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  That's why they don't want to rock the boat, why they don't want to have impeachment because they like having all this power.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  They want to be able to have all of this control.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  And we are headed into one of the most dangerous and most interesting times for that matter in modern history.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  I mean all of the things that are happening.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  The economy is just steadily going downhill as all of you know.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  They are ramping up to attack Iran.
[26:56.000 --> 27:10.000]  There are all sorts of military drills and operations going on and different tattletail units of truck drivers and school teachers, postal workers, firemen, police being federalized.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  Students in high school and junior high being trained to be spies.
[27:15.000 --> 27:25.000]  All the things we told you about a decade ago are now becoming mainstream news as they introduce it to you and national ID cards being tied into global ID card systems.
[27:25.000 --> 27:34.000]  It's all manifesting and there's a backdrop here of people who are still in denial.
[27:34.000 --> 27:51.000]  Friday we posted a story on info wars.com, prisonplanet.com that simply had links to several mainstream news articles and a YouTube clip of witnesses to the congressman's speech.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  Where a particular congressman, it's up there if you want to go read it, was asked a few months ago, why aren't you impeaching Bush?
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  You're a big liberal, don't you want the police, the political hay this will make?
[28:01.000 --> 28:11.000]  And he said, look, if we do that, he will attack Iran and maybe declare martial law and then newspapers reported on it.
[28:11.000 --> 28:20.000]  But now that particular congressman is trying to backtrack and then people get mad at us in the comment section of the news stories on the website saying that we're exaggerating.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  There's no exaggerating here.
[28:23.000 --> 28:38.000]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that the president is basically a dictator over the governors, over the national guard and the state guard, and they're training state police for federalization and local communities for federalization everywhere.
[28:38.000 --> 28:58.000]  And the Marines of the Army for 20 years have been having urban warfare drills in major cities with the express reason of acclimating the Marines, the Army, the local constabulary, the population, the media, preparing the ground for the public to accept military on the streets of the United States.
[28:58.000 --> 29:11.000]  And then we told you there'd be a big terror attack leading up in 2001 to the attacks. We said they would then put troops in major cities on the streets in the name of fighting terror, that they would then convert that to, quote, fighting crime.
[29:11.000 --> 29:21.000]  And now we're hearing that they want to use national guard in Illinois and in Florida and in other areas of the country to, quote, fight crime.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  NBC News, Chicago Tribune, other outlets are reporting this but saying it's a good thing.
[29:27.000 --> 29:38.000]  So it's happening and it's time for people to stop being in denial about this. Everything we broke down is happening exactly as we said it would.
[29:38.000 --> 29:50.000]  This is slow motion red dawn and denial will ensure their victory. It's time to face the facts. We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[29:50.000 --> 29:58.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:00.000 --> 33:23.000]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm, four hours of the hardest hitting radio on the planet. The most important and informed guest and wide spectrum of issues.
[33:23.000 --> 33:37.000]  We break down the geopolitical system as we scan the entire planetary political landscape. You have found it ladies and gentlemen, tip of the spear,
[33:37.000 --> 34:02.000]  front lines in the info war as we wage war on corruption, as we crash through the lies and disinformation. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Don't forget we have the auxiliary websites that have a lot of different news than infowarsandprisonplanet.com, on the truthnews.usjonesreport.com, infowars.net, and of course, prisonplanet.tv.
[34:02.000 --> 34:14.000]  Okay, I know we've got loaded phones. I want to go to Bruce, honey, Tommy, John, Jimmy, and others here in just a few minutes, but continuing with what I was getting into in the last segment.
[34:14.000 --> 34:37.000]  The gear up for martial law, Daily Cause is a gigantic kind of mainline progressive website. And they've done a lot of hit pieces on infowars.com. They have attacked us many times. We have not attacked them back because we are not into infighting here, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:37.000 --> 35:04.000]  We're just sad that they've been so childish over there. So there is so much going on. And all we attempt to do is to get these people to think for themselves. All we attempt to do is try to get the controlled right and the controlled left who predominantly are made up of good people.
[35:04.000 --> 35:18.000]  The average conservative that says nuke Iran, turn them into a parking lot, really thinks Iran carried out 9-11, really thinks that they're going to launch nukes on Israel, really believes things and is scared. They're not bad people, most of them.
[35:18.000 --> 35:35.000]  And they're controlled and manipulated by very cynical psychological warfare experts that run the big think tanks that advise the new world order system and the controlled corporate media that themselves are owned by the big defense contractors.
[35:35.000 --> 35:46.000]  And the left means well, but I have to be honest with you. I'm very proud of what we would call the traditional left in the United States right now.
[35:46.000 --> 35:57.000]  You've got a lot of blue collar and well meaning hardworking people that aren't very sophisticated who love Barack Obama because they want to show they're not racist white America. They have this guilt complex.
[35:57.000 --> 36:05.000]  They think that he's going to bring back a good economy. They think Bill Clinton was the reason we had a better economy in the 90s than we have today.
[36:05.000 --> 36:21.000]  No, it's because the globalists are a different phase right now. The free money system, the liquidity that was issued in the 90s is why we're now seeing the dollar implode. This was all by design. It's part of a cycle.
[36:21.000 --> 36:37.000]  But regardless, the left is the intelligency of the left of the main line white collar left. The left I know that are in entertainment and in media that are in business.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  They are starting to wake up to Barack Obama.
[36:41.000 --> 36:54.000]  To the fact that I mean conservatives when Bush did things that were unconservative like triple the size of government open the borders, triple the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
[36:54.000 --> 37:05.000]  They just said, well, when Bush was for the assault weapons ban, they came out and said, okay, well, we're for banning assault weapons.
[37:05.000 --> 37:22.000]  They really drank the Kool-Aid. But I have to say that, you know, back when I was trying to wake the left of the Bill Clinton, that he was a puppet and pushing globalist agenda and that attacking Serbia was wrong and a CIA operation with Al Qaeda and was covering Senate reports, put up a Republicans on the issue.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  They wouldn't wake up and wouldn't face it, most of them. But now they are waking up.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  Now they're realizing the left right paradigm is a control system where they play different groups off against each other.
[37:38.000 --> 37:50.000]  And so that's exciting. And the people I know that you would call leftists, artists, media directors, people like that, they are now going out buying firearms.
[37:50.000 --> 38:06.000]  They are going out. They are realizing that big government is there to tax them and give it to corporations and that welfare is there to get people institutionalized and in the system and to basically train people to not be independent.
[38:06.000 --> 38:31.000]  They are really waking up and becoming freedom-oriented individuals, people who are more libertarian. And I'm really seeing that and I'm really seeing the left end their mindless leftist activities and really have an awakening that I've been seeing going on for five, six years, but really starting to explode right now.
[38:31.000 --> 38:41.000]  And so I commend you. And conversely, there have been a massive amount of mainline Republicans that have woken up to George Bush and I commend them as well.
[38:41.000 --> 38:56.000]  But that awakening is still not as seismic as what we've seen in the left. And there is a huge article by Taka Q. DeVille on daily costs.
[38:56.000 --> 39:07.000]  We have it posted up on infowars.com, history. How the U.S. government was overthrown in three easy steps. And they give the Rockefeller quotes, the Curl quickly documents, the CFR statements.
[39:07.000 --> 39:18.000]  They say there's a global government. It controls the left and the right. They fully own and run both parties. They control the left through foundation money. It is all staged.
[39:18.000 --> 39:29.000]  Now, I would read this entire article on there today if I had time. In fact, I'll probably try to do it this week. It's like 10 pages long. It's a gigantic treatise for cost standards.
[39:29.000 --> 39:43.000]  And it is definitive and I couldn't say it better myself and I salute you. I salute you. And we're now seeing the London Guardian come out and say 9-11 was probably an inside job.
[39:43.000 --> 39:57.000]  I salute you. See, people have to be ready to win. People keep getting upset that we're having huge celebrities come out and former presidents come out and former senators come out and defense ministers.
[39:57.000 --> 40:10.000]  And saying, well, wait a minute, people are listening to us. This must be a government setup. People are waking up. We're not supposed to have a fighting chance. We're not supposed to win. We're supposed to lose.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we're born to win. If you've got the dedication, the facts on your side, if you're fearless, then you've got a good chance of winning.
[40:20.000 --> 40:29.000]  If you've got the motivation and the dedication, if you don't give up, and if you keep hitting the enemy in the Info War every waking moment, we can turn this around.
[40:29.000 --> 40:44.000]  The alternative is total enslavement and worldwide eugenics program. Now, I said I was going to go to your calls. It's just I've got to play these short clips here because at the bottom of this daily cost article that's up on infowars.com right now, history, how the U.S.
[40:44.000 --> 40:59.000]  government was overthrown in three easy steps. And I want to get this talk acute of ill on. I'm seeing more and more of this because most people aren't government agents in media.
[40:59.000 --> 41:13.000]  Most people aren't operatives on the government payroll. They're more fellow travelers. They've bought into the false political template or hologram that's been downloaded into their minds throughout their lives and by the peer pressure.
[41:13.000 --> 41:23.000]  That that reinforces their world view and it's shattering right now.
[41:23.000 --> 41:40.000]  So we have to be ready to win. We have to be ready to arrest the leaders of the House and the Senate and the executive and give them fair and impartial trials and then send them to prison for the rest of their lives.
[41:40.000 --> 41:48.000]  I don't think we should get into the business of executing people for treason because it can turn into a French Revolution style system.
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.000]  Even though they deserve and many people after they've had a trial by their jury or their peers to be executed.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  And, you know, we've talked about that. I had more and more. I think about it and studying history that really shouldn't be done.
[41:59.000 --> 42:20.000]  They should be exiled to islands as was done in the past. Just too dangerous of a precedent. But I do think they should be thoroughly exposed and imprisoned.
[42:20.000 --> 42:29.000]  So I mean, all I can tell you is that we're having big victories and we need to appreciate the victories we've had and telegraph that to everybody else, the fact that we can win this.
[42:29.000 --> 42:37.000]  So just an incredible article, history, how the government was overthrown in three easy steps. It is one of the best short pieces.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  You know, there's books that do it much better. But one of the best short pieces I've ever seen.
[42:44.000 --> 42:53.000]  And that's the fact that I've been attacked mercilessly by daily cause. I turn the other cheek. And I say to them, good, I'm glad you joined the team.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  I'm glad you saw the light. I'm glad you got knocked off your horse on the road to Damascus. And that's going to happen to more people.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  I mean, as the evil grows, you're going to be tested. You're going to be forced to make a decision and not sit on the fence.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  Liberals, conservatives, all of you. You're going to have to make a decision and decide who you stand with.
[43:10.000 --> 43:20.000]  You're gut. You know we're telling the truth. You can trust but verify. You can go check everything we're covering and find out it's true.
[43:20.000 --> 43:29.000]  And the people are finding out that Israel attacked the USS Liberty in collusion with the White House to try to sink it and start World War III with Egypt and then the Russians.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  By the grace of God, those men kept that ship afloat. The people are now finding out the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  The people are now finding out that our criminal government has staged more than 200 terror attacks that are declassified.
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  Game over. You know, why even debate 9-11? Why even say it's an inside job?
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  Why not even don't start there with people? You start with all the admissions.
[43:51.000 --> 44:03.000]  It's like if I was a prosecutor and I was going before a grand jury and we had some murderer who'd been given
[44:03.000 --> 44:09.000]  life in prison and then for some reason on the technicality his sentence was overturned and he's released.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  And then a bunch of people get killed in the neighborhood where he lives the same way.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  The first person I'm going to go grab is that individual that has this M.O., modus operandi,
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  and then I'm going to drag his butt in there before that grand jury with the evidence.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  See, he's done it before, over and over and over again. These creatures have done this over and over again.
[44:29.000 --> 44:40.000]  Debate's over. You understand that? It's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  So I wanted to play this clip. It's at the end of the Daily Cost article.
[44:45.000 --> 44:55.000]  It's called The Ruling Class in America. It's like children. It's from a good film I've seen.
[44:55.000 --> 45:03.000]  But it's a very childlike question. This is from the American Ruling Class film.
[45:03.000 --> 45:11.000]  And this is an excerpt from the publisher of Harper's and Texaco Air Lewis Lappin's movie, The American Ruling Class.
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  And he's ruling class, so they let him in there to interview him.
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  The ruling class is so able to manipulate our democracy that they really control democracy, I feel.
[45:21.000 --> 45:30.000]  But the point here is that it's so childlike that they train the American people in the last 50 years
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  that there's no ruling elite and there's no special interest.
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  I mean, that's like three months ago when they asked the White House Press Secretary.
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.000]  They asked her, they said, we hear gas prices are up because the dollar's been devalued.
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  Is the dollar been devalued? And they could go look at the foreign currency exchange index and know in two seconds.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  But instead, they all, like children, were saying for five minutes, is it true? Is it true?
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  And she said, I can't tell you that. I'll be fired if I do.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  What does that mean?
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  That means the White House is completely melting down and breaking down the stories we hear about Bush
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  not even reading newspapers or not even knowing what's going on.
[46:07.000 --> 46:16.000]  It's true if his own press secretaries are basically betraying him on TV.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then we have a childlike American people who have to ask, is it true the dollar's devalued?
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  Is it true? They don't know how to go look up the currency indexes.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  We've been trying to discover if in fact there is an American ruling class.
[46:35.000 --> 46:42.000]  I'm afraid there is. I don't think it served the democracy well if that's true.
[46:42.000 --> 46:55.000]  But I think there is. The ruling class is the rich who really command our industry, our commerce, our finance.
[46:55.000 --> 47:08.000]  And those people are able to so manipulate our democracy that they really control democracy. I feel.
[47:08.000 --> 47:22.000]  Okay, now let me, for those of you in denial about the police state in this country, all the urban warfare drills,
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.000]  the military admitting their training for martial law in the United States.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  The fact that they try to ban protest all across the nation, that is martial law.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  All the things that are happening, warrantless wiretapping, that's martial law. When the government does what's illegal,
[47:38.000 --> 47:46.000]  what's against the Constitution and against the wishes of the people, that's martial law when they do what they want.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  Now here's a clip from Bill Moyers a few years ago.
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.000]  Now we reported at the time that Israeli paramilitary was in New Orleans.
[47:55.000 --> 48:03.000]  We reported that Blackwater was running around confiscating guns and shooting at U.S. citizens.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  And we had all the local news reports and people just said, that isn't true.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  We reported and played the clip of the New Orleans police chief saying all the guns will be taken.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  No one will be allowed to be armed. We're going into all the houses and taking the guns.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  And people said, no, no, that's not a real clip. It didn't matter. It was off ABC News.
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  See, there's this wanton denial. Well, in this clip on Bill Moyers, there was one of the reporters admitting all of this.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Here it is.
[48:29.000 --> 48:35.000]  Suppose we had a national emergency. Suppose the terrorist struck again and a president, President Hillary Clinton,
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.000]  President Barack Obama declared martial law in order to try to deal with this threat.
[48:41.000 --> 48:49.000]  And there was a private army of 20,000 soldiers that I could call upon to throw a ring around the Capitol
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  and make sure that the Congress didn't leave town or didn't get back to the Capitol.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  I mean, how far fetched is that?
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  Well, I mean, I was in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  and I think we saw a real window into the possible future.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  I was standing on a street corner in the French Quarter on Bourbon Street
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  and I was talking to two New York City police officers who had come down to help.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  And this was just a couple of days after the hurricane had hit and this car speeds up next to us.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  No license plates on. It was a compact car and three massive guys get out of it
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  and they have M4 assault rifles, bulletproof vests, wearing khaki,
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  upper-owned sunglasses, baseball caps on, and they come up and they say to the cops,
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  where are the rest of the Blackwater guys?
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  And my head sort of, you know, I didn't even hear the answer.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Where are the rest of the Blackwater guys?
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  So they get back in their vehicle and they speed off and I said to the cops, Blackwater,
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  you mean like the guys in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  They said, oh yeah, they're all over the place down here.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  So I said, well, I'd like to talk to them. Where are they?
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  And they said, you can go either way on this street implying that they're everywhere.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  So I walked a little bit deeper into the French Quarter and sure enough,
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  I encountered some Blackwater guys and when I talked to them,
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  they said that they were down there to confront criminals and stop looters.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Who called them in?
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  Well, this is an interesting story. Eric Prince sent them in there with no contract initially.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  About 180 Blackwater guys were sent into the Gulf.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  They got there before FEMA. I don't even know if FEMA is there yet,
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.000]  but they got there before FEMA before there was any kind of a serious operation in the city at all.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Oh, Prince's own decision?
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  Well, so Prince sends them in.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  Within a week, Blackwater is given a contract from the Department of Homeland Security Federal Protective Service
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  to engage in security operations inside of New Orleans.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  At one point, Blackwater had 600 men deployed down there stretching from Mississippi through,
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  from Texas through Mississippi and the Gulf.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  They were pulling in $240,000 a day.
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  One of these guys, Bill, had just been in Iraq two weeks earlier guarding U.S. Ambassador.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  Now they're in New Orleans. They said, oh, we do this sort of as a vacation.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  One was complaining to me that there wasn't enough action down here.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  And when I talked to them, they told me they were getting paid $350 a day, plus a per diem.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  Bye.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Homeland Security?
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Well, they're being paid by Blackwater.

[53:01.000 --> 53:09.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[53:17.000 --> 53:26.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:26.000 --> 53:33.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:42.000 --> 53:51.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[53:54.000 --> 54:13.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  Okay, let's go right back into that clip where he gets into the Israelis.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  This is only the surface.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  Here it is.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  They're being paid by Blackwater. When I got Blackwater's contracts with the Department of Homeland Security,
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  it turns out that Blackwater billed U.S. taxpayers $950 per man per day in the hurricane zone.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  To what margin of $600?
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  Well, the math on this stuff is always complicated and Eric Princeton and his men are very good at drawing up charts
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  and saying, well, there's this detail and this detail.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  The Department of Homeland Security then did an internal review and they determined that it was the best value to the taxpayer.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  At a time when the poor residents of New Orleans were being chastised for how they used their $2,000 debit cards
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  that often didn't work, the ones provided by FEMA.
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  But what was even scarier than seeing the Blackwater operatives on the streets of New Orleans was
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.000]  I encountered two Israeli commandos who had been brought in by a wealthy businessman in New Orleans
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  and set up an armed checkpoint outside of his gated community.
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  They were from a company called Instinctive Shooting International, ISI, which is an Israeli company.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  Okay, that's enough. The point is, the clip's up on infoawards.com.
[55:21.000 --> 55:30.000]  And at Waco, there were French, there were British, there were Israeli, there were Russian psychological warfare individuals there.
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  They had microwave cannons, sound cannons, and they're always setting the precedent.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  Oh, we need Mexican troops in New Orleans. Don't forget that.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  And they were all over Texas.
[55:40.000 --> 55:48.000]  And oh, we need Dutch troops, and oh, we need foreign military to put out the fires in California.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  And it's setting the precedent.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  And you tell the public this stuff, there's Bill Moyers talking about martial law in America
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  and not letting the Congress come back into session.
[55:58.000 --> 56:05.000]  Well, that's what PDD 51, just the declassified version, and they won't even give Congress a copy of the full version.
[56:05.000 --> 56:13.000]  When the Homeland Security Committee is co-equal, in fact, they pass the laws and instruct the executive who then executes them.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  That's what the hearings were all about last Friday in Congress.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  Now, I said I'd go to your calls. We're going to go to your calls now. I appreciate you holding.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Bruce in Colorado. You're on the air, Bruce.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  Well, hi there, Alex. I really appreciate all that you've been doing.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  I'm cooling about one of your sponsors, Interfood.
[56:35.000 --> 56:41.000]  I have a little problem with them, not the product, but last week, Steve St. Clary says,
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  oh, I'm sorry, I messed up on your order. This is the second time I called him.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  And he says, oh, I figured, well, it's a mistake, but we're going to ship it today.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  Sir, I'm going to put you on hold. Listen, look, Interfood's great. I buy it. I use it.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  I'm sorry your order got messed up. I can't do that on my show. See, we don't screen your calls,
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  and I know I'll be the big enemy today or something, too.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  And I had some other guy emailing the office saying, threatening things today,
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  saying we were blocking his MySpace bulletins. We don't do that.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  We don't even look at the MySpace account, but once a week to let new members in,
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.000]  and then they complain that we don't let new members in. We don't have the staff.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  We don't have the people. We're not blocking bulletins. We're not stopping you. MySpace does that.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  All sorts of filtering and stuff that goes on.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  And I know I'm changing the subject. There's just so much we can't.
[57:29.000 --> 57:35.000]  There's like nine of us that actually work on info war stuff and websites and films,
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  and the rest are a few people on shipping and one person on customer service,
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  and I can't even keep track of stuff. I don't even claim we're the best at things.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  We're doing the best we can. We're trying to move to a new office. We're trying to upgrade.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  We're trying to raise the capital to be able to do all this. We're trying to start a TV show.
[57:52.000 --> 57:59.000]  And I mean, I just can't do it. I mean, I can't sit here and hear about how one of my sponsors is bad
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  because there was some problem with an order, and you were able to talk to the owner of the company who said,
[58:04.000 --> 58:11.000]  I'll fix it. You know what? Call back if you hung up on him, John, and get his number,
[58:11.000 --> 58:16.000]  and I'll give it to the sponsor. Everybody else I know is very happy with it.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  I know we ordered around here. I know you can go down to Brave New Books in Austin
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  and you're listening in Austin and buy it there. I mean, we have martial law coming in.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  We have the economy imploding, and I got a caller calling up bitching about some sponsor.
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  I mean, come on, folks. I mean, I can't control that stuff. This is incredible.
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  We'll come back and try to take a few more calls.
[58:40.000 --> 58:50.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  In the fourth hour today, in 30 minutes from now, we've got Anthony J. Hilder coming on to talk about world events
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  and to take your phone calls. Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Honey, in California, honey, you're on the air.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Okay, thank you for the call. When it rains, it pours, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  It's always the same with these people. They always control the world. Everything's connected into them.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  They're always the Queen of England. I just can't handle it anymore, folks.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Good God, it's over for this country.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Oh, my God. Let's try to talk to another caller here. Let's talk to Tony in Illinois. You're on the air. Go ahead, Tony.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing, bud? Oh, I'm not doing too well now for the last two calls. Go ahead.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I'm telling you, it's Brain Dead Monday here on the show. No, I watched the impeachment hearings there on Friday,
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  and I just wanted to get your opinion on that guy, Steve King.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  I've never seen somebody look so close to a stroke in all my life whenever he was talking, given his opening statement there.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I'm not as optimistic as you are.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Yeah, the people that were... Go ahead. Explain what he was doing.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Well, he was just basically chastised, and you know, Boogliosi and everybody tell him how he was embarrassed, and he couldn't believe that he was part of an impeachment sitting there today.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  I can't believe. I used to be out there in the audience, and now I'm here on the committee, and I can't believe this is happening, and it was just all...
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  I mean, the people attacking those that want impeachment rightfully had no information, no facts, no backup. It was just all emotional bull.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Oh, absolutely. Like, I ran into that yesterday. I was talking to a guy about that and about Barack Obama,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  and he finally just thought he was going to drop his Trump card of, well, prove it.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Within 10 minutes on the computer, I don't think he's going to vote Democrat this year, and I think he's going to follow an impeachment hearing if it ever comes.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Now, we need impeachment. We need to punish people, not vote for McCain or Barack Obama. That's more of the same.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  We need a peaceful revolution in this country. We don't need more bull. Go ahead.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Oh, absolutely. I agree totally, Alex. You know, I keep trying to explain to people, you know, I keep printing up more and more articles about Obama,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  and trying to share them with people, and it's like, they're afraid to hear it, because it's like you said that guilt thing that we all...
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  You know, if you're Caucasian, you have programmed into you. You know, it's like they're guilt and they're reality.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  And it has nothing to do with what color he is. I could care less that Barack Obama's mama is white and his daddy's black.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  I could care less who is behind him, what he supports.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  Oh, I hear you. Here in Chicago, I mean, they are hog wild about some Obama.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Just real quick, and I'll run off here. I just wanted your opinion about this, the Obama trip.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  He goes overseas for a week of fun in the sun while half of America has to cancel their vacation.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  Between that, him signing onto the FISA bill, can people starting to discover who his advisors are and everything,
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  his poll numbers are starting to decline.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Now, myself, I think personally that the super delegates, which in my 20 years of following politics, I never heard of till this year,
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  I think the super delegates are going to step in as Obamas. They got two weeks to finish the job on him.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  He's laying down just like John Kerry did in 04.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And I think the delegates are going to drop on him down there and are over in Denver.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  And I think, I don't think he's going to get the nomination. That's why they keep calling him...
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  I don't know, but I'm going to be in Denver for that circus, so I'll be there reporting live.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  commissioning the CFR. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain,
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com,
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Drinking water? Now that's something I can handle.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking,
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone,
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  and I already lost seven pounds, and my skin looks great.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Up on infowars.com over the weekend, we posted a detailed article
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  by Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.com,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  paper sold to pools of liquidity,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  vast unexploited oil reserves, an economic threat from too much oil,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  dark pools of liquidity, threats of hyperinflation,
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  from unsold economy and fed practices,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  remembering the lessons from the Great Depression,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  reactionary measures to protect the dollar,
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  an examination of a crisis scenario.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Lindsay Williams, who's been in ordain to Baptist minister for 28 years
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and then goes into how he learned of the giant
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  discovered oil and gas reserves that were locked up.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Now, that's admitted from government documents and other guests we've had on,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  but Lindsay can tell you the eyewitness story,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  and he's well known, and one of his hour-long talks
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  has been in the top 10 of Google for the last year.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Hundreds of millions of people, conservatively.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  And that's why Google's had to delist the number of hits in the top 100.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  I always have films in the top 10, routinely number one.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  They stopped listing about eight months ago the numbers.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  If you're in the number one slot, you get about 500,000 views a day.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And so, you know, blues change, hundreds of millions of views there alone.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Yeah, it's now over 100 million, conservatively.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  The professor, you know, who gave a speech about how he was dying,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  and it was number one TV, you know,
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  a news report the last few months he died last week,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  he got big in the last year because of being number one on Google.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  I mean, that's how big this is.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Number one video in the world. Our stuff is routinely number one.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Well, so is Lindsay's now.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  That's why they're now not letting you embed Google videos.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  It's hard to find the code to do it.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  They're now talking about even shutting that down.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  They're now not advertising.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  A good video isn't one of the top links on Google.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  They're trying to hide it now because it's hurting them.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  We also caught them manipulating our numbers, cheating, playing games.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  They had to admit they were. We wrote articles about that.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  This is like us being able to get our stuff, say, on the nightly news.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I mean, it's that big, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  And so, that's why the Williams information got so big.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  He's now getting really bad death threats.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  He says he's going to cave into those.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  We hope Mr. Williams doesn't. That's not what you do.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  Bob Chapman doing about 20 interviews a week.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Reaching tens of millions. He is being attacked.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  We're not going to get into all that because he's been getting attacked since the 60s
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  when he's one of the granddaddies fighting this.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  But we're getting the secret service down at Genesis threatening us.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  We got, I mean, folks, they are looking at us right now.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  I mean, we are toe-to-toe beating the daylights out of the New World Order.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And we are X-wings in the trench going at the Death Star here in the Info War.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  And we need your support, folks.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  We need you to get the word out about these radio shows.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  The answer to this is to get bigger.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 in the Info War.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And we are peaceful, but we are fighting to wake this country up.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And yes, we're getting death-threaded.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  Yes, I don't tell you about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Bob, I know you don't want to get into it,
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  but I mean, the type of stuff you go through, it's unbelievable.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  It's been going on since 1967.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And you're going to ask Anthony Hilder is coming on later.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I mean, he was there with me in the early days.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And it's just never stopped.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  What would you say to Lindsay about back and down?
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Well, you know, everybody has their top tolerance.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  And some people are stronger than others.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  They threaten me innumerable times.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  And I said, come on, you know, I can shoot straight, too.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Well, it's a threatening attitude.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  I mean, if they want action, they come to the right place.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Well, it's also they then start threatening family.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And I think that's what Lindsay can't handle.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  That's what Ross Baroque couldn't handle.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Well, I think Lindsay's doing a lot of good,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  although I don't agree with everything he has to say from an economic viewpoint.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  That's right. I mean, he's right about the info wrong on the perspective.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  He's saying, well, explain what he's saying and then break it down.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Well, very simply, there's enough oil and gas for 200 years.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  And as you said earlier, he's dead right.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  And that alone getting a podium and being able to deliver that to the public of the world is extraordinarily important.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Number two, yes, oil and gasoline prices are going to go down once deflation takes over.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  And that is not going to happen for a while yet.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  You and I have discussed this in the program and I think that two or three years down the line,
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  they will finally lose control.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Maybe it'll be five, maybe it'll be a year and a half, but it's not tomorrow.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And for people to wish for $50 oil, it's not going to happen.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  Why? Because oil is just a reflection of the real problem,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  which is the reckless creation of money and credit.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And that is continuing. It's dollar devaluation.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And then that drives the secondary input into the equation.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  I know you know the spot for the listeners, which is the speculators.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And we've been saying for three, four months, it would go up to 145 this summer, which it went above that.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And it would then drop down, as you've been saying in the last month to 120 until next summer again,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  when it's going to go to 200, correct?
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Amen.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Okay, now let's add another sector to this.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Even if they find all these oil reserves, they just lay them off limits like they did in Alaska or the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  That's part B. I want you to comment on that.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  But then part C, there was a program which was released in lawsuits, Associated Press reported.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  9596, two oil company summits, the Big Ten, where they bought up 214 refineries in the U.S.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  scores in other parts of the world, shutting them down to create an artificial bottleneck
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  for the eventuality if Russia or Southeast Asia or somebody else did start delivering masses of oil,
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  they have a bottleneck which will block it.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Correct?
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And that's right, and then some.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  You know, these people are not dumb, and they come back.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  I mean, they're persistent, and they're not going to give up because they have a lot at stake, great wealth and great power.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  And it's been going on for a thousand years, and they're not going to roll over.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And so that's why it's so important that your message, the message of all of your guests and all of these other type programs,
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  get out to the public.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  That's why I won't stop.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  I won't stop until they take me down six feet.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Well, we know you're a veteran and worked in intelligence, and you're up to a lot of stuff we can't talk about on air, Bob.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  But I've never heard you talk like this.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Look, you're talking the last few months.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  We don't want to lose you.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And I think it is escalating, we've seen it in the press against you and the FBI coming after you and things.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And you know, you're, it seems like, I'm not criticizing you, Bob, but it seems like you're kind of, you know,
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  begging the dragon to come after you, saying, bring it on.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Why have you gotten into this mode?
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I've always been in that mode.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  I just never have been that outspoken about it.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  I'm just sick and tired of it.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And I'm sure you are, too.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  You know, my family's been threatened, et cetera, just like yours has.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  And it's gone back a long, long time.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I mean, I had, you know, the government trying to set me up with this thing or that thing at innumerable times.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Well, Paul Craig Roberts, and I'm not calling for this, folks, because I need to be a venue to get the news out.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  And I don't want it to get violent, genuinely.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  But I mean, I have the former head of the Treasury on the former Wall Street Journal editor, and he says,
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  attack police, overturn police cars, and he said that last Friday at the end of the show.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  In fact, cue that up, John.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I mean, I'm seeing the troops and special forces and all these people I know, they, and then this is genuine.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  They want to fight, too.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  I mean, I think the globalists are really pushing it, Bob.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Well, they are.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  And the reason why is their program has been dealt a terrible setback in the Middle East,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  and they're going to have to regroup and go off in another direction.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  It's been a couple of years, I think, since the European Illuminati and the, we'll call them the,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  the, as a big, no, Brzezinski faction have taken over what's going on in the United States.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  And that's why there hasn't been an invasion of Iran.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  And I do think they want to withdraw in time from Iraq, because the oil companies got what they want.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  They're going to get their contracts, and that's what they were after.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  But Israel, but Israel says they're going to go ahead and hit Iran.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  Do you think they're really going to do that?
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  No.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  I think they've been told to stand down and not do it.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  And I believe secretly that they've been making deals with Hamas and Hezbollah and Syria.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  And I think there's going to be a backing off there.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Although I do think in Afghanistan, they're going to expand their conflict into Pakistan and try to balkanize it
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  in order to create a better Western flank against India and China.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  But that is a problem, because there are a bunch of nukes and good delivery systems in Pakistan.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  Why did the globalists arm them?
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  Well, I'll tell you, first of all, I don't know why they armed them.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  The one greatest source is now dead.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  They assassinated her.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  And secondly, I do another program where I had a call in from people who are on the site guarding the Pakistan nuclear weapons.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  This is an elite U.S. government unit.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Well, that's been reported at the U.S. Special Ops all over the key military structures, infrastructure in Pakistan.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Well, that one came right from the guys who were there.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  First hand.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  So they just want balkanization.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  It's the same thing they do in the Balkans.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Going back to the 1400s, every time they wanted to have a war, they had balkanized the different sections of Eastern Central Europe,
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  and they just liked the match.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  You know, it's just like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  It was simple.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  British intelligence, the great game.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  Mm-hmm.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Oh, man.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  And that's what Brzezniki's up to.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  And it could be far worse, because he is now re-again pitting Russia and China and India against the United States.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  And if they continue to press with the situation in Georgia, Kosovo, the possibility of missile installations in Poland, which so far has been defeated,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and the radar and the Czech Republic, Russia's going to have no choice but to confront the United States.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  What does it mean when the Russian Foreign Minister says we will use nuclear weapons against your installations three months ago?
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  I want the answer from Bob Chapman on that when we get back.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  And again, we love Lindsay Williams.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  And it's just that geopolitically, you could have a planet of oil, and they wouldn't refine it for you.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  OK, just checkmate, done.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  Trying to explain this to people.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Now, natural gas is another subject, because it doesn't have to be refined.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Bank failures, rising food prices, and an ever-weakening dollar are only the beginning of a much larger crisis.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men?
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and illusion of authority
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  that only lawless men and women seek.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  They no longer strive to protect American ideals, but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  that they have sworn an oath to defend.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished?
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Do the American people even understand the crimes that have been committed?
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  Where does it stop?
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  Washington You're Fired is a film about true change in D.C.

[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Bob Chapman, I'm going to hold you a little bit over with Anthony Hilder so you can say how do you're a friend.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  Anthony's been doing this since the early 60s as well.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  We're having all the icons on ladies and gentlemen as much as we can during this dark time and giving them the credit that you do.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  We're going to get Anthony's view on the future.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  I'm going to have Lindsay Williams on an hour and 10 minutes from now.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  And then Dr. Stan Monteith is on as well.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  We'll have both of them on together.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Bob, I know you're doing a lot of interviews anywhere between 130 central and 230 central if you want to pop in for 10 minutes to try to explain this.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  I mean, I can do it as well to Lindsay because people are really believing this about the $50 barrel and we're going to be paying $1.10 for gas.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  And I understand he's talked to his oil company, people that are saying there's too much oil, the monopoly is breaking.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  But I don't know why he's being told this because it just doesn't jive with the basic facts.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  I mean, he's right about the giant oil reserves, but I hate poo pooing him.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  He's going to be on.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Great guy.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Do you have your schedule in front of you?
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  We'll just schedule it on air.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  You want to pop in for 10 minutes later and have a bifurcated interview?
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  After 130.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Okay, we'll call you at 1.45 so he can have some time to run before you pop in.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  How's that sound?
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  That's fine.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Okay, we're going to keep going another 10 minutes in the next segment with you with Hilder.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  But right now I was getting into, I got distracted setting up Gaster and the break.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  What was the issue we were going into the break I was asking you about?
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  I don't know.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  I can't remember, I've got to be honest.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Oh, Russia threatening the nuke.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Europe.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Right, and one of the interesting things I was thinking about after you said that was
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  that I found out just recently, and perhaps you and your audience know this already, but
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I didn't, that Zbigniew Brzezinski's son Ian is a world policy advisor for John McCain.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Did we know that?
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Yes, I'd seen that.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  So they not only see the advisor to Obama, but also with McCain.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  We know he's still covertly advising Obama, but you know a month ago they kicked Brzezinski
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  off of the Obama campaign.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  So does that show a power shift to you?
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  No, no, it shows him going undercover because his son is also with McCain.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  And so the Brzezinski family is in there up to their eyeballs and rightly so from their
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  perspective because they're representing a big shift in policy.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  And that's the European Rothschild dominated side?
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Yes, the black nobility of Europe as well.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And the key was two years ago when Brzezinski said that what the current administration
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  of Washington has done has set back our plans for world government by 30 years.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  And those are his exact words.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  Would you call that the Vatican-centered arm or pole of the New World Order?
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Because we do now really see what the old-timer said, the Vatican more and more coming to the
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  head of the European Union Superstate conversions of most leaders, including Tony Blair to Catholicism.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Well, I think it could very well have something to do with it.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  You have to step back and wonder how they survived these centuries by standing apart.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And you don't survive by standing apart.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  You go to a corporate because you're dealing with the crown heads of Europe, most all at one time who are Catholics
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  and some who are still today.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  And so with that said, you have to wonder why they still exist in their current form.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  On the global power structure with this bipolar New World Order system,
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  where is the Vatican in that structure from your research, Bob?
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Well, I don't really know, but I do know this, that there are a lot of people at semi-high levels
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  outside the Church who are Catholics, and you might cite Opus D as an example.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  And I know that they were deeply involved with fascism during the war and before the war.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  And they did set up an escape room for many, many people, some of whom I've talked to.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  And so they were in it big time.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Did they believe in it?
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  I don't know.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Was it survival for them? Maybe.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  You know, there's both sides of that thing.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  And I've never really gotten into it.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  One of the reasons is all the players that I know, number one,
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  thought they were doing the right thing as fascists.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  And number two, they're all dead.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Absolutely. No, I was just trying to get your specific view,
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  because we know that that arm with Brzezinski really does have some major differences with the Anglo-American wing.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  Absolutely. And they are the original and the more powerful of the two wings.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  And they have taken over.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  That was the question, are there two wings, yes, in your expert view,
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  and which is the dominant wing, you see a split between the Anglo-American arm and the Vatican arm.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great-flavored super bulk foods
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  Get on the web at eFoodsDirect.com and find a two-month grab-and-go kit.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  This easy-fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day,
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  the cost about $5 a day.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  The rest of the world is starving,
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  He takes his hand off in year three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  For the next hour, Anthony J. Hilder is on with us.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  I'm going to get him back on for another hour next week because we've got to get Lindsay Williams and Stan Monteith on today about the oil situation.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Bob Chapman is going to be with us for a few minutes with Anthony Hilder because I didn't even know they were friends.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  They're granddaddies of the movement, both of them, two icons.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  We'll be going Anthony Hilder in just one moment.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Before we do that, my new film, Truth Rising, is out.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  And it is my first cinema verite, or in French, the cinema of truth.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  By that, it just shows you what the lens sees. No voiceover.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  It is all the most dynamic, activist video. We are changed. 9-Eleven Truth, confronting world leaders.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Every major presidential candidate, Dick Cheney's wife.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  I mean, it's so amazing. And then it's Michael Moore saying 9-Eleven's probably an inside job.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  It's the late George Carlin right before he died saying, you know, that he could be an inside job.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  It is Martin Sheen. The list goes on and on.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  Amy Goodman saying they could have blown up Building 7.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  I mean, this is an amazing film. It would take hours to go over everybody that's in it.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger is confronted.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, the list goes on and on and on.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  And then it's got pastors walking across the country for 9-Eleven Truth being harassed everywhere.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  And 9-Eleven Truth, we are changed up in Canada.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  And going in over the Walmart speakers and saying 9-Eleven's an inside job.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  I mean, it's an amazing film.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Truth Rising also shows the police threatening to plant bombs on demonstrators to shut down their free speech.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Myself being arrested. I mean, it is a wild film. It's very entertaining.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  And it's perfect for the public to wake up, see what 9-Eleven Truth is all about, the persecution we go through,
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  and also the first responders and the deadly dust and a lot of evidence of how the attacks were carried out.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Truth Rising, get it on DVD.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  That's Jesse Ventura is in it.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Willie Nelson, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Infowars.com, get Truth Rising today.

[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Anthony Hilder put out the original Illuminati tapes in the 60s.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  With Myron Fagan, he has written a bunch of books, made scores of films.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  He's one of the people early on.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  I woke up on my own reading Nundare Call of Conspiracy by Gary Allen that Bob Chapman was behind.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  And then I woke up through Text Mars, Anthony Hilder.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  You know, these are the people that influenced me.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Then I found Mark Kornke and people like that afterwards.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  And I didn't even know about people like in 1998.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Have you heard about Hold a Pale Horse and Bill Cooper?
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Then I found out about him.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  But we're talking to two of the guys right now that really are the roots of the modern movement
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  and their national treasures.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  And I don't want to take up too much more of Bob's time because he's going to pop in
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  with Lindsay Williams coming up in an hour.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  But I wanted to let Bob introduce Anthony Hilder and say anything he wants to say about Anthony.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Well, yes, Anthony has been around for a long time just like I have.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  We're old.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  And we worked in a number of projects together through the years along with Alan Stang and G. Edward Griffith
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  and of course my ex-partner, Gary Allen.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Tony was mostly into publishing and he did, of course, as you mentioned,
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Byron Fagan's records on the Illuminati.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  And I told Tony recently I have an original set, which I guess there's not too many of them around.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  And we were pamphleteers in those days.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  And we got involved in politics in a big way as well.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And so we've been at this a long time.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  You set the bushfires, the men we're talking to are two of the original great grandeddies of this.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Red Beckman and a few others set the original bushfires that were small at the time,
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  but now are burning like the light of the sun across the world.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  And we are just so honored to have them on.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Anthony Hilder, good to have you here.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  It is my pleasure and being on with Bob Chapman is an extra special pleasure
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  because we both understand that this depression that we're going into is by, it was deliberate and by design.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Anthony, what are you up to these days?
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  I mean, you're churning out films, you're doing talk radio interviews, you're as busy as you've ever been.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Tell us about what you're up to right now and then get into your breakdown of what you see us going into in the near future.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Well, I'm actually desperate right at this moment.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  I'm just finishing this film called Ten Dollars a Gallon.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And in this film, we're telling the people that we're going to have a disaster,
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  which is like nothing else the world has ever faced.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  We're getting to the point where they're preparing to eliminate 80% of the various people.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  And they can do this by destroying the dollar, bringing it down,
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  the same time bringing the price of gas up so you can't buy food because it's too damn expensive.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  You can't transport food because it's too damn expensive, the combines, the tractors, the trailers.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  You can't move them because when the gas goes beyond a certain point, the inner cities are going to just shut down.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  That's what's going to happen.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  We're in the process of seeing that now.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I believe there'll be food riots in this country within 60 days.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  You go into Detroit, you go into downtown Los Angeles, where the blacks and the browns reside.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And there are the wars against each other now.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  The Bloods and the Crips and the Long Beach Crips.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  MS-13.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  It's happening. It's before our very high.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  There are already riots in the public schools every few weeks, racially with the Latinos and the blacks.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  And you're right, I've got AP here.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  As cost rise, inflation's next front is retailers and it gets into people already having problems buying food.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  This thing that Bobby knows very well is going to bring us to the point where there is the enemy, our enemy.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  The people who control the privately owned Federal Reserve system.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  The evilarchy, the Illuminati, as we described them years ago, have no option.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  They can't turn around.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  They've got to have and they've got to create another crisis.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  So we have to expose what they are intending to do to set that there's a trap up there.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  We have to spring that trap before we, or the people of the United States, get to that particular point.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Because this country can turn this around.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  We can do this. This is a doable.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Let's set over and over again.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  9-1-1, the greatest lie ever sold, which is in 23 countries. It's in seven languages.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  The first one, the Illuminati 9-1-1, which I started on September 11, 2001, and finished on Halloween.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  We weren't successful with that other than the fact we got others to get on the bandwagon and go with it.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  It's important that we have the completion of these films. I've got 21 projects.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  We have Citizen Chip 666.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  The invasion that's occurring from Mexico is deliberate and by design.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  When we have this invasion here and the people say, well, we have to have some sort of comprehensive immigration program.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  We don't know one from Rodriguez. He said, well, we'll just give everybody a biochip.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  We'll give them a Citizen Chip, but that's how they intend to introduce this.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And a depression, people are more likely to accept that during a depression.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Let me get a comment on this from Bob Chapman.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Well, you're on your knees financially and economically.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Most people, educated or uneducated, going to say, well, gee, whoever's going to feed me, I like them.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  And so along with the feeding and the job or whatever it is, comes a control in the control of this world government.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  Now, I think Bob differs a bit with you, Anthony, and that he doesn't think this is going to start unraveling in the next.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  I mean, it's unraveling now, but it's going to unravel slower.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  Bob, am I right in saying that you think this is going to happen a little bit slower than what Anthony's hitting at?
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  Yes. You know, what Anthony has said is absolutely true, but it's been going on for some time.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And there would have to be a catalyst to bring other people into the involvement.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  And that catalyst would be the falling apart of an economy, and that's taking more time than we have anticipated.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  We're in recession. Government, Wall Street, they all lie about it.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  But sooner or later, they're going to have to admit it, and then they're going to have to move on to depression.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  And when depression starts, that'll be the catalyst. It'll bring everything down.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Well, I went to a restaurant last night, Anthony. I want to get your take on this, because you're in one of the biggest cities in the country.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  I'm in Little Austin. There's a million metro, not 10 million, like LA Metro.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  And we went to a little Mexican food place, and all of the waitresses, we heard them, were complaining about barely having money to buy their own food.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  I noticed, and I've eaten there a lot, that people were walking. A lot of the people were walking over to eat.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  And this is a lower middle class area over here where my office is, but it's not the projects.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  And then I was talking to one waitress, and she said, yeah, I moved over here, had to sell my car,
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  and then I just live in a little one-room apartment down the street, and I work here now.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  And just a few years ago, I was making a good living, working in retail, but that store shut down.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  And I mean, Austin's supposedly the boom town in the country, and it's getting bad, and everybody I hear is complaining.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  How bad is it in Los Angeles, where you have a giant third world load?
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Well, my son lives out here, my youngest son lives out here, and within a block, there's eight foreclosures.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  Eight foreclosures are within the square block.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  The rents are going to, like in Santa Monica, from 1,500 for a one-bedroom to 25, 2700 for a two-bedroom house.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  Because people are leaving big houses and having to downgrade, so the cheaper houses are going up.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  I couldn't say house, let me put it this way.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  An apartment, and that's an apartment.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  It is insane. We're in the People's Republic of Santa Monica.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  There are people in little alcoves sleeping overnight.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  This is a good neighborhood, and I went out one day, and here's somebody sleeping out underneath the entree or the entrance to this apartment house.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  And the California State and Cities are opening huge parklands for car cities now, right?
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  Oh, and the President says, everything is OK, right?
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  There's a little problem, but it's under control.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  The problem is they want us under control.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  It's a nine-bulk, and a like, and fewer, one world, one race, one ruler scenario. It's taking place before our very eyes.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  Bob may think that, you know, it's going to be a little longer, I think, it's a little bit shorter, but we're on the same track.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  We have been for the past 40 years.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  The Illuminati, records by Myron Fagan, I felt if they were not made then, we would not have the situation that we have now.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  Oh, we've slowed them down.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  It would be a seed, and from that seed, Gary Allen, who met with me and John Steinbacher up at the Copper Kettle in Hollywood,
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  said, Hilda, you're wrong, you're dead wrong, and I'm going to expose you and you're doing this thing.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Talking about the Illuminati, it doesn't exist.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  So he started out to write an article, which became into a thing called the Establishment CFR,
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  and then from the Establishment CFR came a book called Men Dare, Call it Treason.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  And how many, it's like 10 million of those are out or something?
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  No, there was five and a half million, and Bob realizes that Gary had not sold them all,
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  and I walked into his place, and it was like a mountain in the warehouse.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  But I mean, since then, they've printed more.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  12 feet on top of the books, and I took it one time, 10,000, put them in the back of my father's truck,
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  and drove off for distribution, and Bob was giving them out, handing them out everywhere.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Now I want to point out, and I'm not trying to kiss up to you guys, I want to thank you heartfelt.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  I mean, you guys were out there on the front lines, in the streets, when nobody knew about this stuff.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  That would be an accurate statement.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  But Myron Fagan, God bless him, would be 100, and I don't know what, but I didn't have it together.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  I was very much involved in the Goldwater campaign in 64, and I just didn't put it all together.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  I knew that the Republican Party was controlled from the inside during that election.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  I even found out about subliminal advertising, or subliminal propaganda.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  During the Goldwater campaign, there was a speech that was made down in Long Beach.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Goldwater was against discrimination.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And I was taking it down from a recording which was done by an outfit in Hollywood.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  And I figured, well, this is going to be excellent, it's going to be clean.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  And I thought that it was clean, until I came to a piece where I had to splice my particular tape
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  in with another tape there, because I had one of those little UR recorders with a small reel, five inch reel.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  When I spliced them together, I heard that one was clean and one was not.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  I said, well, something's wrong here.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  So we kept cranking it up and cranking it up and cranking it up.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  DB after DB after DB.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  I heard in the background, Goldwater, Goldwater's a fascist.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  How they got that on there, I have no idea, but I discovered that even on the publicity that Barry Goldwater was getting,
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  on a station that was owned by Gene Autry, that they were able to put in a subliminal psychological message here.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  And now it's admitted, when you go to film school or RTF, that there's subliminal everywhere, different layers of it,
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  and the public says it doesn't exist.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Well, Bob, we're going to talk to you, shining back in, whether it's in about an hour or about 55 minutes to be technical.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  I just wanted you guys to be able to say hi to each other.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  We'll be right back with Anthony Hilver.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Okay, Bob?
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Okay, bye-bye.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  There goes Bob Chapman.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  Anthony, stay there.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  I want to talk about subliminals.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  I'm glad you brought that up, because you've worked in Hollywood.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  You've run a whole film lot out there.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  You've worked in an amazing individual, seen so much, and met so many famous people.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  And I want to talk about the Illuminati, the fascist global system, what they're planning, the end game,
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  with Anthony Hilver, and give you his website, some of his newest films as well.

[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg group. But their objective being world domination.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Hey, who's that?
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  Sword and pistol?
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  I just love that sweet voice.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  The master taught me in the spring of twenty five.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  But I am still alive.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  With the sea I did abide.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  I sailed a school around the Horn of Mexico.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  I went off to burl the mains a little bloke.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  But I'm living still.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  We're talking to somebody who is an icon right now.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  I was a dammit.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Somebody who's trailblazed.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Who's made a huge difference in the world.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Anthony J. Hilder.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Alright Anthony, that's a good place to get into.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Not only to get into the big picture, but subliminals.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  The average person doesn't know.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  There's many different layers, many different types.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  Not just having five, six video screens behind, say,
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Anderson Cooper, where it immediately shifts you into
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  subconscious mode, because only your subconscious
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  can look at the six different screens.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  One with a football game on, another with Wall Street images,
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  another with battle images, another with flooding.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Then he's talking about something totally different
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  to you verbally, then there's a scroll at the bottom,
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  blue mist in the background.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  And so that shifts, and then there's the flicker rate,
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  which also mesmerizes you, brain waves, scientific fact.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  Then there's semantically the words they use, how they twist things.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  Then you add to that that they're adding subliminals in,
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  you know, one hundredth of a second.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Break down the different types of subliminals that are
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  literally mesmerizing and neutralizing people.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Well, primarily on radio.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  I mean, there's not much you can do other than simply
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  to put a track in below the audible conscious level.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  And when one hears this, they don't hear this consciously,
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  but it registers subconsciously.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  So when you have a promotion that says it is for Barry Goldwater,
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  it is against Barry Goldwater.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  And it is using Barry Goldwater, the people's money
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  that has donated to his campaign, to be used against him.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  I mean, it all sounds crazy, and I didn't realize that this thing existed.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  And in 64, I was shocked.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  I couldn't figure out how the hell he got it in there.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  I figured ABC, because I've had a friend working at ABC
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  who gave me the rest of that particular clip,
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  was that they might be involved in something like this,
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  but I never figured that radio recorders who took down in Hollywood
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  that took down the transmission, it would have to be clean,
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  but it was the other way around.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  And that threw me.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  There was definitely a message underneath the audible conscious level message
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  that was being recorded.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  And by the way, when I took just a few years of RTF,
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  the first basic textbook on RTF's, the history of it all,
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  admitted the famous cases in the early 50s of flashing for a millisecond
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  in a desert, the image of a Coca-Cola, and how that doubled sales.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  So this is admitted in the textbooks, but the public isn't aware.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  So when you're watching mainline television,
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  you are being hit and hit hard by all sorts of stuff.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  And you need to be aware of that.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  Anthony, we're going to be back in just 70 seconds.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  So stay there.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  I want to continue with the most basic forms of subliminals
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  up to the more high-tech things they're doing right now.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  Stay with us, infowars.com.

[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  An inside job?
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  How dare you?
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  I don't want to keep up with the public's suggestions.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  9-11.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  Well, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  Please rise.

[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:48.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Anthony Hilder with us for much of the next hour.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  I'm going to have him back up with us again next week.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  Anthony, I want to get into the big picture,
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  the globalist master plan, the population extermination,
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  why they want this world government as a means to an end to carry that out,
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  but continue with subliminals.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  You know, once you've learned about this, once this woke you up,
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  just because you were, you know, involved in a production,
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  trying to promote Barry Goldwater,
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  involved in a production, how this, you know,
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  in the early 60s woke you up, getting into more subliminals.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Well, primarily they were done in film,
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  and I recognized film because you could stop that, right?
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  And you could stop it and go back and see the frame that they actually put in.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  I was just taking a look at Robert Redford's piece,
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Lions and Lambs.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  And this guy is a terrible, horrible director.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  The acting was horrible, and you'd think that Meryl Streep
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  and Tom Cruise would be at the top of the list,
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  but they were used in a propaganda piece,
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  and it's simply straight propaganda.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  You see a lot of that, and I saw a lot of that,
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  and you'll have it in the dialogue messages.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  Yeah, you'll have overt messages of overt anti-gun, anti-family.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  I mean, there's all of that, so there's just that basic level, too.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  So it is taking the next step, but people don't really quite believe it.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  There's a reason that they have the smell of Mrs. Field's cookies
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  when you go into a big mall.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  So people will, oh, that smells good.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  Damn, let's have some of those.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  You'll have flashes on the little video clips,
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  advertising products in a particular store.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  The movies do it continually.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  It's like you say, the desert with the Coca-Cola.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  Well, I gotta have a Coke, right?
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  It's that reminder.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  It's deeper than that now.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  They have techniques which I don't really quite understand.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  You have to see it, or you have to hear it,
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  and it's also overt in the dialogue.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  It's weave together, so they have a real propaganda piece,
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  and they have experts that do this.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  I'm not a techie.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  At first, I couldn't figure it out.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  I could hear it, and I started to put it together.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  But I thought, how can they get that onto a message
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  that is coming out from a station that is pro-goal water,
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  and people that are pro-goal water?
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  Did they do it at the origin of the source?
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Were they able to mix this in on the same beam
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  that they broadcasted?
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  How do you do that?
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  They have experts, and we have been propagandized.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  We've got millions of people who still believe
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  that George Bush is a conservative.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  We have to do a film talking about the counterfeit conservatives.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  And I'm going to make a challenge to Medvid and to O'Reilly,
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  or Sean Hannity, right now, to do a debate with them
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  at the Conspiracy Con next year.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  I want to debate some of them, one of them.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  So if you're listening out there, guys,
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  I'm challenging you to a debate at the Conspiracy Con,
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  and we'll film it, and we'll show the people
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  how your opinion is used to change the opinion of millions
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  to believe what is not so, because it simply is not so.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  All right, long segment coming up with Anthony Hilder.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Anthony, I want to get into the big picture,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  what you see happening currently and in the near future,
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  whether you think they're going to hit Iran,
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  what you think we're going to witness economically
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  in the next six months to two years.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  Anthony Hilder is our guest.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  We'll give you his website when we get back as well.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  and regaining your health and energy.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision plasma pH drops now

[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  and it creates an alkaline environment where cancer can't grow
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  and parasites cannot live and brings fungus, viruses
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  and bacterial levels down into a halt.

[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Ask yourself, why does our government
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  Join the Info War today.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  Four hours a day, five days a week.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Man, that's a lot of radio.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  And then of course, back Sundays
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  with an abbreviated transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Anthony Hilder is our guest.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  We're going to have him back on next week.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  So we have plenty of time to take your calls.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  We will open the phones up if you want to talk to Anthony
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  John, just I am those to me.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Anthony, shifting gears into the big picture.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  But before we do that, tell folks about some of your websites
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  and some of your materials people need to get a hold of.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  Well, the newest film, and it addresses
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  the counterfeit conservative issue,
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  which is the real problem,
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  because if we could explain to the people
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  those who profess to give us less government
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  are giving us more government.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  And we do this in the field of religion.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Skull and Bone's The Catholic Connection
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  is our latest film, and it addresses the Bill Buckley's
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  and all of those individuals who profess to give us less
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  but give us more.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  Our number on that, this free world film works,
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  is 800-597-9250.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  That's 800-597-9250.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  But we're in the process of getting back there,
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  and we have to...
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  I'm getting an echo on the phone.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Okay, we'll have the network look at that.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  He's getting an echo. Can we look at the phone system?
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  It may not be ours, it may be yours when we have to reconnect.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  With you, Anthony, is it better now?
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  Yes, it is.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Okay.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  No, I'm back on the repeat,
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  and that's a hang-up.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  You want to do a reconnect?
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  I'll cancel, and I'll come back to the greatest radio show.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  Not just in the United States, but in the world.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  The Alex Jones show, the best of the best of the best.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  Like MacArthur said, I shall return.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  I'll hang up, and we'll reconnect.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  All right, calling back.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  We have computerized phone systems.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  Sometimes they go a little bit wacky.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  Honest, so call him back, John, okay?
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  I wanted to get into the big picture with Anthony,
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  also give out his website for people out there.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  We are going to have Lindsay Williams on in about 20 minutes from now,
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  and Bob Chapman's going to pop back in with him, the Dr. Stan Monteef,
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  with his take on what's happening with the oil crisis.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  Lindsay's got quite a story to tell from his oil company executive sources
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  about what he says is going to happen in the near future with oil.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  Anthony, let's see if it's better now.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  It is. It's clean.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Okay, good. That happens sometimes with those telos systems.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Okay, big picture, new order master plan.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  Give us from your 40-plus years of research the basic layout
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  of the new order power structure, and then what their in-game is.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  Well, first of all, you go back to the basic money.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  You cannot have a world that is controlled by this evilarchy
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  through the money offering solutions which in turn give problems.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  We have to get down to the basic core, and Bob would certainly agree.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  We can't have a publicly-owned money system like the US dollar is supposed to be.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  It's supposed to be owned by the government of the United States.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  You can't have that in the hands of a private banking institution
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  which issues fiat-funding money at point of origin and lends it back to us
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  for interest-bearing bonds. They get the interest.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  They own the bonds. They get the gold. We get the shaft.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  We cannot exist in a situation like that because they can manipulate everything.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  The program is to bring about the destruction of the United States dollar
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  totally, totally, and introduce the Amaro and the North American Nausea Agreement.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  The Nausea is the North American union or North American alliance.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  It's the destruction, the absolute total destruction of the dollar.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  What we're seeing right now, we're in this, it's not coming.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  People ask me, when is this going to come?
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  We're already deep into this predatory strip mining of the society economically, socially.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  Anthony, I want to get your, and my listeners, obviously know all about the Federal Reserve.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  We have hundreds of thousands every day that tune in for the first time on AM&F across the country.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  As you know, I really want to get your big picture.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  What makes them tick? What their mindset is? What their drive is?
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Where the British royalty fits in? Where the masons fit in?
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Where the Catholic church fits in? Your new film on that?
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  I mean, we're here covering it all. Give us from your condensed knowledge what really makes this thing tick
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  and what their in-game is if they're able to succeed.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  Well, the in-game is world government. They don't want to just simply control a country.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  They want to own a country. They're not even content with that.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  They want to own the people within the country.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  And I'm going to go into the next step, because this is Luciferian in nature.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  If we take a look at Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam is pointing towards you, it says, I want you.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  And you figure, well, that's patriotic, certainly. Uncle Sam wants you.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  Uncle Sam wants you to join the army, to join the movement of patriots who are trying to save this country.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  But when you take a look at Uncle Sam and overlay Uncle Sam with a picture of the goat of Bathamut, they are identical.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  I'm saying that the goat of Bathamut, the satanic goat, which is the Masonic mascot.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  It's half woman, half man. You'll see that the cuff link on his shirt matches up with the nipple on the breast
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  of the half man, half goat, the satanic star on the, above the goat head, matches with the satanic star on Uncle Sam's hat.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  The flange of the hat at the top, as it rolls out, is in the exact configuration of the horns of the goat of Bathamut.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  It is one, it is the same. Uncle Sam is Satan.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  Well, remember during the debates between John Kerry and George Bush, and even mainstream news said it,
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  they projected a perfect horn devil behind them, and then that was the year the Republicans flipped the stars from straight up,
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  the three stars on the top of the elephant, to straight down.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  They admitted the Republican Party made that decision. I mean, thought goes into this.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  It's almost, you have to see it on a film that I'm in the process of making, and I need help to finish the damn thing.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  We have this overlay. We move one picture to the other picture, and it matches up, it matches up to the very hairs in the beard of Bathamut.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Uncle Sam's hairs and the hairs of the goat of Bathamut are identical.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  I don't know why, but this has been sold to us.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Let me stop you. It was in the times of London 10 years ago.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  Anybody with Lexus Nexus can pull it up. It's pre-Google, but you can probably find it there as well, because we had stories on it.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  And remember, Toyota got caught all over Europe running Toyota ads that were, and it was a film school in London that discovered it.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  And then Toyota apologized and withdrew it, but they were flashing at a millisecond intervals and playing audio under it, but also images.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  The father's driving to the hospital. His wife's had a baby. She had it early.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  He's coming from work through a thunderstorm, and it's saying, kill the baby, drink the blood, the power of the moon, the blood, Satan, kill the baby.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  And that's admitted that Toyota did that. Are they Satanists or are they Luciferian that run this?
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  The Illuminati is Luciferian. We've all seen the fold. I did the fold of the $20 bill.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  So you see, and those who are familiar with this show have probably all taken that $20 bill and folded it over, so you have the North and South powers.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  And you see the city of New York underneath, and you see American Airlines on the left, United Airlines on the right.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  But one other thing you may have not seen, and it's at the very bottom of the fold, on the left-hand side, you'll see an ST.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  ST is the abbreviation of ST, like St. Gaudens, St. George, St. Lawrence. It's the ST, ST.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  On the other side, there is an IN at the very bottom on the fold, and people who are out there right now putting that thing together, you're folding it together.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  And you'll see the ST on the left and the IN on the other side, that's ST. And on the other side, IN, ST. IN, Satan.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  It is identifying this particular movement as Satanic. This is Satan. In our film, Skull and Bones, David Cox, who does this,
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  with me, is a former seminarian student. He understands what has happened to the Catholic Church.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  Initially, we were doing a thing called Vassals of the Vampire, which is about the neo-Kanazi co-option of the Christian conservative right.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  And I said, well, this takeover of the Church is much more prominent amongst the Protestants than it is the Catholics.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  He said, no, no, no, it's worse than I said. I couldn't believe it. But after doing a segment with him on the other film,
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  I discovered that now this thing will stand on its own, and alone. So we did Skull and Bones, the Catholic Connection, and it's an extremely important film.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  Anthony, you throw a website, not just a number, to get that.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  Yes, it's freeworldfilmworks.com.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  Freeworldfilmworks.com.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  There, Anthony, we're going to come right back. I've got to go to the right.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  Have you heard about American Free Press? American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  American Free Press, written by patriots, for patriots.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Standing firm for our Constitution. Standing firm against the New World Order.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Hammering the enemies of freedom. Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head on.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press. Get a free subscription to our online newsletter.

[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  AmericanFreePress, all one word,.net. Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been evaluating.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  He takes his hand off in year three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  I don't want to cut Anthony Hilder short, but we have Lindsay Williams scheduled in the next segment.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  I'm going to try to move him back 10 minutes so we can come back and take a few calls for Anthony Hilder.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  You could talk to this guy for 10 hours. He's got so much knowledge and he hones in on just one facet of the larger tapestry.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  The facts are the facts.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  You were making a film about the Protestants and the Neocons being infiltrated by the New World Order.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  I guess one of your Catholic friends really said, no, look at this.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  So you've made a film about that. I've seen most of your films. I haven't seen this new one.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  You say it, so it's Scullin' Bones and the Vatican's the name of the film?
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  Scullin' Bones, the Catholic connection.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  When you take a look at William Buckley Jr., who I used to like,
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  but he's the guy that brought in the Panama Canal's pay-away to the Chinese Communist.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  He's the guy that endorsed that and we take George Tennant.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  We take a look at his story on Abu Ghraib saying that, well, nothing was going on.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  It was all legal and then we overlaid the killings.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  And when we mix all of this together, it just comes out explosive. It's Scullin' Bones, the Catholic connection.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  And our next one to follow that on the same subject is about the Neoconazzi co-option of the Christian conservative right,
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  the Reverend Hagueys, the Pat Robertsons, and Pat had told me when I asked him about his hand over the heart, like the lion's claw.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  The lion's claw, which is a high-level Masonic signature.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  Yes, absolutely. On Time Magazine, he told me to put my hand somewhere and I just put it there.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  He perfectly lays it. It isn't a fist. He has the fingers out with only the front half of the fingers down.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  It's a clear salute.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  But I knew Pat when Bill Bright from Campus Crusader Christ introduced him to me. They brought him out to the studio.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  I was in charge of the old David Selvick studio where they did Gone with the Wind, but it was then called Laird International.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  And I talked to him about the New World Order. I asked him about his book, The New World Order, and some questions,
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  which he didn't seem to know because I said, did you write that book, Pat?
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  He said, oh, well, yes, yes, I wrote the book. I don't think so. Was he lying to me about this hand over the heart?
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  I know so. He said, well, I can't talk anymore. I've got to go now. And that was in San Diego. That was years ago.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  We have to take these visuals of like Satan and Uncle Sam. We have to put them together. It's clear.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  You see the ST on the left and the IN on the right.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  William David Cox, who did this film with me, is brilliant. He's been working on this stuff for years.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  And I would like to have Willie Nelson on our film on $10 a gallon. Lindsay Williams is on there.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Well, I can only ask for so much from Willie. I mean, I just got another email from him five minutes ago. That's the problem.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  But let me just try to get this other thing together and then we'll see what happens. I've got people calling me.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  You've got a vehicle which will go 458 miles on a gallon of fuel.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  Let's show that to Willie. You can only present so much to him, though. Let's go ahead and take some phone calls here.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to, let me see, who's first up here? Scott in Oregon, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  Hello.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Yeah, Scott, go ahead.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing, buddy? Good to hear from you. Good to hear you.
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  I appreciate you taking my call. I am a product of Mr. Hilder and yourself.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  And I want to thank the greater Austin area for the time I spent there. There's a man behind the scenes that does a lot of work there.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  And I think he needs to be mentioned. It's Steve Mason. He's a good friend of mine. And I want to give him a good thank you.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Yeah, Steve does an immigration show.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  Yeah, and he helps out in a lot of different ways. I want to give him the credit he deserves.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  Yeah, we're doing a radio show about issues and stuff. Yeah, I'm on that, sir.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Basically, I think the subliminal stuff and everything that's going on is a form of worship of this evil thing.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  Yeah, it's always putting its image in your face. That's mind control.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  There's no question that this is satanic. It is satanic by design. It's Luciferian.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  This New World Order isn't just a bunch of old rich men trying to get richer. They want it all. They want your soul.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  This is a Luciferian conspiracy.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  And by the way, folks, if you don't believe in God and the Devil, that's your issue. They do.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  The point is, you know, 10, 12 years ago, I would even laugh at this stuff until I went to Bohemian Grove and was with those men in the audience.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  They were taking it very, very seriously. And the ultimate in selfishness and greediness is to want to take people's lives and their futures.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  And that's why, in their heart of hearts, they want to kill everybody on the planet. Not just 80, 90% of us, they want to kill everybody.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Well, they want to kill us, control us, or incarcerate us. Kill, control, or incarcerate. And that's the option that you have unless you join us and incite a revelation.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Lindsey Williams, who is about to come on, is on our $10 a gallon.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  Stay there, stay there, stay there. I'll let you say how to normally get him.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  If you have any questions for brushing, seek professional assistance, or contact a poison control center immediately.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?

[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  I just talked to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date.
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  There is no doubt that we are headed into a major storm, economically, militarily, societally, on a planetary scale.
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  Final segment right now with Anthony J. Hilder.
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  He'll join us again next week for another hour.
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  We'll take a few final calls and then let him say hi to his friend,
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  Lindsey Williams, who's scheduled to join us in about six minutes.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to John Illinois. John, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  Hello, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. This is just a little bit off topic, but it is very important that I impart this to you.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  I had dinner with Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman last night, and I asked him the pointed question,
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  does he think the military will obey Bush's order to attack Iran?
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  And even though Bowman's been out of the loop for 25 years, he retired 25 years ago,
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  he permanently believes that they will not obey that order.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  Admiral Fallon wouldn't.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  Certainly, and he pointed that out, but because he's been out of the loop so long, I take it with a grain of salt.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  I think he may be more optimistic.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  But then I see the establishment, the Secret Service attacking We Are Change and Alex Jones, and this tells me that these people are getting desperate.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  They are scared.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  Well, I wish I just joined the American people. We're no threat to anybody. We're not the terrorists that carried out 9-11.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  There's no question that there is a fear amongst this evilarchy, and I call it an evilarchy because it is Luciferian.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  There is a fear of massive exposure, and the very best talk show in the world is the one that you are on right now with Alex Jones.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  He has done so much with so little for so many, for so long.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Well, Anthony, the enemy's been an overdrive with COINTELPRO and their mindless parrots attacking me, but that only lets me know that we are really having an effect.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  And it's the guess we bring on. It's the synergy of information. It's the callers. It's everything. It's the films. It's the celebrities we have on.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  All of it is really having a big effect, but it's very daunting for me to have this responsibility and to realize we are the tip of the spear, folks.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  You have found it. You are here. This is the ultimate resistance, so this is the best we've got.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  It doesn't mean it's perfect, but this is the ultimate right now.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  Well, it's all of us working together, and when I say all of us, I'm talking about the guy who calls in for the first time on the show and says,
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  look, I've got this little bit of information. It may not be real important, but it is.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  It's important that you pick up that phone and you call other talk shows around America, because your voice represents 10,000 people.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  We have to have a huge, intensifying, building wave of awakening, a renaissance, a revelation, as you say.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  And we've done that with false flag terror. Now people know about Inside Job. It's in the nomenclature. People are talking about it.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  It's in the vernacular. People are understanding it, and it's exponential.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  And I agree with you, Anthony. The enemy is back against the wall. Thank you, John.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  I want to go to Jimmy and Chris and everybody else.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  We've got to hurry, because Lindsey Williams, I've already backed him up a few minutes. We're about to get him online right now with very important information.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  Right now, let's go to Jimmy and Michigan. Jimmy, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  Hey, Anthony. Hey, thank you a lot for all of the tools that you've given me.
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  Illuminati, martial law, all of those videos. It's an excellent to wake people up with.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  I used them to wake up a lady named Sharon Rainier who's room for the United States Congress here in our 7th district.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  She knows I introduced her to Mark Hornke. She knows what's going on, and they just wrote a big hit piece on her in Ann Arbor News.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  But no big deal. So what? They write a news piece about her that says she's for hard money.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  They don't open fire on you in the Info War until you're hitting them.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  That's right. In the North American Union and things like that, they say she's crazy.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  A lot of people have called in. I can't even get through to the editor because we're always busy.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  People are just constantly calling and saying they're going to vote for her.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  Thanks for writing the hit piece, you know, because it's cool. All the Brown Paul people are now going to vote for her.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Absolutely. Got to jump. Absolutely. Let's take one.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  I want to go to Peggy in PA. Peggy, you're on the air with Anthony J. Hilder. Go ahead.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Hi, Alex. One of the things that sometimes gets overlooked is, for people like me, that Satan doesn't have any power over it just doesn't interest me.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  But for the people that, as you're saying, they do believe in it, and what kind of mind is interested in something like that?
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  And it's always, and it has been throughout history, someone who is very aggressive, someone who is very masculine in the sense that all the traditional masculine virtues
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  have been changed or warped into something that seems demonic to somebody like me.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  No, they're beasts. They're like ravenous beasts that goes about seeing who they can devour.
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  The Masonic goat is half woman, half man. At least that's the visual on it.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  The Masonic goat is bathamate, and the bathamate is the goat of Mendes, and the goat of Mendes is Satan.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  This is the seal of Satan, and it is the icon of the American nation.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  Whoever put that on is the same group of people who put that 666-foot penis in Washington, D.C. It's 555 feet above the ground.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  It's 111 feet below the ground. If you take a look at the configuration of the city of Washington, D.C., you'll see the Satanic pentagram.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  Absolutely. I've got to let Peggy go. I've got to let Peggy go. Do we have Mr. Williams?
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  He's all set.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  Okay. We need to get to Lindsay. Williams here for about 45 minutes. It's amazing information.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  But I wanted to give, because they're friends that know each other, I wanted to give Anthony Hilder a chance before we let him go.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  He's going to be back with us next week to say hi to Lindsay Williams, and also he's got Lindsay Wimms in his new film.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  You know, $10 a gallon gas that he's almost done producing.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  Well, Lindsay Williams is standing 10 feet tall. He came over to the ranch where we recorded this for a couple hours.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  We'll be able to use maybe five or six minutes out of the couple hours. That's what happens when we do shoots.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  But Lindsay has the inside scoop, and he talked about the massive amount of oil, which is off the North Slope.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  I've said it before, and he'll say it again, that there's enough oil up there using the abiotic oil that we do use.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  It's not fossil fuel. It has for 150 years, but we've got an ocean out there of energy.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  We can convert the water into hydrogen. We can end the fuel crisis and the crisis that will bring us down overnight.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  Okay, fire out your website, and we're going to let you go, Anthony.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  Yes, Free World Filmworks, and it's $800. If you want the number, 800-597-9250 for Skull and Bones, and we'll get to $10 a gallon.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  We have to avert this situation and have alternative fuels, and Willie is on board, as the late Dennis Weaver is on the film.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  It's essential at Free World Filmworks.com.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  Anthony, thank you for the time.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Thank you, and God bless, Lindsay.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  Brother, I don't know whether you can hear this right now, but he's standing 10 feet tall and is continuing in this fight.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  He says he's going to bow out some day soon, but I hope that he stays in.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  Okay, Anthony Holder, thank you, my friend. Yes, and Lindsay can hear you. Let's bring Lindsay Williams in right now.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  Lindsay, it's great to have you with us today.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  Thank you, Alex, for allowing me the privilege of being on your show today.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  Well, it's great to have you here. For those that don't know who you are, have been hiding under a rock,
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  in just a nutshell, a minute or two, an abbreviated history, tell us how you woke up, what we're facing,
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  and now you've got a lot of new info. You're saying you and your family are being threatened. You're going to be bowing out soon.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  I hope that's not the case. And then you say you've got new information from oil executive context that you have.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Your info is proven to be very accurate in the past. You've got some new bombshell info for everybody today.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  Everything that is going to take place in this world in the next 12 months, I plan to tell you in the next 45 minutes.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  Now, I'm not going to tell it from my standpoint. I'm going to give it to you directly from one of the people
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  who know everything that goes on behind the closed doors.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Basically, real quick, for a nutshell, I went to Alaska's missionary many years ago just after arriving there.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  The announced they were going to build the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline that 25,000 pipelines would converge on the state to build it.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  I went to Alaska Pipeline Service Company and said, would you not need a chaplain on the pipeline with that many wicked cuss and drinking folks?
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  And they said, yeah. And finally, they allowed me to have them hold them seven camps.
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  About six months later, they offered me executive status, which meant that for three years' time, I sat in the board meetings with,
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  lived in the same dorms with, rubbed shoulders with the elite of the world.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  Many people write books about these people by reading somebody else's book.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  There's no glossary in energy non-crisis because I wrote what I lived, literally, physically, lived with these people for three years,
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  was able to analyze them. As a result, I wrote my book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  Now, for the past 35 years, I have known that there is a line out there.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  I knew that if I ever crossed it, I was in trouble.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  People oftentimes have asked me, and I've never been willing to answer them, whence they have ever been threatened.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  I've never answered that on any radio talk show, even though I've been asked many, many times.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  I am answering that now.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  1984, it happened.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  And seven weeks ago, I had the most dawdling phone call that I've ever had in my life.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  On the other end of the line was a gentleman whom I knew well at Poodall Bay.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  He'd been in my services.
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  I knew him as one of the top.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  He knows everything that's going on.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  If anything's going to happen in the world, he knows it.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  Now, folks, let me pause here long enough, Alex, please, to say to your listening audience,
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  folks, you believe everything you hear from Alex Jones.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  I have the greatest admiration for him.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  I wish I had more opportunity to be on his show, but I guess it takes something like this for him to fight me.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  But anyway, I want you to believe everything he says. He's telling you the truth.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  He gives it to you like it is.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  And he talks about these people. They do exist.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  Their positivity is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  And Alex has tried his best to tell it to you.
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  And I'm going to prove it to you today because this is not a conspiracy.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  This is an agenda.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  So here's what happened to me.
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  This gentleman called me on the phone and he said,
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  Lindsay, you've gone too far. You're going to have to stop.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  He said, you can do this, this, this, and this.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  But he said, you can't do this, this, this, and this anymore.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  And he said, if you do, then we are going to do this, this, and this, and this.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  And what he said was not very pleasant for either my family or me.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  And you don't argue with these people.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  And these people say they're going to do something.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  If they have the power to tell the president what to do, dictate to Congress what bills to pass,
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  tell the Arabs what they're going to give them for a barrel of oil in a given day,
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  control the currencies of the world, and take the life of John F. Kennedy
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  because he was about to destroy the Federal Reserve.
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  They wouldn't have any problems at all with Lindsay Williams or Alec Jones.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  So I didn't argue with him.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  I immediately said, what do you want me to do?
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  And he told me.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  He said, you can do this and this, but he said, you can't do this and this anymore.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  And if Alec's asked me certain questions on the show today,
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  I'm going to not be able to answer you about certain subjects because if I did,
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  I would be in jeopardy.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  Well, as a result, within 24 hours' time, I closed down my website.
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  You don't believe me.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  You know how much your website's worth to a person.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  Well, go to my website and see.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  You'll see nothing but a front page, lwoil.com.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  I call them my 800 service and I said, under no circumstances,
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  do you ever sell another energy non-crisis DVD?
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  You pull it from the market and I don't care how much people want to offer you.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  You positively do not sell it to them under any circumstances.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  But what are the oil companies, Lindsay?
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  Lindsay, how do they think they're going to stop it being all over the web?
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  It's number one on Google routinely.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  Well, I told the gentleman this.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  I said there are thousands of that DVD out there.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  It's everywhere imaginable.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  From this point on, he said there are certain things you do not say.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  He said, we know that you can't do anything about things that have already been done.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  But he said, from this point on, you just positively do not do certain things.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  Now, let me guess.
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  You said things that are very nice.
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  Did he threaten to kill your wife and grandchildren?
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  I don't have any grandchildren.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  And as far as that question, I can't answer you, but I will put it this way.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  What he said was the kind of things that you and I positively don't want to happen.
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  So as a result, the few things that he said you can't do anymore
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  were not worth the things that I can do not being able to be said.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  So as a result, after we'd gotten through with our agreement,
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  and he said, now, if you're willing to do these things, he said, we'll let you alone.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  I decided I'd be friendly with him.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  This is where your listening audience comes in, Alex, because I'm going to tell you
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  everything that's going to happen for the next 12 months.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  I'm going to prove one up until you.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  And I am so glad that you're having Dr. Stan Monteith on just after I'm on.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  And I'll tell you why in just a moment.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  You have a perfect lineup of people on your program today,
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  because Dr. Stan was the very first person I went to after this happened.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  Now, I knew that.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  I called him on...
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  Yes.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  Go ahead.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  I called Dr. Stan on the phone just after this gentleman had called me,
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  and I said, Dr. Stan, this is what happened to me.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  I have the greatest respect for Dr. Stan, or probably any man on the face of the earth today
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  in his particular position, both because of his age, his wisdom,
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  and his spiritual atmosphere that he creates.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  And I said, Dr. Stan, here's what's happened.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  He said, Lindsay, your life, your family, you come first.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  He said, forget about everything else.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  And he said, why don't you call this man back?
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  He gave me his phone number.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  He said, why don't you call him back and ask him what you can say?
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  Well, here's what happened.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  After he got through with our agreement, he said...
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  I said to him, I said, how's your family been?
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  I decided I'd be polite if I could.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  And where have you been for the past 20 years since I last saw you at Prudhoe Bay?
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  He became very polite, very kind.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  And so I decided to ask him some questions.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  And I said, the price of crude oil, the price of gasoline at the gas pump,
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  it's really hurting the American economy.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  I said, would you mind telling me where it's going?
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  He said, yes, it'll probably go a little higher.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Now, he would not say how much.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  Folks, write these down.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  You can take this to the bank.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  And I'm going to show you one that you can already take to the bank
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  as off Thursday of last week.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  But anyway, remember this was seven weeks ago.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  And I gathered from what he said that it would probably go up another dollar
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  before the summer is over.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  And then he said something so startling, Alec,
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  that I am still sitting here shocked by what he said.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  He said, Chaplain Williams, the price of crude oil is going to $50 a barrel.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  My mind began running 1,000 miles an hour.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  $50 a barrel.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  First thing that came to my mind was, how are you going to do this?
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  So he knows.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  I mean, there are certain people in the world who know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  They have already planned it.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  It's an agenda.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  Lindsey Williams, stay there.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  I'm going to skip.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  I'm going to skip.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Lindsey, we've got a break.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  But we're going to skip the break.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  I just want you to know that.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  Everybody, for mfallwars.com, stream listeners,
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  you'll be able to hear what goes on behind the scenes for the next three minutes.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  I don't want to waste any time.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  If everybody else will be right back.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  And Lindsey, I'm going to briefly have Bob Chapman,
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  because he couldn't come on later, pop in,
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  because he wants to talk to you for just a few minutes when we get back.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  Then we'll complete your story.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  Stay with us.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  Okay.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  Okay.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  We're still on air.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  I just skipped that break, but I'm asking the folks in Minnesota,
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  do we have Bob Chapman?
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  Yes, Bob is here.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Okay.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Let him know.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  I'm going to come to him in three minutes when we come back to the full transmission.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  But I want to keep.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  I want to digress back first, Lindsey.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  We've got plenty of time going into the next hour.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  And if we need to, when Stan Monteef is on the last 30 minutes,
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  we can hold you over with him if you've got the time.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  But right now, getting back to these threats,
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  I guess you can't tell us.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  I mean, was it one of the oil company executives you knew up there?
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  Was it one of the government people that came out to Prudhoe Bay when you guys
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  now admittedly discovered more oil than Saudi Arabia?
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  I mean, you say you know this guy.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  Is this one of the people you worked with for three years?
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  Yes, I know him well.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  I've had many, many hours spent with him.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  I cannot give his name if I did.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  I would be in jeopardy to no end.
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  I will put it this way.
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  There are certain people who know everything that has been decided.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  Everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  Insiders.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  Yeah, and super insiders.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  So, but then in the past, you've told us one of them was an Atlantic Richfield guy,
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  but you can't say if that's who it is.
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  I positively cannot.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  If I did, I'd be in jeopardy.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  No, I mean, that's how this high level mafia stuff works.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  They give you a lot of times a chance.
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  And they say just shut up.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  But, but you're still here on air.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  They said you can still go on and talk about some things or does he want you to come out and say,
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  oil is going to be $50 a barrel?
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  Well, for five weeks time, I disappeared.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  I literally didn't do a single radio talk show.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  I didn't take a single speaking engagement.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  I'll admit to you, Alex, I was scared.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  And I remember I called Dr. Stan Monteith on the phone.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  I said, Dr. Stan, what should I do about this?
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  I said, here, I'm sitting knowing everything is going to take place in the world for the next 12 months.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  And I have a moral obligation to tell the world.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  But I said, I don't dare do it for the sake of myself and my family.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  He said, Lindsay, you have the phone number of this gentleman.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  Why don't you call him back and ask him about what you said?
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  I said, I said, okay.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  Well, we're going to get into that with a full audience in a moment.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  But I want to understand here.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  Was he saying they were telling him this and he was a messenger or was he threatening you?
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  I'm not quite sure.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  You see, this comes as a we, this, we, that.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  This is the way it's going to be.
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  You do this, you do that.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  They don't ever tell who they're going to.
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  You know the mob well enough to know.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  You know the people in the elite well enough to know that.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  No, that's exactly, listen, listen.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  We were going to make a big film production in Hollywood.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  I'm not going to get into it.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  And the producer, within days, people found out what he was doing, not even through channels.
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  I mean, they, they, and then he got a call saying, you know,
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  somebody will kill your kids from a general in the Air Force that he knew through his family.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  And boy, he backed off real quick, but that's insane.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  Lindsay, we're going back to the full audience.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Listen, I don't mean to bifurcate the interview, but I want to bring Bob in for some comments about what you're saying.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  Then we'll let him go quickly and then get into your full story.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  Here we go.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  Pastor Lindsay Williams, best selling author is our guest so much of what he wrote about in his books and lectures came true.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  And we do know they have giant oil reserves in Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico that they have blocked to keep the price of oil up.
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  I want to bring in Bob Chapman because he's very busy because Bob wrote a big article titled Paper Sold to Pools of Aquidity.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  And Bob has said there's this masses of oil.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  It's proven, it's documented, which it is.
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  Bob, you know, has analyzed all this, but he has said that he thinks it's a couple years away before they fully crashed the dollar,
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  massive inflation, then deflation comes and he said that months ago on the show.
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  He sees oil plunging at a certain point.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  So I wanted Bob to be able to ask a few questions of Lindsay Williams and make his point for this segment and the next.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  And then we're going to give Lindsay Williams the total floor to say whatever he wants.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  But we've got to have Bob on now. We couldn't have him on later. So for that, I apologize to Lindsay Williams.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  Bob Chapman, go ahead. You can talk to Lindsay Williams.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Well, I'm wondering what the gentleman who called you bases the information on. Do you know?
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  When a person that you know is in the position that this individual is says something, you don't ask him where you got his information because you already know.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  You see, there's a difference, Bob, in what I have written and what the average author writes.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  And that is the average author tries to sit back and analyze these people by reading everybody else's book imaginable.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  I lived with them. Having been a pastor for 12 years prior to going to Alaska as a missionary, having a bachelor's degree, having studied psychiatry,
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  being able to analyze these people one-on-one, not in my church, but on their oil field, sitting across the dinner table from them.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  I knew that whenever one of these, and in particular this one, whenever he said what he said,
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  I had no problem whatsoever knowing that he knew everything he was saying. I didn't ask him any questions. I knew better than to.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  So what you're saying, outside of the natural forces that would normally dictate what oil and gasoline might do,
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  other forces are at play that the gentleman says will drive prices down on oil to $50 a barrel and perhaps a gasoline to $2.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  He said it just as if he had just returned from the board meeting.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  As casually as you and I are talking on Alex Jones' show and I did not ask him for it, I had asked him where the price of gasoline was going
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  and he said slightly higher and then he said out of a clear blue sky, the price of crude oil is going to $50 a barrel.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  When? When is he saying this is going to happen, Lindsay?
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  I tried to find out exactly when he would not give me a date. I did ask him how.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Okay, well that's key because Bob's saying that will happen.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  How? How? How? How?
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  How is he going to do it? That's the first question I asked. I didn't ask him because I first wanted to know how.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  I said how are you going to do this? And again, just as positively as if he had had it on a sheet of paper written in front of him,
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  he said we're going to open up two major oil fields in the world that the world doesn't even know exist yet.
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  Now remember this was seven weeks ago, approximately.
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Okay, stay there Lindsay, back in 70 seconds with Bob Chapman and Lindsay Williams.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  And think about this, Lindsay Williams when we get back.
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  See the problem is they bought up all the refineries globally and so even if they found an ocean of oil,
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  it takes about three years to build a refinery as you know, even if they found an ocean of oil, which we know they do have,
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  they're not going to let that be brought to market. So I'm trying to understand this, we'll be right back.
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  Tell them to both stand by, okay, our beloved republic is on her knees.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Okay, you still want Dr. Stan at eight after, correct?
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  No, that's not what my sheet is.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  Besides, it takes about three years to build a refinery as you know, even if they found an ocean of oil which we know they do have,
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  they're not going to let that be brought to market. So I'm trying to understand this, we'll be right back.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:58:59.000]  but in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  We're now into hour number four.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  Lindsay Williams is our guest. I want to state that I completely respect Lindsay Williams.
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  He's a wonderful patriot, a wonderful pastor. His info has all proven out to be golden.
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  And on record, we know he was the chaplain. We know he was in the executive branch with Atlantic Richfield.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  And we know that what he says is true from hundreds of other sources.
[2:59:56.000 --> 2:59:59.000]  He's just an insider, so a window directly into those boardrooms.
[2:59:59.000 --> 3:00:05.000]  So I believe that he believes everything he's saying, and I believe this executive told him this,
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  whether he's twisting or spinning or knows how influential Lindsay Williams is.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  Is he trying to plant this info with him? I doubt that because Lindsay called him back and got this.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  This guy wasn't pushing it on Lindsay. So I think that's a key piece of info.
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  So I believe he's been threatened. We all get threatened here, our families.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  Bob Chavin, myself, our families, our women, our children.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  And I've just said, you know, I've already cast my doubt. I'm going all the way. I'm not.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  But I understand what Lindsay's doing. He's put his info out.
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  You know, he's older. He doesn't want his wife and family getting murdered.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  And I hate to even have to bring these things up, but that's obviously what's happened.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  Lindsay, the point is, you know they bought up the refineries to stop other Wildcats from bringing oil and gas in.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  And that's come out even in the Associated Press, something you talked about years ago,
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  then materialized five years after I heard you talk about it.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  So I really respect and believe what you're saying, that at least they're talking about this.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  I think what Bob Chapman's saying is the pipelines aren't done in the stands.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  Even the ships couldn't bring in what they need.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  It would take about a year or two to build more pipelines out of Alaska.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  I know that could drive it down to $50 a barrel.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  So that's very doable. And now we know the key here that you're saying he didn't really say when.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  So it could be two, three years out, like Bob's saying.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  Some people were representing this as if it was in six months a year.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  Lindsay Williams.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  Alex, when I give you the two oil fields that they plan to open up, you'll understand that this is so bizarre.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  And so far fetched from anything that you and I have thought off until it's literally going to blow your mind.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  I said, where, how are you going to bring this to $50 a barrel?
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  Now forget about America, forget about Alaska, forget about oil fields.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  They have no intentions in opening up any of them.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  He said, we're going to open up an oil field in Indonesia already known, already ready to go.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  You don't know about it. They haven't announced it to the world yet.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  And he said, we're going to open up one depth of Russia.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  Flood the world with cheap crude oil.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  Bring the price to $50 a barrel.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  Alex, that was seven weeks ago, but watch this.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Thursday of last week, July the 24th, 2008.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  Verify this with Dr. Stan when he comes on over the next hour because this will literally send cold chills up and down your spine.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Mind you, this man told me this seven weeks ago.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  And on Thursday of last week, Fox News came out with a headline story of eight oil fields north of Russia.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  identical same spot that this man told.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  And you were saying this.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  Well, you went bigger than Saudi Arabia, 90 billion barrels.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  And you went public, what, a week or so before all this happened?
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  I went public a week before it all happened.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  And when Dr. Stan had me on his program last Friday, he was almost shaking.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  You could hear his voice on the air.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  Okay, let's see.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  You were told this seven weeks ago, and they announced it yesterday.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Okay, let me bring Bob Chapman in.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  Do they have the pipelines in Russia and in Indonesia to cause something like that to happen?
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  And how do they get passed?
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  They're not being refinery capacity for that, Bob.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  I just don't know.
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  I don't know, but I have to assume that even if they're in operating areas, it's still going to take a while.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  But then we don't know when they're going to announce this, when they're going to start this.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  And so we have to decide, you know, what the timing is.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  I can give you the timing if you'd like.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  Pardon me?
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  I can give you the timing if you wish.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Oh, well, please do that.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  The first thing he said was $50 a barrel.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  The second thing he said was the two places they're going to open them.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  That is going to plunge the price of crude oil all over the world for $50 a barrel.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  And the reason they're doing it is the next question I ask him.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  I said, why are you doing this?
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  This is what will startle the world, and you can take it to the bank.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  The reason that Dr. Stan said on this program on Friday,
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  he said the reason, Lindsay, that I can believe this now is because he said,
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  you told me this seven weeks ago.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  No, I know. Stay there. Stay there.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  I know we're going to have him on. Stay there. Here we go.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  We're going to talk behind the scenes.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  Okay, we're continuing.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  I skipped that break, too, gentlemen.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  I mean, I think the question that Bob Chapman's getting at here is that you had said that he wouldn't say exactly when,
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  but then you're saying you do know when. I mean, do you have a ballpark?
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  What did he say specifically on that, Lindsay?
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  Yes, and here's what he said when I asked him why are you going to do this?
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  He said, we're doing this because, okay, number one, he said,
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  I ran his worrying us to no end.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  He said, I ran his becoming one of the wealthiest nations on the face of the earth.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  I said, are you talking about I ran in Boris, the bank?
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  Many countries doing business now besides the American dollar.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  He indicated in his way of saying it, yes.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  And basically, in a nutshell, here are their plans.
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  They are going to utterly decimate the Middle East.
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  Can you imagine crude oil being taken from $143 a barrel where it hit at a peak to $50 a barrel?
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  Well, that just won't bankrupt the Middle East. It'll bankrupt the dollar.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  Well, that's exactly, Alec, you hit them. I'm so glad you're thinking ahead of me.
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  You can also make the price of gold go up, too.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:46.000]  When the Arab world must maintain their economy.
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  There's a few shakes and cheeks over there.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:51.000]  There were nothing but nomads roaming the desert fighting camels 100 years ago.
[3:05:51.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  Oil companies went in there and made them.
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  Now, I studied history. I had a history minor in college.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  About every 75 to 100 years, they will destroy one culture.
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:04.000]  They did it in the first and second world war. They turn around and make another culture.
[3:06:04.000 --> 3:06:07.000]  That's exactly what they're in the process of doing right now.
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:10.000]  They are going to utterly decimate the Arab culture.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  The few shakes and cheeks will have to get rid of all of their reserve currency of American dollars overnight
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  in order to be able to try to even maintain some semblance of economy over there
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  because they have a socialistic economy whereby they give the people everything
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  from schooling to housing to medical to, you name it, and all of a sudden it goes to $50 a barrel.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  They can't buy our T-Bills anymore. They can't buy our Federal Reserve issues anymore.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  We have a $10 trillion national debt now plus.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  And what happens to the American dollar when this happens?
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  Going through the floor overnight.
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  Bob, this fits in. I mean, we'll see if it happens.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  Lindsay's been accurate in the past.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  I believe he believes what he's saying that this fella did tell him that.
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  But boy, that is a reckless operation if that's what they're planning.
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  Bring down the U.S. and the Arabs.
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Left standing is Europe and Russia.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  And then move their New World Order centers to those places.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  We're going to get Bob Chapman's take on this and let him go
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  when we come back to the full audience just a moment.
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  And then let Lindsay Williams roll.
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  And then I want to keep Lindsay Williams on in 20 minutes when Monteef joins us
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  so they can all discuss whatever they want.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  So here we go with Bob Chapman and Lindsay Williams.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  Very appreciative of Lindsay Williams coming on
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  even though he's under threat on this show today.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  Here we go.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  Okay, I want Lindsay Williams to recap their master plan.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  What the big oil baron told him they're planning to do.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  And again, Lindsay's only had accurate info in the past.
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  It was the chaplain for the executives up there when they found
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  the giant oil reserves in Alaska.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  He's been exposing it, talking about it.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:54.000]  He's been threatened.
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  He's still coming on there to discuss it.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  But Bob Chapman, any other questions or comments
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  you've got here for Lindsay Williams?
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  No, I think that we know the groundwork.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  And my synopsis from a research point of view
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  and a psychopolitical warfare point of view,
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  a difference from what the gentleman he talked to said.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  But then again, I'm not on the inside.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  Maybe this gentleman is.
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  But I see a lessening of problems with Iran.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  There's been negotiations going on with them for two years.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  And I think that they're soon going to come to an agreement.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  And I see more problems in other areas of the world.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  As far as flooding the market with oil, it's possible.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  Maybe even probable.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  I think there's a time element that will be attached to it
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  like we discussed earlier in the program.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  And so I think it could be down the line a ways.
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  And I think in the absence of warfare in the Middle East
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  that oil probably wouldn't go much higher.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  And on the other hand, Lindsay believes that through his contact
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  that oil will go substantially higher
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  because deported in my parlance,
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  the Middle East is going to become a free fire zone.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  And that's possible.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  But I don't believe that's going to happen.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  I disagree with his fellow that he's talking to.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  But then again, he's on the inside.
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  But I've been studying this for 50 years.
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  And I have got a pretty good track record.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  Well, regardless, all the policies show,
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  and the trend shows, the dollar going down.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  And what would a flooding in the market do?
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  Because a jacking of the oil up hurts the dollar.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  Bringing it down to a mid-level helps the dollar.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  But plunging it, doesn't that too hurt the dollar?
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  Well, I think one would offset the other.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  And I think that people have got to look
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  at the underlying reason why the dollar's weak.
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  And it's not because of oil prices.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  It's caused an effect.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  And the effect is high oil prices and food prices
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  and prices for other things.
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  And that's not changing in the next three years.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  OK.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  No, because they can't change the system
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  because if they don't create money and credit
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  and that continues to devalue the dollar,
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  then there will be still upward pressure normally on oil
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  because it's reflected they want to make up
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  for what they're losing.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  And it's a hard combination, but...
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  But if they devalued oil,
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  that would then take the pressure off the dollar.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  Only to an extent, because these people
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  at the Federal Reserve continue to increase
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  the supply of money and credit by 15% to 18% a month,
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  and they're not the only ones doing it.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  OK.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  Theinternationalforecaster.com.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  I really appreciate it.
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  OK.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  Thank you, Lindsay.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  There goes Bob Chapman.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  OK.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  I wanted to bring him in just to get a different perspective
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  in this.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  Lindsay, you have the floor.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  All the issues.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  Recap the master plan.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  What this executive told you?
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  Let us in on it.
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  I can tell you only what he told me.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  Exactly how it's going to play out.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  I'm quite sure Bob Chapman is much more knowledgeable
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  on that than I.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  And for the past 35 years, as all of you know,
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  all I have done is told what I have been told
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  at different times by the elite.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  And so far, I cannot take any credit for it being true.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  It's only true because of the providence of God
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  and that I was allowed to know these people
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  and have been in touch with some of them from time to time.
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  As a result, they have told me some things.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  They haven't told me all things.
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  They've told me some things.
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  And as a result, I have been willing to give it out to the world
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  just as you have done a marvelous job
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  of giving out what you have known, Alex.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  So from this point on, I will try my best to tell you
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  what this man indicated to me.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  First of all, $50 a barrel.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  Secondly, how is he going to do it?
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  Or how are they going to do it?
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  These people do exist.
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  This is an agenda, not a conspiracy.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  I'm sorry.
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  I asked you, listen, these people, they control the world.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  They know what they're doing.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  So anyway, he said, we're going to open up an oil feeling
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  in Indonesia north of Russia, flood the world with oil.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  I gathered from what he said,
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  even though he wouldn't admit to it.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  I talked about war with Iran.
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  Now, I have been under the impression for a long time
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  that there would probably be a war with Iran.
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  I'm gathering from what he said
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  that the best way to destroy them,
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  because right now, our president couldn't go to war with Iran.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  They called it due to super-America wouldn't stand for a draft.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  The monetary system is in such shabby shape
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  until there's no way.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  And what he indicated was that they're basically
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  going to financially break them.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  Take it to $50 a barrel.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  Put the Arabs back to roaming the deserts riding camels.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  That beautiful five-star city over there of Dubai,
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  what you're going to turn out to be.
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  You'll probably turn out to be a ghost town.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  And they're going to turn around and build new cultures
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  that they have done for the past 75 to 100 years in the past.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  And this is what's so startling.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  Alex, oh, it scares me to even think about it.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  We're going to have to compete with Russia again.
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  We're going to have another cold war,
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  because here, as was announced by Fox News on last Thursday,
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  Russia now being equal with Saudi Arabian oil output,
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  wherever they can produce eight times more than in Saudi Arabia,
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  90 billion barrels of recoverable oil
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  announced officially by the Coastal and Geodetic Service
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  of the USGS and Fox News on last Thursday.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  This is going to make Russia one of the major contenters
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  of the world, both financially and oil.
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  We're going to have another great cold war.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  They're going to turn around, destroy the Middle East culture.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  They're going to suddenly decimate it and build new cultures
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  in Indonesia and Russia.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  And this, to me, is so startling.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  I hate to even think about what could take place.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Now, the CEO of ExxonMobil,
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  and you go back up and look this up for yourself,
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  said on May the 3rd of 2008, he said,
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  quote, crude oil should be $50 a barrel.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  Now, that was May the 3rd of 2008.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  How did he know that?
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  How did the man that called me know it?
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Why did they both have the identical same figure?
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  The reason they did, because both of them
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  know the same boardrooms behind the same closed doors,
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  and they know exactly what it is that they plan to do.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  Then, oh my goodness, Alex, I hope,
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  I don't know how to even recognize this.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  Then he said to me, he said,
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  Chaplain Williams, he said,
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  John McCain is our man.
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  He was rather odd how he went from subject to subject
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  because he was very friendly and talkative with me.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  And he said, John McCain is our man.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  And at that point, oh my goodness,
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  my mind was running so fast, and I thought to myself,
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  what are they going to do?
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  Now, he didn't say that they were going to bring crude oil
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  to $50 a barrel before the election.
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  He did not say that.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  I asked him, and he wouldn't admit it.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  He wouldn't say it.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  They wanted to do something.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  I gathered just before the election to be assured
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  that their man gets in office.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  And he said, whatever it takes,
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  we will try everything possible to see to it
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  that he gets into office, and John McCain is their man
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  for what it's worth.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  Why?
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  And I'm not saying who I'm for or who I'm against.
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  I'm just saying that's what the man said.
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:05.000]  Then I asked him the question,
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  in light of all of this, $50 a barrel oil.
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  You're going to open up these two major oil fields.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  These countries will become rich and great
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  as the Arabs are today.
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  You're going to totally decimate the Arabs.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  You're going to put them back into
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  Nomad's Roman Cadets' writing camels.
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  You're going to change the whole world around
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  and make Russia a great power again.
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  I said, what can the United States of America
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  expect at this point?
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  And I'm going to try my best to tell you
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  exactly what he said.
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  He said, Lindsay, the United States of America
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  is going to see a financial collapse
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  that is going to be so great
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  that it will take years for it to come out of it.
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  Now, please note these words,
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  because over the next 15 minutes,
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  he talked with me for about an hour and 15 minutes,
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  and when he finished that last 15 minutes,
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  he kept saying it over and over and over.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:03.000]  He repeated it.
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:07.000]  It is going to take years for the United States of America
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:09.000]  to come out of this, and I asked him the question.
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  I said, are you talking about a 1929 depression?
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  He wouldn't admit to that. He would not say that.
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  He said, I am saying that America is going to see
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  a financial collapse that will be so great
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  that it will take years for it to come out of it.
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  Now, there are a lot of things that we could read
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  between the lines and all of this.
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  I've tried my best to tell you just what I think,
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  to the best of my knowledge, may look like,
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  but I've told you exactly to the best that I could,
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  what they have planned, and with these things in light,
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  I decided that I had to tell the American people what I know.
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  Even though you're under...
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  As a result, I've been willing to appear
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:53.000]  on a few radio talk shows here in Yon
[3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  and have just finished producing a DVD entitled
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:17:59.000]  The Next 12 Months.
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:01.000]  I decided I had to give it out
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  and give the basic points and then let you go from there
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  as to what you think.
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  So, we've just completed this past week
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  a DVD approximately an hour long
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  entitled The Next 12 Months.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  Now, I had to do something else also.
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  In order to even have an energy non-crisis DVD,
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  which I've had for years in my book, Energy Non-Crisis,
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  we had to go back and take certain things out of it.
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  And you'll know whenever you look at the new 2008 version
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  of my Energy Non-Crisis DVD,
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  you'll know what it is that I can't talk about anymore
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  because you'll notice those things are missing.
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  But the other things we left in,
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  and he told me very upfront...
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  Why are they saying it's okay for you to say one area
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:45.000]  but not the other?
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  Oh, very easily.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  And here's the reason why, Alex.
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  They have no intentions whatsoever
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  of allowing any American oil fields to be produced.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  Alaska, that huge oil field up in Montana,
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:01.000]  the one in Utah, they have no intentions
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  of allowing any of this to be developed.
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:07.000]  America is going to be kept dependent on foreign oil
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  and what I say in my book about Alaska oil
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  and the things that you...
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  Stay there. Stay there.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  We gotta break. We're gonna talk behind scenes.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  But bottom line, they build up Russia and China,
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  give them unlimited oil, turn us off.
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  We're totally in debt.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  We implode Third World Police State.
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  We'll get your take on that summation right now.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  Okay, do we have Stan Monteef?
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  Yeah, I'm calling right now.
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:35.000]  Okay, we're gonna get him on after this break,
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  but this is still on air for the Internet pastor,
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Lindsey Williams.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  This is amazing because I know you gave accurate info
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  the last 15 years.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:47.000]  I know that you're telling the truth
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  and that these are high-powered people you're involved with
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:51.000]  and I believe you've been threatened.
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  And it actually makes perfect sense, the diabolical.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  And I've always said the new order throws curveballs
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  and we're certainly gonna find out if he's right
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  or he's putting out this info,
[3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:03.000]  you know, this guy that's feeding you this information,
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:05.000]  but it was always accurate in the past.
[3:20:05.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  We'll find out in the next 12 months is what you're saying, Lindsey,
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:09.000]  because we keep getting back to that.
[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:11.000]  He wouldn't tell you when it was happening,
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  but you're saying the next 12 months.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  How do you come to that?
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  Well, then how do you say the next 12 months?
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  I think that we can see...
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  I'm quite sure we're gonna see this $50 barrel of oil
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  begin to develop.
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  Okay, so from the info you have,
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  you are drawing that conclusion.
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  I'm drawing the conclusion that I'd like to tell people
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  within the next 12 months
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  everything that I know that they have to look forward to
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  in the future.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  All right.
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:39.000]  Well, all the big economic experts we have on agree
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  it could happen in the next 18 months
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  to 36 months, this implosion.
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  And then they say it'll run up through hyperinflation
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  and dive into basically a debt economy
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  with nothing but debt and plunging prices,
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  but the currency destroyed.
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  I mean, is that the info you're getting?
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  Yes, very definitely.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  The currency is on its way out.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  Now, whenever they take it to $50 a barrel,
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  the Arab world can no longer buy our T-bills
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  and our Federal Reserve issues.
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  That's it, yeah.
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  They have to dump their reserve currency,
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  which is the American dollar,
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  and dump it trillions of dollars at a time overnight.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  No, to maintain their economies,
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  it is gonna collapse the American dollar
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  and every good of that is in perfect line
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  to bring in the North American Union
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  and to issue a new currency.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  Yes, which they need, which the neuron documents,
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  they admit that they want to re-monetize the debt
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  under a new North American Union currency,
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  and they also said in the Security and Prosperity Partnership
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  meetings that Judicial Watch sued
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  and got that they plan to use economic,
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  terrorist, and military crises,
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  and that they would then say that the North American Union
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  was the answer to that
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  and that Security and Prosperity Partnership
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  to give us that security and to, quote,
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  give us prosperity to get the economy going again,
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  that the SPP will be the new bubble
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  or the new Ponzi scheme that they launched
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  that is offered as the solution,
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  but that he was telling you it's not gonna be a solution.
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  They plan a long de-evolution of our economy
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  and our culture.
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  That is exactly right.
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  In fact, this is the tool that they would use
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  to accomplish what they will.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  Alex, the very thing that you've been animating about
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  for a long time, but all he did was gave me
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  the intricate tools about which they plan to do it.
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  We're gonna come in with Monty.
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  Can you stay with us another 30 minutes?
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  Gladly.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  Okay, good.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  We'll just take you right to the end.
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  That's about 37 minutes.
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  Exactly 37 minutes.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  We're gonna be back on the main transmission in one minute.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  Everybody watching on the web.
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  We're gonna post the audio of this
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com,
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  truthnews.us, prismplanet.tv, jonesreport.com,
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  all of our websites.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  We want you to get this audio, this vital interview
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  because this is different from some of the others.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  It's bringing in a lot of other integrated information
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  for a big picture, three-dimensional overlay
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  of what we're facing.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  Lindsay, fire out because you said you've shut down
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  the other side.
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  What is the new site where people can get the new DVD?
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  Please call 800-321-2900.
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  Ask for my new energy non-crisis 2008 DVD.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  And the next 12 months, I would urge you,
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  for those of you who don't have what's happening
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  to the farmers, get my entire set of eight DVDs
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  at a very reasonable price.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  I only have 600 energy non-crisis left,
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  and we will never reprint.
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  I do not plan on reprinting.
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  Let me just tell you right now.
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  There are 600 people that call you free of charge as a gift.
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  Wow.
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:43.000]  I want to buy some of those before you get rid of them,
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:46.000]  so save me a few for the infowars.com bookstore.
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  Here we go.
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  Dr. Stan Montief joins us for the next 34, 35 minutes
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  that we have left in live airtime.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  Syndicated radio talk show host, medical doctor,
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  expert on every facet of the New World Order.
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  He broadcasts himself five hours a day.
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  And last time I checked, it may be more or less now.
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  And he is on, isn't it close to 100 stations total
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  around the country, Dr. Montief?
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  Well, we have 65 outlets.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  But some of those are 63 outlets, I think.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  And some of them are short-wave, some are internet.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  Well, I know they go up and down from time to time.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  You have been 100 affiliates,
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  because I remember that number before.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  Right.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  Well, no, I wish I had that many affiliates.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  OK, so it's 63.
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  Anyway, I'm happy to have what we have
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  because we need to get the people to understand
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  what you talk about, what I talk about.
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  Well, that's about how many affiliates we have.
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  But that's just amazing, Dr. Montief.
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  We've got Lindsey Williams on.
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  He's been laying the sound.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  He told you about this long before he went public
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  in the last two weeks.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  And then now so much of what he's already saying
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  is manifesting, you've got the floor in a nutshell.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  Tell us what we're dealing here with,
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  with the information being brought forward
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  by Lindsey Williams.
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  Well, the only thing I really have to contribute
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  is the fact that probably about seven weeks ago,
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  seven or eight weeks ago,
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  I called Lindsey after he'd taken his website down.
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  I think it was probably about seven weeks ago.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  And I said, Lindsey, what happened?
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  And he told me about his experience,
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  which he shared with you, being told that
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  he was not to be allowed to bring out certain facts
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  about the things he'd been talking about in the past.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  But he told me that he'd talked to this very high official
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  in the British Petroleum
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  who had basically told him what the future held
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  and the fact that the price of oil was going to come down,
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  that they were going to announce
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  that they had these large oil deposits,
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  one in Indonesia and this other one,
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  not close to Russia somewhere in the Arctic Circle.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  He didn't mention Arctic Circle, but close to Russia.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  And of course, what was amazing was
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  that these things are coming to pass.
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  It was about two weeks ago that the price of oil started to fall
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  in many areas now.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  The price of gasoline is less than $3 a gallon.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  But the most significant thing was,
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  and I will have to admit, Alex,
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  when I heard the report that the US Geological Survey
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  had announced that they had 90 billions of oil
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  up above the Arctic Circle,
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  and of course Russia and the US were going to be competing for it,
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  why it set a chill down my spine.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  Obviously, what Lindsay was told is true,
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  and of course, I mean, this is truly prophetic,
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  but of course along with that comes the prediction
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  that they're going to be terrible,
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  catastrophic financial situation in America.
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  And one of the things Lindsay told me was that when he asked
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  what was going to happen to America, he was told
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  they're going to be very terrible and difficult times
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  for the American people.
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  Every misconfirmed by somebody in a key position,
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  one of those people who rules the world,
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  or knows the people who rules the world,
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  I think gives tremendous credence to what Lindsay has said.
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  I feel very privileged to be playing a little small part
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  of this only if nothing else to verify what Lindsay is saying.
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  Lindsay, your comments on what Dr. Monteef is saying.
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  Well, as I said a few moments ago,
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  the first person I called after this old person called me
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  was Dr. Stan because I admire his wisdom so much,
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  his age and his Christian background.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  Dr. Stan is a privilege by the providence of God
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  that you own this program today because when Alex
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  produced a call and asked me to be on, he said,
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  did you know that Dr. Stan Monteef was asked to be on today?
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  So I know that the providence of God that you and I both are here
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  at the same time so that you can verify these things.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  And likewise, it was just as startled when I heard them all.
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  And as a result, it's a privilege to be able to tell
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  the American people what the elitists have planned.
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  And Alex, I need to say to your audience again,
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  folks listen to everything Alex Jones says.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  Sometimes you may think it sounds a little outlandish,
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  but he hasn't missed it.
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  And he's right on.
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  There is a conspiracy.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  I mean, there is not a conspiracy.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  There is an agenda.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  These people do exist just like you've heard Alex say.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  So even though I may not be on the radio every day,
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  because I don't have my own show,
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  do you listen to everything Alex Jones says
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  and Dr. Stan Monteef says?
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  Because they have been trying to tell you this for years.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  Well, people are finally waking up.
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  The big, gigantic, liberal website Daily Costs,
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  one of their top writers, has done a huge report admitting
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  there's a world government, a new world order
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  that owns both parties, that they're basically eugenicists.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  And Dr. Monteef, are you seeing the same thing
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  that there is a huge awakening taking place right now?
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  I'm sure there is.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  I think more and more people are beginning
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  to be hit by the declining economy
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  and they see the value of their currency
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  and their life savings being eroded.
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  I think we're just on the brink of a great awakening
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  across America.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  We're going to talk about that, Doc.
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  Doc, when we get back, we're going to take this three-minute break
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  and we'll be right back to both of you
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  on the other side of Dr. Stan Monteef,
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  Lindsay Williams, infowars.com, stay with us.
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:45.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[3:29:45.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFAR.
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:54.000]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:56.000]  to grow at our own door.
[3:29:56.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:04.000]  An inside job.
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  How dare you?
[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:12.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:30:12.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  Truth rising.

[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  finalized a contract in London,
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:45.000]  and demoed our new product in Boston,
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  online from my desk with WebEx.

[3:30:56.000 --> 3:31:00.000]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  But there is something you can do.

[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  You can hear the whole shackles on me just by Googling it.
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  I sat down with big brother
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  and watched Jimmy play at the Texas Independence Day rally we had
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  against the North American Union last year.
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  Don't want to chip in my own pocket.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  We're going to go back to Lindsey Williams and Auderman T.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  for the balance of the radio show.
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  I do want to tell the listeners about a few of our sponsors
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  that make this radio show possible.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  One of them is eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  That's the website for the J. Michael Stevens Grip,
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  the longest continually operating storeable foods company
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  in the nation.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  I don't know what's 27, 28 years.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  I've gotten storeable foods from them four times.
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  It's freeze dried and dehydrated.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  That means a lot of food fits in very small containers
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  last more than 10 years in climate controlled areas,
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  10 years in non-climate controlled areas.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  And you can give them a call and get a free brochure
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  of all the high quality non-GMO foods.
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  They have 1-800-409-5633 with food prices exploding.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  They're only going to go up.
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  It's important to have storeable foods
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  in the number one way governments control you
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  and the dangerous times we're going into.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  Also, I'd known about this for about 10 years,
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  but I thought, hey, this is great.
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  We've got one in the office. Let's get them as a sponsor.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  And we did. They're ColoBlue.
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  And ColoBlue.com is the website.
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  E-C-O-L-O, Blue.com.
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  Big banner up on infowars.com.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  ColoBlue.com.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  You can sell it within one year if you buy your water.
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  From the store, pure clean water without the fluoride.
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  Unlimited water for the humidity and the air.
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  I know exactly what you're drinking.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  In the desert, it does about half of that.
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  Low operating cost.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  On average, it costs about 12 cents a gallon.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  The generated water is passed through five filters,
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  included reverse osmosis and carbon.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  Simple to use, great tasting, pure H2O.
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  Exactly what the way nature makes it.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  Natural pH.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, you give me a call at 1-866-585-4044.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  1-866-585-4044, or ColoBlue.com.
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  Again, a banner on infowars.com.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  And in closing, be sure and visit the infowars.com
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  online video and bookstore for the scores of different titles,
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  videos, and books we carry, including my 19 films,
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  the newest one, Truth Rising and Endgame.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  Going back to Lindsey Williams and Dr. Stan Monteef,
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  looking at what that was going to affect the United States
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  and how the globalists are planning to bring in their New World Order
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  with this information you're bringing forward here, Lindsey,
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  and I wish you weren't a credible source.
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  I wish this wasn't true.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  I mean, I wish that you hadn't been told this.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  I mean, it could be disinfo.
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  I tend to doubt it.
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  It seems to actually fit into everything we're looking at here.
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  Did he say anything else? Any other tidbits, this executive that you knew,
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  back when you were there with the oil company in Alaska, told you,
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  and then any other key points that you and Dr. Monteef want to cover,
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  you guys have the floor.
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  This will have a major impact on America.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  The one thing that he did say, which I noticed that I haven't said yet,
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  was he said the huge oil field in Indonesia and the one north of Russia,
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  he said, we know, non-reserves are there,
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  that are more than all of the Middle East combined.
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  Now, please note this, all of the Middle East combined.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  Saudi Arabia, take Iran, Iraq, take Dubai,
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  Arab Emirates, all of the Middle East.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  Put them together.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  And these two oil fields have more oil in them.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  Now, this was alluded to by the Coastal and Geodetic Service on Fox News
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  on Thursday of this past week.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  One of the oil fields, they haven't announced the next one yet.
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  This means then that no American oil field will be open.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  This is going to affect the economy and that Alaskan oil is not going to be released.
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  We'll not get the monetary advantage of being able to produce from our own fields.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  We will still be kept dependent on foreign oil.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  They have no intentions in allowing other methods of transportation to be developed.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  I say this so emphatically because I have seen it not from what this gentleman said,
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  but what I have seen all of these other little things from ethanol to you name it.
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  These things are just kind of little pill-de-side lines with them.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  They know exactly that they have no intentions in allowing any of this to be increased or built in America.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  So I would urge you folks, and here again, I don't want to have to sound like I'm on a soapbox,
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  but I beg of you, please, the number is 800-321-2900.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  I have stuck my neck out. I've tried every way possible to put in only what would keep me out of trouble.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  The next 12 months, what you should look forward to, market on your calendar, watch it happen.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  And I beg of you to get all of my 8 DVDs.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  I'll give you a copy of my book, Energy Non Crisis.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  We only have 600 left and when they're gone, they're gone forever.
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  I understand Google is selling it for, what is it, $1,900?
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  Because there are no more Energy Non Crisis books out there, I'll give you one as a gift with my 8 set of DVDs.
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  You can get my new Energy Non Crisis DVD and the next 12 months, the number is 800-321-2900.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  Now, why do I say all this? Folks, I beg of you, set your house in order.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  You need to listen to what Alex, he had some wonderful products advertised there just a moment ago that you need.
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  If ever you got things ready, do it now.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  And the first thing to do, and you'll have to bear with me, I've been a minister for 50 years,
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  set your spiritual house in order for goodness' sake, read your Bible and get right with Jesus Christ.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  Know that your salvation is settled, that your house is on a solid rock and not on sinking sand.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  And I try to bring all of this out in my new DVD the next 12 months.
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  I'll bring out not just the things that this man told me that we can expect,
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  but I go into the background, the ramifications of it, the little details, how you set your house in spiritual order,
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  plan a garden this spring, get out of debt, listen to the buzzwords of the elitists,
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  because they do have their own moral code.
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  Believe me, these people are not totally immoral people.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  They have a moral code they're required by their moral code to tell you in advance of what they're going to do.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  Exactly, that's their Illuminati system.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  Stop right there, Dr. Monteef and Lindsay Williams, because I just want to bring up a point here.
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  You can see them gearing up for the martial law.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  You can see the police state preparations everywhere as they announce,
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  oh, the National Guard's going to be in Denver.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  Oh, the National Guard's going to be in Chicago confiscating guns.
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  You know, an NBC news.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  Oh, it's for your safety.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  We can see them building up for this collapse.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  And we better get the word out to everybody of who's behind it,
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  so people don't go along with Barack Obama or John McCain or George Bush.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  They're just puppets.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  We have to have the revelation of understanding right now,
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  or they're going to be able to take us into the next level of all of this control.
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Dr. Monteef, your comments on what's being discussed here.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  Well, you know, there are a lot of things.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  Why won't they develop, you know, or let us develop the oil resources that we have?
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  Those that Lindsay has talked about in Alaska are certainly the Balkans.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  Oil, shale oil, something like 400 billion barrels of oil there.
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  According to the Governor of Montana, in fact, there was a fellow named Dr. Price
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  who was writing about this in 2000.
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  He worked for the Geological Survey.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  And just before he got the report finished, he just up and died.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  And Chris's report has been repressed ever since then.
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  400 billion barrels of oil.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  And the Governor of Montana has used that figure, and you can Google that in
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  if you want to check it out.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  Saudi Arabia only has about 230 billion.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  And, Chris, the question is, why won't they let us develop our own oil resources?
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  Well, there is a plan, and that is to redistribute the wealth of the American people.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  We're putting out over 300 billion dollars a year for an oil.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  We're importing about 12 million barrels of oil every day.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  We're consuming about, well, we were consuming 20.5 billion.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  We're down to about 19.7 billion.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  Actually, oil uses is declining here in the United States since the price of oil
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  began to rise.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  Now, it'll probably go back up again as the price falls.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  Why are they going to lower the price of oil?
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  Well, first of all, because the Bilderbergers ordered it.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  You go back and you read about what happened at the last Bilderberger meeting, or...
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  Yeah, they had a shift and said that this is waking the people up too fast.
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  We might want to cut back on prices.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  You may very well be right.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  But the other thing, the other reason I think they want to cut the price of oil
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  is they've done this repeatedly before.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  They go up and down.
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  And they did it in the early 1980s, and you say,
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  why would they possibly lower the price of oil intentionally?
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  Well, very simply because that's where you get a lot of competition.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  And there were a lot of people in the year, in 1982, 83, 84, or out there.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  You know, they were wildcatters.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  They were trying to develop oil on their own.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  And of course, to me, they might have a few million dollars.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  And of course, they dropped the price down to $10 a barrel as they did,
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  and they just bankrupted them.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  Well, that's happened over and over again.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  They let, they jack-o-boiled prices for a while, and then they lower it again.
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  And they admit it's come out in their own documents to bankrupt all their competition.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  This is what I want to do for the last 15 minutes we have.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  I want to give the number out to listeners, but specifically only for Lindsay William
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  and Dr. Stan Montee, on energy, on oil, on the issues we've been talking about in the last hour.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  1-800-259-9231-1800-2599-231.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  And specifically on this issue, and we'll go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  Dr. Montee, the gear up of the police state, what do you think they're gearing it up for?
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  Well, I think they want to take away our freedom, you know.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  It is the most amazing thing, Alex, and I know you're aware of this,
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  but maybe your listeners are not, but this housing bill they passed last week
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  to help, you know, the people who are losing their homes.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  What does it include?
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  Everybody working for the mortgage industry is going to have to be fingerprinted.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  How many people in the listening audience believe that the reason we have a housing crisis
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  is because the people who work in the financial industry are fingerprinted?
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  And then the other thing was, as a part of this legislation,
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  all of the records of everything you purchased with the credit card
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  will now be sent to the Internal Revenue Service.
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:27.000]  How many people think that we had a housing crisis because the IRS didn't have a record of everything you buy?
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  I mean, this is the most incredible thing, how they beat these crises,
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  and then they use them as a cover to collect these dossiers on American citizens.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  You're absolutely right, Alex. They are planning on a dictatorship in America.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:45.000]  I know you've probably seen that clip of the film from the Iran Contra hearings
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  where Congressman Jack Brooks is trying to bring out the facts,
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  but there's a plan, he's asking Oliver North about the plan,
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  you know, to suspend the Constitution and put people in concentration camps.
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  And now we're alive when all of this is coming to fruition.
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  We're now all the globalist setups, all their global manipulations
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  to bring in this world government, to bring down the U.S.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  We are now, to make China and Russia the new powerhouses, we are now here at that point.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  What would you say, Dr. Montee, Pastor Williams,
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  what would you say to the police and military right now
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  who are finally listening to us and finally realize just how real all this is?
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:27.000]  Well, I would say first, your loyalty is the Constitution,
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  not to the people in positions of command.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  And when push comes to shove and when they try to declare this dictatorship,
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  which they will do under one guise or another,
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  you're going to have to decide where your loyalty is.
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:43.000]  I hope it will be with the Constitution and with the American people
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  and not with the elitists who control our military and control the reins of power
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  and through federal extension of gifts to the local police force.
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  Now we have, in many instances, a federal militarized local police force
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  under control of the federal government.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  What we need to do is take America back.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  Alex, I've done some investigations since I was contacted a few weeks ago.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  I am amazed. I can't give their names because I'm not allowed to.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  I wish I could name over the air, which I want,
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  the number of top oil company officials that I knew
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  when I was in Prudeau Bay on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  that have moved to a safe haven.
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:31.000]  I know where they are. I've been able to make contact.
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  Cook Islands, New Zealand.
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  It is amazed how they've moved out of certain...
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  Hold on, let me ask you. Cook Islands, New Zealand, Switzerland?
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  They've gone through some safe spots in America.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  Many of them have moved to Alaska and gotten back out of the way from all of it.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  Montana.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  All I know is that a lot of the rich people I know
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:56.000]  have been leaving the last three years.
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  Dick Cheney, Bina House in Dubai.
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  Blackwater moving offshore. Halliburton to Dubai.
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  But you're saying Dubai is going to be even worse.
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  They're making preparations for themselves,
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  and you can be assured that they know what's in the wind.
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  Let's take a call. Alan Los Angeles, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  Alex, I was wondering, where is it that you can find that specific phrase
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  North American Union?
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:30.000]  Oh, well, it's in Council on Foreign Relations documents
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  where they talk about North American integration.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  We've got Vicente Fox on video.
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  We are changing, interviewing him. It's actually in the extras of...
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  I know it's in the film, in Truth Rising.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  We say, you want to set up a North American Union, right?
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  He says, yes, that's what we want.
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  It's in Council on Foreign Relations published books.
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  It's going back 50 years.
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  The New York Times has reported on the plan to set that up.
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  Dr. Montee, do you want to comment on this?
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:02.000]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations published a book
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  called Building a North American Community.
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  They actually published it. I purchased it from them.
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  This is what they want, a North American community,
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  a North American Union. It is simply part of a master plan.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  First of all, to unite Europe and then to unite North America
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:23.000]  and South America and Africa and Asia and the Asian Rim countries.
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  And they always deny that there's going to be a North American Union
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  or there's going to be an Asian Union or an African Union
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  or a Mediterranean Union or a European Union.
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  I mean, they just last year had the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  Okay? In Europe, 50 years of the European Union.
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  But they officially told everybody in Europe it didn't start until 2000.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  So they, in their SPP documents, September 23rd, 2006,
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  the Judicial Watch suit and got the first item on the agenda,
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  and this is by the way an end game, is keeping it secret.
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  Okay, does that answer your question now?
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  Yeah, I was just also wondering if you could put that up
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  in your famous quote section on your website.
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  You know, we've posted all the articles and everything else 100 times.
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  I don't have the staff to, we need to get a bigger internet staff.
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  I'm planning on trying to hire some more web people.
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  I mean, you have no idea. I'm not whining.
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  I'm literally working constantly. I was here at midnight last night.
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  It's Dr. Montee, if you want to comment.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  Well, I know how hard you work, Alex.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  And the people out there have to understand that all of us here
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  on the Patriot Movement have limited funds
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:36.000]  and you just need a lot more help.
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  And I appreciate everything you do.
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  I know how hard you work.
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  I know my poor wife, if it is the bulwark of what we do,
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  she works 12 to 14 hours a day just to raise the funds.
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  We don't get a cent out of this. We do it because we're trying to save America.
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:52.000]  Yeah, I mean, we just posted, I mean, I've posted the info
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  over and over and over again, had guests on over and over and over again,
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  and we do need to make sections that are easier with the basics,
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  but it's all there. We can't direct you to all of it.
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  Thank you for the call. We're going to skip this break
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  for infowars.com stream listeners.
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:12.000]  They got to do this now more and more because this info is too important, too powerful.
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  So when the podcast, everything goes out,
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  you'll be able to hear what's behind the scenes.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  Also, Prison Planet.TV members are watching us live on the web.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  And the final segment is also straight ahead.
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  I thought we'd play that Walter Cronkite clip
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:28.000]  where he talks about how much he loves the devil and the world government.
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  John, you know that little intro you made that has the Walter Cronkite part?
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  Let's come out of this break with that for everybody.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  Okay, just that whole track.
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  Yeah, I mean, we'll play about a minute of it.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  Let's go to Fred and Philly right now.
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  Fred and Philly are on the air. Go ahead.
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  Come along, Fred. You're on the air worldwide.
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  Yeah, I want to take a position that's in between Chapman and Mr. Williams.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  And that is, I don't really think that you can exactly control a level
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:08.000]  or create a level price of crude oil, commodity like that.
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:16.000]  If you don't control all the other factors, creation of money, the total demand.
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  Refining.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:24.000]  Right, and I do think that it may be attempted,
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  but let's not jump to conclusions about what will happen or won't happen.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  Well, we've got a guest on who's proven to be credible in the past
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:36.000]  who's saying his source told him that. Time will tell.
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  I'm not saying this will happen. I believe Lindsey, he's right there.
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  He believes it, and I think he believes it.
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  So, you know, we'll see what happens.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  Now, the other thing is that I think that you still have this, Alex,
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  you still have this phenomenon of you need a tremendous amount of more of engineers,
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  technicians, legal staff.
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:52:00.000]  That's tending to keep a price of this high,
[3:52:00.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  because you never thought that energy was as complicated as this.
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  No, it is. I hear you. Good points. Let me get a comment from...
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  Let me just point out that, of course, if you see what happened in April,
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  consumption here in the United States, it was down from about 20.5
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:24.000]  to 20.7 billion barrels a day, down to about 19.7 billion barrels a day.
[3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  And yet, during April, with the demand falling...
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  Wasn't it millions of barrels? Wasn't it millions of barrels?
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  Millions of barrels, yeah. That is what we consume here.
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  Millions of barrels per day.
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  And we were using last minute, when the price was up.
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:40.000]  That's right. And, of course, the question is, why was that?
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:44.000]  Well, simply because all the manipulation on the commodity exchange
[3:52:44.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  and the commodity speculators were driving up the price.
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  Well, there was plenty of oil.
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:52.000]  And certainly my latest newsletter goes into the background of that.
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  And people from even the oil companies were saying,
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  there's plenty of oil out there.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:00.000]  Now, why did commodity speculators drive up the price of oil?
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:02.000]  Well, part of it was for profit.
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:06.000]  But why didn't the commodity regulators, other than the Bush administration,
[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  stop them? They could stop that tomorrow.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  We saw them do that back in 1980 with the price of silver.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:14.000]  They wanted to break the price of silver. They did.
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:16.000]  And yet they refused to intervene.
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  In other words, they wanted the price to go up.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  And they allowed it to go up in violation of our laws.
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:22.000]  Okay.
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  The commodity market has manipulated...
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  Here we go. We're going back live, Dr. Montee.
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  Final segment with both of you gentlemen.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  We may even go into overdrive a little bit, but I doubt it.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:30.000]  Here we go.
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  A whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:44.000]  to get people actually to love their servitude.
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs,
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  which by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:53:56.000]  Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:08.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[3:54:08.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:22.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:24.000]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  important things in the future.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:32.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  but could it also cause cancer?
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  Oh, wow, the government had the right under U.S. law
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  to conduct secret testing on the American public
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  under a specific condition.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  I have to work with dark side,
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  or I'll spend time in the shadows.
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  must be the work of the devil.
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  Well, join me.
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:52.000]  I'm going to do it.
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:56.000]  The world order must be the work of the devil.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  Well, join me.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:02.000]  There's a need for a new world order.
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  Someday, in the next few years,
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:10.000]  a solution will emerge.
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  The world government is real.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  Their dark armies are real.
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  And all of us face them.
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  Scott living in denial.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  The enemy is before you.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  Hordes of evil.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  Their flags.
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  The skull and cross-blowns.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:38.000]  The pyramid flies in your face.
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  Arise.
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  Arise and face evil.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  Prepare yourself.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  Protect your family.
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  Police, military, join us
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:50.000]  under the white banner against tyranny.
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  Now or lose your immortal soul.
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  Final segment with Lindsay Williams
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  and, of course, Dr. Stan Monteith.
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  I wanted to go to Arian and Holland
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  and then let them have closing comments briefly.
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  Arian and Holland, you're on the air.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:08.000]  Go ahead.
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  Yeah, thank you very much, Alex.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  This is from Holland, the first state,
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  one of the three first states of the European Union.
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  And I've got two quick things for just to throw in the basket.
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  I'm a Christian myself.
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:28.000]  And I am a strong believer of prophecy.
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:33.000]  And I've been exposed right now to the $50 per barrel news.
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  And I had one hour to think about it.
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  And the more I think about it,
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  the more prophecy starts to fill in and take places
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  with Russia becoming a much larger portion
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.000]  and getting a much larger portion of oil
[3:56:48.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  and the effect also that says in prophecy,
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  you know, don't harm the oil.
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  In Revelation it says, don't harm the oil.
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  And I differ with Dr. Bob Chapman
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  about the attack on Iran.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  I hear you. You think it's on.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  We've got to jump. Call me back tomorrow.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  Everybody else, Jay David.
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:10.000]  Gentlemen, this is too important.
[3:57:10.000 --> 3:57:14.000]  Can I get both of you back on tomorrow for another hour
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  to flesh this out and take people's comments and questions?
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  Dr. Monteef and Lindsey Williams.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  I'm always available for you.

[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  Uh, the same time tomorrow is fine.
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  You named the time.
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  Okay, how about 1.30 central time tomorrow, sir?
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  How about West Coast time?
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:40.000]  Uh, that would be...
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  That would be 11.30.
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:43.000]  11.30.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:46.000]  It would be 10.30.

[3:57:51.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  in about two minutes and we'll set it up, okay?
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:54.000]  Okay, fine.
[3:57:54.000 --> 3:57:56.000]  Thank you, gentlemen, because we also have Webster Tarpley
