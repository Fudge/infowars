[00:59.280 --> 01:06.880]  went to and some places I didn't go to back in 1997 to see what the United Nations biosphere
[01:06.880 --> 01:17.000]  World Heritage Site takeover has basically metastasized into I was at the Carlsbad Cavern
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.440]  National Park yesterday and ran into a cornucopia of Big Brother activities in fact it was an
[01:24.440 --> 01:35.120]  orgy of control freakism and anti-human global indoctrination with now the the National Park
[01:35.120 --> 01:41.320]  Rangers festooned with firearms and tasers walking around like it's a supermax prison with their
[01:41.320 --> 01:48.520]  eyes in slits just literally thinking that terrorists are under every table so we're going
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.480]  to be breaking that down today Aaron Dykes is going to be riding shotgun with us and bringing in
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.120]  the latest news as it breaks obviously throughout the week we've been having Gerald Solente on
[01:58.120 --> 02:06.600]  because of MF Global I was watching CNBC just about an hour ago and they had the anchor there
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.600]  at the desk a male gentleman I meant to write down his name but didn't have time I think they
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.400]  were calling him Jamie something and of course they had the attractive Asian young lady who's
[02:15.400 --> 02:23.000]  on in the morning along with Kramer and one other person and the host who was anchoring to the
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.320]  people out on Wall Street Kramer and the other people he was saying that it looks like this
[02:30.320 --> 02:37.640]  MF Global is some type of theft and crime and that now the 600 million that they claim they knew
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.480]  where it was now it's gone and this is sending the markets down and then they come back to Kramer
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.280]  and the other talking heads they were like no no no no no this is not a big deal this is not
[02:48.280 --> 02:53.640]  illegal I'm sure it's just an accident and about five minutes later the other anchor
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.000]  host said yes it's no big deal it's just rumors and nothing to them nothing to them you could
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.440]  tell somebody had popped into his ear and told him do not say this is destroying confidence do
[03:04.440 --> 03:12.760]  not say people don't like being swindled and they cut back to the the female anchor field anchor
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.360]  and she's like yes this just happens when you're involved in commodities no big deal of course
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.960]  Salente's been in it since the early 70s I've made a novice study of it this was money in his
[03:23.960 --> 03:31.480]  in his what's the term they use segregated account it's like a bank account and they took it and
[03:31.480 --> 03:37.240]  they took 33,000 other people's money he won't say how much it is above 100,000 but it's a lot
[03:37.240 --> 03:42.840]  more than 100,000 now Aaron Dice is writing shotgun once we've got a lot of other news everything is

[06:07.240 --> 06:12.680]  you're in anachronism like a ghost from another time i am nothing more than a reminder to you
[06:12.680 --> 06:19.080]  that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages you're a bug mr. wordsworth a crawling insect
[06:19.080 --> 06:26.600]  an ugly misformed little creature who has no purpose here no meaning i am a human being words mr
[06:26.600 --> 06:34.680]  wordsworth they have no substance and no dimension like air like the wind i don't care i tell you i
[06:34.680 --> 06:43.080]  don't care i'm a human being i exist if i speak one for a loud that thought lives even after i'm
[06:43.080 --> 06:51.320]  swallowed in the microwave delusions mr wordsworth delusions that you injected in your veins to
[06:51.320 --> 06:56.120]  make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[06:56.120 --> 07:05.240]  spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your crime resistance to tyrants is obedience
[07:05.240 --> 07:17.160]  to god it's alex jones this country this world has been given over to a great and powerful delusion
[07:18.760 --> 07:26.440]  and the more that the deception is pulled from my eyes the more i stare into the heart
[07:26.440 --> 07:32.120]  and soul of the new world order the more i am not even angry or even frustrated anymore
[07:32.120 --> 07:38.920]  or i am sad because let me tell you it's not people that want money and power that are running
[07:38.920 --> 07:46.760]  things it's people that love pain and destruction and death and they want control to do horrible
[07:46.760 --> 07:51.240]  things what you can call it the devil whatever you want if there's not a devil these people might
[07:51.240 --> 07:57.800]  as well be devils because i can't imagine a devil being like this it is so destructive it is so evil
[07:57.800 --> 08:02.920]  it is so out of control we're going to go to kc michael eric josh matthew and others here in just a
[08:02.920 --> 08:09.640]  moment then i'll get into some more news here today but we're not a negative radio show the things
[08:09.640 --> 08:16.200]  we talk about are happening i wish they weren't but denying it's going on only makes it worse
[08:18.040 --> 08:20.360]  denying it's happening only makes it worse
[08:20.360 --> 08:25.960]  and there's so many thousands of different flavors of bull out there
[08:27.880 --> 08:33.560]  but if you go read globalist white paper study history research their program study the scientific
[08:34.680 --> 08:39.240]  megalomania of these people you understand what's going to happen and it is an incredible
[08:39.240 --> 08:44.200]  responsibility to be one of the few outlets and then luckily we've we understood this in the last
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.520]  decade we got a clear image of it and 17 years ago not so much but i was still doing some good then
[08:50.520 --> 08:56.280]  it's all a wake-up process for all of us but the last decade or so i've really cracked the code of
[08:56.280 --> 09:01.000]  these people and figured out exactly what they're about and now it's becoming very evident we were
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.920]  completely right and then some and we've got a fighting chance and i'm seeing a lot of other
[09:08.920 --> 09:15.480]  people click to our lens because we all see things through a lens but our lens really decodes the
[09:15.480 --> 09:21.880]  globalist operations and if you've got the will you can see what we see and let me tell you i say
[09:21.880 --> 09:28.040]  the will because you're going to be living with the devils every day i mean you think you see evil
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.160]  now folks when you actually pull back the curtain they're all it's everywhere and let me tell you
[09:35.160 --> 09:47.400]  it is not fun somebody mailed me a animated movie called dead space two it's like a movie off a video
[09:47.400 --> 09:56.440]  game and really it's um i would say kind of a adaptation of that russian film where the cosmonauts
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.880]  are out at this planet the planet itself's like an entity or you know it's haunting them or whatever
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.120]  and i'm i'm not saying i believe that stuff's real what i'm saying is this morning i was on the
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.200]  treadmill watching it and they go dig up this artifact on the planet and dead space two is
[10:12.200 --> 10:19.000]  like once the rescue ship gets there and the rescue ship's actually the big global corporate
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.200]  government the galactic government that's killing its own people and torturing them to get answers
[10:24.200 --> 10:29.240]  and they sent them out there to be a setup kind of like an alien where they where they send the
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.920]  mining crew on their way back to land on a planetoid to dig something up and you know they don't find
[10:34.920 --> 10:40.120]  out till 50 60 years later when they get back or one of them gets back that it was all a setup
[10:42.280 --> 10:47.640]  they were sent there as guinea pigs see they tell you in all these movies but i'm watching this and
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.240]  in the first episode i'm going to your calls they've they've blown up part of the planet
[10:53.240 --> 10:59.640]  to destroy this artifact that basically caused all these mutations on the ship and all this
[10:59.640 --> 11:08.600]  horrific stuff to happen it's like a dna generator a mutation generator basically or at least that's
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.480]  how it's operating malfunctioning some ancient 56 you know million-year-old artifact
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.480]  and they go back they want pieces of it so they send them back down to get pieces of it
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.440]  and one guy picks up a piece and then basically causes him to start hallucinating he's not really
[11:26.440 --> 11:31.640]  hallucinating he's like seeing interdimensionally and and this and it's manipulating him he sees
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.520]  like his dead daughter a little girl who got run over by a car and it shows that happening to her
[11:36.520 --> 11:41.560]  and and and then it basically tries to lead him off the edge of a cliff and then you know he's seeing
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.120]  all these horrible demon creatures grabbing on his daughter trying to pull her into him and it
[11:46.120 --> 11:52.600]  basically maneuvers him into you know killing a bunch of the crew but again it's that archetype
[11:52.600 --> 11:58.360]  that's not real but that's basically what the globalist manifests they they trick us they manipulate
[11:58.360 --> 12:05.720]  us they they play humans like a concert pianist plays a piano or a concert violinist plays a violin
[12:06.440 --> 12:09.960]  they manipulate us and
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.680]  and that goes without saying but the manipulation is so many layers deep
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.560]  and then when you really research it you find out they did all this
[12:24.120 --> 12:31.000]  it's because they like to kill people and they're a bunch of sickos and then good people are smarter
[12:31.800 --> 12:38.680]  and are better and more creative but good people never reach for that stuff they never would think
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.560]  to manipulate they would never think to learn all these bad things they would never think
[12:47.080 --> 12:53.480]  so we're like blind to these people and I watch the population like a bunch of lobotomy sheep
[12:53.480 --> 12:59.160]  with these demonic wolves tearing their guts out as the sheep smile and thank them I mean it's it's
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.680]  it's it's it's unbelievable and it's like that you know an archetype of just seeing the demons
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.360]  everywhere well that's how it is for me to watch the news or read things or see the propaganda or hear it
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.360]  is that it's just it's always in my face it's always there it's always it's always
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.520]  and my whole will is set against it but then I look at all the servants of this evil
[13:26.520 --> 13:36.760]  they're 99 of them are compartmentalized and have no idea what they're part of have no idea if they
[13:36.760 --> 13:43.800]  knew there's no way that they would ever be part of this but even though a lot of them have the
[13:43.800 --> 13:50.760]  intelligence to grasp it it's spiritual and it's discernment and they won't admit the first levels
[13:50.760 --> 13:55.640]  of it to themselves they certainly can't ever get the deep wisdom and that's what christ said you
[13:55.640 --> 14:01.960]  know while they're torturing him he says forgive them father they know not what they do those those
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.400]  romans flying off his skin for no reason with his bones sticking out getting off on the pain
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.520]  they thought they were law and order they were getting a bad guy they were
[14:16.520 --> 14:23.240]  and it's like that with
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.880]  with the special forces soldiers and the work for all major governments that have been trained
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.000]  to do horrible crimes and now the video games all because I read about them stimulate torturing
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.320]  people to get answers or I saw a video game last week do was show me where you kill cops
[14:38.280 --> 14:43.080]  because it's for the greater good so the bomb doesn't blow up and blow up the the brooklyn bridge
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.200]  does the cops are are going to end up killing the guy with the bomb and it's going to detonate so
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.320]  so that doesn't happen they kill the cops but it's for a greater good once that idea is introduced
[14:53.320 --> 14:59.720]  once that virus is introduced it's over and they take the sickest part is they take some of the
[14:59.720 --> 15:05.720]  best men who really believe they're doing good and once they commit small evils in the name of a
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.960]  greater good now they psychologically will will produce an envelope or a membrane around that
[15:11.960 --> 15:17.080]  where they'll do more evil things and never admit any of it's wrong because they couldn't be a bad person
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.200]  when you figure out that the devil's chariot is pulled by people that think they're saints
[15:28.760 --> 15:32.840]  oh man all I could say for those of you that have decided to serve the system
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.480]  you better think twice you better pray to god to open your eyes because
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.120]  or if you've ever had bad feelings about what you're doing but you don't know why you better
[15:42.120 --> 15:51.320]  assess what you're part of and you oh you're signing on to pure evil I mean you're signing
[15:51.320 --> 15:57.160]  on to something that's that's beyond anything I could even articulate beyond anything I could even grasp

[20:40.840 --> 20:46.360]  we've been shooting a lot of high def video of what's happened when i get back to austin next week
[20:46.360 --> 20:50.920]  we'll have that for the nightly news and for the syndicated radio transmission that you're tuned
[20:50.920 --> 20:58.280]  into right now in the meantime via my iphone i filed a report from carls bad caverns yesterday
[20:58.280 --> 21:05.000]  where it was a a out of control police state exercise and i think that in a few years if this
[21:05.000 --> 21:13.240]  doesn't stop the the national parks will be like entering an airport with the tsa i saw the
[21:14.680 --> 21:19.800]  national park rangers some of them wearing firearms and tasers walking around with their arms out
[21:20.840 --> 21:26.200]  like they were tough guys questioning everyone they would come over and talk to you and others
[21:26.200 --> 21:31.240]  it wasn't just us i thought they knew when i was at first that wasn't what it was and that they were
[21:31.240 --> 21:35.880]  singling me out turned out they were interrogating everybody that's just normal now in america
[21:35.880 --> 21:40.520]  like when you go rent a car go to hotel room if they're part of patriot act compliance you get
[21:41.080 --> 21:48.040]  20 questions so i'm going to be breaking some of that down later today gerald salente is going to
[21:48.040 --> 21:53.560]  be joining us coming up here in about 22 minutes from now a top trans forecaster who had over six
[21:53.560 --> 22:02.360]  figures over a hundred thousand dollars taken out of his private account Reuters ap they've all
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.400]  admitted that it basically is a type of theft uh if it turns out it was done on purpose and if
[22:07.400 --> 22:12.600]  they don't return it at mf global when they're admitting that these were segregated accounts
[22:12.600 --> 22:18.280]  these were this was money he'd made in the market money he'd invested and then made in gold futures
[22:18.280 --> 22:24.120]  and that it was then his money and they've taken any other cash accounts from people as well 33
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.480]  plus thousand mf global bought the trading firm that he'd been trading with and using since the
[22:29.480 --> 22:36.520]  early 70s and he's never seen anything like this and i was watching msnbc uh this morning just an
[22:36.520 --> 22:41.240]  hour and a half ago or so and uh they had the host they're anchoring it talking to the three
[22:41.240 --> 22:47.000]  reporters kramer and two other people on the ground at the new york stock exchange and he was saying
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.040]  he was saying well what's driving down the market right now uh you know the intel we're getting is
[22:52.040 --> 22:57.800]  there's no confidence now in the government there's no confidence now in these companies
[22:57.800 --> 23:02.280]  especially in futures that's why the markets are going down we thought that the bankruptcy
[23:02.280 --> 23:10.120]  of mf global hadn't signaled a new bear sterns or type situation 2008 but now that the money's missing
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.120]  they said that they had just misplaced it now they won't say where it went this is destroying
[23:14.120 --> 23:19.800]  confidence and this is well really theft that's what this is this is theft and then he throws it
[23:19.800 --> 23:24.840]  i meant to write down his name but couldn't find a pin here in the hotel room um he throws it to
[23:24.840 --> 23:31.720]  kramer and the uh the attractive woman and the other guy uh and they just all say no it's perfectly
[23:31.720 --> 23:36.040]  fine it's no big deal it's all just an accident perfectly reasonable and then about five minutes
[23:36.040 --> 23:39.960]  later i'm sitting there reading the newspaper surfing the web getting ready for the show
[23:39.960 --> 23:45.240]  uh doing research and he goes oh just just to be clear uh there's nothing to the rumors that the
[23:45.240 --> 23:50.440]  money was stolen no one knows where it is but it's no big deal quite normal uh no big deal i he didn't
[23:50.440 --> 23:56.760]  correct himself he just he just retracted everything by what he said five minutes later so somebody
[23:56.760 --> 24:02.280]  got in his ear after the break and said you listen here buddy and again i'm not watching many of
[24:02.280 --> 24:07.480]  these financial shows i've been on the road shooting video doing interviews with locals
[24:07.480 --> 24:11.720]  really learning a lot about what's happening out here out west what spurred me to want to do this
[24:11.720 --> 24:18.120]  trip uh about six months ago my parents went out to montana and wyoming and visited family friends
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.640]  fellow patriots uh and they've just talked about how the government's trying to encroach there and
[24:23.640 --> 24:28.280]  the things that are happening so i figured i'd come back out west and i'm not going to say the
[24:28.280 --> 24:32.200]  other national parks and places i'm going in the next four days because i don't want to be waiting
[24:32.200 --> 24:38.520]  for me you know i wanted to go to carlsbad caverns be friendly be nice have my wife have my children
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.240]  richards with us helping with the technical stuff and i want to just come in all friendly and nice
[24:45.240 --> 24:50.600]  and see what it was like and i've been to carlsbad caverns four times before this and it's really a
[24:50.600 --> 24:56.360]  big police state now now now tying in to gerald salente coming up we're about to get some other
[24:56.360 --> 25:01.080]  news and some recaps some of the stuff we already mentioned and get erin dice's tank who's riding
[25:01.080 --> 25:05.880]  shotgun with us throughout the three hours today and i've certainly appreciate the uh fantastic
[25:05.880 --> 25:10.840]  job he did and the crew did yesterday with that in-depth breakdown of the censorship of the proof
[25:10.840 --> 25:17.000]  of fema camps in america and also the fact that they're hiding geoengineering terraforming uh
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.680]  chemtrailing uh in-plane view amazing job with erin dice but i wanted to go over some of the news

[32:08.200 --> 32:13.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[32:13.240 --> 32:18.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[32:18.840 --> 32:23.960]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:23.960 --> 32:29.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[32:29.240 --> 32:33.800]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[32:33.800 --> 32:39.240]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[33:06.120 --> 33:22.040]  jones broadcasting network network
[33:37.000 --> 33:44.040]  so
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.560]  why does government want to go after amish people selling their neighbors milk
[33:51.560 --> 33:56.600]  why are they harassing organic farmers why are they trying to arrest women with gardens in their
[33:56.600 --> 34:02.600]  yard you've seen all that craziness worse than the old soviet union because the global technocrats
[34:02.600 --> 34:09.240]  the fortune 100 owned by the big six megabanks want to shut down normal human self-sufficient
[34:09.240 --> 34:15.320]  society and do it to shut down true independent sustainability they bring in the counterfeit
[34:15.320 --> 34:21.480]  un agenda 21 sustainability now here's an example of this on the wide scale look at
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.120]  grease you've seen the news articles about all these hundreds of greek islands they have hundreds
[34:26.120 --> 34:30.840]  of them some of which have now been transferred for six billion dollars in debt one island alone
[34:30.840 --> 34:37.160]  that were owned by the state and the people have been given to the big megabanks and brokerage firms
[34:37.160 --> 34:43.960]  that actually induced grease into debt to understand that they're taking their national and state
[34:43.960 --> 34:50.120]  parks and public lands and giving it to the same big brokerage firms that entice their government
[34:50.120 --> 34:56.120]  to get involved in all this fraud and to sign on to the derivatives that they created so to
[34:56.120 --> 35:03.160]  bail out the bankers you then also give them your property so back in 97 i learned about the
[35:03.160 --> 35:07.960]  executive order bill clinton had put into place transferring our national parks and other key
[35:07.960 --> 35:14.280]  monuments and public lands and buffer zones worth trillions of dollars overall the minerals
[35:14.280 --> 35:21.400]  everything over to the un as collateral to the imf and world bank just as you see happen in third
[35:21.400 --> 35:25.240]  world countries where the imf world bank come in and take the land we had the executive order we
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.920]  had the kentucky legislature talking about it i traveled around the country and i would
[35:28.920 --> 35:33.080]  pull into the grand canyon you name it politely walk in and say i'd like to talk about the un
[35:33.080 --> 35:37.320]  black i'd like to talk about what's happening and they would blow up and threaten to arrest me and
[35:37.320 --> 35:43.160]  that's on tape at the grand canyon other places in america so about design so i've decided to travel
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.720]  back across the southwest and visit some of the same national parks and some others that i hadn't
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.840]  visited in that film like carlsbad caverns here in southern new mexico and that's why info wars
[35:52.840 --> 35:58.680]  dot com info wars nightly news is here that's why we're covering this information now i came here
[35:58.680 --> 36:03.880]  several times as a child i came here in college i came here six years ago with my wife and two
[36:03.880 --> 36:09.080]  children now i have a third child i wanted her to see it uh before she gets too big we're here
[36:09.080 --> 36:15.720]  again as part of this research project i brought my family along on the rv from the minute we get
[36:15.720 --> 36:20.360]  here it's changed in six years ago i'm gonna run over just some of it because one thing alone is not
[36:20.360 --> 36:26.280]  a big deal but as it added and built up richard kept saying well wonder what's going to happen next
[36:26.280 --> 36:34.520]  we walk in and i see some of the park rangers with tasers and guns walking around the old tough guy
[36:34.520 --> 36:39.720]  like they're in an airport or something and terrorists must be everywhere okay so i think well
[36:39.720 --> 36:44.040]  whatever you know maybe they're forest service or something i don't know why they need guns and tasers
[36:44.040 --> 36:49.400]  but okay everything's okay in america same visitor center i've been too many times the elevator ride
[36:49.400 --> 36:55.080]  down 800 feet and all of it so then i go up to the counter and i go up and i was wondering why
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.000]  that there was one group ahead of us and why it took so long to get them through i thought many
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.920]  people are slow so i get up there there's hardly any tourists here today there's literally more
[37:04.360 --> 37:11.240]  park rangers than there are a tourist i probably saw 40 or 50 total about 20 at one time so i get
[37:11.240 --> 37:16.840]  up there and i find out why i'm being interrogated i'm being told rules uh and i'm being asked if
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.840]  i've ever been in mine shafts or caves recently and and where and i said no six years ago here
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.400]  i thought it was small talk but she was asking at real stern like i was you know tsa or something
[37:28.200 --> 37:33.160]  she was tsa and i was at the airport and i said no i told you i was here six years ago she was
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.640]  really not anywhere on the east coast or anywhere there and i said no i said i said i've been here
[37:39.640 --> 37:45.160]  in the last cave well where are one of the caves you've been to one in mexico one time decade ago
[37:45.160 --> 37:52.840]  or more uh a couple around texas what caves in texas uh i don't remember the names and i was like
[37:52.840 --> 37:56.600]  what's this all about she goes you don't worry about that here's your tickets and then i went
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.680]  and asked another ranger and i said is it that white nose fungus stuff and he said yeah and my
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.960]  mom's so educated she goes so informed she goes but the mexican uh brown bad isn't susceptible to
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.480]  that and he goes wow how do you know that but the point is then we walk past that and a ranger
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.200]  waves the kids over i'm like oh thank god a nice ranger he wants to talk to the kids and he goes
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.600]  hi do you know what animal this is he has a table out we're trying to go to the elevators couldn't
[38:22.600 --> 38:30.040]  get past these people he you know he wanted his pound of flesh and so he he holds up a white-tailed
[38:30.040 --> 38:35.000]  deer in a puma and shows us a puma skull and he goes one last thing and he holds up a map of the
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.280]  park underground and he says 90 percent of this is off limits to humans that's for the animals
[38:40.280 --> 38:46.600]  animals need a place to i'm like oh god does it never end this anti-human brainwashing you know
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.920]  90 plus percent of the plants totally untouched the globalist the ones destroying the environment
[38:50.920 --> 38:55.080]  they got a fake environmentalism to grab property and control but i didn't say that i'm like thank
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.720]  you because we need to get through the park and get on the next leg of our investigative journey
[38:59.720 --> 39:05.000]  as my children are basically apprenticing with me i'm like thank you so then we walk out and go
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.640]  down to the natural entrance because you can't just take the elevators down you're lazy and there's
[39:09.640 --> 39:15.080]  another one comes slinking over and he says no gum no food no this and that don't talk it disturbs
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.320]  the animals and the people the lecturing continued and continued i said thank you and he was all kind
[39:19.320 --> 39:23.880]  of creeping around acting weird i'm like god this is horrible now remember i've been here at least
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.600]  four times before this hadn't happened this hadn't happened so then we walk down into the cave and 100
[39:28.600 --> 39:34.840]  yards in there's a camera and a sign that says cave watch if you see anything illegal call this
[39:34.840 --> 39:40.200]  number 30 30 and you know had the code before those were there if you've slipped and fell or needed
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.720]  help or whatever now it's tattle on people and cameras everywhere hidden up in cave crevices
[39:45.720 --> 39:52.360]  and this goes on and on and we finally we don't see any of the uh of the park ranch we get down
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.400]  to the bottom 800 feet down and they're all there bossing people around and stuff i talked to some
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.520]  they were a little bit nice then i went and got back on the elevator where they had a little gift
[40:02.520 --> 40:09.000]  shop down to bottom went back up to the top i got back off saw more park rangers with guns and tasers
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.760]  i i was my family walked in the bathroom i turned around and a guy goes sir did you just come in
[40:14.760 --> 40:20.280]  because you need to buy a ticket right now or or this is the last five minutes to buy a ticket
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.080]  but he kind of said it like i was like okay uh thank you know i've i've already been down thank you
[40:25.720 --> 40:31.800]  and it's just this this this oppressive culture of the american people are bad the american people
[40:31.800 --> 40:37.480]  can't be trusted only government is good they've got new homeland security ads in denver that are
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.200]  airing and training manuals that paul watson wrote about yesterday where they say even your best
[40:42.200 --> 40:45.960]  friend can't be trusted they could be a terrorist really what about the government caught shipping
[40:45.960 --> 40:49.320]  drugs in the country what about the government caught beating people to death what about the
[40:49.320 --> 40:54.040]  government letting big mega banks rob people and put in their people in as federal regulators
[40:54.040 --> 41:00.680]  what about uh all these other companies taking people's bank accounts like mf global i mean what
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.560]  about that see this is about us learning to be perps us learning to be criminals us learning
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.840]  that we're bad we have guilt we're evil and it just went on and on there was a bunch of other nanny
[41:10.840 --> 41:17.880]  state stuff so many i had to write it down uh but again this park 90 percent is off limits to you
[41:17.880 --> 41:24.200]  in the final equation if they discovered this cave like they did a hundred and something years ago
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.960]  today they would guaranteed not let it be open to the public there are already caves they found
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.360]  in the u.s canada france and other areas that are huge that they just say you're off limits
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.080]  vital biosphere area it's all about treating us we have no rights we're scum we're trash we have
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.640]  no value and the government is there with the big mega banks to basically pick up the garbage and
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.760]  throw it away that's what's going on and more and more i mean i've gone to state parks where
[41:50.760 --> 41:56.680]  they're super rude um erin dyke tried to go to a state park mckinney roughs with his girlfriend
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.480]  a few weeks ago and he said they interrogated him nice clean cut guy nice clean cut girlfriend
[42:01.480 --> 42:05.640]  they interrogated him like he'd done something wrong and says anybody else hiding in the car
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.120]  it's like when you go rent a car they interrogate you where are you going what are you doing
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.840]  oh really who are you visiting it all goes in a patriot act database and this is all fact i mean
[42:14.840 --> 42:22.360]  this is like stasi east germany or something so i i wanted to follow this boil down before i also
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.800]  post the videos we shot in there today inside the cave and uh that covers some of what we just broke
[42:27.800 --> 42:32.680]  down here but it's just all off the chart so here's kind of a final boil down before i post all the
[42:32.680 --> 42:38.360]  pieces uh that were you know shot live inside the cave again i'm alex jones signing off from the

[47:08.680 --> 47:14.680]  right
[47:30.920 --> 47:35.720]  thank you for joining us general salente is going to be our guest the next 30 minutes
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.720]  we had him on two days ago on the radio show and now of course last night he joined us for
[47:41.720 --> 47:46.920]  info wars at nightly news that rob do hosted did a great job along with the crew producing
[47:47.640 --> 47:54.760]  i was watching cnbc this morning and the host who was anchoring it went to kramer
[47:56.040 --> 48:03.080]  jim kramer and two other field reporters who were in the new york stock exchange and the anchor
[48:03.080 --> 48:09.800]  host i think they said his name was jamie uh i forget his last name he but this was on about
[48:09.800 --> 48:17.880]  two three hours ago he he said on their well the markets are going down because of mf global not
[48:17.880 --> 48:24.840]  because of the bankruptcy but because first we were told the money disappeared 600 to 900 million
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.560]  now we're told that they found it but now again they won't say where it is this looks like theft
[48:29.560 --> 48:36.360]  and that's what is really driving down the markets and driving down uh speculation and commodities
[48:36.920 --> 48:42.280]  and other things he said this is really a serious situation then he cuts to kramer and he cuts to
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.000]  the other people they all say well this type of thing happens sometimes and you know that's what
[48:47.000 --> 48:55.000]  happens when you're speculating or whatever no this was segregated accounts and ap roiders bloomberg
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.120]  forbs they've all reported this is unprecedented that's why investors are freaking out and getting
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.920]  out of the market that's why people don't trust banks we've already had all these semi runs on
[49:04.920 --> 49:12.200]  banks people try to take their money out of bank of america uh jp morgan chase wells fargo and others
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.480]  because they understand that and some of the banks try to refuse to give you your money
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.320]  you've seen the attempts to ratchet up all these fees this is what the casualist society is about
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.280]  they get to take your money and then not get in trouble so as this broke earlier in the week
[49:26.280 --> 49:31.000]  suddenly there was going to be judges involved and they were going to get the money back well now
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  mf global and all the little companies that grabbed up like the one that salente's been
[49:35.720 --> 49:41.560]  doing trades through for more than 30 years suddenly uh they were going to give the money back
[49:41.560 --> 49:48.360]  now they're saying oh i we don't know where it is and it's just a new situation where you don't get
[49:48.360 --> 49:53.000]  your money back first it was you might get a little back and then no you'll get it all back and now
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.080]  sorry it's gone and the funny thing was that i'm going to gerald is that about five minutes later
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.320]  they go to break and they come back with the host who's there anchoring you know from the news desk
[50:03.320 --> 50:08.200]  and he goes actually uh just to clarify things i've researched all these rumors of the money being
[50:08.200 --> 50:13.480]  stolen and they're just that they're they're rumors uh we can't confirm uh so i just want to say that
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.880]  so well that we know the money's gone and he admitted it was a theft and that's what's hurting
[50:17.880 --> 50:23.880]  the market then he comes back five minutes later and was chastised i guess behind the scenes in
[50:23.880 --> 50:29.240]  his earpiece or whatever and it's like uh actually there's nothing to these rumors he didn't say
[50:29.240 --> 50:34.920]  conspiracy theories but you know the money's gone but that's just it so joining us now is trends
[50:34.920 --> 50:40.280]  forecast researcher uh trends forecaster gerald salente who had more than a hundred thousand
[50:40.280 --> 50:46.520]  dollars taken that was in his account his money his money and he was going to take physical
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.640]  december delivery and of course a lot of people had predicted that you'd see problems in december
[50:51.640 --> 50:56.040]  with delivery because a lot of these companies they believe don't have the physical gold
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.080]  gerald salente thank you for joining us so give us the latest developments with your case and then
[51:01.080 --> 51:05.560]  i want to get your take and your expert analysis and break down along with erin dykes who also
[51:05.560 --> 51:10.200]  write shotgun with us because i'm on the road uh with germany secret plans to derail the british
[51:10.200 --> 51:16.920]  referendum on e u they admit it's a total banker dictatorship a goldman sacks coup that's time
[51:16.920 --> 51:23.480]  magazine over europe but they say how great goldman will now manage europe they'll fix the problems
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.600]  when they literally piloted the problem with all their minions and all the finance positions
[51:28.600 --> 51:33.560]  prime minister and presidents positions preparing for this takedown on the way up they made tens of
[51:33.560 --> 51:38.200]  trillions selling the derivatives garbage now they have the government agents they control
[51:38.200 --> 51:45.080]  sign on to those debts and then have the whore media or prostitutes you call them sell the public
[51:45.080 --> 51:48.680]  on it's your debt it's your fault and they're telling them we're taking part of your pension
[51:48.680 --> 51:53.240]  funds we're cutting your we're taking your money we're raising your taxes sorry if you go out of
[51:53.240 --> 51:59.800]  business it's our money give it to us so all hades is literally breaking loose gerald salente
[52:00.520 --> 52:06.120]  yes let me thank you alex let me first explain because a lot of people don't seem to understand
[52:06.120 --> 52:13.080]  this it is like having a layaway plan you go to a store and you're going to buy something but you
[52:13.080 --> 52:17.960]  don't have all the money yet so you just keep adding money into it until you have enough money
[52:17.960 --> 52:22.600]  and then you go pick it up now imagine that you go pick it up and you go to the place where the
[52:22.600 --> 52:29.000]  store was and the store is no longer there and you put all the money in that's what would that's
[52:29.000 --> 52:35.400]  exactly what happened to me i was building the account having planned it out that i would take
[52:35.400 --> 52:40.600]  delivery this month and kept putting money into my account building my account till i had enough
[52:40.600 --> 52:47.080]  money so all those morons out there that are saying what i'm doing you know oh you believe in paper
[52:47.080 --> 52:51.800]  this and that you don't know what you're talking about number two i just got off the phone with
[52:51.800 --> 52:58.680]  the broker here's the deal people like myself that had money in the account and the position to pick
[52:58.680 --> 53:07.880]  up the gold we're getting nothing zero some people are getting 60 cents on their dollar now here's the
[53:07.880 --> 53:17.400]  big lie and those guys i mean anybody that watches cnbc and believes those little those little guys
[53:17.400 --> 53:23.320]  out there that are always you know sucking up and bowing down to the money men you know they
[53:23.320 --> 53:30.920]  should have their head examined because here's the deal the cme group and this is a story that we
[53:30.920 --> 53:39.720]  broke with you last night the cme group is the exchange that handles all the delivery the derivatives
[53:39.720 --> 53:47.240]  and the commodities that's the exchange like the new york stock exchange handles stocks the cme group
[53:47.240 --> 53:55.720]  handles derivatives and commodities now commodities isn't just speculation farmers use it airlines use
[53:55.720 --> 54:03.960]  it millions millions and millions of people use exchanges and businesses buying futures for
[54:03.960 --> 54:17.560]  delivery now here is what the ceo of the cme group terrence terrence duffy said last year we picked
[54:17.560 --> 54:23.960]  this up after doing research we pulled it up this was at a press conference with the former mayor
[54:23.960 --> 54:32.440]  daly who he called his great friend no customer has ever lost a penny as a result of the clearing
[54:32.440 --> 54:40.280]  member is defaulting through the cme group that's number one he said number two and this is the most
[54:40.280 --> 54:48.760]  important part since we are the guarantor of every transaction that happens in our markets
[54:49.640 --> 54:57.480]  we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of these contracts to do this we hold
[54:57.480 --> 55:08.280]  more than 100 billion of collateral to support the transactions that are being done on our markets
[55:08.280 --> 55:16.360]  okay terry boy over there in chicago with your good buddy daly from the machine
[55:16.360 --> 55:27.880]  where's the guarantee i know how to read i understand english the cme is either a fraud
[55:27.880 --> 55:36.280]  or this guy's a con or he's a liar you pick it it's one of those three because they're
[55:36.280 --> 55:42.920]  saying they guarantee it and we haven't gotten our money and they're saying it's only 700 million
[55:42.920 --> 55:52.360]  dollars short that's why the markets are falling apart there is no guarantor it's a lie a con or a
[55:52.360 --> 56:01.720]  fraud general this is news of which the magnitude i don't even have words to describe let me ask
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.320]  you this question i think i know i'm gonna know the answer but you're on the inside of this now
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.960]  i want to go back over exactly what this broker creature was telling you i want to break this down
[56:09.960 --> 56:16.680]  um if they're admitting that the markets are falling apart especially the futures markets
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.480]  because this is destroying confidence if if it's well known to even a layman like myself who just
[56:21.480 --> 56:27.160]  studies this as a novice that if you've got money in your account and then it's yours and it says on
[56:27.160 --> 56:33.400]  the account that it is segregated that is your money to take that as total fraud it's equivalent
[56:33.400 --> 56:39.480]  of wire fraud or basically bank robbery without a weapon it's a serious felony and you can spend
[56:39.480 --> 56:47.640]  life in prison for this so why over 650 700 900 we see different numbers let's just say it's 700
[56:47.640 --> 56:53.960]  million why over 700 million with a company that that has tens of millions of customers tied into
[56:53.960 --> 57:00.280]  trillions in in in different forms of assets why would they endanger the entire structure at this
[57:00.280 --> 57:06.280]  juncture over 700 900 million whatever it really is less than a billion dollars i think the answer
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.880]  is what you said three days ago here that's right they don't they don't have the product they don't
[57:11.880 --> 57:18.920]  have the goal to deliver and the same thing's going to happen with etfs this is a big fraud
[57:18.920 --> 57:25.960]  this guy is shooting off his mouth saying that they're going to guarantee it and they have 100
[57:25.960 --> 57:34.520]  billion dollars in collateral 100 billion dollars and terry boy you can't come up with 700 million
[57:34.520 --> 57:41.480]  so my belief is there's no money in there my belief this whole thing is one big scam
[57:50.040 --> 57:56.120]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in

[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.520]  got cut off by the break this is a short segment erin dox is up there in the command chair at info
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.280]  wars headquarters in austin i'm here in arizona reporting uh on the globalist takeover that
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.760]  they're preparing to take over the public lands and receivership just like grease so erin you
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.920]  pop in anytime jerald please continue with the point you were trying to make as he went to break
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.160]  and then i want to ask you the question after the break when the full audience is tuned in
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.960]  some stations don't carry this segment what are you going to do individually against these people
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.000]  that took your money charles lente all right first of all finishing what i was saying is bigger than
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.640]  mf global it's a takeover in every way look alex those of us that are old enough to remember
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.760]  and i think about this whole generations two generations have no idea what this used to
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.760]  this country used to be like people could open up a hardware store you didn't have to go to work
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:11.080]  as a clerk for loads of home depot you could have your own store people used to open up their own
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:18.760]  pharmacies their drug stores with soda fountains and i was a soda jerk during the end of that era
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:25.880]  you didn't have to work as a clerk for cvs a walmart a right aid people used to be able to
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:33.400]  open up their own mom and shop stores clothing stores for men and women you didn't have to go to
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:40.680]  walmart which controls 10 percent of the action and be a clerk for them people in this country used
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.200]  to be able to start their own businesses and be their own entrepreneurs and now what they've done
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:53.080]  they've taken over every virtually every industry in this country under clinton with the broadcasting
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:59.720]  putting in the power of the hands of a few clear channel you know give me a break clear channel
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:07.480]  clear rip off one after another they've deregulated this country laws that were put in place at the
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:16.760]  turn of the other century to stop the robber barons from robbing us so what i'm saying is the mf global
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:24.600]  is only part of a much bigger picture so you asked me what can we do there's only one thing i believe
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:31.960]  a couple of things we could do but one of them is break the chains all you cops out there to keep
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:38.920]  eating donuts and you have pension plans and you have these wonderful retirement plans you
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:45.080]  want to see your money when you retire guess what you're not going to get it because it's going to
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:53.800]  go under most likely like minded so instead of going to dunk in donuts go to your local coffee
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:01.560]  shop what people need to understand alex is that these huge companies and the mf global
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:11.560]  is the perfect example are so leveraged that you take away a little bit like 700 million to the
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:22.440]  entire cme group and you start seeing the whole thing collapse the whole thing begins to collapse
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:31.960]  all you need to do is everybody if you do your share and stop supporting the chains
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:39.640]  we could bring this country back to an entrepreneurial country another thing i keep hearing it all the
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:47.400]  time yeah they blame labor for everything you want every day low prices you have every day low
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.520]  quality with every day low quality jobs you got to stay there gerald gotta go break starting to

[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:12.680]  the crooks i'm exposing the cons and the frauds and please put up that video that you had uh i
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.760]  forget the fellow who did did the piece on it last night who uh who posted it he did an excellent
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:26.760]  job in revealing it about the cme group and the and they're either as i said it's either a lie
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:33.160]  a con or a fraud they said they were going to guarantee it up to a hundred billion dollars
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:41.000]  so what my work is as yours is is to keep exposing it and we can we could change the system are you
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.040]  talking about rob do everyone else speaks up sure well and well let's get more into that and then
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.440]  get Aaron's take on this but gerald are you talking about the nightly news last night hosted by rob
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.680]  do yes but not that it robbed at a great job but whoever posted the piece on there that what we
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:05.240]  broke about the cme groups duffy uh terrence duffy saying that no one lost a penny with cme group
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.000]  and that the cme group which is the exchange like the new york sock exchange the commodities and
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.040]  derivative exchange they said they're backing this by a hundred billion dollars so whoever posted
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:24.440]  that piece on your site i forgot his name he did a great job in it get every one was it patrick
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:35.160]  henningson now another name uh erin dykes hurt nimo yes that was okay okay okay tell me tell me
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.480]  the headline and then after you leave us uh we'll uh we'll uh play that piece because i haven't seen
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.280]  it i've been on the road why is this so bombshell breakdown for folks what you're talking about
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:54.040]  specifically i sent this piece to you specifically because it says i have a video tape of the head
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:01.480]  of the cme group terrence duffy saying that no one's ever lost the penny with the cme group
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:07.640]  in commodities exchange going back to the depression and that they are guaranteeing it
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:15.320]  to a tune of a hundred billion dollars he said this at a press conference with mayor daly
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:22.280]  last year they've gone as i said it's either a con a lie or a flaw okay so you're saying curtain
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.360]  nimo did an article with that video and we need to get that out to people we'll certainly yes
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:32.600]  cover that you know everyone should send it viral send it all to the media it's the biggest
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:39.640]  breaking story out there the system is a fraud and this proves it gerald do you remember the
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.280]  headline on that and will uh we'll repost it on the front page and make sure it gets emailed out
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.840]  or we'll call nimo up here to the front office and find out what the headline is and put nimo in
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.560]  studio because this is big the fact that they're telling you hey this is a hundred percent backed
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.400]  a hundred percent insured but but but listen they're already admitting to stock markets down
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.840]  hundreds of billions over this they're already admitting that this is endangering the entire
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:09.080]  commodities future market derivatives even further why why would they not pay the 700
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.400]  million this isn't this is incredible i don't believe they have it just like bernie didn't have it
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:21.000]  if they have it put it up because they said they'd put up a hundred billion here's the thing salenti
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:29.720]  cme discussed guarantee oversight on mf global and the show i did last night with rob it was it
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:36.920]  we hit the points over and over this needs to be brought out there it's a ponzi scheme why aren't
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.400]  they coming up with the money after taryn stuffy said they would guarantee it to the tune of a
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:51.720]  hundred billion not 700 million all right erin dykes i've raised a lot of points gerald's
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.400]  raised a lot of points the last four minutes we have a three minutes left with him any other
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.080]  questions or comments you've got from gerald and gerald any other points you think need to be made
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.960]  here today well first of all alex the article that gerald is talking about the headline is salenti
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:12.360]  cma did not guarantee oversight in mf global scandal that was curt's uh very nice article from
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.920]  yesterday afternoon we didn't get to cover it until the overdrive segment on the radio show
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:22.840]  but that's why we got rob do covering an in-depth on the nightly news last night and he's right it
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:28.040]  breaks down really what is a fraudulent promise to guarantee this money when clearly they're just
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.920]  running interference for the big boys and now the system's just trying to play stupid i mean
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:36.840]  listen i'm not just saying this folks i've studied this i've called a lot of stuff and i agree with
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:42.120]  gerald i think this is going to end up probably completely blowing up i've got to say a hundred
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.800]  times the size of madeoff because with madeoff that was 60 70 billion with the cme group and all
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:53.560]  these other groups at mf global and what it ties into this ties into tens of trillions does it not

[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.960]  the rug from underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.880]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.560]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.880]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.840]  government kim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.560]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:51.160]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:57.880]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:08.040]  the coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.040]  but the final equation it's more important just to spread the word about these videos
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.840]  and this information because the white house is coming out saying they want to censor talk radio
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.920]  they want to have an eas alert system as we covered earlier breaking in over your computer over your
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:33.160]  phone with video and text messages tele screens going in the public places forcing their message
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.720]  of fear and tyranny upon the public and that only big sis and big government will save you we are in
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:46.600]  an incredible time as the sleeping giant that is free humanity awakens no one can deny that as congress
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:52.120]  is approval rating slides and nine percent the system is going to attempt false flag stage terror
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.960]  attacks to get us on their side and other type activities as a pretext to bring this clamp
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:03.480]  down in but as we documented getting secret myack and homeland security reports from good law enforcement
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.480]  who are following their oath none of it has to do with foreign quote al qaeda muslim threats
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:15.480]  that's a red herring an excuse the entire system behind the scenes is for the american people
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.360]  and now it's rolling out in the public i wanted to get one of the most well versed constitutional
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.920]  law scholars we interview michael bagnaric on the show you know we've talked to a lot of constitutional
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.720]  lawyers stewart roge you name it they're great folks and fighting hard but michael has and i've
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:35.240]  known him for 1415 years since he moved to austin i've been doing this 17 years he's been doing it
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.520]  almost as long he of course was the libertarian presidential nominee in 2004 and did a great
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:46.120]  job coming in fourth in that election right behind ralph nader and he's traveled the country teaching
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:52.760]  his constitutional law to groups of citizens but now he's shifting years after cooperating from a
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.960]  heart attack that actually killed him he was brought back by the defibrillators thank god
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.320]  now he's now going to speak before state legislatures and he's working with sheriff mac on a very
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:09.560]  exciting operation to reach out to the sheriffs as well and we're calling it operation domino
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:16.200]  effect we're going to talk about that before he leaves us but first uh look we're not happy about
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.920]  it we talked about on the radio today we've been proven right everything we warned of michael
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:27.400]  is now unfolding and uh where is it going to go next if we don't turn it around i mean why
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.440]  why could you and i and ron paul and others see this historically coming and see all the signs
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:38.040]  that were as clear as the nose on my face or your face and and and now people are just now
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:43.560]  waking up to it uh and and is that why we're seeing the establishment freak out and come down to the
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:51.560]  population with both feet it is and really a psychological question is why people remain
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:58.200]  in denial for so long and there were people on the titanic who refused to believe the boat was
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:07.000]  sinking um because it's just too horrific and i think that when we tell people that the federal
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.160]  reserve is counterfeiting our money and we've got fema concentration camps i think people just get
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.440]  overwhelmed by the concept and they don't want to believe it um but they are believing it now
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:25.720]  and as we said in uh an earlier program today the government is so out of control that it's hard
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.880]  not to believe it and we've got all these uh patriot groups out there you can't throw a stick
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:39.640]  without hitting a protest rally things are are changing rapidly and we are hopefully teaching
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:46.760]  people the fundamentals the philosophy that underscores the constitution so that they can
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:53.160]  understand why individual rights and private property are almost the same thing well that's
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:57.720]  right humanity has been through this over and over again that's why many historians and
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:03.080]  philosophers and teachers have said those that don't know history or doomed to repeat it uh
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.400]  people been through this over and over again they went through 30 40 years of it under british
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:13.800]  tyranny before they finally stood up and became the model of liberty worldwide now that greatest
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:19.320]  model i'm getting chills right now he is under assault but that's because it's the antidote
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:26.360]  and you're out there trying to administer the antidote uh as a constitutional scholar we
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.440]  i want your take on this because now we hear it's a privilege to own a gun a privilege to drive a car
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.840]  even though we have all the cases saying it's not uh it's a privilege to fly it's a privilege of this
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:42.200]  and that and now they're saying it's a uh privilege to uh you know have the tsa on the highway sticking
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.840]  their hands down your pants well then if it was something that was lawful why didn't happen before
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:53.160]  in this country and why was it synonymous with authoritarian states so as the tsa with local
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.040]  police under their control sure it's tenth amendment violator sure it's fourth amendment but specifically
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:04.680]  for citizens now driving up to hundreds of officers including army wanting to search their vehicles
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:11.080]  in their person what do you do at that point a and b as a scholar explain to people who are brainwashed
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  police and others that have been told that it that they're allowed to do this why they're wrong
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:23.800]  well what we have to do is be brave enough to resist no you may not search my car and i'm not
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:31.160]  sure how dangerous that'll be but we all need to insist that they do not search our car the legal
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:37.000]  ramifications of that is the fourth amendment they have to have probable cause they can't just
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.520]  come into your home and search just because they want to they have to have probable cause which
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:48.200]  means some physical evidence that leads to the probability of other evidence that's why when
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:54.280]  a police officer stops you alongside the road they always ask for permission to search your car
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.800]  because they know they don't have the authority to do that unfortunately most of us are intimidated
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:06.360]  the police officers are tall they're armed and we just give in so that we can get this whole mess
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:14.920]  over with the tsa they are searching everybody that goes through there is no probable cause that
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:20.680]  you have committed a crime and it's only because everybody goes along with it it just kind of
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:27.080]  that's the way we've always done it attitude that allows them to get away with it and we need to have
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.040]  a lot more people and and you can search the internet there are already cases where people
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:38.200]  refuse to do the body scan they refuse to go through the scanner i know of at least one lady
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:47.080]  that you know basically stripped down into her underwear and you know so people are protesting
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:53.800]  and oh well i've seen it myself they have national opt out day last year and ended up for two weeks
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.600]  they just turned the scanners off for longer and did none of it they didn't want to give us a chance
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:05.800]  to protest and say no but think about the the legal idea that everyone's guilty until proven innocent
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:11.640]  and the government's got to stop any potential crime before it starts first it's airports that it's
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:17.560]  malls and it's highways and they've said yes we're going to be everywhere i mean i mean it it is so
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.080]  amazing so explain to folks the fourth amendment you know it's it's it's houses persons papers
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.960]  effects i mean it's your person it's your body what do you do when the state police pull you over
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:33.160]  and don't even ask grab your cell phone plug it into a system to grab the whole contents
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:37.000]  what do you do when you find that tens of thousands of americans without warrants
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.160]  have gps stuck on it and federal courts are ruling they can do that i mean this is a full
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:49.800]  on assault on the fourth amendment isn't it oh absolutely and whether your listeners need to
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:55.960]  know fundamentally is that individuals have rights we are granted those rights by god
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.480]  and those rights are unalienable when we created the state governments and the federal government
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:09.000]  we granted the government's privileges and we can take those privileges away anytime we're brave
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.800]  enough to do the do so the declaration of independence says that we can alter or abolish
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:22.280]  the government if it's in violation of our rights so we have absolute total authority we are the source
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:28.840]  of all political power in the united states if we are brave enough to exercise that power so we
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.720]  have rights the government has privileges the government has no authority to change one of
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:42.120]  our privileges our rights into a privilege um i ask police officers if they have a a church permit
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.080]  and they look at me real funny and i ask them if they've ever filled out a government form that
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:52.600]  allows them to exercise their religion and they point out that the government has no authority
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.160]  to require a permit for the exercise of a right and then i ask them to explain how the second
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:05.000]  amendment is any different hi this is alex jones this holiday season more than half of our nation

[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:06.440]  prices empty shelves dot com coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:15.320]  jones broadcasting network network i wanted to have fellow austinite and patriot eddie craig
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:21.000]  in studio because the last few years i've listened to his local radio show that can also be heard
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.600]  on the internet and learned a lot from it i've studied the law quite a bit and learned about
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:32.360]  common law bill of rights constitution i've studied the court cases that traveling uh
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:39.400]  uh local motion is not a privilege it's a right uh i've learned about the fourth amendment you name
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:46.040]  it but when i listen to eddie craig he can teach us so much more but especially about state laws
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:51.720]  and traffic violations and what this whole police state's doing and eddie woke up similarly the way
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:56.840]  i did when i was in high school i saw police dealing drugs in dallas and um exposed it and was
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:02.760]  threatened eddie is an acadocious uh sheriff's deputy saw a lot of corruption things missing from
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:08.200]  the drug locker and spoke out against it and also revenue generation and they came after him so
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.640]  he'll be a guest from time to time here because he does live in austin but i thought in this
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.360]  short interview tonight on info wars nightly news we get him to just basically give you a snapshot
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:25.240]  of who he is and his awakening and then really break down uh what's happened in our society this
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.680]  road to tyranny what is tyranny so eddie thanks for being here with us uh tonight first off spend a
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:35.720]  few minutes telling your story from the inside inside a sheriff's department and watching the
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:42.360]  local police department and then expand out into how you would in layman's terms describe the process
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.880]  of going from a free society into an oppressive tyrannical society because earlier when we were
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:52.920]  standing around the water cooler after the radio you had a good uh uh parable to basically describe
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.960]  that to people i'm originally uh an active duty air force member i spent 14 years active duty in
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.600]  the air force uh that's when i got my first real exposure to the way government actually operates
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.200]  from the inside uh when i got out of that i actually became an acadocious sheriff's deputy
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.640]  i worked inside the county jail i worked with other individuals i've worked with the local police
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:20.520]  officers there and the people that i worked with for the most part were honest hardworking people
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:24.200]  they didn't really understand everything that was going on they didn't even understand the
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.240]  laws associated with their job and i'm one of these type of people that i don't settle for
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.520]  being second best at something uh i may be second best but it won't be because i settle for it so
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.040]  i spent a lot of my time reading and studying the actual statutes that we were expected to enforce
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:46.120]  i was also doing it for the purpose of when i was working inside the jail when these inmates would
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:52.600]  be brought in and booked i wanted to know with relative certainty what the actual offense was
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.240]  they were being charged with and so on and so forth just from my own satisfaction and it
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.240]  came to my attention that a lot of the people that were being brought in for things like public
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:07.720]  intoxication traffic citation arrest and so on and so forth were being illegally brought into jail
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:13.320]  under false pretenses by both the sheriff's department the dps and the local municipal
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:19.320]  police department there in acado just where i live and or did live before i came to austin but
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.200]  the more i noticed this the more i started asking questions about it and the real thing that got
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:33.720]  me out of the job there per se was by actually caught one of my supervisors uh misusing public
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:39.480]  funds and property he was actually doing his resume for one of the larger police departments in
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.480]  dallas using county property he was using the county booking camera the county film supply
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.480]  and basically everything to send out all these huge fancy picturesque resumes of himself to all
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.760]  these big municipalities because he wanted to get out of the small towns was he also stealing the
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:01.880]  time yes he was he was doing all this on the time when he should be working he's in there doing this
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:09.000]  for his own personal business and then he crashed the booking computer and asked me to help him fix
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.840]  it which i didn't so it's dereliction of duty it's it's it's it's stealing time and resources
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:20.680]  settlement is what it is and uh yeah and it's actually uh misuse of public funds and property
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:27.720]  and when he saw that i understood what had happened and how it had happened he sent me home
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:33.080]  early off of my shift and then he actually went to our immediate supervisors the next morning
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:37.080]  and reported that i was the one that had caused the booking computer crash even though i hadn't
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:42.200]  been the one that was on it and when i tried to bring up the fact that it was this individual
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.160]  that had caused this problem and what he was doing in the interim uh that's when things
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:52.040]  they threatened me with jail and everything else if i wouldn't leave the cover up kicked in and of
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.240]  course this is a microcosm of safe pin state where for 18 years they've been covering it up and going
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.760]  after the police officers and people that tried to expose it and that's a microcosm of the big
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.280]  megabanks controlling all the regulators and persecuting people at the sec that blew the whistle
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:13.960]  i mean it's it's i guess a system of where you and i were something relatively petty but they
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  then tried to persecute you making it something bigger because undoubtedly there was more going
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.520]  on above that well they compounded it with the fact that i'd bring up these other issues where
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.360]  these i believe these arrests were being done illegally which of course affects the revenue
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:32.040]  generation especially on the traffic citation side uh most of these arrests that were occurring were
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.720]  on a citation basis and each one of those citations is worth x amount of dollars in revenue to the
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.880]  city uh basically the laws of Texas set up where a city gets to keep up to 50 percent
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:49.000]  of the amount of money collected in these fines and fees while the other 50 percent goes to the state
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:55.640]  so you can honestly say that the municipalities and the counties their revenue generation is
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:01.480]  sanctioned by the state because it's a profit sharing program so the state won't interfere with it
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.280]  unless the individual causes such a stink as to make them have to look twice at the issues
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:13.000]  that's where i come into play my job is to educate people on what the actual law is here's what
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.440]  you're being told here's what it actually says here's how they're misusing it against you in
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:25.320]  order to commit fraud and to steal they're basically taxing the people of texas untold millions of
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:30.600]  dollars a year in fines and fees that don't even apply to us that they should never have been allowed
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.880]  to apply to us and compounded with these other things yeah that's one of the reasons they don't
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.160]  really like me over in that part of texas anymore that and the fact that i also went directly after
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.920]  the state comptroller's office for illegally forcing small unincorporated businesses to collect
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:53.160]  sales tax uh basically there's no law in texas that requires an unincorporated business to collect
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.840]  sales tax on behalf of the state the state does not pay the individual to do it the state does not
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:04.120]  in any way compensate them for doing it basically they're forcing you into indentured servitude
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:10.200]  as their unpaid tax collector it's on your dime that you have to take the time to accumulate the
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.960]  money prepare the reports file the reports and pay in the money and that's all out of your pocket
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.080]  and the state doesn't compensate you in any way for it that in my book is indentured servitude
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:27.080]  when i challenge the state on this that's when they begin rating my business under false pretenses
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:33.400]  swat style they actually rated my computer repair service business three separate times at gunpoint
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:38.280]  you would think they were raiding one of the largest drug labs in all of texas the way they
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.680]  came in there there was and again this is the law you were telling me earlier about the case here
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:48.760]  in austin that they've now won with these golf carts yes that drive people around uh for no money
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.960]  but a tip if they want to give it and and and and the police had no statute to be even giving them
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:58.920]  tickets they've now been defeated in court but they won't run that on the news but but we're
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  going to get to that in a moment defined for people the process of going from liberty to
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.920]  tyranny and how it takes place well uh it takes place over time if they actually tried to do it
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:15.400]  all at once the people would see it for what it is and rise up against it that much i honestly believe
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:22.600]  but over generations what they've done they have slowly indoctrinated us into accepting
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.640]  this is the way things are they teach it to our kids in school they teach it to the teenagers in
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:35.080]  college they teach it to the adults now that have grown from that generation on up and it's been a
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:43.160]  slow overtime type of thing and we've come to accept it where now we've got the public servants
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.360]  have now tried to convert our society of being from their attitude of being a servant into their
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.320]  attitude of being the master of the people they've completely done a role reversal on the way our
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:42:01.160]  republic was set up the analogy i believe i gave you in relation to this was when a rancher fails
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:09.720]  to control the coyote population on his ranch he will see a direct inverse proportion in population
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:16.520]  to his livestock to the increase in population of the predatory base so if he fails to keep
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:22.120]  that predatory base cold down then he loses money he loses control of his property and
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.920]  you know he eventually gets done in by that and what we've got now is the state instead of becoming
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.400]  the servant and protecting the rights of the people as we set them up they have become the
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.080]  predator and we the people are not keeping that predatory base minimized and that's what the founders
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:44.920]  warned us about exactly it's common sense it happens in every culture in every form of classical
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.560]  tyranny is now being set up but they've gone further adding all this high-tech grid to it
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.960]  and now in all these training manuals that good police have sent us that have made national news
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:59.400]  they say returning veterans of the enemy gun owners libertarians people that talk about the constitution
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.720]  you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with

[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:26.360]  to be a global secret program of geoengineering it's an admits it's an admission that there is a
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:33.000]  secret program going on we need to know exactly what that program entails and how this aluminum
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.080]  dioxide barium salts and sulfur dioxide is affecting not just plant and animal life but human life
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:48.280]  as well as the levels of toxic metals goes up in our soil and our next guest is going to speak to

[01:47:54.360 --> 01:48:02.040]  then gerald solente is joining us of course after that he has had his bank account robbed
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:08.920]  all part of the globalist world depression that's being engineered he had the gold out
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:15.240]  of his account stolen just incredible information breaking here coming up with gerald solente after
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:23.960]  this interview now conrad bufard if i'm pronouncing that right yes sir is our guest and let me tell you
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:30.120]  we are so left to have somebody like this right here in central texas he is recognized by many
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.920]  publications have a list of them here as one of the leading beekeepers in the world he has the
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:40.840]  largest beekeeping school in the world that is undisputed he started out in bee removal
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:45.400]  instead of just killing bees that are so important for our environment and the entire life cycle
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:51.880]  from plants on up he specialized in that and he got so busy he quit being a school teacher
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.360]  and moved on from there to now being one of the most successful beekeepers in the world
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.800]  and his honey is also of course shipped all over the united states and the world and i was mentioning
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.280]  to him that my uncle had worked for feins honey going back you know 20 years ago and he said oh
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.880]  yes we work with feins so i have to know that's another company that's real raw honey not mixing
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.280]  in corn syrup or all that other garbage and they don't strain out all the good stuff that's in it
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:22.200]  so we're going to talk about what is real honey uh what's happening with colony collapse all over
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:30.440]  the world uh and this report by texas a&m that's 76 or 77 depending on the on the brand they tested
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:38.680]  of of a major major companies had no honey in it and i mean that as an oxymoron or as a pun
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.240]  because it's not honey if it doesn't have pollen in it and he's going to explain that it's no longer
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.800]  honey it's been cooked it's been totally changed and it's great to have you here conrad thanks
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:53.160]  for coming in thank you i'm gonna try to just give you the floor you heard the points i threw out
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:50:01.720]  run through it and where we stand today sure um well you know this article uh was was like a
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.400]  godsend for most beekeepers especially beekeepers that are interested in producing raw unfiltered
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:14.280]  unheeded honey and uh it basically revealed what most all beekeepers know that the large honey
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.840]  companies are filtering out the the pollen and the large sugar crystals and cooking honey
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:28.200]  from raw honey when they get it in to put it on the shelf because they believe that consumers
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:33.000]  want that they believe that the consumers want honey that isn't really honey by definition honey
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.760]  by definition includes the nectar from plants that bees have converted you know through their
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.360]  natural processes uh into into the syrupy part of honey and then the pollen and the pollen is
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.680]  a critical part if you take that out it's not honey and so you know anyone can tell you that
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.800]  honey has to have pollen so when some of these larger companies come around and and as they've
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:02.120]  been doing for years now and take all all the pollen out uh it does nothing good uh for the
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:08.920]  consumer uh and it's it's it's kind of like uh taking the engine out of a car that's like the system
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:14.280]  telling us we want white wonder bread and not wheat bread but of the decades they found oh the public
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.680]  doesn't really want that and you know when you have allergies they say eat local honey because
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:24.440]  it has the allergens in the area i mean that's always what's been in honey that's part of it
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:29.560]  and uh can you speak to i mean there's a lot of research done on the amazing health benefits of
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:36.680]  real raw honey like round rock honey we've got a uh here on the table yeah um you know there are many
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:43.640]  benefits to honey uh it's been shown to reduce blood pressure um it in my opinion has been uh and
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.680]  in the opinion of many other experts uh has been shown to reduce allergies or allergic reactions
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:56.200]  histamines um histamine type reactions rather um it uh taken over time uh has uh it can normalize
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:01.320]  blood sugar levels if you have a wound on your skin if you get burned you can put honey on it
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:07.160]  and it will actually help heal that wound because uh honey uh naturally draws water and keeps the
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:11.960]  skin moist it helps and it was the only thing still surviving in the egyptian tombs 3000 years old
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:16.600]  yeah honey is the only food in nature that's naturally you know self-preserving that's why you
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.800]  can put it in a bottle you could put it in this glass bottle here and come back in 5000 years
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.200]  and it would still be totally edible what what are the big companies and we have a list of them
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.480]  that you see dominating store shelves where it's it's almost completely clear like like water
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:36.040]  and it tastes terrible i mean i don't like the process honey as a child my mother would buy
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:41.480]  both kinds i always liked you know the real brown honey and you know more and more people are starting
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:46.520]  obviously to buy the the real honey because i see it starting to displace the establishment uh you
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:52.200]  know so-called natural stuff but but what is that stuff that's on the shelves that that is devoid
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:57.160]  of any flavor and and doesn't have any pollen in it sure it's honey that and not all honey
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:02.040]  producers are doing this but but it's mostly among the large honey producers and typically what they
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:07.400]  do is you know they filter out all the pollen they heat it above 130 degrees sometimes for days on
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.920]  end and the reason why they do that is they want to make all the sugar crystals inside the honey
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:17.720]  the same size and they they want to filter out all all the pollens because the the pollens are of
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:23.800]  course what make it crystallize quicker so they think you know that crystallize honey is bad and
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.320]  they know what's best for the consumers so they're going to tell the consumer that it's bad
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:32.760]  and they it's kind of this self-fulfilling prophecy that uh that some consumers believe this but
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.200]  actually in reality if you were go around to most consumers they believe that they want honey
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:40.120]  straight out of the hive because it's you know it's a god-given product it's there's nothing wrong
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.360]  with honey as it comes straight out of the hive in fact you can go like i did when i first started
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.800]  keeping bees uh over here in east austin and pull a hive straight out of a church wall or out of a
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:56.440]  home uh the wall of a home or out of an attic and eat it right there and uh you know it's uh
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:01.560]  it's completely edible well that's what i buy and and and we actually have listeners also send it to
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:08.440]  us i i buy the sliced cord right and that's what i like and then i just spit the wax out right i mean
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.240]  that has the real flavor when it's in the i mean obviously you're the expert but just my taste buds
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.200]  like the you know the in the comb right right and if you take comb honey usually at the bottom of
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:23.320]  the each cell of the comb there's usually a little bit more pollen that you know just because of
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:29.080]  gravity uh that that collects in the bottom part there so uh you know if you're eating comb honey
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:33.080]  you're you're getting you know a little bit more a little bit higher concentration of pollen that's
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.880]  just based on my own experience uh and then also chewing the wax helps you know remove all sorts of
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.360]  things from your teeth it's a it's a good good way to uh to manage tartar in your teeth from your
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:48.200]  research why i mean it's i mean even medical doctors tell people that have allergies you need to go
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.800]  and you start eating a lot of local honey when allergy season kicks in and i've done it myself it
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:59.240]  really alleviates a lot of it what's happening uh you mean what when when you eat the local honey
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.000]  why is it helping with allergies i see what you're saying so you're taking in the small amount of
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.640]  pollen and you're having a small uh immune reaction and over time your body builds up a
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.600]  tolerance to that it's the same it's the same concept as you know allergy shots building up
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.280]  tolerance over time until you're at such a point where you don't react anymore to that particular
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:27.560]  pollen now i want to get into the fact that you have the largest beekeeping school right in the
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:32.200]  world that's great that you're bringing real true agriculture back to society right and i'm also
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.680]  interested in what i've read about tax incentives where people can even on small pieces of property
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.840]  knock their property taxes down to almost nothing if they beekeep i was reading where
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.560]  bon jovi has like some ten million dollar piece of property biddy pays a hundred dollars a year
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.120]  i'm very interested in that because i think we live out in the country my wife's like let's get
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:55.080]  the ag exemption with some donkeys and i'm like no let's do bees but before we get into that
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.440]  business angle of avoiding you know the big wicked tax man who wants to squeeze us to pay
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.920]  it to offshore bankers what about the crisis bees are going through there's all these different
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:11.240]  reports that it's the pesticides the bt corn the cell towers the chemtrails i'm sure it's a cocktail
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.120]  of things but from your deep research because you are respected around the world by uh by folks for
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:21.720]  being one of the biggest beekeepers out there what's your gut dead reckoning that's causing this and
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:27.640]  how big is the crisis i've seen numbers in some areas of 80 of the bees gone right and and i i
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:34.200]  think that that's true i don't um i think that uh i couldn't put a number on it but i can say that
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:39.720]  i don't know a single beekeeper who is doing pollination like you know cross-continent pollination
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:44.200]  who hasn't lost more than half of his hives and that's all that is the average some areas around
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.800]  80 they were saying right right and areas like upstate new york uh some parts of southern california
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:56.120]  um and this is just talking to people i know in those areas uh you know they they've lost everything
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:02.280]  i mean forget 80 90 percent they've lost 100 percent they lost every single hive wow and i i i don't
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:08.440]  know the the man but i i heard from another person who knows a gentleman in florida uh who took his
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:13.480]  hives to montana and when he got there the bees were alive they came back i think it was seven
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:18.120]  ten days later and literally every hive there was an bee around anywhere i mean he was they were
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:25.880]  just gone and so what that tells me and and also based on just my my gut feeling is that it is exposure
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:32.120]  to pesticides and and it's a new class of pesticides there's been a lot of research on uh neonicotinoids
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.040]  and other types of pesticides like that uh of course that may not be a hundred percent the
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.120]  reason there may be other things like travel fatigue with you know the cross-country pollination
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:47.400]  and stuff like that uh but it wasn't things didn't get really bad until uh these other chemicals
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:57.880]  started being introduced
