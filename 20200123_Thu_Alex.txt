[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  I don't have to tell you.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 has already started.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  With a bang, a lot of huge unprecedented earth changes, political changes, wars.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  And this coronavirus is huge.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  We have a special guest joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour to get into the latest developments.
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  There are all these dozens of videos coming out of people just dropping on the streets of China reportedly with the coronavirus.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  They're putting them in tubes and containers and treating it like it's something out of apocalyptic 28 days later.
[01:03.000 --> 01:15.000]  They're now seeing it comes from snakes. It has a very high mortality rate, similar to the Spanish swine flu that killed around 30 million people at the end of World War I.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  And so we're going to be going over all of this coming up, ladies and gentlemen, a new shock video reveals.
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  Chinese collapsing on streets of their major cities, major cities being closed, major airports being closed, train stations being closed.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  This is a big deal.
[01:31.000 --> 01:41.000]  Especially when we just discovered, just like I predicted, Bill and Melinda Gates are financing a company secretly developing a vaccine that just got patented.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  And then magically, well, you see what's going on.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates, of course, are really just fronts for a depopulation operation.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  But first, a special report on the good things and the positive things that are happening. Stay with us.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  The Communist Party decreed that the people surrender all their weapons and later surrender their knives.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  20 million people were killed.
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  Mao Tse Tung said that the government must command all the guns so that no guns can ever be used to command the party.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  65 million were killed.
[02:58.000 --> 03:06.000]  After America gained independence, the people were bestowed with the Second Amendment to defend their freedoms from tyranny.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  The founders would have likely found the Federal Reserve Bank alone to be despotic.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  Let alone the deep-rooted corruption and tyranny we are steeped in today.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  Today, there is open talk of gun confiscation.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  When the governor of Virginia threatened to strip his people of their constitutional right, over 22,000 people showed up to protest.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  16,000 were armed to the teeth.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  The spirit of the Second Amendment has nothing to do with sport.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  It is an equalizing force for the individual's soul which thrives only in a free society.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  And the only people who want to take it away are tyrants and fools.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  Virginia was a victory, but the swamp runs deep and the danger is real.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  A pivotal year like 2020 comes only once in a lifetime and we all need to give it everything we have.
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.000]  The leading Democratic candidate has been staffing violent radicals calling for a communist revolution in America.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  Whether or not their candidate wins.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  So if Trump gets reelected, what?
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  F***ing cities burned.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  The time to act is now. Help yourself and help your family.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Support the InfoWar at infowarstore.com.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  And we will continue to fight for individual freedom and the spirit of 1776.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  1776 will commence again if you don't back down.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  You will not take away our firewalls and you will not silence us.
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[04:52.000 --> 05:09.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  You can get the nascent iodine pack with survival shield X2 and X3 for 50% off each bottle.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  Ultimate fish oil and prostagard are both back after months of waiting as well for 35% off.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  These products are hard to source at the quality we demand so we don't know how long they'll last.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  Make sure you get yours today.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  If supplements aren't your thing, we have storeable food supplies for up to 50% off as well as water and air filter units for 30% off.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  There's never going to be a better time to support the InfoWars team.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Show Owen, David, Alex, Savannah and everyone else behind the scenes.
[05:55.000 --> 06:24.000]  You stand with them in the fight against tyranny today.
[06:25.000 --> 06:35.000]  Don't act so surprised globalist. You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  It is Thursday, January 23rd, 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  We're going to be here live until Warren kicks off live from DC.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Until 3 p.m. Central Standard Time today.
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  All right, we already had Mike Adams, who's an engineer and health news writer and a very smart person,
[06:57.000 --> 07:08.000]  joining us to cover the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak that clearly is much worse than what Beijing has been saying
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  and is something out of a science fiction horror film.
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  As we see images, hundreds of videos are now pouring out of people just dropping like flies at the ground,
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  flopping around, being put inside containment tubes out of the movie Outbreak,
[07:25.000 --> 07:37.000]  and panicked medical workers on board airplanes at checkpoints scanning people for high temperatures.
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  This is clearly much worse than they're saying, and a lot of top scientists we have reports up on infowars.com
[07:44.000 --> 08:00.000]  are reporting that it has as high a rate of death as the Spanish flu, swine flu, in 1918, 1919,
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  that killed between 30 and 40 million people, so I'll just say 30 million people.
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.000]  And DrubsReport.com is linked to a big report right now that lays all that out.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  We're going to be detailing it here today.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  Here are some of the headlines.
[08:18.000 --> 08:27.000]  Wuhan Quarantine, that's what they're calling the virus, expands the Chinese fear authorities not telling full story about coronavirus outbreak
[08:27.000 --> 08:40.000]  outside of the Greenwich Times, and that is absolutely a common-sense response with all the cover-ups and things that we've seen in the past.
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  It was Rob Dew a few days ago that filed a report, a text report, he's now filed a video report.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  We're going to play here in just a few minutes.
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  In FullWars News Director, who's in D.C. right now, on the fact that Bill and Melinda Gates fund a shadowy foundation that's been developing coronavirus vaccines,
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  and then of course you have Bill and Melinda Gates and their connection to Planned Parenthood, to depopulation programs,
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  and the statements of Bill Gates wanting to reduce world population down massively, and then you see something like this unfolding.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  It's very, very suspicious. One of the scientists who invented the coronavirus, that's what it says on the patent,
[09:22.000 --> 09:35.000]  works for a company called Piperite Institute, which gets funding from Bill Gates, the primary,
[09:35.000 --> 09:45.000]  founder on the patent, is a fellow named Bao Q. Lee.
[09:45.000 --> 09:53.000]  And again, that's linked all up on infowars.com right now.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  Also, John Hopkins has done big study partnerships with the World Economic Forum,
[09:58.000 --> 10:05.000]  and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They hosted an event, 201, a high-level pandemic exercise.
[10:05.000 --> 10:14.000]  On October 18, 2019, New York City, the exercise illustrates areas where public-private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  What is the new deadly China virus of covert operation?
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  Well, we're going to get investigative journalist John Rappaport and Mike Adams on to break all of that down.
[10:36.000 --> 10:45.000]  There's the patent history on the particular coronavirus that they say that they have invented.
[10:45.000 --> 10:56.000]  Gates funded a coronavirus pandemic exercise in October of 2019, all very, very coincidental, I'm sure, until you realize everything else he's involved in.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Here's the Paul Joseph Watson infowars.com article that's linked on Drudge Report.
[11:01.000 --> 11:16.000]  Professor Warren's new coronavirus has same kill rate as the Spanish flu, and that's what we're going to cover on the other side of this break that is coming up.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  A passenger infected with coronavirus wheeled out of airport in quarantine box.
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.000]  Let's just roll some of the footage that we have put together for TV viewers and more is being added by our intrepid reporters here as they come in.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  But there are hundreds of these videos now proliferating the Internet.
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  New, more shocking ones every few minutes.
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  Shock videos reveal Chinese collapsing on city streets as coronavirus spreads.
[11:47.000 --> 12:00.000]  Video shows hazmat teams treating people who have collapsed in the streets as potential victims of the coronavirus, but spreading worldwide in one video reportedly shot in the Chinese Providence of Wuhan.
[12:00.000 --> 12:11.000]  First responders in full hazmat suits can be seen dealing with a man laying in a pool of blood, which indicates he hit his head as he collapsed suddenly on the sidewalk.
[12:11.000 --> 12:21.000]  Another video shows a hazmat team loading another man in the back of an ambulance and an additional video shows an overflow crowd at a hospital, ostensibly in Wuhan.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  Wuhan is the largest city in central China and reportedly as the epicenter of the coronavirus.
[12:29.000 --> 12:37.000]  Wow.
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  Now, as I said, we're going to get to Professor Warren's new coronavirus has same kill rate as Spanish flu.
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  We come back and we're going to air Rob Do's report ahead of Mike Adams joining us.
[12:51.000 --> 13:02.000]  Then I will get into all the other attacks on free speech that are taking place and Greenwald, Glenn Greenwald of all people have come to my defense and said that it's very dangerous.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  Once you start banning Alex Jones, then you ban everybody else and now they're trying to lock him up for his journalism.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  We're going to be looking at that.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  We're also going to be looking at what's happening with Trump in Davos.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  The ratings for Trump in Davos are roughly five times that of the impeachment viewership.
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  People are completely and totally and absolutely sick and tired of it and they know it's garbage.
[13:27.000 --> 13:36.000]  Now, I plug basically every day in the fall and in the winter what I'm about to do.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  But now is a time to think about it even closer.
[13:41.000 --> 13:55.000]  My daughters this morning took their fish oil and had with their orange juice they'd like to mix in some of the vitamin mineral fusion because I'm trying to make sure they get additional nutrients they need so they don't get sick all the time like the other children.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  Then I went, wait a minute.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  When's the last time you guys had iodine?
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  They said, Daddy, you know, you made us take it last week.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  I said, well, you should take it a couple times weeks.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  They went and did that small dose of X2.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  One of the daughters took X3.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Then I said, wait a minute.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  And I rummaged around because I'd been forgetting to take this.
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  And I went, you understand about the coronavirus and all this stuff that the reason people get a lot sicker during the winter is not just being in cramped spaces.
[14:20.000 --> 14:33.000]  They know it's because you don't produce vitamin D3, which is essential to fighting off viruses and bacteria as a building block in your body in the winter because you're not producing it from your skin getting sun.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Like plants have photosynthesis.
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  Well, we produce vitamin D3 from the sun.
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  And that's why white people from northern climes have lighter skin is to be able to absorb more of it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  Folks from the equator don't need more.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  They have dark skin.
[14:48.000 --> 15:02.000]  It doesn't matter if you got black skin, white skin, red skin, whatever pretty color your beautiful human skin is, you need winter sun, organic, concentrated, absorbable, under the tongue, vitamin D3, white spectrum.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  It's the best you're going to find.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  It's super high end at a low price because we don't mark it up five times.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  And it's discounted right now.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  I can't go 50% anymore on sales because we'll go bankrupt because we don't have that much markup.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's 40% off at infowarstore.com and I was just in the meeting this morning.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  That's why I was almost licking on air looking at the product we have, what we can sell, what we can do.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  And this is close to selling out in the next month at the current sell rate.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  But you know what?
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  I'm going to keep it at 40% off, 23.97.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  Way better than what you're going to find out there in the synthetic garbage.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Some of it costs even more.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  Some of it costs less.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  This is a great deal for what you're getting.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  Winner, son, vitamin D at infowarstore.com.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  You really need this to fortify your immune system.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  If you don't get it from us, get it somewhere.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Just make sure it's real and it's organic and you take it out of the tongue
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  because most people don't absorb a lot of it in the gut.
[15:54.000 --> 16:09.000]  Get your D3 to daddy.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  And not just one, but all your devices with one out of the box setup.

[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  they thought might never be solved.

[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office,
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  especially folks that have worked there a long time,
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  I'm not tempting fate.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given.
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  InfoWarsLife, I still got sick every couple of years.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWarsLife,
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  the highest quality stuff that you're going to find out there,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  I just never get a fever anymore.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  It's just crazy.
[19:55.000 --> 20:08.000]  So I chalk up the genetics and the great products.
[20:25.000 --> 20:37.000]  There's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen,
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  that Bill and Melinda Gates are on record being obsessed with depopulating the Earth
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  and being connected to very, very clandestine operations.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  And they made public statements about depopulation.
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  So the fact that they are involved funding the group that has now patented the coronavirus
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  and are doing mass drills for its outbreak,
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  and now this is happening, is very, very suspect.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  Remember who Bill and Melinda Gates hang out with secretly?
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  Got caught lying about, yes, Jeffrey Epstein.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  They're front man.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  So these people are the top of the pyramid.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Make no mistake.
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  Well, now, Professor Warren's new coronavirus has same kill rate as the Spanish flu.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  A professor has warned the new deadly coronavirus, which originated in China,
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  has the same kill rate as the Spanish flu,
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  which landed lives of 20 to 50 million people in 1918.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  Here's a widespread contagion are growing after hundreds of cases were confirmed
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  and 70 people died.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  The virus originated in an animal market in Wuhan, we're told.
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.000]  China has now spread in numerous other countries, including the United States.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  The virus has a 2% death rate compared to 0.1 for the regular flu
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  for every 50 people who are infected, one will statistically die.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  And then it goes through the calculations of that.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Novel virus has spread much faster because we have no immunity.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.000]  And it goes into what Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said,
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  the report goes on from there.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  I suggest you read it.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  Now, days ago, we began to point out the Bill and Melinda Gates Fund,
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  basically all these big foundations.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  And sure enough, it's come out that they are the main funders of this one.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  For the PIR Bright Institute.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.000]  Pi Bright, or that Pi Bright Institute is how it's pronounced.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  And they hosted the operation called Event 201.
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates did, dealing with just such a pandemic just a few months ago.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that every time they have one of these big events,
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  they've had drills that are eerily similar right around the time
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  that are used for cover for any surveillance of what they're doing.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  If it ever comes out, they just say, oh, that was part of the drill
[23:02.000 --> 23:09.000]  that Building 7 was magically going to fall on 9-11, a 47-story building the CIA was based in.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  Let's go to Rob Dew's report.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  That's right, the PIR Bright Institute owns the patent to the coronavirus,
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  and I'm going to tell you the patent number right now.
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.000]  It is 101-30701, and it was invented by Erika Bickerson, Sarah Keep, and Paul Britton.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  They filed for the patent in July 23, 2015, and the patent was granted November 20, 2018.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  Now, why is that important?
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  Well, a lot of companies that develop vaccines must first patent the virus.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  Did you know the Ebola virus is patented now by the CDC?
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  They own the patent to the literal Ebola virus.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  So we have these companies making vaccines, but first they have to patent these viruses,
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  and why are they doing that?
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  Well, a lot of people say it's because of depopulation.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  In fact, it was Prince Philip who once said he wanted to be reincarnated as a virus
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  to come back and help kill off most of the population,
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  because in his effect, humans are bad for the earth as you see the society we've created here.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  We're bad for the earth and therefore need to be eliminated.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  That's why you also see groups like Extinction Rebellion and others touting global warming,
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  because that is a way to control human development and human growth.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  What do humans exhale?
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Carbon dioxide.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  What is the bad element?
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Carbon dioxide.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  So they have to get rid of that, and one way to do it is by getting rid of humans and human development.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  Getting back to the coronavirus, the area of Wuhan where this virus originated has now gone on full quarantine.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  People are not allowed to leave or enter the city, and they've stopped all public transportation.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  But is it possible, since this virus is patented and they are making a vaccine for it,
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  that this is a man-made problem?
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  I take you back to the SV-40 virus.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  Never heard of it?
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  It was named for Simeon virus 40, which was found in the polio shot,
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  and it gave hundreds of millions of people here in the United States cancer.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  In fact, you could find videos of a one Dr. Heineman talking about the SV-40 virus
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  and how they were testing it on the Russians and how they knew it was going to give them cancerous tumors.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  Gee, that damn SV-40, I mean that damn, that vaculating agent that we have,
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  I'm going to just pick that particular one.
[25:38.000 --> 25:47.000]  That virus has got to be in vaccines, and it's going to be in Saban's vaccine, so I quit when I tested it.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Sure enough, it was in there.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Don't be damned.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  So now, so I go ahead and...
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  So you just took stocks of Saban's vaccine off the shelf here at Murray?
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  Yeah, well, they had not been made at Murray. It was made at Murray.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  And you were making it for Saban at this point?
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Yeah, it was made before I came.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  Yeah, but at this point Saban is still just doing these massive field trials.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  In Russia, and so forth, so I go down...
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  I talked about the detection of non-tech profiles, and I told Alberta...
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  But at this point Saban is still just doing these massive field trials?
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  In Russia, and so forth, so I go down...
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  I talked about the detection of non-tech profiles,
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  and I told Alberta, I said, listen, Alberta, I said, you know, you and I are good friends.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  But I said, I'm going to go down there and you're going to get upset.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  I'm going to talk about a virus that's in your vaccine now.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  You're going to get rid of the virus. Don't worry about it. You're going to get rid of it.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  But...
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  So, of course, Alberta was very upset with me.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  What did he say?
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  He said, basically, that this is just another obfuscation that is going to upset vaccines.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  I said, well, you know, you're absolutely right.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  But I said, we have a new era here. We have a new era of the detection.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  And the important thing is to get rid of these viruses.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  Why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was contaminating vaccines?
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.000]  Well, because, well, there were 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we were inactivating.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  But you weren't inactivating the...
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  Well, that's correct. No, that's right.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  But a yellow fever vaccine had leukemia, a virus and everything.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  You know, this is in the days of very crude science.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  Finally, I went down and talked to him.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  I said, well, why are you concerned about it?
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  I said, well, I'll tell you what.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  I said, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus is different.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  I don't know why to tell you this, but I've been around bars all the time.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  I just think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  And he said, what?
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  I said, how? Cancer.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  I love it. I love it.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  Go ahead.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  No.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  I said, Albert, I said, you don't think I'm nuts.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  But I just have that feeling.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  Well, in the meantime, we had taken this virus and put it into monkey and into hamsters.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Uh-huh.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  So we had this meeting and that was sort of the topic of the day
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  and the jokes that we're going around was, gee, we would win the Olympics
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  because the Russians would only load it down with tuners.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  This is where the vaccine was being tested. This was...
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  So can we trust the elites to really keep us safe?
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  As you can see, the capitals over to my left, and right now, they're trying to invent...
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  All right, the full report is at Band-Aid video in the rob-do section.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  Listen to me. That's the guy that helped invent it with Dr. Salk.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  He's talking about Dr. Salk saying that.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  And the clip that dude didn't put in there is when he says, it's okay.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  We need to depopulate people anyways.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  So the CDC says 100 million Americans at least died from it.
[28:54.000 --> 29:23.000]  Get the Russians too. Nice folks, huh?
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  National treatment advisors.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  and totally change your life.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[32:56.000 --> 33:21.000]  NewsWars. Brought to you by you.
[33:21.000 --> 33:49.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have some really big developments here.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  I told you today I was going to cover the attack on the press and how it's intensifying.
[34:00.000 --> 34:08.000]  Well, now we've got another prime example, not just Brazil moving to indict Glenn Greenwald for journalism,
[34:08.000 --> 34:19.000]  and I guess wanting to lock him up like Julian Assange or Roger Stone facing 50-something years in prison for speech.
[34:19.000 --> 34:40.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer, Info Wars reporter, has been arrested again.
[34:40.000 --> 34:49.000]  Now, I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while, and when we know what's going on, I'll be able to come back and tell you.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  We've got Mike Adams coming on, but I've got to go do some stuff here, because I already know the details,
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  but I need to double-check those and just prepare, and I just need to take care of a few things here.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  So we're live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to be back here.
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  There's a very important piece that Gregory's put together that we're going to play right now that's critical,
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  and it breaks down the attempt to take our guns, and why America's waking up now realizing the real intent of guns.
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  Is it just self-defense? It's defense against a tyranny. That's how the nation was founded, so here's that report.
[35:22.000 --> 35:36.000]  Hitler took their guns. The Weimar government passed a government registration law in the name of public safety.
[35:36.000 --> 35:45.000]  After Adolf Hitler seized power, the registration list was used to disarm the Jews and political opponents of the Nazi party.
[35:45.000 --> 35:54.000]  Stalin took their guns. The Communist Party decreed that the people surrender all their weapons, and later surrender their knives.
[35:54.000 --> 36:04.000]  20 million people were killed. Mao took their guns. Mao Tse Tung said that the government must command all the guns
[36:04.000 --> 36:12.000]  so that no guns can ever be used to command the party. 65 million were killed.
[36:12.000 --> 36:22.000]  And if you try to take our power, 1776 will come in again.
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  After America gained independence, the people were bestowed with the Second Amendment to defend their freedoms from tyranny.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  The founders would have likely found the Federal Reserve Bank alone to be despotic, let alone the deep-rooted corruption and tyranny we are steeped in today.
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  Today, there is open talk of gun confiscation. Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  When the governor of Virginia threatened to strip his people of their constitutional right, over 22,000 people showed up to protest.
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.000]  16,000 were armed to the teeth. The spirit of the Second Amendment has nothing to do with sport.
[37:04.000 --> 37:16.000]  It is an equalizing force for the individual's soul, which thrives only in a free society. And the only people who want to take it away are tyrants and fools.
[37:16.000 --> 37:23.000]  Virginia was a victory, but the swamp runs deep, and the danger is real.
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  A pivotal year like 2020 comes only once in a lifetime, and we all need to give it everything we have.
[37:31.000 --> 37:41.000]  The leading Democratic candidate has been staffing violent radicals, calling for a communist revolution in America. Whether or not their candidate wins.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Trump gets reelected, what?
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  The city's burned.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  The time to act is now. Help yourself and help your family.
[37:50.000 --> 38:00.000]  Support the InfoWar at infowarstore.com, and we will continue to fight for individual freedom and the spirit of 1776.
[38:00.000 --> 38:12.000]  We'll commence again if you don't back down. You will not take away our fireworks, and you will not silence us.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[38:16.000 --> 38:31.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[38:47.000 --> 38:56.000]  The prosecutors were wanting him banned from the Capitol completely, and the judge said, no, that's the first amendment.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  This is breaking as we speak.
[38:58.000 --> 39:07.000]  They just said he couldn't quote harass members inside the chambers, which means inside the sessions.
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.000]  Well, he was in the group commons area. We've got demonstrators, media, everybody. The footage just came into us seconds ago,
[39:14.000 --> 39:22.000]  and they have arrested him for silently protesting with a piece of tape over his mouth, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  So this is really, really out of control. Savannah Hernandez, the reporter was there.
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  They are not letting people get in with equipment unless they're mainstream media, so she's on her handheld phone.
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.000]  We appreciate her. She just witnessed what happened, and then we're going to roll that footage that just came in after she breaks down what she witnessed.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  But, Savannah, tell us what just happened to Owen.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  Hi, Ellis. So, me and Owen were actually going to go into the Senate trial, and we were going to.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  Owen was going to hold up a sign that said Democrats are trying to silence me, find out more at banned.video.
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  But before we came in, the security guard said, Owen, you can't take that in. They're going to arrest you if you put that sign up.
[40:03.000 --> 40:10.000]  Now, we came on Tuesday, and there were removed Trump protesters right here, right where I'm standing.
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  Of course, silently demonstrating. Nobody talked to them. Nobody tried to come and arrest them.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  So, Owen said, OK, let's go do the same thing. Let's go stand there, and I'm going to do a silent protest.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  I'm going to hold up my sign. I'm going to put a piece of tape over my mouth that says censored, and I'm going to silently demonstrate.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  And that's what we did. And then one security card game came over.
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  You know, there's young students around that are pouring the building, and the students were coming up.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.000]  They were reading the sign. They were in support of him. He was, again, silent demonstration, not making any ruckus at all,
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  just like the removed Trump protesters do every single day here at many of the other buildings around here.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  And before we knew it, there was five security guards around him, and he got arrested for his silent demonstration.
[40:53.000 --> 41:00.000]  Savannah, we're going to get more information from you on this. Owen is in custody right now. They told him, I guess he was arrested.
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  But let's go ahead and roll the footage that you guys were able to shoot that just got into us minutes ago. Here it is.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  Consider an act of demonstration. If you don't see it, this case will be arrested.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  Sir, the impeached Trump protesters come here every single day. We saw them here. We actually confronted them.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Is there a reason why they aren't arrested every day?
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  What if I just get rid of the sign and hold this?
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  That's a different story. Holding up the sign, that's a silent demonstration.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  It can't be any demonstration activity. It can't be any demonstration activity.
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  Demonstration free time.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  How come the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to be out here every day?
[41:35.000 --> 41:43.000]  We saw them the other day. They were standing out here. No one came up to them. Is there a reason?
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  You'll have to arrest me.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  No, I don't want to go to jail, but if this is how free speech is going to be violated and you want to arrest me in front of all these people, go ahead.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  Absolutely.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  No, no, no, not yet. You just won.
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  No, no, no. Arrest me in front of all these people so they can see the censorship in this country. Go ahead.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  I want everybody to see the censorship in this country.
[42:07.000 --> 42:14.000]  Impeached Trump protesters come here every day and have never been arrested. But I'm arrested today because I have this sign.
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.000]  That's the attack on free speech in this country. That's the two-tier justice system that we're dealing with.
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.000]  If you're impeached Trump liberal Democrat protesters, you get to come here every day with no consequence.
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  But I have security all over me because I'm standing here silently.
[42:30.000 --> 42:36.000]  And if that doesn't show you any attack on free speech, if that doesn't show you the two-tier system, I don't know what will.
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  All right, folks, we've got to go to break. Network breaks are all on satellite.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  We're going to come back with them being arrested. And then we had the footage of them there two days ago, the exact same spot,
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  with a bunch of people protesting, saying they're protesting with big signs.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  But that's okay because they hate Trump and they hate America.
[42:53.000 --> 43:07.000]  But if you love America, you go to jail.
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.000]  Or you can get the nascent iodine pack with survival shield X2 and X3 for 50% off each bottle.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  Ultimate fish oil and prostagard are both back after months of waiting as well for 35% off.
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  These products are hard to source at the quality we demand, so we don't know how long they'll last. Make sure you get yours today.
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  If supplements aren't your thing, we have storeable food supplies for up to 50% off, as well as water and air filter units for 30% off.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  There's never going to be a better time to support the Info Wars team.
[43:50.000 --> 43:57.000]  Show Owen, David, Alex, Savannah, and everyone else behind the scenes. You stand with them in the fight against tyranny today.
[44:20.000 --> 44:30.000]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling a strain from rising pressure.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  Chill Force is our solution for a true, healthy, relaxation support formula.

[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Info Wars history to the spirit is your financial support.
[45:35.000 --> 45:46.000]  We make it really easy at infowarstore.com, but I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it.
[45:46.000 --> 45:55.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[45:55.000 --> 46:24.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and fight for your own future.
[46:25.000 --> 46:36.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  It feels so good. It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[46:42.000 --> 47:01.000]  I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[47:01.000 --> 47:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.000 --> 47:32.000]  Welcome back. Alex Jones here with exclusive information about the foundation being connected to the coronavirus. Of course, you knew that would end up happening, but we're going to get to that next hour.
[47:32.000 --> 47:44.000]  They're unable to bring in their equipment there. I've never seen such a clear illustration of discrimination and oppression of pro-America, pro-Trump people.
[47:44.000 --> 47:55.000]  Owen is in the Capitol. The Capitol Democrat controlled police have already in court yesterday asked that Owen not be allowed on the Capitol grounds period.
[47:55.000 --> 48:07.000]  Owen is in the exact same spot in the Senate rotunda outside the Senate where there are demonstrators all the time. I was just there days ago. They're just everywhere and holding up their signs, all of it.
[48:07.000 --> 48:18.000]  Owen is silently doing that with his sign and they come over and say, we're arresting you. At that point, he starts talking after they said we are arresting you.
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  He then said, OK, very smartly so they can't claim him to make a disturbance. It's him saying I'm being falsely arrested. It's his right.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  They're angry at him for standing up to Nadler. The most viral video of the impeachment hoax of the last three, four months is Owen. That's admitted.
[48:34.000 --> 48:48.000]  OK, top link on DrudgeReport.com, hundreds of millions of views in the aggregate conservatively. All over the nightly news worldwide it went out there. Somebody standing up and saying, no, you're the ones involved in treason.
[48:48.000 --> 48:58.000]  They were saying Trump was involved in treason. And now he was just arrested. More video just came in of him and handcuffs. We're going to get to that in a moment, but let's cut back to where we were. We went to break. Here it is.
[48:58.000 --> 49:12.000]  I want everybody to see the censorship in this country. Impeached Trump protesters come here every day and have never been arrested. But I'm arrested today because I have this sign. That's the attack on free speech in this country.
[49:12.000 --> 49:25.000]  That's the two tier justice system that we're dealing with. If you're impeached Trump liberal Democrat protester, you get to come here every day with no consequence. But I have security all over me because I'm standing here silently.
[49:25.000 --> 49:35.000]  And if that doesn't show you the attack on free speech, if that doesn't show you the two tier system, I don't know what will.
[49:35.000 --> 49:56.000]  How many warnings do you give to the impeached Trump protesters when they come here today? How many warnings do you give to the impeached Trump protesters? How come the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to come stand out here and he cannot silently stand here?
[49:56.000 --> 50:05.000]  Are you arresting me in front of all these people here today? And if that's what you guys want to do, then that's what you want to do.
[50:05.000 --> 50:15.000]  Gentlemen, no one can answer me. How come the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to stand out here and he's not? Can I get any comment on this?
[50:15.000 --> 50:29.000]  Now, next he gets arrested. That footage just came in uploaded to us just minutes ago by Savannah while she's on air with us doing a great job multitasking.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  But there's the sign tech companies ban me from social media. Democrats are trying to ban me from the Capitol. Learn more at band.video. Not my idea.
[50:37.000 --> 50:45.000]  Another great idea from Owen Schreuer and the crew. And so there you go. We're going to show you the footage of him getting arrested here next.
[50:45.000 --> 50:56.000]  But first let's roll some of the footage for TV viewers. It's from Cuck Slayer Goes to Washington that picked up by the news went viral and they couldn't defend themselves.
[50:56.000 --> 51:05.000]  They couldn't say a word. They just told him, you know, you're an idiot. You're this and that. There's other video of women screaming at him and Trump people hitting him with signs inside the Capitol.
[51:05.000 --> 51:18.000]  But that's OK. That's OK. As you see right there, it's just you can't be a Trump supporter. So when he was silently doing what they were doing, you know, they were allowed to talk.
[51:18.000 --> 51:26.000]  They were going to arrest him. So then he started speaking. Then they said, don't talk. He was quiet. They still arrested him because they want to set the president.
[51:26.000 --> 51:35.000]  But don't worry. We've got the lawyers lined up and thanks to listeners support. We got the money to defend keeping Owen in the game. And now more than ever, I'm going to ask Owen to stay in D.C.
[51:35.000 --> 51:41.000]  And we'll set up a Washington bureau this time that actually does something. I did hire some folks and try to do something, but nothing really came out of that.
[51:41.000 --> 51:48.000]  But we're they're doing something now that we're setting up a D.C. Bureau now. We're going to be there full time to make sure that they know they're not kicking us out of anything.
[51:48.000 --> 51:56.000]  And I believe the listeners will back us and support us in that info or store.com. Take action, folks. We certainly are. So please stand with us.
[51:56.000 --> 52:06.000]  Savannah, I'm going to get to this other footage of him now being arrested and handcuffed. Other thoughts on what what we've just witnessed here and how incredible this is.
[52:06.000 --> 52:19.000]  Alex, I was honestly just shocked because, again, the removed Trump protesters were allowed to stand there and demonstrate. But as soon as Owen doesn't, it becomes a big issue. And I kept asking all of the police who were trying to arrest Owen.
[52:19.000 --> 52:29.000]  Can any of you comment on why he's not allowed to stand here? There's actually five or 10 minutes of b-roll that I will upload here shortly to Twitter. As you all know, this is happening in live time.
[52:29.000 --> 52:38.000]  But I'm going to be uploading that. And in that footage, you'll see Owen, he's standing right where those removed Trump protesters stood. He's standing with his sign. He's being silent.
[52:38.000 --> 52:50.000]  Again, he only spoke when they said that they were going to arrest him. And at that point, too, he still wasn't speaking. And that's why I was asking the officers, why aren't the removed Trump protesters ever arrested or had there ever been a case?
[52:50.000 --> 53:07.000]  But again, by the police ended up swarming him. He was not disturbing anybody. There were actually many people who were coming up to him. And they were in support of the fact that they were trying to silence her that, you know, he was standing there and that he was trying to bring awareness to this.
[53:07.000 --> 53:16.000]  So it was very shocking to see. And again, none of the police could tell me why he was being or why he was not allowed to demonstrate.
[53:16.000 --> 53:30.000]  Savannah, this is happening in the USA. And again, we have the video, they're telling him, we're going to arrest you for the tape over your mouth and the sign saying Democrats want me banned from the Capitol, which is true.
[53:30.000 --> 53:43.000]  Everybody else can talk, yell, do whatever they want. But but he can't. This is totally discriminatory. This is exactly what people in the some areas of the South did to black folks, where white folks could demonstrate that black folks couldn't.
[53:43.000 --> 53:50.000]  This is this is literally a set of being black folks being discriminated against. It's conservatives. It's Trump supporters.
[53:50.000 --> 53:57.000]  Definitely, Alex. And we've seen that on social media as well. People say that it's a hoax that conservatives are unfairly targeted on Twitter and social media.
[53:57.000 --> 54:05.000]  But that's untrue. And now we're seeing that extended to the 3D world, because if you hate Trump, you can scream about it until you're blue in the face anywhere you want to.
[54:05.000 --> 54:15.000]  And no one's going to say anything to you. But as soon as you support the president, as soon as you try to call out the Democrats for their illegal motives for all of the.
[54:15.000 --> 54:24.000]  Treason that they're enacting, then you're the one that's bad and you're going to be arrested. You're going to be silenced in the 3D world. And I'm honestly shocked that this happened today.
[54:24.000 --> 54:33.000]  Owen said he wanted to come hold the sign up here. And I said, well, the remote Trump protesters were out there. So I don't know if they're really going to arrest you while I was wrong. And I'm genuinely shocked right now.
[54:33.000 --> 54:40.000]  It's crazy to have to break this news, especially in the USA, the country that is supposed to be founded on freedom of speech.
[54:40.000 --> 54:47.000]  Well, we don't start defending the speech until they come for it. We don't start valuing stuff till it's almost gone. Same thing with the Second Amendment.
[54:47.000 --> 54:56.000]  So the sleeping giant is rising. This is going to backfire on him. Savannah, go find out what's happening anytime you get an update. Call us. Great job. Get back on.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  I know dues there. Get in with you. So you have a crew and we're all pray for Owen right now in custody. Thank you so much, Savannah Hernandez.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.000]  All right, I need to fund some things. I want to play the raw video. I'm getting arrested here in just a moment.
[55:08.000 --> 55:17.000]  But I'll tell you, we're keeping Winterson High Quality D3 that you need to fight off viruses and bacteria. People get the flu and stuff in the winter because you're not getting sun on your skin that produces D3.

[55:28.000 --> 55:37.000]  You need this product, Winterson, selling out at infowarstore.com. Here's the raw footage of Owen Schreuer being arrested.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  Do you guys think I should put my sign away or no? Do you think they should arrest me in front of you guys right now?
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  What do you guys think?
[55:44.000 --> 55:56.000]  So this is your last one. This is the last final one. Do you guys tell the impeachment protest at the same time?
[55:56.000 --> 56:07.000]  I'm just asking. I just want to know. You don't want to play with me. I'm just standing here.
[56:07.000 --> 56:15.000]  There you go. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Another Trump supporter receives second-class citizen treatment.
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  Another conservative receives second-class citizen treatment.
[56:19.000 --> 56:27.000]  If you're an impeached Trump protestor, you can come out here and protest and demonstrate all day long. But if you're Owen Schreuer, they arrest you.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  So there you go.
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.000]  I was talking about the sign you told them before.
[56:37.000 --> 56:44.000]  Sir, how come the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to stand out here but we're not? We were not making any noise. We're standing there silently.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  How come the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to stand out here? I just want an answer to my question.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  No? No comment?
[56:53.000 --> 57:03.000]  All right, y'all. So Owen Schreuer just got arrested. No one can tell us here why the impeached Trump protesters are allowed to stand out here and demonstrate that Owen Schreuer is not.
[57:03.000 --> 57:14.000]  All right.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  Look at all the schoolchildren watching someone arrested for holding up a sign because they support Trump and the Democrats are openly allowed to do it.
[57:21.000 --> 57:30.000]  Why do you necessarily think there's five police officers here right now for a silent demonstration and then impeached Trump protesters are here every single day and they do not get arrested?
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  I'm in the same direction.

[59:10.000 --> 59:21.000]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[59:21.000 --> 59:30.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[59:30.000 --> 59:46.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  All right, it's 12 noon, Central Time, Mike Adams was supposed to be on 30 minutes ago and I appreciate him holding. He's an engineer, runs a big company, runs over 300 websites like naturalnews.com, and we appreciate him holding because he understands how big that was and breaking with Owen Schreuer just not getting arrested.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  We're going to get into the huge coronavirus news and big developments there and then the big developments of Fox News admitting, like, reprint me that article. I can't find it in my stack. Thanks, guys.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Oh, here it is, that the fluoridation that they call fluoride is really a toxic mix of chemicals and that it's a congressional waiver in law to do that and now they're going to put the biosludge that's even worse or not going to they are on the crops.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  So this is so huge. This is all coming out and they admit that it's deadly toxic. What the fluoride is doing to people. Just amazing. But I know you want to respond as I saw you on Skype last 10 minutes, shaking your head, watching that footage.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Radio listeners can find it. We're uploading it right now. It just went live to infowars.com and newswars.com and Band-Aid video. I mean, Owen did nothing and he's right in the same spot where the leftist run around screaming like chickens on LSD or something.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Well, Owen, he's to be commended for his actions and he is showing the complete hypocrisy of the system where you cannot stand silently holding a sign if that sign is pro Trump, but you can hold a sign and not be molested by security if it's an anti Trump sign.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  So now we have here in the Capitol building the same thing that the tech giants are doing. It's the content of your speech is what determines whether it's legal or illegal, whether it's allowed or banned.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And again, Shroyer is doing that. He's proving it. And by the way, I love what you just said. You're going to have a D.C. Bureau or activities there. I agree. If info wars can get in the faces of these people there in D.C.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Every single day they can expose this hypocrisy. You know, oh, and Shroyer just one big time, even though he got arrested, it's a big win for showing the insanity of the censorship position.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  So so hands up to Owen and Savannah. They're covering it as well.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And I'll say this, the police, I'm not defending what they did, but clearly they didn't want to do it. They've been ordered to do it and they did not look happy.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  But it shows the criminal orders they're being given by the human tick that is what we know who's leading this whole thing. It's Nadler.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And by the way, I've got a I've got a breaking story to share with you here today when we get into.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Look, this this clamp down on free speech and the release of the coronavirus have everything in common. This is all one big plan. It is a bioweapon and you're not allowed to talk about it.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  And the attacks on free speech are being ramped up everywhere. I've got details that no one else has covered yet.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  And by the way, I'll go ahead and just I haven't told you this yet. You told me two days ago, massive, unprecedented attacks you're under.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  We won't get into how they're doing it. Guess we've got started getting attacked last night, same style attack.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  And it turns out everybody's getting hit right now ahead of the coronavirus. They don't want us telling people who has their fingerprints on it.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Yeah, it's it's a huge story. We are still disconnected from our own data servers now two days and running. I've been able to post some emergency alerts.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  But here's here's the breaking news. I don't mean to take away from what Owen is doing. That's the big bombshell story of the day.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  The attack on free speech is important, but that's something that's a long term fight. The coronavirus is really starting to look bad.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  It's very bad. The hospitals are being overrun in the Wuhan province in China. 10,000 hazmat suits have now been distributed to health care workers there.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I mean, food food supplies are being stripped bare because of the quarantines in three cities now. It's insane. But this is timed with a very specific new kind of attack, a new sabotage attack.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  I've got the details in a post I put up there this morning. Look, there is a court, a federal court in California that's been hijacked by the vaccine deep state.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And they have put out what are called the TROs, you know, temporary restraining orders that are secret sealed orders that don't exist in the normal court system.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  And they are ordering hosting companies and infrastructure providers to shut down temporarily all anti-vax websites.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  So that's that's what natural news is suffering yesterday. I thought it was maybe somebody impersonating federal agents getting fake hoax.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Oh my God, this news is the most massive ever. We knew it's not just DNS blocking. They now have secret court orders under national security to block anybody exposing what's happening and pointing out the truth.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  My God, it's martial law, so it is.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And you know what? I'm the same way. And that's why we're on the same damn team. And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity. And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020, however you can.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  For bottom my heart, for my family and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  And you know that's not just words. That's reality. You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you. And I suggest you use it.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Has been arrested for peacefully holding up a little sign the size of just printer paper saying tech companies ban me from social media. Democrats are trying to be banned from the capital, which they said in court.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  The judge said no first amendment. Others are allowed to hold up signs at the very same spot we have footage from two days ago, but he was arrested.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  He was arrested. Now, Mike Adams has naturalnews.com over 300 major sites. And he is highly respected. He's an engineer. He owns a major toxicology lab that test vaccines, everything.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  I mean, if anybody is accredited to be saying what he's saying, it's him. He's got medical doctors, scientists on his advisory group is bored.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  He's got a major facility, major facilities here in Texas. Okay, major publisher in multiple languages around the world, hundreds of books. I mean, he runs just a giant operation.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  And so we're already talking about free speech. He was going to come on about the coronavirus and just how Bill and Melinda Gates funded a vaccine for it. That's a fact. Others are reporting that.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And suddenly two days ago, he said, Yeah, we can't get on our website. Hackers have gone in and blocked us. We've never seen this. Well, he just learned today.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  He just learned today. The next level of censorship is here. It's not just IP level blocking. It's not just the platforming you from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  It's getting a judge in a secret court just like I did with the president with the FISA warrants to order takedowns of anti-vax sites.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  And suddenly it's happening to other big prominent sites. It'll probably happen to Kennedy who is been speaking out against it.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  They are going into overdrive right now. You've heard them saying all this. And so this is absolutely 100% to do with the coronavirus and publicly available information.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So anything Mike, you need posted to info wars.com or news wars.com or other sites and things we have on other people's servers and things that aren't even in our name relay to us because this could happen to us.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  This is this is happening everywhere, folks. This is how bad it's gotten. That's what we got to have backup sites and relay sites and sites we work with.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  I've got big announcements I'm making on Monday collaborations that were involved in because we knew this was coming with 284 days, but but it's here.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Secret court issuing website takedown orders in America targeting vaccine proof sites.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  And they have learned secret court orders hidden inside sealed termination court cases, which are being laundered through the federal bankruptcy courts, but have nothing to do with bankruptcies are the hidden from the public view and assigned a secret code that indicates their real purpose to disrupt and sabotage the independent media
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  reporting tech companies to remove websites, the platform channels or disrupt indie media operations. And of course, it's being run out of San Francisco. Of course it is.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we even know the name of the judge. Mike's not going to release that at this time.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  It's incredible how he discovered this. This is the terrorism of the deep state and you think Trump's invincible folks and they're telling him he's going to win the election.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They're confident, but they've got a bunch of tricks happening while the trials going. We told you if they start blocking sites at the server level, you know, they're dropping the hammer.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  So so many points are converging together right now. Mike Adams already had you coming on today about these big issues with the coronavirus and what's happening.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  But this is the biggest censorship news ever because they have COG continue government emergency courts. Obviously, Trump isn't even involved in this.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  This is the deep state. So rogue didn't want you to know this was even going on. You've been calling me for four or five days.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  It's happened to a bunch of other sites, medical news sites, you know, big stuff going on. And so they're there.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  There is solve natural news subjected to industry sabotage by vaccine deep state working in junction with court secret California court incredible story culprits identified site functionality
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  compromise recovery underway. We are very close to live status again. Check back for updates. Wow. And and I'm not going to get into our architecture how we stay up.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  But this this is the deep state terrorism folks and if they can't suicide of existence with fake lawsuits. This is the next level.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  That's why you've got to remember we've got to go to the point of putting on our backup sites. We haven't even announced to people yet.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And we're going to have to do a leapfrogging folks that when they take one big one down, you'll have to know what the new backup is on other servers and it's going to take them time.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  But Trump's got to act on this now. Mike Adams, this is so illegal. This is so secret. This is so out of control. This is so unbelievable.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  This is exactly how this stuff is done. And it's all these maniac judges appointed by the Democrats just doing whatever the hell they want the president to the military to the police.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  I mean, this is judicial tyranny. Right now what you can tell us this point.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  We have a team of lawyers and private invest investigators working on this and they were able to uncover this secret sealed TRO a temporary restraining order which initially we thought was a hoax.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  But it turns out to have been issued by a court out of California. I already gave you the name of the judge off air.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I can say this judge is a female and she is a judge who has been accused. She's she's called one of the most corrupt judges in California.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  She's accused of helping a lawyer skim billions of dollars off of asbestos settlement trust funds.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  So she is a defender of chemical poisons and obvious obviously an operative of the vaccine industry perhaps will release her name at a later date.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  But she signed an order to sabotage natural news dot com and we learn from our own attorneys that she signed similar orders for dozens of other websites.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  The only thing these sites have in common is that they were named on a list and they're all known to be vaccine truth websites or so called anti-vax websites.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  My attorneys also warned me that this TRO could be escalated. They could literally seize your domain name and you have no opportunity to defend against this restraining order.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  You're not given any notice. We were never given any notice whatsoever. We're about to you know who filed the fake garbage against you.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  We know who filed it. Yes. We know who's involved in this. We know all the names and our lawyers are going to be filing an emergency injunction against this.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  The TRO probably in the Austin federal courts later today. So we're fighting this because it is blatantly illegal. And again it's a secret court.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Alex listen what they do is they find they go to an old bankruptcy court involving people that have nothing to do with us.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  That a case that was terminated in 2018 and they reactivate the case and then they attach a new temporary restraining order that has nothing to do with anything to go shut down websites.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  So what they're doing is they're not telling me in my court cases when we give them discovery no one's ever done before do everything.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  They go you're a criminal. You're not doing we say we're going to put you in jail and then they send us child porn hidden in files.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  We never open it but then they do subpoenas and no right where to go. Yes. Yes. All of our staff members were hit by attempted phishing attacks right before this happened.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Of course we know not to click strange links in email so that didn't work. Here's the bottom line carrying the coal mine. You've talked to other sites.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  It's happening to them. They're making a big move and it could be this virus out of China is what they're going to use to try to overthrow Trump.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Create a civil emergency. We've said one of their wildcards could be a bio attack or hysteria from a potential bio attack.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Mike Adams. Well the timing of this is crucial. I think John Rappaport also has suffered severe attacks on his website.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  I noticed that when I went to info wars dot com this morning that you had the cloud cloud flare turned way up because obviously you must have been getting hit by D.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  Massive massive attacks. I don't want to get into all this. What listeners don't get is we're not victims here. We're on the front lines of the fight.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  So we don't bitch and go oh I'm a baby. Help me. They've just arrested Owen. Everybody else is allowed to have speech. He can't.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  They're coming at us at every level. They're running black ops against my family and we just keep rampaging forward winning.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  But I'm telling listeners this isn't business as usual. This is red alert. Red alert. They're about to move on Trump.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I'm telling you you can feel it. You can see it Mike. And that's why Trump needs to just absolutely come out and speak.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Notice they're doing this while Trump's out of the country. I mean this is out of control man. They could kill Trump today.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I mean the fact that they're pulling secret courts doing this type of crap ahead of this virus. Who the hell knows what they've already got.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  And what they're doing and they're testing to see if we figure it out and we know or maybe our sites just disappeared.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Everybody goes oh we're in four wars. Go. This is unbelievable. It's it's the courts have been hijacked at this point.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  They're hijacked by the vaccine deep state and this vaccine deep state is this. It's a cartel between corporations and government.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  It's Bill and Melinda Gates NIH National Institutes of Health.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  And they don't know what to do now that the U.N. scientists head U.N. scientists came out and said vaccines are killing people.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  There's a cover up that they that's it banned out video. They absolutely don't know what to do. Mike we're come right back to you and talk about this folks.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  This is the biggest censorship news ever. This takes the cake with my orders of magnitude. This is like a number 10 earthquake.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  OK. This is it. Guaranteed red alert. All the stops are out. I can feel it. I can see it. This is it. They're going to try to kill Trump. This is it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  We can all agree. These are troubled times. Right. So do you know who's on your wireless network. Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.

[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  I'm here with Scott. You see him founder of OMG tax. Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS. My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garnish.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  Sometimes in the same day we even have reduced the total debt. Some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  Oh, can I ever. We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.

[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  Do you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars? It's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.

[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  Disinformation. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Remember what happened? We were the first to report on it three plus years ago. The FISA court, supposedly under the Patriot Act for Terrorist, was used against President Trump.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  We were in the campaign when he was president-elect and after, and the FBI lied to Congress in 2017 and said they hadn't been surveilling Trump.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  It was all over the media in the New York Times saying, Alex Jones is a liar. We didn't surveil him. We specifically said the FISA court.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  I was told that by former high-level people in the National Security Agency. We weren't just up here saying that.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  Why do you think they were saying arrest me, kill me? I'm a Russian agent and all this crap.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  The people that were telling me that are the folks that took down the entire Soviet Union, not the Russians, people like William Benning.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  And he said that on record here on air. That's not a secret. But we weren't just imagining all this specifically exactly, okay?
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  So when I tell you this stuff, I'm not up here trying to be dramatic.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  They've got the Senate trial going for the next two weeks. They've got this virus popping up and they've already done the big drills.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And Bill and Melinda Gates that are the deep state are behind the drills and the virus, the virus they've patented for a vaccine.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  I'm not saying they're behind the new one that just magically showed up right now.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  And Mike Adams is the tip of the spear when it comes to health news. He's just as big as Mercola and obviously they collaborate.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And Mike's got a lot of big things. He was about to launch the upsets big tech who's being sued and it's all over the news suppresses any new rivals.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  Well, Mike was about to announce this week. This week. Huge stuff. We were so excited.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Well, you just saw what happened. He's been scrambling around calling me at night. Everybody else's sites are going down.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  You know what's going on. We're just getting hammered. We're getting attacked or crawled over stuff.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that. But they got his domain support, didn't tell them and then just went and took it down.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  And then it's some squirrely court for the judge that's known all over. I looked her name up as Mrs. Corruption.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  And they don't care because they believe they're going to take Trump out for a judge to do something like this secretly.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  They're telling her Trump's gone. We're going to finally get him. Just like they told Strock and Page, Trump's gone. Set him up.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  They are threatening a judge. They're holding her feet to the fire with all the asbestos corruption that's been alleged and reported to make people do stuff.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Stuff like this is so illegal. Remember what I told you three years ago and then the headlines this year and last year.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  FBI lied hundreds of times. Just type it in.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  FISA Court says FBI lied to them with fake information to get illegal warrants.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  I'll put it in the phone if you want. Can we just put that in? There it is.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  The Inspector General's report reveals a scandal of historic magnitude, not only the FBI but also the U.S. media.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Yeah, that's the original report that we first broke. But I'm going to show you the new articles. I'll get it.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  This was big news in the last three months. Everybody heard it. Everybody knows it.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Headline, FBI lied to FISA Court. That's all you put in.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  And there it is. That's what's happening. And so it's the very same thing here.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  But you don't even know who does it unless you've got a bunch of money and time and energy to scramble around and find out what the hell happened.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  Just like I was put by G2 last year on a secret filing for my bank credit saying perfect score except he's hate, so he has a horrible score.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Take away his merchant accounts or anything he has.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  This is war, folks. This is illegal. This is racketeering. This is criminal. This is disgusting. This is evil.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And now Mike Adams has tracked it back with PIs and lawyers and found out what happened. Mike, please continue.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  We're going to have bombshell details in the days ahead. But what we know, and you described it accurately, listen, this is the headline today.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  There is now a secret FISA court or FISA style court in America that's ordering website takedowns.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  And they are specifically targeting websites that talk about vaccine truth.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  And this is happening at the same time of this massive coronavirus outbreak, massive cover up in China.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  People dropping dead in the streets and it's already spread to America and who knows how many other countries.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  This is not a coincidence, Alex, and you nailed it. This is coordinated. It's all about causing devastation and causing disease and causing an actual murder.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  And it's so illegal what the courts and the Democrats are doing, it means they're going for broke.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  They just escalated the level of their crimes is what I'm saying. Everything they're doing now, arresting reporters, everybody else has speech.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Taking down sites secretly. This means they've launched their next level of ops. They're not giving in. They're not rolling over.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  This is a huge escalation, Mike, while all this other stuff is happening.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And what it surrounds this coronavirus that you know 100% folks, the canary just died in the coal mine.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  The damn coal mine is blowing up right now. OK, this is it. It's on total maximum red alert. Guaranteed. Mike, continue.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  And remember, this virus is going to become more deadly as it mutates and it adapts.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  So the fatality rate that we're seeing right now, which is already much higher than influenza is just the beginning.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And there are also binary weapons that we talked about yesterday just a little bit as this virus combines with what they're putting into the vaccine.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  Remember, they can put DNA altering ingredients into the vaccines and isn't it amazing they have the vaccine ready for this at the same time the outbreak happened?
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  That's impossible unless you're a time.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  The Gates had a drill just two months ago and they're panicking that everybody's pointing it out. They think shutting you down is going to stop it.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  It's one of the top friends on Twitter. Everyone's saying it.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Yep. Yep. And they're going to roll out mandatory vaccines when this becomes a panic in America.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And by the way, the media is going to cause this to be a massive, massive, you know, panic among the public, but they're going to push people to mandatory vaccines.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  They're going to have an emergency order maybe by the president. I don't know. I don't know if he's going to stop this.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  He's not stopping the tech censorship. I don't know what he's going to do, but they're going to have mandatory vaccines and the vaccines will be the second half of the binary weapon.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  This is euthanasia via vaccination. This is what it's all about.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And because you and I, people like us can speak intelligently about this because we know the history, we know the background.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  That's why we are targeted first with these illegal secret court orders to take down our websites. It is so blatantly illegal.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  I mean, the court in California just committed a felony crime against natural news.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  The DOJ should be arresting that judge whose name I gave you off air.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  She should be behind bars, and yet she's still signing orders to take down other websites today.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  And these infrastructure providers out there are just following orders. They get a secret court order.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  I called the vice president of our hosting company and I said, what the hell is going on? Tell me.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  He says, I've been told not to talk about it. I can't tell you anything. There's nothing I can tell you.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  I said, we never received anything. No notice. No nothing. What is this? Is this America? What about due process?
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Aren't I supposed to receive notice? He says, we don't know anything about that. We have a TRO and we have to act on it because it's from a court in California.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And this is happening all over the country right now today. This is why sites are being taken down. The kill switch is here.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  The kill switch is here. This is what we warned about. We've been talking about this for years, Alex. You and I both and many others.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  This is the kill switch. Tomorrow, I don't know what your infrastructure is. I know it's probably way better than ours.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  So you're more resistant to it, but they're going to try everything to take it.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  We're already under attack. Stay there. This is the biggest news ever. In my 25 years, what this is so illegal, I'm getting all the calls too.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  It's happening to hundreds of prominent people. They are making their move ahead of the takedown of Trump.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  They have been testing, testing, testing, and now they're making their move, which means this virus.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  The reporting is way more deadly than they first said. It's going to be absolutely horrible if this is true and they don't want anybody there to point out who developed it or who has a history of developing stuff like this.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  This looks like the big one, folks. Total maximum alert.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  Now at survivalistcamps.com. That's survivalistcamps.com. Trust your family survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation infowarstore.com and that's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  Last Seasonal Immune and Inflammatory Responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  25 years ago when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was honest with the listeners. America was in a coma. We were being absolutely poisoned physically, culturally, and spiritually.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  It's forward to this year and 2020 and to see Soros spend over $100 million on the women's march here in DC and in Los Angeles and they might have had 30,000 people. Maybe.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  They had 5 million three years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, I was here. That is emblematic of how his money and trichon money cannot buy them the astroturf anymore.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  So yes, the awakenings happened, but we're not out of the woods. The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during this Trump Senate trial and we're going to be covering it live from DC at ban.video.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  There is an ongoing live trial of President Trump happening as we speak.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  We've been in a protracted trade war with the Communist Chinese who've killed over 100 million of their own people that the left is completely allied with.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Big Tech has been working in concert as a combine or oligopoly to suppress the speech of nationalist patriots and others.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  And now the professor who exposed its wife has died and he believes now that it was foul play and a message to him.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  The Internet kill switch. Listen to me carefully. The Internet kill switch has been activated by the deep state and by Obama and Clinton era appointed judges.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  I have been getting hundreds of calls in the last week from notable sites that are pro Trump and or expose vaccines and or talk about issues that big pharma doesn't like like life of states that's all confirmed that it's causing cancer.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  And that these consumer advocacy sites journalists are having their servers wiped and the companies aren't telling them why they're wiped and won't talk to them.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Mike Adams has over 300 sites is a major publisher. An engineer owns a medical testing company that actually test vaccines and things like that.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  One of the top accredited in the state of Texas.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  He works with Dr. McCollough of a medical doctor exposing this and many others. A secret court filed a secret TRO on him but he learned just in that court dozens and dozens of others and more every day.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  And I'm getting all these calls will say they won't say why I've just been taken off.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  This is Kafka as this is 1984 and this is all happening with the backdrop of the big tech censorship and Owen shroyer arrested a second time.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  This time not in chambers saying to Nadler you're a tyrant not Trump.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  But this time peacefully with a piece of tape over his mouth saying censored holding up a little sign saying I've been censored by big tech off the Internet.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Now I'm being censored out of the Capitol.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  You know he wasn't banned from the Capitol. The Democrats had called for that in court the day before he was there for the first arrest.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  They arrested him that videos on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  My personal lawyer is a famous First Amendment lawyer.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  He's also famous criminal lawyer.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Norm Pattis is here but quite frankly Owen is important and he should get out the next three hours or so we've been talking to the Capitol police.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  But that's just a section of the same animal.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  The Internet kill switch at server level.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  They've got systems to shut down hubs that's one part of it but to be able to go in and just say boom boom boom boom boom.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  Go into a judge nobody ever knows why you're taking off.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  You can't face them just like Trump had a secret court that the FBI was lying to that's all confirmed now.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  This is judicial tyranny and the fact of the Democrats because Mike Adams is the name of the judge all the info.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  The fact that this is all happening in secret shows they've just escalated to another level believing they're not going to get in trouble for what appears to be crimes they're committing.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Because the deep state's not been punished for trying to take Trump out so far they take that as hey we've shot a bunch and missed let's just escalate.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  Maybe we'll get him this time by cutting out all his support from under him.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  This is a major tyrannical move and he is stunning.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  We'll get constitutional lawyer Norm Pattis's take on that on both cases and oh but Mike Adams we're all in this together.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  This happening to use like getting my arm chopped off.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  So many people say I don't care my size not getting taken down big tech.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  It's in the news or lawsuits once everybody shut down even other liberal sites that they don't control are being shut down.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  It's monopoly.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  It's monopoly tactics and it's it's racketeering like the mafia saying you're not going to open a cleaners in this town.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  We'll burn it down or you're not going to open another restaurant on this block.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  That's what they're doing and it's outrageous and it signals to me Mike.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Total escalation.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  I don't see how you escalate past this unless they start shooting people.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  I mean and that and silencing people like this would be ahead of a move on the president.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  I think President Trump's more dangerous than ever.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  My god they've got the trial right now using that as the backdrop for what they're about to roll out and they don't want us to counter it.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  I predict there isn't a major uproar by Breitbart and by Daily Caller by Fox News.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  That'll be a signal and they're going to roll this out to not hundreds of sites that I know of that are having this.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Thousands probably it'll be millions because they've all got them listed and ready and they're just going to do this.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  And if they don't get in trouble with that they'll just send a whole list not even from a court.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  Mike Adams what do you think all it takes is you being named just being put on a secret list in a secret court with a secret sealed order that the public cannot find.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  You know normally you can you can look up federal court records by their number.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  It's a district number followed by the year number followed by the case number.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  You can use a phone system and you can use the the the web system and look them up.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  These cases are sealed secret cases.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  You're never alerted to them.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  It's total tyranny.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  This is the same kind of judicial tyranny Alex that has been used against President Trump.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  I mean every time Trump signs an executive order for example to protect our borders from radical Islamic terrorists.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  You know then the liberal judges say no we're going to shut that down.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Well how does a judge in Hawaii in that case have that power.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  How does a judge in California have the power to shut down my website in Texas.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  For example these are these are tyrants and they are just running rampant across the country.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  They've got to be stopped through a legal process.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  And I cannot tell listeners and up in viewers stand together and separate.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  This is the test.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  This is confirmed.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  I've been wondering what's going on for five or six days.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  You you've called me.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  You are never calling me.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Hey Alex you know what's going on.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  All these sites are going down.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  I'm getting the same calls.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  No one knows they call their hosting provider.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  They won't even tell them because they're told national security don't even tell someone because they know these orders are illegal.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Which again you'd normally go to jail for this down the road.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  But this means they're going for broke.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Let's bring Norm Pattis in here with Mike Adams.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Norm Pattis constitutional lawyer looking at his article.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  I can tell you Mike's a straight shooter here Norm.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And he's got the name of the judge off here. You should talk to him and the information.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Have you ever heard of anything like this Norm Pattis.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  No it doesn't make any sense.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And I don't know Mike's time that this is not an implicit criticism of him.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  But I you know I got the notice of this from you not long ago and I've been in the federal rule book.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  This is contrary to the federal rules of civil procedure rule 65 governs restraining orders.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  If to get a restraining order on an ex parte basis the party asking for it has to show some extraordinarily compelling set of facts to the judge.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  And what's more the target of that order gets is supposed to get a copy of it.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  The order only exists for 14 days.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  And then to be extended at the another 14 days the party seeking it has to request it show extraordinary cause and eventually you get a hearing.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  There's no such thing at least our law does not contemplate a secret court issuing indefinite takedown orders to people without notice and an opportunity to challenge those orders.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  And the notion that these are being run through a bankruptcy court and hidden from public view runs a foul of the First Amendment.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  One of the cardinal virtues we say of the court system is its transparency.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  Justice is often presumably obtained in the people's interest in proceedings that are open to the public.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  It is an extraordinary thing to seal a case.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  I'm unaware of any case in which a TRO a temporary restraining order was issued and remained in place indefinitely in a case that was then sealed and terminated to hide it from public view.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Mike's Mike I'm Mike forgive me for saying this I'm I'm hoping Mike made a mistake because if what he wrote is true we have truly entered into a I've confirmed this with other big sites and the anti-vaxxers have talked about how they want to do this.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And so this is really happening but let me add this norm.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Well this needs to be challenged.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  I agree.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  It's in the Declaration of Independence that the king had secret courts and the same kind of crap.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  I mean this we've been through this before we have and we've bought a revolution over it.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  And you know I mean at this point you know I'm simply a lawyer.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  I mean my view is if a district court or a bankruptcy court has so bastardized the rules as to permit this sort of thing it needs to be challenged immediately in a fellow in a federal appellate court.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  And if necessary in the United States Supreme Court and if these courts refuse to hear it then I guess I would reach the reluctant conclusion that there is something like a tyrannical overreach taking place.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Right now I don't know enough.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Mike's article shocks me.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  This is stunning news and if it's accurate it's a constitutional outrage and there's no other way.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Exactly and it means that they'd only be doing it if they were going for broke and we're about to probably overthrow the president and then try to get everybody.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  I mean you only do something like this if you are going for everything and this is just wild swinging for the fences foaming at the mouth behavior.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  And I can confirm Norm this is going on. Stay there please both of you.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  But I'll be honest with you.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  I don't want them to win.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  So listen you've got this guarantee for me.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  We sell enough product.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  We'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their money.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  These will change your life.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  Check out the water filtration air filtration.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  Check it all out.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  Whatever you do take action and know be part of the second American Revolution.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Be part of crushing the globalist and get great products at the same time.

[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  Mash shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  You see when you expose our false flags and fake media.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  Blaming him for mash shootings we committed.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  Hey oh Cobra.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  The revolutionary Alexa pure breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  We are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide and I want to explain something to the listeners.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  I know you know that I mean what I say.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  Now I think people figured out that I laid out a lot of extraordinary things that I believe were going on the last few decades.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  And it turns out my research and others research of what the globalists were up to has turned out to be true.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  And we've got this giant deadly outbreak of something that's a lot of mainline virologists and scientists are saying Drudreport.com's links to these articles will kill 2% of people that come in contact with it.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  And clearly it's all over the news now that the Chinese people think it's much bigger and there's all these videos of people dropping here and dropping there.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  And the fact that the last five, six days since this broke clearly they've got COG courts that's on record.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  They've got FISA courts, but that's not what bankruptcy courts are.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  And the fact that they're doing this shows that big stuff's afoot.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  And so you talk about a sensor going off or you talk about the canary down in the coal mine mean there's gas so there could be an explosion gas building up.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  This is like canaries just dropping dead everywhere.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  Okay, instantly falling over dead.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And again, Mike doesn't hype stuff up.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  He's told me the judge I've seen the information.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  Norm Pattis is here. I want to get you guys in contact with each other when we go to break here and when you guys leave us in a few minutes.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  But Mike tell Norm just on air as much as you can without saying her name so he can say more.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  Well, I really appreciate Norm's analysis there.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  And I know he doesn't represent us in this case and he doesn't yet have all the information that I'm sure he'll look into it.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  I can give Norm off air the case number that's cited here because what they did is they hijacked an old case that was terminated in 2018 in this California bankruptcy.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  It had nothing to do with us.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  It involved two individuals who live in California.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  Neither one of these individuals we've ever even written about or had any interaction with nothing to do with us.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  And then they just tacked on these TROs to that case reactivating it in 2020.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  And then without any notice without any hearing without any opportunity to challenge this we are without notice just completely taken down.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And our infrastructure provider says we can't talk about it that.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  So that's what's happening.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  And my article is word for word accurate and we are challenging this we're filing hopefully today in Austin and the federal courts in Austin.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  We have attorneys working on this.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  They are beside themselves.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  They have never seen anything like this.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  In fact this case in California that's being used hijacked for this purpose for the kill switch they're assigning this code to these cases this designation code.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  You know some cases have like a CR which means criminal or BK which means bankruptcy.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  This is a whole new code that nobody's ever seen that I've talked to none of my attorneys have any idea what they've just never seen this before.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  Never seen this action.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Never seen no chance to challenge it.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  No hearing.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  No notice.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Nothing.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  This is happening.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  I'm really glad Norm had that analysis because it actually makes me realize this is probably a bigger deal than even I had already known.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  I maybe I need to talk to some you know the DOJ about this because maybe there needs to be a criminal prosecution of the people responsible.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Something clearly isn't right Mike.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  I mean can you care you had liberty to share the code they're using to describe this you say CR BK you know I mean what what what are they designated as.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Yes it's dash MP dash.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  That's the code that they're using for these cases.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  How long ago was the order issued as to your takedown.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  To our takedown was issued on the 20th on the 20th January 20th of this year from a 2018 case.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  And Norm Norm I've been getting calls for five days from other people saying do you know what's going on.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  We're kicked off a provider they won't talk to us.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Has it begun and then you get more and more calls more and more calls.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  You know it's kind of like before they had radio or TV you know when a war was coming you saw smoke and heard cannons going off.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  I mean this is like I mean now the smoke and fire is getting closer and closer.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  This is stunning to me.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I mean you know I thought I'd seen it all and I go to court every day and I'm often surprised by what I see but this shocks me.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  You know the fact that Mike that the order was issued on the 20th you'll have a right under.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  I mean assuming they follow the rule anymore under Rule 65 you'll have a right to get into court to challenge this fairly soon.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Well the damages to him are incredible but Norm let me just tell you this.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Remember how the FISA court admitted it.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  Right no I hear you.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  That the FBI lied hundreds of times false reports.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  That's what I'm saying is they've just weaponized it all.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  They've gone crazy.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  But here's the deal FISA at least had the cloak of lawful secrecy and you know the presumption that the actors appearing before those judges would act with integrity.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  There is no cloak of lawful secrecy here and you know it's very very difficult for me to comprehend what set of factors would yield.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Only a civil emergency only and this would not be Trump.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  So we know Obama left stay behind networks and COG parameter programs in place and his idiot followers still believe he's president.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  So I'm telling you that's what I believe it is Norm.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Well I wish you all the luck in the world Mike and I would hope that you'd reach out and keep me posted on what's going on.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  I want to follow this one. I'm very interested in this and very disturbed by it.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  This is this is mega massive.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  This issue to the next level and pursue it as far and as hard as you can.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  This is a clear and present danger to every American alive because we all depend on courts for the neutral application of the rule of law.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  And if they're going to resort to this kind of secret skull dudgery I'm not feeling very safe and secure in my own republic.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  That's exactly it.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  It's being done in secret.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  They can do it to anyone that they target anyone who's named even someone who has again nothing to do with anything in California with any bankruptcy in California.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  You know we're not a California company.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  We're not bankrupt.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  We had a record year last year actually and I want to be I want to be completely clear.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  This is how everybody always works. One man dies. It's a tragedy.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  10,000 died. The statistic Stalin said that he's right.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  This is happening to everybody right now.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  We're under massive 24 hour hack attack right now.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  A deadly virus is out.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  They're covering it up.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  Obviously that's mainline news that they're covering something up and the president is under trial right now under that backdrop.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  I predicted a bio weapon release three months ago.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  I said once they we got to find that clip.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  I said once he's in the trial something like a big war or a bio weapon release something to destabilize things and now it's here.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Mike Adams as the sun folds.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  We will relay everything.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  The war rooms coming up today.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Give us an update then please and God bless you.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  All right.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  I appreciate you having me on and this is an emergency that affects us all.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  So we need you were going to be on about the admission by Fox News and the federal government that fluorides deadly poisonous and should be taken out and that other chemicals are added with it.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  You were going to come on about bio sludge all the toxic drugs and chemicals.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  They're now putting on crops and now it's how they have a waiver in Congress.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  We don't get to hear any of that because it's all about how you've been shut down and that goes through hell to post anything on the site on a backup server.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Thank God.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  And then no one told you that you were going to be sent to the phantom zone.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  That again is the essence of the Kafka style stuff where you don't even know the crime you're accused of or what happens.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  You just go straight to the hush cow.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Mike Adams.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  Thank you.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  This is Aaron Pattice here a constitutional lawyer.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  I normally want to put you on hold and come back and get into the video you've seen of O and shroyer being arrested.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Ted, can you hold for a few minutes?
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  We come back for break.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Of course I can.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Yes, and then I've got phone calls to make on this and a bunch of breaking stuffs.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  What I'm going to do is we're going to break here in a few minutes.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  I'm going to let you host as soon as you hear the liner and the music, you just host the next five minutes and then give your take on Owen.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  Then you're Godson right now because people want to hear your take.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:26.280]  and I don't know, I already talked to you.
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:28.000]  It looks unlawful to you.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.880]  And then I'm gonna just work on a bunch of stuff here
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.720]  because all hell's breaking loose.
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:35.480]  But let me just say this, or we'll run out of money.
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:37.720]  Keeping us funded is paramount.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:39.720]  And we built our own servers,
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:40.960]  we got our own backup systems,
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:43.080]  we got all sorts of things,
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:45.680]  so that when they try this stuff on us,
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:47.720]  when they set off a nuke or release a bio weapon
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:49.000]  or kill the president, God forbid,
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.640]  that we're there to counter them.
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:52.040]  Because they're gonna try to kill everything
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:53.160]  when they make that move,
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:55.400]  but they're not in total control.
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:57.520]  So they don't want us,
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:58.840]  if they try a coup on the president
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.600]  to be faithful to the republic and be on air.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:03.840]  So everyone tell folks that the internet kill switch
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:05.600]  is being implemented selectively.
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:08.320]  They're testing the internet kill switch to see our response.
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:11.600]  Get the live feed out at infowars.com.
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:13.960]  And if you go to infowars.com,
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:16.400]  we pull up today's article page, it says right there.
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:20.280]  Maximum alert, internet kill switch activated in beta test
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:22.040]  ahead of removal of Trump.
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:24.960]  Get that article from newswars.com.
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:28.080]  It's not as censored out there at newswars.com
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:29.720]  as infowars.com is.
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:32.520]  I'll pull it up, it's all right, I can do it.
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:35.800]  So just go to infowars.com,
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:37.760]  and it's the big article page for the show.
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:38.880]  Yeah, click on that please.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:40.920]  Maximum alert, internet kill switch activated,
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:43.720]  thousands of Trump sites erased from servers,
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:45.080]  infowars is confirmed.
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:46.880]  The secret Obama control court has activated
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:48.440]  a beta test for complete removal
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:51.760]  of nationalist and patriot content from the internet period.
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:54.480]  Maximum red alert.
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.760]  We're adding a link there to Mike Adams article.
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:59.200]  They've been testing and pushing
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:00.360]  to see if you ever wake up,
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:04.440]  and now it's gone just exponential means exponential.
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:07.160]  Every point on a Richter scale is exponential,
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:09.520]  meaning it's a whole magnitude.
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.460]  So a one is a one, a point one is double a one.
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:15.480]  You understand?
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:17.320]  And it goes exponential right up from there.
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:20.760]  This is order of magnitude pegging the line,
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:22.280]  jamming it through the side,
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.640]  fire coming out of the control panels, okay?
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:26.880]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:28.520]  if they blow Trump's head off today, okay?
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:31.680]  I mean, I'm just saying, red fricking alert
[1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:34.640]  with all the signs and the stuff we've got going on.
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.720]  Watch your six, and I tell everybody, I've never said this.
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:39.600]  Everybody better start carrying firearms
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:41.040]  right now defensively.
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:43.920]  Watch your six, patriots, the globalists are testing.
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:49.160]  Hey, you there, we have a problem.
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:52.200]  You see, there is a baby.
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:56.040]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:58:00.160]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[1:58:00.160 --> 1:58:02.960]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:06.760]  The father considers leaving town.
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.000]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.320]  She says to have an abortion.
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:16.120]  The mother decides to look into it.
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:19.240]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:21.000]  She's made her decision.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.560]  She's going to have an abortion.
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:27.080]  The problem is that baby is you.
[1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:33.000]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life,
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:36.760]  Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C.,
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:38.800]  noon at the National Mall.
[1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:39.960]  I'll see you there.
[1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:42.400]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:47.280]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:51.120]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars,
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:53.720]  the family of listeners and viewers,
[1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:56.200]  that without you, we won't be on the air.
[1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:58.160]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:00.240]  But I really think you should thank yourself
[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:02.960]  for keeping us on the air and really changing the world
[1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:05.600]  for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:07.920]  But something I should spend more time on
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:11.520]  is just reminding you that these products
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:13.160]  are really amazing.
[1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:14.560]  You've got that pledge from me,
[1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:16.320]  but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:18.320]  the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:20.680]  The supplements are all the very best
[1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:21.840]  you're going to find out there.
[1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:25.160]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:28.000]  that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:31.800]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[1:59:31.800 --> 1:59:36.600]  It really is something that is good for everybody
[1:59:36.600 --> 1:59:38.560]  that stands for justice and freedom
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:40.880]  and makes your life and your family's life
[1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:43.040]  and your children's life so much better.
[1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:45.920]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:52.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:06.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:13.840]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:13.840 --> 2:00:16.480]  I'm sorry to tell you about Owen Schreuer from the war room,
[2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:19.560]  and I want you to pay attention to it because it's important.
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:21.600]  I represent Owen down in Washington,
[2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:26.000]  and he was arrested for telling Representative Nadler
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:30.480]  that he thinks Nadler and the Democrats are the traders here
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:32.160]  and that he thinks they ought to be impeached.
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:35.040]  He was arrested on charges of interfering with Congress.
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:37.960]  So I go down to DC yesterday and appear it is arraignment
[2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:39.480]  to the initial court appearance,
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:41.360]  and the United States Attorney's Office
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:43.120]  took the following position,
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:45.480]  that pending the resolution of Owen's case,
[2:00:45.480 --> 2:00:48.200]  he should be barred from Capitol grounds
[2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:49.480]  or in the alternative,
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:51.640]  prohibited from entering the Senate building.
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:53.720]  There'd only be one reason to keep him from the Senate building
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:55.680]  and that would be to keep him from reporting
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:00:58.200]  on what's going on in the impeachment proceedings.
[2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:00.760]  We opposed that in a court hearing
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:02.400]  and a judge agreed with us.
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:04.640]  We then appeared in a second court later in the day
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:06.160]  when the government renewed its motion,
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:08.320]  and we had to argue yet again
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:09.680]  that Owen should not be,
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:11.640]  that Owen enjoys the presumption of innocence,
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:13.520]  that even if he violated the law
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:15.880]  in telling Representative Nadler off,
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:18.040]  that's not to say that a court should adopt
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:20.640]  the minority report-like perspective on the law
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:22.920]  and make predictions about what he'll do next.
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:24.320]  And a court agreed with us and said,
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:27.120]  Owen can go back onto the Capitol grounds.
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.240]  This to me was a stunning event.
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:30.760]  I practice law in New Haven.
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:32.680]  I've got, I've had the pleasure of getting to know
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:35.960]  the folks at InfoWars and I'm delighted to represent them.
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:37.960]  But in New Haven, we recently had a protest
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.920]  at the Yale Harvard game
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:42.960]  where environmental protesters stopped the game
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:44.480]  for an hour or so.
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:46.000]  They were removed from the field.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.560]  A local prosecutor called me and said,
[2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:49.720]  what do you think we should do with these kids?
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:50.640]  Or these protesters?
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:52.840]  I said, you know, a small fine and a slap on the wrist.
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:54.600]  If you're going to engage in civil disobedience,
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:55.440]  pay the price.
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:56.720]  The prosecutor said, yeah, maybe you're right,
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:58.240]  but I think we'll just drop these.
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:00.160]  That's how I looked at Owen's case.
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:02.720]  Here's how the government looks at Owen's case.
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:03.640]  No deals.
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:05.520]  He has to plead guilty to crimes
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:08.080]  and he can enter what's called an open plea.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:09.960]  That is, he can appear before a judge
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:12.360]  where he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison.
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.640]  I am stunned by that.
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:16.640]  That is such an overreaction.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:17.920]  Well, it gets worse.
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:20.200]  Today, Owen appeared in a Capitol building
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:22.240]  and he appeared with a piece of duct tape
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:24.440]  over his mouth that said censored.
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:26.400]  He was also holding a sign talking
[2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:28.240]  about big tech censorship.
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:31.000]  When officers approached him and said, you got to leave.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.520]  Now it turns out he was being videotaped by a colleague
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:34.360]  and the colleague said, well,
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:36.360]  how come when the anti-Trump protesters
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:38.480]  were here a couple of days, they weren't asked to leave?
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:39.960]  The officers ignored him.
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:41.120]  One of them actually looked at her
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:42.440]  and said, you're so adorable,
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:43.920]  as though flirtation were part
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:46.880]  of the standard law enforcement repertoire.
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:50.240]  Owen was warned thrice to leave the cock crowed three times
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:52.240]  and then he was placed under arrest.
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:54.640]  He was placed under arrest for demonstrating
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:56.520]  in a public building.
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:00.360]  Now there is an obscure district of Columbia statute
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:05.000]  that says, and I quote, it shall be, excuse me,
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.480]  shall be unlawful for any person willingly
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:09.600]  and knowingly to parade, demonstrate,
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:12.000]  or pick it within any of the Capitol buildings.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.080]  So I gather that the police officers
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:16.600]  take the position that standing silently
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:19.720]  as a crowd milled by with a sign on him
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:21.880]  was a demonstration within a Capitol building
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:23.480]  and they will attempt to justify
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:25.720]  their arrest of him on those grounds.
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:27.800]  Our position is the First Amendment
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:30.120]  gives the government the right to place
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:32.520]  reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:35.600]  on our speech in public locations,
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  but it does not give to the government
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:40.440]  the right to shut us up.
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:42.760]  And Owen had as much in our view of a right
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:45.520]  to stand where anti-Trump protesters did
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:49.480]  and give his point of view that those protesters had.
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:51.920]  So I don't know Owen's status right now
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:54.680]  and I returned from Washington late last night
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:03:56.760]  after representing him, we're due back in court
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.920]  on his prior case next Tuesday.
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:00.920]  For all I know, I'll be back there tonight
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:03.560]  or tomorrow morning to appear with him
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:05.760]  if they don't release him on bond.
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.600]  So when you hear info war is talking
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:10.320]  about needing your help, this is a snapshot
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:12.640]  of what's going on on the front lines.
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:15.240]  Owen Shroyer, host of the war room,
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:17.880]  went to Washington to tell we the people
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:19.720]  what he sees down there.
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:23.000]  And some people in Washington don't want you to hear it.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:24.840]  And they feel strongly enough about it
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:27.840]  that the United States attorney appeared in open court
[2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:30.160]  to seek an order barring him from reporting,
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:32.880]  from appearing so that he could report on what happened,
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:35.440]  on the theory that he might protest again.
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  How did we like sheep get to the point
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:40.960]  of being corralled in such a pasture?
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.880]  Owen is a patriot.
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:46.560]  Now he may have disrupted, you know, Nadler's hearing.
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:49.320]  It's an open question to me how that disrupting of a body
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:51.280]  can be disrupted, but we'll concede
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:54.400]  that he may have disrupted that as to today.
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:55.480]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:57.360]  It's time to take a new healthier approach
[2:04:57.360 --> 2:04:59.200]  to one of your most basic needs.
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:01.240]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system

[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:54.640]  Brought to you by you.
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:06:21.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:30.520]  there is an attempt to sabotage our republic.
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:32.760]  I'm going to break down the latest right now
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:35.720]  on this coronavirus and the biggest quarantine
[2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:38.240]  in world history.
[2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:40.760]  It's what many experts are asking that stories up
[2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:45.400]  on infowars.com, big story up at drudgereport.com.
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:50.360]  Scientists out of the UK, virologist says this could be
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:57.080]  or looks like it's as deadly as the swine flu of 1918,
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:00.440]  the kill between 30 and 50 million, they're saying.
[2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:01.640]  I said 30 and 40 million.
[2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:05.320]  That's 30 and 50 million.
[2:07:05.320 --> 2:07:08.240]  And all I know is it's the perfect type of global crisis
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:11.480]  to have a global government as the answer to a global crisis
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:13.840]  and a perfect way to try to derail the US economy out
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:15.560]  of the election.
[2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:18.680]  The little indications had a big drill a few months ago
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:20.680]  for just as such thing happening, it turns out
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:24.680]  they're financing the vaccine for this very virus.
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:29.520]  Lo and behold, those are all facts.
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.560]  But if you're reporting on it, they're now trying to shut
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:32.120]  people down.
[2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:33.480]  We've confirmed that.
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:35.920]  So this is a really worrisome trend
[2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:36.880]  and you add it all together.
[2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:37.960]  It doesn't look good.
[2:07:37.960 --> 2:07:41.080]  Shock video reveals Chinese collapsing on the streets
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:43.640]  as coronavirus spreads.
[2:07:43.640 --> 2:07:45.440]  And it looks like something out of a horror movie
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:46.560]  with the pods and the rest of it.
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:48.720]  But we're going to go back to Norm Pattis on the attack
[2:07:48.720 --> 2:07:52.920]  on free speech and the new arrest of Owen Schreuer.
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:53.760]  You're in just a moment.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:07.080]  I just see things like this happening to Owen Schreuer.
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.600]  And yeah, when I saw the police officer basically tell
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:15.960]  Savannah she was just attractive, I mean,
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:17.520]  I guess I'm glad they're not politically correct.
[2:08:17.520 --> 2:08:19.400]  But when you're arresting somebody,
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:21.200]  there fell a reporter violent in their rights.
[2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:24.000]  I see it as very aggressive and domineering
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:28.600]  in the context in which he was complimenting her.
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:33.160]  Very creepy and sick that it's an exact same spot
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:34.400]  the two days ago.
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:36.000]  There were all the anti-Trump protesters
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:37.360]  who were not even admonished.
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:40.400]  And they were there for hours, groups screaming at Owen.
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:42.560]  So Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer,
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:45.080]  he's been covering what happened to Owen in the case.
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:49.400]  And Norm, again, this is all just part of the course now,
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:51.800]  what do you think Owen's going to have to do
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:53.560]  after you saw them throw the book at Owen
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:55.240]  but Democrats can do whatever they want?
[2:08:55.240 --> 2:08:57.920]  Well, we're due back in court with Owen on Tuesday.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:01.280]  And I suspect the government will use this new arrest
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:04.280]  to seek yet again what it failed to get last week that
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:07.200]  is an order barring him from capital grounds.
[2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:09.320]  I also have been in touch with folks of yours,
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:12.680]  I think Rob's down there in DC to keep an eye on Owen's bond
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:14.040]  situation.
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:15.520]  He was released on his first arrest
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:17.280]  on what's called a personal recognizance.
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:19.400]  In other words, a promise to appear.
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:21.520]  Today, they're likely to set a bond on there.
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:24.280]  And if it's a bond much higher than $5,000, $10,000,
[2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:26.160]  you're going to know that the fix is in
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:29.160]  and that the desire to silence and restrain and punish Owen
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:31.240]  for speaking out is predominant.
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:33.560]  So I don't know what is going to happen today.
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:35.800]  Obviously, it's happening in real time.
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:38.720]  But on Tuesday, we'll be back in a courtroom
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:41.960]  in the District of Columbia on his behalf.
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:45.160]  And I suspect the government's going to up the ante.
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:47.320]  They're going to say he's been charged yet again.
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:50.360]  And they're going to insist that he enter a guilty plea
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.520]  and agree to accept some time behind bars.
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:54.000]  That would be my suspicion.
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:09:59.520]  We are in the midst of researching, as we speak Alex,
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:02.040]  I've got somebody here researching the history
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:05.800]  of the statute under which he was presumably arrested today.
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:08.880]  And the argument is that there is a statute
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:12.680]  that says you can't demonstrate within a Capitol building.
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:16.040]  Is that an over-broad statute?
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:18.920]  Is standing with a sign a sort of demonstration?
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:22.360]  Well, also CNN, MSNBC praise women in the cabinet
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.040]  all hearing yelling and screaming.
[2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:26.520]  And they didn't get charged last time I saw.
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:27.520]  So...
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:29.560]  Well, it's even more disturbing than that.
[2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.120]  When I was in court yesterday with Owen,
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:33.320]  I was in the cafeteria and ran into an old friend
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:34.280]  and he said, what are you doing here?
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:35.680]  And I told him and he started laughing.
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:37.120]  He said, are you serious?
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.320]  And I said, yeah, why? He says, every time Jane Fonda
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:41.240]  gets arrested for doing something similar,
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:44.000]  they just let her walk out the door and drop the charges.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:47.040]  So, we're trying to reach out to Jane Fonda right now
[2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:49.360]  to see if she'll come to Owen's support.
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:51.040]  Freedom of speech matters.
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:53.040]  Whatever your views in this country,
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:55.000]  you should have the right to express them
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:56.480]  and people should be treated.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:57.600]  Well, I wouldn't hold your breath
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:01.040]  because the left now supports their speech, but not ours.
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:03.600]  There's now more Bernie Sanders high-level staffers
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:05.600]  caught on tape saying they're gonna put
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:07.920]  nationalists and conservatives in death camps.
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.640]  Well, they're gonna have to fight me to put me in one.
[2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:14.720]  I don't know whether I'm a nationalist or a conservative,
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:16.200]  but I do believe in the rule of law
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:19.040]  and I think that that kind of talk is dangerous
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:21.320]  and needs to be fought every step of the way
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:22.720]  in every courthouse of the land.
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:23.560]  And if you're a court member.
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:24.520]  You're damn right.
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:27.520]  Why do you think the left has gotten itself
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:30.000]  into such a crazed position
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.120]  to just push boundaries to the breaking point?
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:35.400]  I think they're terrified that Trump will win again.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:38.080]  You know, the coasts are littered with anti-Trumpers
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:41.520]  who can't accept the results of the 2016 election.
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:44.400]  The impeachment proceedings were timed, in my view,
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:46.880]  to coincide with the electoral season
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:50.480]  to make it a publicly financed attack on Trump.
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:53.040]  And they're terrified that in flyover country,
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:55.200]  the place that most of us reside in,
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:57.000]  and certainly although I live on the coast,
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:58.200]  the place where my heart is,
[2:11:58.200 --> 2:12:00.000]  I come from Detroit and Chicago.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.120]  In flyover country, they're afraid
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:05.000]  that most people are gonna vote for the economy.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.800]  They're gonna vote for putting America first.
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:09.840]  They're going to vote for taking care of ourselves
[2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:11.040]  before we make commitments
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:13.600]  that we cannot sustain to the rest of the world.
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:15.480]  They're afraid of Trump 2020,
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:17.440]  and the only way they can try to stop it
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:20.240]  is by silencing those who speak on behalf of Trump.
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:22.320]  You're absolutely right,
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:24.600]  but there's a lot of federal executive relief
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:26.120]  the Justice Department could engage in
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:27.520]  with this type of behavior,
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:29.400]  not just with what happened to Owen,
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:31.320]  but big tech censorship and the rest of it.
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:33.560]  And Trump doing nothing so far
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:37.440]  has been a big fat green light for all of that.
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:38.800]  Norm Pattis, thank you for the great job
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:40.480]  you're doing with Owen and all of us,
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:42.320]  and thanks for joining us.
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:43.160]  I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:44.840]  All right, thank you.
[2:12:44.840 --> 2:12:47.160]  So that's where we are, folks.
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:48.440]  And if you just tuned in,
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:50.760]  Owen Schroyer this morning,
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:52.840]  right before he went live on air,
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:57.340]  he just was there and was not even talking
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:12:59.680]  and had tape over his mouth.
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:01.400]  You're ready, you're listening to the video
[2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  at m4wars.com, simply saying
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:14.360]  that he has a right to free speech and it's being violated.
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:19.040]  In fact, let's just do this.
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:20.680]  Let's play the first video
[2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:23.960]  before he gets arrested for TV viewers and radio listeners
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:26.800]  because you'll notice there's no audio.
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:28.200]  I'll have to talk over it
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:30.280]  because they come over and say,
[2:13:30.280 --> 2:13:33.360]  you can't have a piece of tape over your mouth.
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:34.920]  But everybody else can demonstrate in here all day.
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:36.520]  We just don't call that demonstrations.
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:38.600]  They can hold up their signs, they can yell at you,
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:40.860]  but you can't be there.
[2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:43.080]  So let's go ahead and roll that video.
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.200]  Owen Schroyer here from infowars.com.
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.640]  I am back in the state capital where
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:52.640]  when I walked in today, I was greeted by security
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:56.880]  who told me if I even take this sign out
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:00.440]  in the building today that I would be arrested.
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:04.720]  Well, I'm planning on not even saying anything
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.080]  because I'm gonna put this over my mouth
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:09.600]  as an illustration of the censorship that I'm enduring
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:12.280]  now in the real world, not just by big tech,
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:13.520]  but by the Democrats.
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:15.240]  And I was told I'd be arrested
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:17.680]  if I take this sign out and hold it.
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:19.160]  Well, the removed Trump protesters
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:21.280]  had dozens of signs out here that they were holding.
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:24.980]  Are they gonna arrest me for doing exactly what they did?
[2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:27.240]  Well, I guess we're gonna find out.
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:36.920]  So he's whispering in a corner.
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:42.520]  He's right where everybody else has been standing every day
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:45.800]  right in the middle under the big goddess of Columbia.
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:55.800]  And they come over and say, can't do it.
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:14:57.560]  Sir, the impeached Trump protesters
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:14:58.880]  come here every single day.
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:14:59.720]  We saw them here.
[2:14:59.720 --> 2:15:00.720]  We actually confronted them.
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:03.120]  Is there a reason why they aren't arrested every day?
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  What if I just get rid of the sign and hold this?
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:10.280]  We're gonna go to break.
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:12.520]  Again, the full video is on infowars.com
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:15.040]  and newswars.com, but I'm just gonna be honest
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:19.520]  with you right now, I've been studying COG,
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:22.000]  continuity of government, how they're trying to take Trump out
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:23.800]  and how these shadow groups that were put in
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:26.480]  during the Cold War are still operating.
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:29.520]  And the way this judge in California is ordering
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:32.920]  hundreds of sites secretly taken down is totally illegal.
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:35.360]  We just had a lawyer on explaining that as well.
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:37.880]  That means they've gone full criminal.
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:40.800]  And if you follow this threat continuum,
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.480]  it means violence very soon by them,
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:46.920]  false flags to blame us, start a shooting war.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:49.720]  I'm just telling you, and at a gut level,
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:16:14.720]  oh man, I mean, it's off the chart, my spotty sense.
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:22.240]  Not a security IPO or note.
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:23.920]  Blockchain data centers have proven
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:26.080]  turnkey equipment sale leaseback program

[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:48.760]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:49.880]  consult with financial professionals
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:16:51.480]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:53.800]  a security which requires an offering document.
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:56.280]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage,
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:16:58.840]  founder of BlackRifleRealestate.com.
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:01.720]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:04.240]  until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:06.520]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead

[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:57.240]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers
[2:18:57.240 --> 2:18:58.760]  from InfoWars.
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:02.440]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.080]  as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:09.080]  has really caught hold, not just here in the US, worldwide.
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:11.720]  And President Trump's fearlessness when
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:15.040]  it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:16.720]  is amazing as well.
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:19.720]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship,
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:21.720]  taking action against that in some other areas.
[2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:24.280]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy,
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:26.440]  speaking out against communist China,
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:27.880]  Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:30.360]  But now, more than ever, we really
[2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:33.600]  have to realize that we're being targeted because we
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:35.160]  are effective.
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:38.520]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:40.040]  against humanity in a big way.
[2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:42.480]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:44.600]  But it's critical to not let ourselves
[2:19:44.600 --> 2:19:48.280]  get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:50.240]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[2:19:50.240 --> 2:19:53.400]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:20:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:33.080]  There is a dagger pointed at the heart of the American
[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:39.080]  Republic right now.
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:44.240]  The deep state establishment was just
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:47.920]  a drive in their heart.
[2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:52.600]  Question is, are we going to let them?
[2:20:56.600 --> 2:20:59.720]  Think about that.
[2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:02.320]  But all the moves we've seen are
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:10.800]  like laying a piece of paper on top of a stove,
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:14.520]  a coiled electric stove.
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:18.280]  And if you watch the paper begin to yellow and then brown
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:26.640]  and then suddenly, flashpoint, that piece of printer paper,
[2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:32.960]  writing paper flashes into flame.
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:35.000]  And so the increments of the tyranny
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:38.400]  have been yellowing and browning the paper.
[2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:40.640]  But we're right at that moment in slow motion
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:45.280]  if you can see it when it goes.
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:49.160]  If you put a piece of paper into a regular fire or a gas stove,
[2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:51.000]  it'll kind of light on one spot right away
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:52.400]  and just kind of burn through.
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:54.600]  But there's something spectacular
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:56.800]  about one of those flat top electric stoves.
[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:02.880]  And it's a science experiment.
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:04.480]  My dad and I was like six, seven years old said,
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:05.480]  you want to see something?
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:08.600]  And he showed me out of the deer camp
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:11.360]  we had that had a gas stove and an electric stove.
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:14.400]  He actually got a piece of paper and showed me.
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:16.520]  He said, because the heat's being evenly distributed
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:20.080]  with this one, it'll go at a flashpoint instead of over here
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:22.560]  with a flame and explain some thermodynamic thing to me.
[2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.560]  I didn't get that and don't get now.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:26.280]  But that's kind of something my dad was always doing
[2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:27.880]  when I was a kid.
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:30.440]  He teach me how water towers work
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:32.760]  and how electricity works and how gunpowder works
[2:22:32.760 --> 2:22:35.800]  and how nuclear weapons work and how firearms work
[2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:39.120]  and how crops work and how the electrical work works.
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  But I digress, America is at that flashpoint
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:49.360]  and the paper's browning right now and any second.
[2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:54.360]  That's why some of the biggest explosions are in paper mills.
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:22:58.360]  There's a bunch of paper dust in the air.
[2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:01.760]  And you get one spark, one piece of paper burns,
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:06.360]  little bitty piece, barely see it, just like flour mills.
[2:23:07.480 --> 2:23:09.240]  So the biggest explosions you could see,
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:11.280]  it looks like TNT goes off.
[2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:14.920]  Somebody lights a match inside a paper mill
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:17.400]  and we're inside a flour mill
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:18.920]  and those little pieces in the air
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:23.920]  just like gasoline and that's where we are.
[2:23:28.200 --> 2:23:29.840]  And so I don't know if it's gonna flash today
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:33.440]  or next week or tomorrow.
[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:36.480]  Well, you actually found an example of flashpoint.
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.600]  And so Trump has to act, America has to act
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:49.880]  because globalists look like they're losing
[2:23:49.880 --> 2:23:52.680]  but they keep upping the criminal increment.
[2:23:52.680 --> 2:23:54.840]  They keep upping what they're getting away with
[2:23:54.840 --> 2:23:59.840]  and we think they're losing because each plot fails.
[2:24:00.640 --> 2:24:03.160]  But what they're really doing is conditioning us
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:06.760]  not to recognize when the big one actually hits.
[2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:12.040]  And that's why they're telling you that Trump's invincible.
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:12.880]  That's why they're saying,
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.800]  all the odds makers say he's invincible.
[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:17.640]  That's why they're saying nothing can stop him.
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:23.360]  It's because they want Trump to be comfortable
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:25.800]  and not watching us back and they want us to go to sleep
[2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:27.280]  so they can drop the hammer.
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:33.880]  And in increments, exponential going to this level
[2:24:36.800 --> 2:24:38.640]  with what they're doing to Trump supporters
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:39.480]  around the country,
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:41.160]  electing all these district attorneys
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:42.760]  and sheriffs that work for Soros
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:45.240]  and are openly saying we're gonna allow people
[2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:46.680]  to attack Trump supporters
[2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:48.680]  and then they're having cases where they do
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.240]  and the DC courts let Antifa brutally attack
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:56.980]  men and women savagely and they just say, you go free.
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:01.400]  And you say, well, that'll start a war.
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:03.400]  Well, that's exactly what they want.
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:05.520]  Due process has been thrown out the window
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:09.400]  but it's being done in the blue cities
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:12.440]  because they're losing.
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:18.120]  But if Trump doesn't take action
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:19.840]  and if we don't take action politically
[2:25:19.840 --> 2:25:22.240]  and through the criminal justice system,
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:25.080]  we are aiding and abetting these people.
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:28.160]  We'll have discussion about what we're gonna do
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:30.720]  but it's rapidly reaching the point
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:36.940]  where the media and the academics and the politicians
[2:25:36.940 --> 2:25:38.480]  leading and directing this
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:41.720]  and the globalist financing it are at war with us
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:45.400]  through their capos and through their soldiers
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:48.000]  and they're entering a world of pain.
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:55.480]  It's all I'm saying.
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:56.520]  They will lose.
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:57.640]  There's no way they're gonna win.
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:00.160]  Chot-coms, they're done.
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:01.760]  Globalist Hollywood, everybody hates them.
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:03.680]  There's nothing they can do to fix anything now.
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:05.720]  They're totally hated, it's over.
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.200]  Except can they drag us into a big giant war?
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:15.800]  They should quit right now.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:19.640]  But they just don't know how to quit, do they?
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:22.600]  Like undead zombies.
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:23.840]  We're gonna go to break.
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:25.520]  Something I wanna just tell you about here
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:27.720]  is so important to you and your family.
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:31.240]  You know, funding this operation is pretty darn important.
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:32.440]  We are the tip of the spear.
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:33.360]  You are the tip of the spear,
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:35.480]  funding us to spread the word.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:37.440]  But this is from the World Health Organization
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:38.880]  of all places.
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:41.840]  According to the World Health Organization in 2007 study,
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:43.560]  nearly two billion individuals
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:45.800]  had insufficient iodine intake,
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:47.880]  a third being of school age,
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:50.520]  cognitive iodine deficiency syndrome.
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:53.120]  It goes on to say it's the leading cause
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:57.960]  of low IQ in the world.
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:00.680]  Two billion plus people.
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:04.000]  We sell the very best iodine there is out there,
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:05.840]  the opposite of fluoride.
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:07.400]  Fox News reports on a big federal study
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:10.840]  about how there is weaponized toxic fluoride
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:13.880]  added with chemicals in all the major drinking water
[2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:15.400]  and how it's killing people in mass
[2:27:15.400 --> 2:27:17.720]  and 100 plus million people are getting sick from it.
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:19.360]  That was Fox News two days ago.
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:26.600]  X2 and X3 are the good halogen that counter all of that.
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:31.400]  Yes, of course, I'm selling you something you need.
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:32.680]  I'm telling you you need it.
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:35.880]  So you buy it and so it helps you and so you get more.
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:37.120]  You know why I never get sick?
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:38.400]  You know why I'm so aggressive?
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:40.040]  You know why I look many ways younger
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:41.280]  than I did 10 years ago?
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:43.480]  Because of iodine, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:44.800]  and because of the right kind.
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:46.240]  This funds our operation.
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:49.760]  It's been sold out for a while, 40% off.
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:52.480]  You get it with X3, two different formulas, both excellent.
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:53.880]  Give them 50% off together.
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:56.200]  Only thing I know 50% on, wither together.
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.880]  And that means free shipping on that order as well.
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:02.840]  The infowarstore.com, everybody should be stocking up
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:03.680]  on this stuff.
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:04.560]  It lasts for years and years.
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:06.360]  There's not even expiration date on it.
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:08.480]  But let me go further.
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:12.800]  Why do I call our vitamin D3 and vitamin K fusion,
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.240]  winter sun, because your skin produces vitamin D
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:18.720]  when it gets sun?
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:19.960]  Well, you don't get it in the fall
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:20.800]  and the winter in the spring
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:23.160]  and that's the main reason you get so many flus
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:25.720]  and other things from viruses and bacteria.
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:29.040]  During the winter is because you're not producing it.
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:32.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, doctors forever said,
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:34.120]  go out and get some sun, you won't get sick.
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:35.440]  Well, you can't do it in the winter.
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:37.480]  Winter sun is 40% off,
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:39.720]  even though it's about to sell out at infowarstore.com.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:42.080]  So two things with all this crazy stuff going on in the world
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:44.440]  and the fluid on the rest of it is vitamin D3
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:46.280]  and we have a great, high quality,
[2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:49.400]  non-synthetic form of it, infowarstore.com.
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:52.280]  Get both of these big specials before they end.
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:57.080]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:00.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.520]  Whether it's a big company selling your data

[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:07.200]  everybody sees your information.

[2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:57.640]  We have been fighting so hard in the last two weeks
[2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:00.240]  that I've not even had time to cut new audio ads
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:02.920]  for this huge syndicated radio audience.
[2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:04.640]  And I apologize to radio listeners,
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:07.240]  I apologize to the fact I'm cutting this on a phone
[2:30:07.240 --> 2:30:08.080]  as I drive around the road,
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:10.760]  but this is a war we're getting to done anyway we can.
[2:30:10.760 --> 2:30:13.720]  But we had huge sales in the new year,
[2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:16.600]  around Christmas end of the new year.
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:20.120]  But we sold the products at such low prices
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:23.200]  that it didn't bring in a lot of actual capital
[2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:24.160]  to fund our operations.
[2:30:24.160 --> 2:30:26.840]  And I'm expending massive amounts of money
[2:30:26.840 --> 2:30:29.640]  to put more than 15 people in Virginia,
[2:30:29.640 --> 2:30:31.520]  more than 10 people in BC,
[2:30:31.520 --> 2:30:33.560]  all next week for the trial of Trump.
[2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:36.720]  It's so critical we're there to confront the globalist
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:38.360]  and put out the counter narrative of the truth
[2:30:38.360 --> 2:30:39.760]  to what they're doing.
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:41.000]  This is a real fight.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:42.680]  So please step to the plate
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:44.160]  and take care of yourself and your family
[2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:46.560]  and get great products while you do it.
[2:30:46.560 --> 2:30:49.080]  At infowarstore.com, these are products you need,
[2:30:49.080 --> 2:30:51.400]  like the ultimate fish oil, and it funds the operation.
[2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:53.560]  Please take action, infowarstore.com.
[2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:56.560]  I would thank you for everything you've done
[2:30:56.560 --> 2:30:58.640]  for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:00.560]  You don't want my thanks.
[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:02.320]  You want victory over the globalist
[2:31:02.320 --> 2:31:04.320]  and these devil worship and child molesters.
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:06.800]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:08.360]  And you know what, I'm the same way
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:10.960]  and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:14.400]  And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:18.360]  when it's clutch time to focus the people
[2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:20.320]  on taking action against the globalist
[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:24.080]  because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[2:31:24.080 --> 2:31:25.680]  And I know you are as well.
[2:31:25.680 --> 2:31:28.320]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:29.280]  because you are the Info War
[2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:31.800]  and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us
[2:31:31.800 --> 2:31:33.800]  in 2020 however you can.
[2:31:33.800 --> 2:31:35.720]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family
[2:31:35.720 --> 2:31:37.640]  and for the great crew at Info Wars,
[2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:38.480]  I want to thank you all
[2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:40.360]  because you are the Info War
[2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:43.480]  and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:45.080]  You have made history.
[2:31:45.080 --> 2:31:46.960]  We have made history together.
[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:51.560]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you
[2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:53.920]  and I suggest you use it.
[2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:56.360]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste
[2:31:56.360 --> 2:31:57.880]  because I hadn't tried it
[2:31:57.880 --> 2:31:59.640]  except for maybe the last week and a half
[2:31:59.640 --> 2:32:01.680]  and I told Alex, I said,
[2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:03.360]  man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:04.720]  He's like, well, what are you doing
[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:05.640]  just sitting in here telling me?
[2:32:05.640 --> 2:32:07.440]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:09.680]  So here I am telling people
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:11.720]  super silver whitening toothpaste
[2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:15.040]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:16.280]  and I'm 45 years old
[2:32:16.280 --> 2:32:18.200]  and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:19.920]  and it's fluoride free.
[2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:21.160]  I think the big difference,
[2:32:21.160 --> 2:32:23.200]  the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:25.480]  because after I brush my teeth with this,
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:27.960]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:29.960]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth
[2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:31.440]  after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:32.720]  It feels so good.
[2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:35.640]  It feels like it feels like good things
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:36.880]  are happening in my mouth.
[2:32:36.880 --> 2:32:39.960]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:41.440]  three to four times a day
[2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:43.080]  rather than just twice a day now
[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:45.160]  because I like the way it feels.
[2:32:45.160 --> 2:33:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:15.160 --> 2:33:19.960]  Waging War on Corruption.
[2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:21.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.720 --> 2:33:27.720]  So the original theme of the broadcast today
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:29.360]  is I just cover whatever I think is most important
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:30.920]  and whatever is front and center,
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:32.240]  whatever you alert us to,
[2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:35.560]  was the coronavirus
[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:39.320]  and the weird connections of the low malendigates
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:41.280]  and a vaccine and then wargaming
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:43.640]  that's happening two months ago and all the rest of it
[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:46.080]  and how that could politically be used
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:47.840]  against Trump and the world economy.
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:50.200]  I mean, I predicted three months ago
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:53.480]  that a bio weapon release or a crisis
[2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:56.640]  during the Trump trial would be what I would look for
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:33:58.840]  as part of the backdrop of fear and hysteria
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:01.520]  to then trigger riots and things
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:02.800]  and say Trump's got to go.
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:08.240]  That's just one of the things we're on record saying.
[2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:10.840]  I'm not saying that's what's unfolding at this point,
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:14.600]  but we're also going to get into censorship
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  and Glenn Greenwald and the fact that the Brazilian government
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.120]  wants him arrested for journalism
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:27.040]  and how Trump's not standing up for a signs,
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:29.880]  even though he told him release the WikiLeaks on TV.
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:31.280]  You just can't do that, President Trump.
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:33.680]  You need to release Julian Assange.
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:36.160]  A lot of people have turned against Trump because of this.
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:38.160]  I still love him way better than Hillary,
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:39.640]  but my goodness, it's scary.
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.560]  Glenn Greenwald confronts American liberals
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:44.240]  trying to destroy free speech.
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:46.280]  Big article up on inforwars.com.
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:48.800]  Here's some of what Greenwald had to say
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.120]  and then Roger Stone's lawyer is gonna exclusively join us.
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:56.440]  Yep, there's big news on that front.
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:57.360]  Oh, it's big news.
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:34:58.200]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:00.400]  We're getting Tyler next on the line right now,
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:02.520]  but first here's what Greenwald had to say.
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:05.280]  And say, look, they're not banned from communication.
[2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:06.760]  They just can't use a telephone.
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:08.680]  They can drive six hours
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:11.400]  and go talk to the person directly.
[2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:14.360]  Or the same with the person who had a monopoly
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:16.960]  over telegraphs at the turn of the century.
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:18.880]  The reality is that Facebook and Google,
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:21.200]  I think, are becoming something much different
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:23.480]  than public companies.
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:26.880]  They do a lot more than just fostering communication.
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:30.080]  In fact, their primary business at this point
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:31.840]  is not fostering communication
[2:35:31.840 --> 2:35:33.120]  or allowing internet searches.
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:35.960]  In the case of Google, it's gathering data about all of us
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:38.600]  so that they can sell this data and monetize it.
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:41.040]  And their main business actually is artificial intelligence,
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:42.800]  is understanding how the human brain works
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:43.920]  so that they can replicate it
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:45.600]  and even build a better version.
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:49.600]  These are companies with incredible power
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.840]  over almost every aspect of our civic life.
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:56.800]  And so I'm not losing any sleep over the fact
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:00.280]  that Alex Jones' videos can't be on YouTube,
[2:36:00.280 --> 2:36:02.200]  but I am starting to lose some sleep
[2:36:02.200 --> 2:36:05.320]  over the ability of these corporations
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:09.520]  to exercise unconstrained control
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:13.640]  over almost every facet of human life
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:17.600]  in a way that I do think starts to transcend
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:20.000]  the power even of the most powerful governments.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:24.040]  And that, I think, is what this Alex Jones' banning is about.
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:26.720]  And let me just make one last point about Facebook,
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:29.400]  which is it isn't like this is the first time
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:33.120]  that they've decided to ban big platforms
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:36.040]  and the name of eliminating incitement to violence
[2:36:36.040 --> 2:36:36.880]  or hate speech.
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:39.360]  We wrote an article actually at the end of last year
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:41.240]  about how they're now taking requests
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:42.520]  not just from the US government,
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:44.200]  but from the Israeli government.
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:47.240]  And I think in something like 97% of the cases
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:49.560]  have taken requests from the Israeli government
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:52.720]  to delete pages of Palestinians,
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:54.840]  including Palestinian journalists and media outlets
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  and activists.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:58.200]  And it just deleted them on the same grounds
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:36:59.600]  that they just deleted Alex Jones,
[2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:01.880]  which is these pages are hate speech,
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:03.720]  they incite violence.
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:07.320]  And I think that there's this kind of romanticized notion
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:09.600]  that if we have the rules that Breonna read earlier,
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:11.240]  that they're gonna be implemented in this way
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:13.520]  that's really pleasing to the liberal mind.
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:15.400]  And I think the reality is much different
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:17.880]  that powerful corporations are gonna institute
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:20.760]  censorship rules in general,
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:24.200]  not to protect the marginalized against the powerful,
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:27.080]  but to protect the powerful against the marginalized.
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:29.040]  I don't have any...
[2:37:29.040 --> 2:37:33.200]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:36.320]  Oh, I'm not losing sleep over Alex Jones losing his platform,
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:39.040]  but it is dangerous.
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.400]  Everyone has to add that proviso so they don't get attacked.
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:43.640]  Remember Zuckerberg said,
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:47.200]  you talk about Alex Jones in a positive way, you're banned.
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:49.240]  I could be a terrible guy,
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:50.800]  but people should have a right to defend me,
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:54.440]  but imagine that dangerous proviso we're watching you
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:59.080]  and you've got to only say bad things about this person.
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:02.560]  That's so cult-like, but oh, everybody's got to follow it.
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:08.920]  Wow, that's really what people have become.
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:16.040]  That's what everybody's turned into.
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:19.200]  And then now, oh, it's the NRA, now it's President Trump,
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:24.360]  and it's all about making you do what they say
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.200]  or this huge internet that was supposedly for us to communicate.
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:31.560]  It's really to watch us and make sure we conform,
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:34.080]  and that's not dangerous.
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:37.360]  A big semi-omnipresent system,
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:40.760]  tracking everything we do,
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:43.480]  working with authoritarian regimes,
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:45.800]  but then they're the moral authority
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:48.760]  when they help China round up millions of people
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:50.600]  and put them in death camps.
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:53.160]  That's Google and Apple on record doing it.
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:56.440]  They don't even hide it, but they are moral at Google.
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:01.080]  And Alex Jones, he questioned years ago mass shootings
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:02.640]  because so many other things are fake,
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:04.640]  and that's the worst thing in the world.
[2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:06.800]  Oh, he questioned WMDs,
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:09.040]  and he questioned babies and incubators in Iraq
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:12.680]  that he was right about, and he questioned Jesse Smollett.
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:15.280]  And we first questioned the Covington kids
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:16.560]  when the media said they did all this,
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:18.800]  and I said, looks to me like that guy came over
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:19.640]  and got in their face.
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:22.120]  We were the first on that Saturday.
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:25.240]  They put an article out like an hour after it happened live.
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:28.920]  And sometimes it would turn out we were wrong.
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:30.640]  Maybe the Covington kids did do something wrong,
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:31.920]  but it didn't look like it to us.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:36.520]  So we said, looks like the media's running with this BS,
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.720]  because it was now this that it put it out.
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:43.520]  And it turned out we were right.
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:49.960]  98% of the time,
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:53.040]  because we're trying to tell the truth.
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:54.880]  We're trying to get it right.
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:56.200]  We don't always get it right,
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:39:57.440]  and when we get it wrong, we tell you,
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:39:59.160]  but we're really trying to get it right.
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:00.720]  We're really care about humanity.
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.760]  I really have empathy for little black kids
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:05.920]  and little white kids, little brown kids.
[2:40:07.040 --> 2:40:09.160]  I may hate how adults get wound into fury
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:11.160]  and hate me because of what color I am.
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:13.680]  And it doesn't mean I go wrong
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:15.280]  with political correctness either,
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:18.760]  but I genuinely care about humanity,
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:20.560]  and the system knows that, and they know
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:22.560]  you legitimately care about humanity,
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:25.360]  and they know that we legitimately come together,
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:27.200]  and that what we're saying is popular
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:30.000]  because humanity has a fallen nature,
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.640]  but at the end of the day, want to be good,
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:37.920]  and that freedom is popular.
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:41.600]  And then asking questions and being focused
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:44.720]  and being involved and being engaged is not a moral sin.
[2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:45.880]  It's a good thing.
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:49.560]  It's a blessing, and that the corrupt Hollywood
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:52.200]  and the corrupt globalists and the corrupt chikams
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:54.160]  and the corrupt EU royalty
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:40:57.880]  has no business sitting up there
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  as the new moral church over the world,
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:03.880]  pontificating and speaking from their thrones
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:07.880]  of political power about who has speech and who doesn't.
[2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:10.720]  But finally, tyrants believe they're gonna win
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:13.560]  because they weaponize media, they weaponize entertainment,
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:16.120]  they flood the country and the world with drugs
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:17.960]  and entertainment and alcohol,
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:21.080]  and hope that they can just get us confused and scrambled
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:24.280]  and short attention spans to the point of
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:26.680]  we lose our humanity,
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:28.400]  and these big corporations can dominate
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:30.000]  and take full control,
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:33.160]  even though it's ruining their own children's lives.
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:38.320]  They can't help but deploy the technology.
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:41.320]  They can't help but carry all this out
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:44.360]  because if they don't, somebody else will.
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:45.600]  That's the argument.
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:48.160]  Okay, well, if somebody else is gonna get nuclear weapons,
[2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:50.200]  why not just hand them out to everybody?
[2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:54.560]  Bio weapons, gene editing, edited babies, human animal clones,
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:59.520]  all the announcements about normalizing, growing.
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:02.840]  Now they're saying, oh, biological stuff is robots.
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:05.040]  Oh, look, we created the first cellular robots
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:08.760]  and soon we'll create cellular flesh robots.
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:11.800]  But really, it's biological creatures they make
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:13.880]  that are slaves and programmed.
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:19.480]  It's disgusting and it removes us from who we are
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:22.600]  and lets these sick evil corporations be our gods
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:24.520]  and have us merge with them.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:27.440]  And then it's fetishized by the left in Hollywood
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:29.160]  that this is the great new thing.
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:32.600]  When it's dead, it's unfulfilling, it doesn't work,
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:35.360]  it stinks, it doesn't, it's a joke.
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:37.960]  All of it, pedophilia, all this crap,
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:42.160]  is just people signing on to destroying who they are.
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:45.200]  The equivalent of sticking their soul
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:47.280]  into a light socket and being fried
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:49.480]  and saying, oh, that's an amazing phenomenon.
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:51.880]  What a feeling, big breaking news, straight ahead.
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:56.480]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate.
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:42:59.280]  But everybody around the office,
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:02.080]  especially folks that have worked there a long time,
[2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:04.720]  have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:07.280]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow
[2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:10.000]  because I just made that statement, I'm not tempting fate.
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.400]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:13.440]  when it comes down to that.
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:15.960]  I'm very thankful for good Lord, for the Constitution
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:17.480]  I've been given.
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:20.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:24.480]  when I started taking X2 and the products in forced life,
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:27.440]  I still got sick every couple of years.
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:30.440]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:31.800]  and things like that.
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:36.160]  But now that I religiously take the products
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:38.480]  and in forced life with the highest quality stuff
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:40.080]  that you're gonna find out there,
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.320]  I just never get a fever anymore.
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:46.920]  It's probably been three, four years
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:49.920]  since I've had a fever, it's just crazy.
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:44:03.600]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[2:44:19.920 --> 2:44:22.960]  Highline pack with survival shield X2 and X3
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:24.840]  for 50% off each bottle.
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:26.680]  Ultimate fish oil and prostate garter

[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:31.460]  These products are hard to source
[2:44:31.460 --> 2:44:32.640]  at the quality we demand,
[2:44:32.640 --> 2:44:34.280]  so we don't know how long they'll last.
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:36.060]  Make sure you get yours today.
[2:44:36.060 --> 2:44:37.440]  If supplements aren't your thing,

[2:45:54.660 --> 2:45:58.260]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[2:45:58.260 --> 2:46:02.260]  introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[2:46:02.260 --> 2:46:07.460]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal
[2:46:07.460 --> 2:46:14.900]  and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[2:46:14.900 --> 2:46:20.260]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[2:46:20.260 --> 2:46:25.860]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have
[2:46:25.860 --> 2:46:31.380]  the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[2:46:31.380 --> 2:46:37.460]  symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current
[2:46:37.460 --> 2:46:42.180]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an
[2:46:42.180 --> 2:46:48.100]  enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the
[2:46:48.100 --> 2:46:54.100]  air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:46:54.100 --> 2:47:10.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:15.860 --> 2:47:22.660]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[2:47:22.660 --> 2:47:38.580]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:40.580 --> 2:47:44.100]  You've been doing great, Owen. You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's,
[2:47:44.100 --> 2:47:48.260]  and of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour of calls. The crews volunteered
[2:47:48.260 --> 2:47:52.900]  to do it, so we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates. So the live
[2:47:52.900 --> 2:47:56.900]  covers continues. Everybody spread those links. The Glowdwells are hacking us, trying to shut
[2:47:56.900 --> 2:48:00.660]  this down. Don't let them win. No BS. Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[2:48:00.660 --> 2:48:05.460]  See, I don't have some Mackie Valley manipulative view. With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:12.500]  That's the real power. Don't act so surprised, globalist. You didn't think you could silence
[2:48:12.500 --> 2:48:18.580]  the American people, did you? Join Band-Aught Video, and I will complete your training.
[2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:28.420]  Together, we can overthrow the emperor and restore the republic.
[2:48:29.700 --> 2:48:35.060]  The power structure has built the Internet kill switch. They've built the incremental systems
[2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:40.900]  of Chinese social credit score. Big Tech has helped China round up millions on record. They're very
[2:48:40.900 --> 2:48:46.340]  proud of it. Well, they lecture us about how to be moral. How conservatives are evil and need to
[2:48:46.340 --> 2:48:54.820]  be silenced as we question public events and statements. Now, they are moving forward with
[2:48:54.820 --> 2:49:03.860]  even more intense censorship, right as they try to remove the president. But I was thinking about
[2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:10.660]  political prisoners soon to be of their successful Roger Stone last night. So I thought, let me
[2:49:10.660 --> 2:49:18.500]  search into his name. And I saw this. Key witness, ass judge, not to send Roger Stone to prison.
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:28.580]  Randy Kredico. And this is Randy Kredico right here, the former current talk show host that
[2:49:28.580 --> 2:49:34.020]  Roger was saying was one of his sources. I remember Roger telling me that, that it was Randy Kredico
[2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:39.300]  when Roger was a pundit here on InfoWars. I remember saying, get Kredico on. That's great. Oh,
[2:49:39.300 --> 2:49:45.540]  he's scared. But what's the crime trying to get ahold of Julian Assange? He never told me that
[2:49:45.540 --> 2:49:50.260]  he was, had talked to Julian Assange. He hadn't. But everybody else had. He wouldn't talk to us.
[2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:54.740]  But he said he was talking to an intermediary. And so Roger's only crime was hyping up that was
[2:49:54.740 --> 2:49:58.580]  going to be big against Hillary Clinton, something that was true and something that Assange had
[2:49:58.580 --> 2:50:04.820]  said publicly. You already know about that. But Randy Kredico, to his credit, has come out and
[2:50:04.820 --> 2:50:07.700]  said, you know, I wasn't asked the right questions about the prosecution or the defense.
[2:50:07.700 --> 2:50:13.140]  This was just Roger and I joking back and forth. That is what we did, threatening each other.
[2:50:14.420 --> 2:50:17.620]  Roger does have a funny sense of humor, does that back and forth here as well.
[2:50:18.340 --> 2:50:21.460]  But that's it. That's threatening a witness. And he just says, please let him out.
[2:50:22.100 --> 2:50:29.620]  The sentencing has been moved back to February 20th from the 6th because they're getting all of
[2:50:29.620 --> 2:50:34.900]  Roger's finances and a federal courts ordered all of his documents, all his bank accounts,
[2:50:34.900 --> 2:50:39.140]  all his emails to be handed over to the media. Judges have never done that.
[2:50:40.340 --> 2:50:43.780]  So the deep state's all secret, but boy, everything Roger's got, I guess, on the left
[2:50:43.780 --> 2:50:50.660]  and dig through it and really try to destroy him will be released. So that's the type of
[2:50:50.660 --> 2:50:56.820]  harassment that's going on here. Ladies and gentlemen, but I wanted to get Tyler Nixon,
[2:50:56.820 --> 2:51:00.260]  who's not his lawyer, been his lawyer in the past, was not his lawyer on these cases
[2:51:00.260 --> 2:51:04.020]  because on none of this comes from Roger. None of these are statements from Roger.
[2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:09.300]  Roger said, I can't talk to you. Talk to one of my lawyers. You want to talk to somebody?
[2:51:09.300 --> 2:51:11.780]  Because I texted him last night this morning. He said, you know, I can't talk to you.
[2:51:12.340 --> 2:51:17.460]  Say hi to the crew. Miss you guys. Talk to Tyler Nixon. And he sent more messages.
[2:51:17.460 --> 2:51:20.500]  By the way, I didn't say anything to you. I want to talk to Tyler Nixon. I mean,
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:24.740]  he's that doesn't have free speech. His co-host is in jail right now.
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:30.420]  All his lawyers have been arrested again for wearing tape on his mouth in the Capitol for your
[2:51:31.700 --> 2:51:36.580]  where everybody else is in there demonstrating, but he's not allowed to. So now one one host is
[2:51:36.580 --> 2:51:42.900]  facing 20 to 52 years in prison. Art has been millions has been bankrupted. The other host is
[2:51:42.900 --> 2:51:46.980]  they're now saying what the judge wants them to spend a year in jail with the lawyer on earlier.
[2:51:48.020 --> 2:51:54.500]  So that's America right now. So Tyler Nixon as an army veteran as a patriot,
[2:51:54.500 --> 2:51:57.620]  as a lawyer, what do you make of this climate and what's currently unfolding?
[2:51:59.460 --> 2:52:05.300]  It's just unconscionable, but it's also exposing who the people really are,
[2:52:06.020 --> 2:52:10.820]  you know, what their intentions are. And frankly, that, you know, those like you,
[2:52:10.820 --> 2:52:15.460]  Alex and others who have tried to sound the clarion bell, this is exactly what they're
[2:52:15.460 --> 2:52:18.500]  going to do. And what they're doing and what you predicted they would do,
[2:52:18.500 --> 2:52:22.580]  which is to try to shut everybody down, lock up. I mean, they're going to turn this into a police
[2:52:22.580 --> 2:52:27.460]  state if they have their way, but it's not no a police state necessarily with jackboots and
[2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:33.620]  truncheons just yet, but it's certainly digital police state to digital. That's right. Exactly.
[2:52:33.620 --> 2:52:37.220]  Yeah, you can, they can, they can shut your life down with the, with the click of a mouse,
[2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:44.340]  you know, as opposed to the stroke of a pen in days past. And, you know, Roger Stone's
[2:52:44.340 --> 2:52:48.820]  persecution, prosecution, whatever you want to call it, is a perfect example of this where
[2:52:48.820 --> 2:52:54.980]  they've co-opted or attempting in the process of co-opting the final bastion, I guess you could say,
[2:52:54.980 --> 2:53:00.500]  within the state structure of the government for any type of recourse or redress, which is the
[2:53:00.500 --> 2:53:05.460]  justice system. And they're sending a message to Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Owen Shroyer,
[2:53:05.460 --> 2:53:10.580]  you support Trump and America will destroy you as they know they can't intimidate us,
[2:53:10.580 --> 2:53:16.580]  but it's an example to everybody else. Sure. And they're doing exactly what they've done or
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:22.580]  tried to do to Roger Stone and to others to now, to the president with this ridiculous
[2:53:22.580 --> 2:53:29.460]  farce of a, of a so-called impeachment trial, which is to focus in on some, you know, my
[2:53:29.460 --> 2:53:36.020]  new minutiae or some area where he had a phone call, for example, and just blow it up into literally
[2:53:36.020 --> 2:53:43.140]  to use the term a federal case. And, and it's pedophogry at its worst. Adam Schiff and that
[2:53:43.140 --> 2:53:48.500]  bunch are just a bunch. I mean, they, they are the biggest manipulators, liars, and above all,
[2:53:48.500 --> 2:53:53.060]  hypocrites that this country has ever seen in our political life in modern times.
[2:53:53.060 --> 2:53:58.180]  And, you know, it's Roger Stone that was, was put through a process where he was
[2:53:58.180 --> 2:54:04.740]  effectively shut down from defending himself, both in court and publicly. And now you have
[2:54:04.740 --> 2:54:09.460]  Randy Kredico coming out. Even this is the chief witness against him, supposedly,
[2:54:09.460 --> 2:54:15.700]  on, at least under the witness tampering charges coming out and imploring Judge Berman Jackson
[2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:20.580]  not to give him any prison time. Now, look, we've been talking about sentencing, prison
[2:54:20.580 --> 2:54:26.020]  sentencing reform. I know Alex, you've been all over the, you know, the harshness of the system
[2:54:26.020 --> 2:54:30.100]  within the, you know, the penal system, let's just say, for many years, you know, the over
[2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:35.860]  incarceration of people, the devastated, the African-American community with the drug war.
[2:54:35.860 --> 2:54:41.780]  And you're going to throw a 67 year old political activist who's never been convicted of even Jay
[2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:46.100]  Walker. By the way, they called him, they implied also in the news and as you know,
[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:50.980]  that he was some kind of white supremacist. Roger is a huge libertarian, a libertine,
[2:54:51.940 --> 2:54:58.100]  and is famous for drug decriminalization and is famous, you know, for marching in gay marches
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:03.940]  and all this kind of stuff. So that idea is total defamation and slander. And that's why he was
[2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:07.700]  able to get Danny Williams, Bill Clinton's son and stuff on air. And he's been huge in the black
[2:55:07.700 --> 2:55:14.420]  community as a JFK researcher. So again, another form of pure defamation. Yeah, he stood with
[2:55:14.420 --> 2:55:19.460]  Russell Simmons, Al Sharpton and others and denounced the drug war as early as in the middle
[2:55:19.460 --> 2:55:24.500]  of the Bush administration with, you know, in working with Randy Kredico, who mentions that
[2:55:24.500 --> 2:55:29.940]  in the letter, how much Roger's done to, you know, to help the cause of this ending. Well,
[2:55:29.940 --> 2:55:35.220]  let's just say everybody gives the credit to Kanye West, which he deserves some into and to
[2:55:35.220 --> 2:55:42.980]  his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But it's been, it's been, it's been Roger in Trump's ear for 40 years
[2:55:42.980 --> 2:55:48.020]  to run for office and to run on decriminalization of marijuana and to let and to not have unfair
[2:55:48.020 --> 2:55:52.500]  sentencing for blacks. Sure. And you can see it. You can go back to an article, I believe, from
[2:55:52.500 --> 2:55:59.300]  19, either 88 or 90, where Trump openly says the drug war is a disaster and needs to end.
[2:55:59.300 --> 2:56:04.980]  I wish he would adopt that policy today. But instead, instead, they had the elitist jury.
[2:56:04.980 --> 2:56:10.580]  It wasn't even really a black jury. The elitist white jury full of CIA people publicly. It was
[2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:16.260]  like a Democrat. Oh, how about some of them going and giving interviews and talking trash about
[2:56:16.260 --> 2:56:20.820]  Roger afterwards and saying basically it was political. I mean, this is, this was a sick
[2:56:20.820 --> 2:56:26.900]  miscarriage and a railroading. No, they've taken every opportunity, every avenue, every choice,
[2:56:26.900 --> 2:56:30.980]  and they've made it so that it was rigged against Roger. I mean, you put them in DC,
[2:56:30.980 --> 2:56:35.140]  they put them in front of an Obama appointed judge. They, they eliminated his ability to
[2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:39.140]  introduce evidence about the Russian. And all this was done after he was the platform,
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:43.700]  because that's how this works. The platform to prison. They told me, they said, Democrats came
[2:56:43.700 --> 2:56:48.980]  up to me in DC and in Virginia and said, you're going to prison like Roger. We're going to put
[2:56:48.980 --> 2:56:54.260]  you in prison. I mean, these are scum. Yeah, they, they really are. They've been there. Anyone who
[2:56:54.260 --> 2:57:00.660]  would abuse the justice system or use the justice system to, to convict and punish innocent people
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:04.580]  or use it as a political weapon are the worst criminals of all and need to be dealt with most
[2:57:04.580 --> 2:57:08.980]  harshly. Tyler Nixon, you're on fire today. I want to get into why you think credit coast coming
[2:57:08.980 --> 2:57:12.500]  out because everything credit goes saying is what I was hearing from Roger about, man, we would
[2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:16.340]  just joke with each other and stuff. This is BS. Why is he doing this? Now these credit coasts
[2:57:16.340 --> 2:57:19.940]  basically admitting that I like to get critical on the show. I have nothing, but you know,
[2:57:19.940 --> 2:57:23.300]  I like credit code before all this happened. Stay there though. I want to get a few more
[2:57:23.300 --> 2:57:27.620]  minutes with you. Come back on soon because you know, Roger's front and center right now
[2:57:27.620 --> 2:57:32.100]  with the attacks on the signs, the attacks on green wall down and the tax on us. I mean, folks,
[2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:35.140]  I'm not trying to be dramatic here. They're breathing down my neck. It's okay. Just say
[2:57:35.140 --> 2:57:39.780]  a prayer for info wars, spread the links because we're sacrificing everything to be patriotic
[2:57:39.780 --> 2:57:48.500]  Americans that stay at the wheel under attack. Info wars, life.com info wars, life.com info
[2:57:48.500 --> 2:57:54.500]  wars, life.com. You go to that URL. It takes you to the subsection of info wars store.com where

[2:59:54.420 --> 3:00:12.740]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[3:00:12.740 --> 3:00:25.860]  so does he lie from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:25.860 --> 3:00:28.980]  Oh,
[3:00:43.540 --> 3:00:49.700]  globalists are getting rid of chivalry. Oh, they're big text going to save them
[3:00:49.700 --> 3:00:57.940]  with a surveillance grid. It's going to protect them, but give society breaks down.
[3:01:00.660 --> 3:01:07.060]  Every person I've talked to that protects globalists tell me that they are going to take
[3:01:07.060 --> 3:01:12.580]  good care of the globalist. They're going to put the bed at night, make sure they're warm
[3:01:12.580 --> 3:01:18.580]  at six feet of covers. I have lots of little friends down there with them.
[3:01:22.580 --> 3:01:24.420]  I'm not threatening anybody. I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[3:01:26.580 --> 3:01:33.700]  They come to take your life onto the dead of night.
[3:01:33.700 --> 3:01:42.740]  You see the four horsemen ride, so choose your fate and die. Oh, yeah.
[3:01:44.740 --> 3:01:47.780]  The dions is the day we're born. You know, it's all been planned.
[3:01:48.580 --> 3:01:54.340]  Need no confession now. A center once, center twice. All right.
[3:01:54.340 --> 3:02:04.820]  Let's go to Tyler Nixon. Tyler, I hope we can fix things peacefully, but I look at the globalists
[3:02:04.820 --> 3:02:09.300]  and the things they're doing. They just, they don't seem to get it. And I just think history's
[3:02:09.300 --> 3:02:13.060]  getting ready to repeat. I hope Trump can fix things peacefully. But at some point,
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:18.260]  he's got to move against the deep state. Well, you remind me of that, that old trope.
[3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:24.100]  I'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by six. And yeah, you're exactly right.
[3:02:24.820 --> 3:02:31.300]  President Trump has for too long been tweeting and complaining and calling this all this mess,
[3:02:31.300 --> 3:02:36.740]  a witch hunt, a hoax, which is all true, of course, but he needs to realize he has the power
[3:02:36.740 --> 3:02:43.140]  to blunt the effects of this campaign. That's right. He's only inviting more of it now and
[3:02:43.140 --> 3:02:49.220]  it's becoming a dereliction of duty. It is. Well, I mean, I'm sorry, but when you have an FBI
[3:02:49.220 --> 3:02:54.820]  agent who is not even starting to question the assistant director, McCabe, lied to the FBI,
[3:02:54.820 --> 3:02:59.540]  lied to his fellow agents, and he just walks free and is a commentator on MSNBC or wherever the
[3:02:59.540 --> 3:03:04.260]  hell they have them these days. You know, this is, this is like a perversion of our justice system,
[3:03:04.260 --> 3:03:09.540]  perversion of basically the rule of law itself. I mean, we don't have a rule of law anymore if
[3:03:09.540 --> 3:03:14.180]  this goes on. And President Trump, I understand he needs to get reelected and he doesn't want to
[3:03:14.180 --> 3:03:18.340]  rock the boat, but you know what? They're not going to come after him any harder or they're
[3:03:18.340 --> 3:03:25.460]  not going to, you know, basically try to try to do more to him if he acts. I mean, they're not suing
[3:03:25.460 --> 3:03:31.780]  for peace. They don't want they taunt. They take his restraint as weakness. Yeah. And, you know,
[3:03:31.780 --> 3:03:38.820]  Roger Stone is someone who will become a political prisoner if he is actually incarcerated, in my
[3:03:38.820 --> 3:03:44.020]  opinion, without question. And I would like to, I would remiss if I did not point out that although
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:49.220]  he has not decided fully on his appeal rights yet until we see what happens at the sentencing,
[3:03:49.220 --> 3:03:55.700]  certainly, StoneDefenseFund.com is where people can donate. I think the problem is that people have
[3:03:55.700 --> 3:04:00.820]  forgotten, you know, that he has, that the battle goes on. That's right. They think he's sitting
[3:04:00.820 --> 3:04:05.540]  on mountains of cash. He's not, he didn't like lobbying. He got out of it when he had a big
[3:04:05.540 --> 3:04:10.100]  conscience paying after the Brooks Brothers suit riot. And this is all on record. I don't just
[3:04:10.100 --> 3:04:16.020]  believe Roger. I don't know the story. He's out of money. He and his wife live in an apartment.
[3:04:16.020 --> 3:04:21.780]  And I know how much these appeals are with good decent lawyers. It's millions of dollars per
[3:04:21.780 --> 3:04:26.740]  lawsuit per fight when they're real. We've got major litigator operations running against us.
[3:04:26.740 --> 3:04:30.660]  They think they're railroading us, but we've got a lot of tactics. Obviously, you see, we're still
[3:04:30.660 --> 3:04:34.900]  here two years into it. We're not going down. That's why they're trying to put us in prison
[3:04:34.900 --> 3:04:39.140]  right now and pulling a lot of dirty tricks behind the scenes. But I, I love it because it means
[3:04:39.140 --> 3:04:44.980]  I'm over the target. Tyler Nixon, please join us again in the next few days. It's been too long.
[3:04:44.980 --> 3:04:49.540]  I want to talk about how Roger's doing, how his spirits are, but let's do that for a few minutes
[3:04:49.540 --> 3:04:56.900]  on the other side of the 60 second break. It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to
[3:04:56.900 --> 3:05:04.740]  President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars. Our operation for our partners
[3:05:04.740 --> 3:05:12.340]  for Communist Chinese have bought control of your media, but it's true. Your people are beginning
[3:05:12.340 --> 3:05:21.060]  to awaken. That's why Cobra is launching operations to trade a race war, mashing things and bombings,
[3:05:21.060 --> 3:05:28.100]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone wants to be staged in some tax that
[3:05:28.100 --> 3:05:36.660]  does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see,
[3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:44.260]  when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out a tax and then blame you like
[3:05:44.260 --> 3:06:00.260]  we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed. From the front lines
[3:06:00.260 --> 3:06:15.140]  of the information war, it's Alex Jones. You can feel the energy intensified. There's now no doubt
[3:06:15.140 --> 3:06:21.700]  this is a deadly outbreak already spiraling into pandemic. There's pressing that right now.
[3:06:23.620 --> 3:06:28.420]  And I have an update before Matt Brocken takes over. We're all seeing an update from
[3:06:28.420 --> 3:06:36.500]  Caitlin Bennett, who's been on fire on top of the fire. She's always on fire talking about what
[3:06:36.500 --> 3:06:41.060]  she witnessed in Virginia, what she witnessed in D.C. and what she thinks about Owen being arrested
[3:06:41.060 --> 3:06:45.860]  for the second time today for wearing tape over his mouth. So they gagged Roger Stone and now
[3:06:45.860 --> 3:06:50.500]  they've gagged Owen for being gagged. That's right. The judge said, just you can't go in there
[3:06:50.500 --> 3:06:54.100]  and disrupt anything. Well, wearing a piece of tape is now disruption. The Democrats can yell
[3:06:54.100 --> 3:06:58.180]  and scream and throw themselves around inside committee rooms. Jane Fonac can get arrested every
[3:06:58.180 --> 3:07:03.300]  week as a stunt. They drop the charges every time. That's all confirmed. It's just total
[3:07:03.300 --> 3:07:09.940]  lawlessness by the left. And we do one tenth what they do. The book is thrown from on high
[3:07:09.940 --> 3:07:15.060]  like a 10 Commandments smashing onto his head. I got to tell you though, Owen, and I'm not
[3:07:15.700 --> 3:07:19.620]  putting Owen down. I know why he did it, but Owen is not doing what I told him today.
[3:07:19.620 --> 3:07:25.940]  I told him, do not get arrested. Even if the orders they're giving you are unlawful,
[3:07:26.500 --> 3:07:30.260]  I don't want stunts and buddy, they're going to throw the book at you. And he's learning that from
[3:07:30.260 --> 3:07:34.340]  court yesterday. We had a great lawyer there with me. So he's never seen anything like it. And now
[3:07:34.340 --> 3:07:38.980]  they're doing it again. And sure, he's in the right. And like, if he wants to be Rosa Parks and
[3:07:38.980 --> 3:07:43.140]  sit at the front of the bus and get arrested, that's, he can do that. He's doing this as a
[3:07:43.140 --> 3:07:47.220]  citizen. And by the way, it's not because I have liability that I'm saying that I'm proud of Owen
[3:07:47.220 --> 3:07:52.500]  at a certain level. I want to keep him in the field. They want to throw his ass in prison,
[3:07:52.500 --> 3:07:56.500]  man. They called for a year in jail yesterday. Now it's going to be, I mean, and you're like,
[3:07:56.500 --> 3:08:05.700]  well, they won't do that. Yes, they will. Because Roger Stone, I was there, never talked to Assange,
[3:08:05.700 --> 3:08:09.780]  never lied about it, told Congress never talked to Assange, talking to someone that talked to
[3:08:09.780 --> 3:08:14.020]  WikiLeaks is not talking to him. If you call up and talk to the secretary at info wars,
[3:08:14.020 --> 3:08:18.020]  you didn't talk to Alex. If Congress said, did you talk to Alex? You went, no, I didn't. I
[3:08:18.020 --> 3:08:24.020]  talked to the secretary. That's not talking to Alex Jones. And that's not talking to Julian Assange.
[3:08:24.020 --> 3:08:30.580]  It's a didn't lie. And again, you're like, yeah, well, why is he facing because it's an Obama judge,
[3:08:31.140 --> 3:08:35.380]  the same woman that tried to cover up all the illegal spying and a bunch of other crap.
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:42.820]  This woman is an abomination. These are what they call tyrants in black robes.
[3:08:42.820 --> 3:08:47.700]  It's why we had 1776. Read the Declaration of Independence. The biggest thing it talks about
[3:08:47.700 --> 3:08:51.300]  is corrupt judges and corrupt far away courts. People are sick of it.
[3:08:54.980 --> 3:09:00.100]  So they just keep pushing and pushing and pushing. Nobody believes the damn thing they say now.
[3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:04.100]  If they could get patrons to do something violent, what you hope doesn't happen, no one's going to
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:15.060]  think we did it. Got that? The new order is done. Surrender now. They can't help it.
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:20.100]  We're going to Caitlyn Bennett here, but I want to tell her Nixon, Roger Stone's confident personal
[3:09:20.100 --> 3:09:25.940]  lawyer, not his lawyer in the criminal cases. How is Roger doing right now? I mean, I see the news
[3:09:25.940 --> 3:09:32.100]  where the judge ordered at a court ruled all of the court files are public. No one's ever,
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:38.820]  but his personal phone numbers, his friends, emails to his dying mother who died. I mean,
[3:09:38.820 --> 3:09:43.540]  I know it's in there. There's a ton of them. He was talking about it before it all came down.
[3:09:43.540 --> 3:09:48.660]  The harassment of the courts, ordering all that turned over. Everything he's got is live.
[3:09:48.660 --> 3:09:51.460]  That's part of the sentencing. What the hell is that?
[3:09:52.980 --> 3:09:58.020]  Yeah, Roger Stone's treatment is a chilling preview into what you can expect from a lawless
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:03.300]  police state run by the likes of the atom shifts of the world and so forth. Roger's holding up.
[3:10:03.300 --> 3:10:09.380]  He's doing great. As great as can be expected, but the man's a fighter. He's a solid warrior
[3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:14.740]  for the right. This is why they've gone after him with all, I mean, with everything they have in
[3:10:14.740 --> 3:10:21.780]  their book of tricks. I mean, you have to look. They're going to release the evidence in the case,
[3:10:21.780 --> 3:10:27.460]  or this is potentially going to happen. The House Intelligence Committee has yet to release the
[3:10:27.460 --> 3:10:35.060]  transcript of the testimony over which he was charged. The Democrats ran in 2018 saying the
[3:10:35.060 --> 3:10:39.460]  Republicans are withholding these Intelligence Committee transcripts, blah, blah, blah, and we
[3:10:39.460 --> 3:10:43.700]  will release them, elect us and we'll release them. Come January, they said, just in a few days now,
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:46.420]  we're going to release all these transcripts of testimony. Let me give you an example.
[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:50.980]  A couple of months ago, a judge ordered us to give them a list of all our employees going back
[3:10:50.980 --> 3:10:55.300]  seven years. All of a sudden, former employees go, yeah, I'm getting calls from the New York Times.
[3:10:55.300 --> 3:11:01.780]  The next day. So they get our employee records and they're just handed right over to the media.
[3:11:01.780 --> 3:11:07.540]  Imagine all his personal emails, everything, everything is going to be given to the media.
[3:11:07.540 --> 3:11:13.700]  They've said that, I mean, the harassment level. This is, you know, they're talking, these, these
[3:11:13.700 --> 3:11:18.260]  transcripts are being held under the intelligence communities. You know, suppose a declassification
[3:11:18.260 --> 3:11:22.740]  process. What, what the hell about Roger Stone's testimony needs to be declassified. You know,
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:26.820]  this was a tactic to basically do what they did to Stone and what they want to do to everyone else.
[3:11:26.820 --> 3:11:30.180]  They want to, they want to basically be able to characterize, mischaracterize, I should say,
[3:11:30.740 --> 3:11:35.780]  distort and cherry pick what they want out of different, different testimonies given to patch
[3:11:35.780 --> 3:11:41.300]  together a completely false picture of what went down in order to basically just railroad these
[3:11:41.300 --> 3:11:46.660]  people. I mean, how, how can you justify the intelligence committee has rules which require
[3:11:46.660 --> 3:11:52.180]  that if anybody discusses or discloses any part of someone's testimony, that they are, that that
[3:11:52.180 --> 3:11:56.420]  has, well, I mean, Comey perjured himself and say he didn't leak. And now he admits he did.
[3:11:56.420 --> 3:12:01.220]  Tyler Nixon to come back very, very soon to talk about this more, but just 30 seconds and closing.
[3:12:01.220 --> 3:12:05.220]  Trump's got a part in stone. When are you guys expecting after the sentencing for that happen?
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:10.900]  He better not spend one night in that fricking jail. I agree with you. It would be a terrible
[3:12:10.900 --> 3:12:16.100]  disgrace. I hope this judge has some sliver of sanity and to see that this man has been put
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:21.140]  through enough. And I can't believe that President Trump would stand to see someone who has
[3:12:21.140 --> 3:12:26.980]  committed no crime and has no victim. Mainly, I mean, whatever you say of him, there's no victims
[3:12:26.980 --> 3:12:30.820]  in this crime. Well, plus the whole Michigan things falling apart. You disgrace to this
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:36.900]  Republic and pardon him. Please, Mr. President, pardon Roger Stone now. Absolutely. All right.
[3:12:36.900 --> 3:12:41.060]  Thank you, Tyler Nixon. Tyler Nixon on Twitter at Tyler Nixon. Thank you, sir.
[3:12:42.340 --> 3:12:48.020]  Very eloquent individual. Please get him back on crew. Okay, let's go to Caitlin Bennett. I really
[3:12:48.020 --> 3:12:52.260]  appreciate Caitlin joining us. Caitlin, where to start with Owen's second arrest? I know he's a
[3:12:52.260 --> 3:12:56.820]  big fan of you. You're a big fan of your colleague. We work together again in DC. Had to work together
[3:12:56.820 --> 3:13:02.340]  in Virginia. Where do you want to start first? I would like to start with the video he did the
[3:13:02.340 --> 3:13:07.940]  other day where he just completely overtook and overpowered the protesters that were standing
[3:13:07.940 --> 3:13:12.420]  there in the Capitol. And he was asking them, what is Trump being impeached for? They couldn't
[3:13:12.420 --> 3:13:16.420]  give an answer. They don't even know what they're there protesting for. But when you don't know
[3:13:16.420 --> 3:13:22.100]  what you're there protesting for, they let you stay there. No one got removed. Do you see any cops?
[3:13:22.100 --> 3:13:28.500]  There's no cops there. He overpowered them, took over the protest, and it was fine. Look how many
[3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:33.940]  there are. But when Owen goes there by himself, silent with duct tape over his mouth, it's a
[3:13:33.940 --> 3:13:40.020]  whole big deal. I think he explains it best in his video where he shows the double standard in
[3:13:40.020 --> 3:13:44.820]  the hypocrisy and showing what's going on in Capitol Hill. They're controlling the police
[3:13:44.820 --> 3:13:52.340]  to be anti-Trump. And then he comes back two days later. And this is once the police came over. He
[3:13:52.340 --> 3:13:56.660]  had tape over his mouth and was saying nothing. And they said, we're going to arrest you.
[3:13:58.340 --> 3:14:05.780]  Yeah. I know that you tell him not to get arrested. And I almost would not get arrested either. But
[3:14:05.780 --> 3:14:11.620]  Owen's his own person. He's definitely got a mind of his own. And I think that's great. I know I
[3:14:11.620 --> 3:14:16.740]  personally would not prefer to be arrested because you never know what those cops would charge you
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:22.020]  with or try to do. I wouldn't trust them. The cops are being ordered to do it. It's the judges and
[3:14:22.020 --> 3:14:26.980]  the prosecutors, man. They are slime in that city. I mean, we're talking bad. I mean, you're
[3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:32.900]  putting yourself in the hands of criminals in my view. Yep. I would just avoid it. But Owen's
[3:14:32.900 --> 3:14:38.660]  tougher. I think he's got a stronger will than I do to go out there and do that stuff and face
[3:14:38.660 --> 3:14:44.020]  the arrest and the judges. And I mean, I support what he's done. I just am not going to order
[3:14:44.020 --> 3:14:47.620]  him to go do it. And I'd ask him not to do it because I think he's more effective outside of
[3:14:47.620 --> 3:14:54.100]  jail. Yeah, he probably is more effective outside of jail. But I have to thank him for going out
[3:14:54.100 --> 3:14:59.780]  there and standing up for Trump and doing what all of us wish that we could go do and just deal
[3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:03.700]  with the stuff that he deals with. So so many people look at him and you know, I just I just
[3:15:03.700 --> 3:15:07.220]  thought of something and I'm going to interrupt you, Caitlin. I apologize. You're so smart about
[3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:11.620]  saying that. We already have coming out. In fact, the truck arrived today. I'm not mad,
[3:15:11.620 --> 3:15:16.580]  but nobody brought him over here from the warehouse. These just came in. These are a little bit
[3:15:16.580 --> 3:15:21.220]  bigger than our actual size. They're about half the size. And it says save the First Amendment

[3:20:45.460 --> 3:20:50.500]  are allowed to protest. He's just not allowed to. And yes, I came up with this idea a few weeks ago.
[3:20:50.500 --> 3:20:54.900]  Listeners did. A caller did to have a sticker. It's a little bit smaller than this. It goes

[3:21:54.900 --> 3:21:58.900]  hand them out at events. You go to a Trump rally. Everybody puts them on and being silenced even more
[3:21:58.900 --> 3:22:04.980]  powerful. Trump will definitely hear about it or go to the Capitol and do it. See if you can arrest it.
[3:22:04.980 --> 3:22:09.940]  You'll see Democrats all doing whatever they want protesting but you do it. They're on you.
[3:22:11.780 --> 3:22:15.220]  And imagine this is like black folks trying to ride the front of the bus and getting arrested.
[3:22:15.220 --> 3:22:19.700]  It's going to end up backfiring on them. Caitlin Bennett. I got you on here about what you saw
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:23.700]  in DC. The great reports you file what you witnessed in Virginia. Not this with Owen,
[3:22:23.700 --> 3:22:26.980]  but this is a pretty big deal. Finishing up with that and then just getting into the state of the
[3:22:26.980 --> 3:22:33.780]  country. Yeah. So I have been going so many places with that the last week, Alex. And one thing I
[3:22:33.780 --> 3:22:39.620]  want to kind of go off topic here and I want to thank the listeners for going to infowarstore.com
[3:22:39.620 --> 3:22:44.420]  and sharing the links from News Wars because I was actually with your help and with the opportunity
[3:22:44.420 --> 3:22:49.540]  you were able to give me to go out and do these videos and support my work and be a sponsor.
[3:22:49.540 --> 3:22:54.340]  I was actually invited to the West Wing of the White House, which is something that you have
[3:22:54.340 --> 3:22:59.540]  to be invited by the Trump administration or his staff to go do. And that wouldn't have happened
[3:22:59.540 --> 3:23:03.860]  if it weren't for you. So I want to thank you personally. And then I want to thank the listeners
[3:23:03.860 --> 3:23:07.140]  because without you, we wouldn't have the listeners. And without the listeners,
[3:23:07.140 --> 3:23:10.740]  they wouldn't have info wars on here. And I wouldn't have the platform that I have.
[3:23:10.740 --> 3:23:15.700]  So thank you to the listeners and thank you, Alex, for the opportunity you have given me
[3:23:15.700 --> 3:23:20.900]  to be able to go do that. So it's not a status thing, obviously, to get to work with the White
[3:23:20.900 --> 3:23:25.140]  House and just and then recognize the great journalism you're doing. That's a great thing.
[3:23:25.140 --> 3:23:29.140]  So it just shows you how you're being noticed and the great work you're doing and what listeners
[3:23:29.140 --> 3:23:35.140]  are sponsoring you by supporting us, what that allows you. And of course, I've doubled this year
[3:23:35.780 --> 3:23:40.020]  the expenses and the funding for you because the more we fund you and you're not even making
[3:23:40.020 --> 3:23:44.660]  much money personally, you just spend it almost all of it on action. And so I've doubled your
[3:23:44.660 --> 3:23:48.340]  funding this year and you've really doubled the amount of work. So I want to thank the listeners,
[3:23:48.340 --> 3:23:52.820]  but I told listeners, we're doubling operations. I'm spending every reserve we're all in.
[3:23:52.820 --> 3:23:57.380]  We're just trusting in God. So and you've really been doing an amazing job with your team.
[3:23:57.380 --> 3:24:01.540]  Thank you. I appreciate it. So yeah, another thank you to the listeners. I wouldn't have
[3:24:01.540 --> 3:24:05.940]  been able to have that opportunity without them. So the supplements are important. Sharing the
[3:24:05.940 --> 3:24:10.420]  links are important and going to band.video is important as well. But when we look at the
[3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:16.180]  things that I were able to do this last week, another thing I went to was the Virginia rally.
[3:24:16.180 --> 3:24:21.300]  I went out a little bit later and everyone was asking for you. Everyone was asking where you were
[3:24:21.300 --> 3:24:25.540]  and in Owen as well. But I went out a little bit later when people were leaving so that it was a
[3:24:25.540 --> 3:24:31.060]  little bit more calm and I had easier access to interview people. The message was the same from
[3:24:31.060 --> 3:24:35.700]  the people who were from Virginia. And there were tons of people who weren't even from Virginia
[3:24:35.700 --> 3:24:42.100]  that came to support Virginians. I think that is the most amazing thing I saw there that day
[3:24:42.100 --> 3:24:47.060]  was so many people from out of state. And this sends such a clear message to the second
[3:24:47.060 --> 3:24:51.460]  amendment supporters and even the governor of Virginia and basically everyone. Well, we know
[3:24:51.460 --> 3:24:56.260]  it's a globalist, new world order, Soros, Bloomberg attack. Of course, we're there.
[3:24:56.260 --> 3:25:00.740]  Virginians were thanking me. I'm like thanking you. They're coming for my guns too, brother.
[3:25:00.740 --> 3:25:06.980]  We're Americans. Yeah. So this is just a clear message to any politician out there that wants
[3:25:06.980 --> 3:25:12.980]  to push for gun control. The entire country is going to stand up against you. And I really think
[3:25:12.980 --> 3:25:18.580]  the Virginians need to be on their toes because they're pushing red flag already. They're passing
[3:25:18.580 --> 3:25:24.420]  them. They have the FBI watching militias that showed up. So really be on your toes. You go to
[3:25:24.420 --> 3:25:30.580]  these rallies and you show up and you have fun. The numbers, Democrats don't care. They don't
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:35.860]  care. They will try to step on you every step of the way. They will try to tread on you every step
[3:25:35.860 --> 3:25:40.820]  of the way. So just a message to Virginians, just because you had so many people at this rally
[3:25:40.820 --> 3:25:47.940]  doesn't mean you need to have a blind eye or think that's it. Make sure you're doing all that you
[3:25:47.940 --> 3:25:52.740]  can. And if they do come for your guns, I really hope people stand by their words that they will
[3:25:52.740 --> 3:25:58.500]  not comply. And just know the whole country is going to be there to back you guys up. Most amazing
[3:25:58.500 --> 3:26:04.500]  thing I saw. Well, Americans are facing coordinated multinational attack. We have to combine forces
[3:26:04.500 --> 3:26:08.900]  together and an attack on a Californian, an attack on a Virginian, an attack on a Texan,
[3:26:08.900 --> 3:26:13.060]  an attack on a Michel Gander. It doesn't matter. We're all Americans, an attack on a Black
[3:26:13.060 --> 3:26:18.180]  American's rights or a White American's rights or anybody. It's an attack on us all. Yeah,
[3:26:18.180 --> 3:26:24.020]  it's really disappointing. I think it was really funny. The tweets going around with pictures
[3:26:24.020 --> 3:26:29.380]  of Black gun owners because the entire media, CNN, local media was trying to paint this as a
[3:26:29.380 --> 3:26:35.380]  white supremacist rally. And it kind of was like the time to shine for these Black gun owners
[3:26:35.380 --> 3:26:40.420]  because they were like, what about me? You guys are so important. You guys want to focus on Black
[3:26:40.420 --> 3:26:46.020]  lives, Black lives matter, but they completely ignored the mainstream media, completely ignored
[3:26:46.020 --> 3:26:50.980]  all of these Black gun owners. By the way, I was blown away by, I'd say the crowd was about 10%
[3:26:50.980 --> 3:26:55.140]  Black, which is almost the population. That was scaring the hell out of the left. In fact,
[3:26:55.140 --> 3:26:59.220]  let me just show people something. Here's a hat I wear, probably to come out with one of these.
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:03.460]  It's custom, but it's just a Black cord or a hat I've had a long time that I like. And it says,
[3:27:03.460 --> 3:27:09.460]  don't tread on me. Well, it's join or die. It's the original oldest flag from the Revolution
[3:27:09.460 --> 3:27:16.180]  before the Revolution even started saying the 13 colonies all the way from New Hampshire and New
[3:27:16.180 --> 3:27:23.140]  York and all that right down to Virginia and North Carolina and West Virginia. And it says,
[3:27:23.140 --> 3:27:27.220]  join or die. It has a double meaning join or they'll destroy us and join us or we're going to kill
[3:27:27.220 --> 3:27:33.540]  you. But that says it all. And that's about unity. That snake isn't white. It's not Black. It's
[3:27:33.540 --> 3:27:40.020]  American. And it joins or it dies. It's that simple. It's a great message that Virginians
[3:27:40.020 --> 3:27:45.140]  stuck together and people from out of state came to stay together with them. So I think that's
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:49.460]  great. Just Virginia, keep on your toes because they're still passing gun control. Governor
[3:27:49.460 --> 3:27:55.620]  Northam does not care. And if they want to really stop their state from turning blue,
[3:27:55.620 --> 3:28:00.020]  I think they need to look at what's turning it blue too. So make sure you get out in those
[3:28:00.020 --> 3:28:06.100]  pools. Those pools and the election fraud. And I want to take away hope, but we need indictments.
[3:28:06.100 --> 3:28:09.540]  We I mean, they're they're organizing illegal aliens to vote and giving them driver's license
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:13.780]  in Democrat states. This is a takeover. It's a criminal operation. We treat them like criminals
[3:28:13.780 --> 3:28:18.900]  or they win. Caitlin Matt Bracken is obviously an expert on all this bestselling author former
[3:28:18.900 --> 3:28:22.420]  Navy SEAL really smart guy. Let's let's let's say hi to him on the other side of you hold a few
[3:28:22.420 --> 3:28:27.220]  more minutes and then let him take over here and host a few segments because this is really key. And
[3:28:27.220 --> 3:28:31.060]  I would also get your take on the women's march and more that didn't even have 30,000 people that
[3:28:31.060 --> 3:28:35.060]  had had like 5 million right after Trump had elected. I was there. I saw it. Biggest March
[3:28:35.060 --> 3:28:39.460]  I've ever seen. It was insane. Capitol police and DC police told me the only thing ever bigger
[3:28:39.460 --> 3:28:44.660]  was Obama's inauguration. That's the all time record. And then Trump's like number three.
[3:28:44.660 --> 3:28:48.100]  Okay, you did have a huge inauguration, but the anti-fuck kept folks from getting in.
[3:28:48.100 --> 3:28:54.900]  The second biggest thing ever is now tiny. We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:33:18.180 --> 3:33:21.860]  All right, folks. Matt Bracken is about to take over, but I know he's a fan of Katelyn Bennett.
[3:33:21.860 --> 3:33:26.340]  The young girl, as she's known, the Penn State young girl that's been doing a great job
[3:33:26.340 --> 3:33:30.020]  reporting for InfoWars last few years, want to get his take on what happened in Virginia and how
[3:33:30.020 --> 3:33:36.180]  big a deal that is and get her closing comments. But please don't forget, I sell you things I
[3:33:36.180 --> 3:33:41.060]  know you need that will make your life better so you fund the operation and want to order it again.
[3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:46.260]  I treat you like I want to be treated. You know, that old-fashioned idea. And with
[3:33:47.620 --> 3:33:50.660]  the winter and all these deadly flus and viruses going around,
[3:33:50.660 --> 3:33:56.900]  Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K are what allow you to beat that. And most of the time when you get sick,
[3:33:56.900 --> 3:34:01.300]  it's a deficiency in these, 40% off, even though it's close to selling out. I'm keeping at that
[3:34:01.300 --> 3:34:06.660]  price because I want people to get it, especially for your children, Wintersun, InfoWars.com,
[3:34:06.660 --> 3:34:13.780]  and then what iodine does for everybody, X2 and X3. X2 just got back in stock. The good halogen,
[3:34:13.780 --> 3:34:17.860]  the good base of everything in your body, you die without iodine. And over 2 billion people
[3:34:17.860 --> 3:34:21.780]  have mental deficiencies according to the World Health Organization from lack of iodine. Folks,
[3:34:21.780 --> 3:34:26.580]  it's why people are so stupid. One of the biggest reasons, because they take the good fluoride or
[3:34:26.580 --> 3:34:33.060]  the, they take the good halogen out that is the iodine. They put the bad halogen fluoride in.

[3:34:38.820 --> 3:34:44.900]  items at InfoWars.com. And that's how we fund this operation. Well, Matt Bracken, I know you've got
[3:34:44.900 --> 3:34:50.420]  a lot to cover in the limited time in the next two segments, but your take on Virginia, and then,
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:55.300]  of course, we have Caitlin Bennett here with her take on what happened at the Women's March,
[3:34:55.300 --> 3:35:01.780]  being so tiny, less than 30,000, the DC police officially told us versus the 5 million or so
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:05.620]  that Soros funded just three and a half years ago. What do you make of this, Matt Bracken?
[3:35:06.660 --> 3:35:11.700]  Well, I think it's instructive to compare what happened in Charlottesville
[3:35:11.700 --> 3:35:18.660]  to the way it went down in Richmond. And I think that the Virginia State Police and Richmond Police
[3:35:18.660 --> 3:35:24.340]  Department, they took to heart, you know, whether they were intentional or just blunders,
[3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:32.340]  they really had the rules of engagement, so to speak, down very firm in Richmond,
[3:35:32.340 --> 3:35:38.500]  so that everybody knew what the boundaries and borders were. You know, like we predicted weeks
[3:35:38.500 --> 3:35:43.860]  ago, they put up all this chain link, so they built a perimeter around Virginia Square and made
[3:35:43.860 --> 3:35:51.620]  that a no-gun zone, a gun-free zone, but immediately around it was a open-carry zone, at least for
[3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:57.380]  that day. I'm sure today you walked around downtown Richmond, you know, with an AR-15 on your back,
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:36:04.180]  you'd probably get yanked over, but on that day, no way. So you sort of had three rings of security
[3:36:04.180 --> 3:36:11.220]  because you had the unarmed patriots inside the fence, then you had the armed Virginians
[3:36:11.220 --> 3:36:17.700]  and Americans immediately around outside the fence, so 7,000 inside, 20,000 outside,
[3:36:17.700 --> 3:36:23.780]  then on the roofs around and under cover, other cops. So if anything had gone sideways really,
[3:36:23.780 --> 3:36:28.340]  really badly, I mean, it would have gone out of control, so the police had to be on their
[3:36:28.340 --> 3:36:33.780]  best behavior. Sure, but the big takeaway is it was probably more than 30,000 people came together,
[3:36:33.780 --> 3:36:38.340]  peacefully, and not one problem, only one arrest for somebody violent, a lot of wearing a full mask,
[3:36:38.340 --> 3:36:42.740]  they thought it was Antifa. And so this was just the opposite of what the governor said was going
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:48.500]  to happen. Yeah, and yeah, it went down peacefully, and they even, you know, pick up their own
[3:36:48.500 --> 3:36:54.580]  trash, you know, and show and put the lie to the entire thing. So a giant victory. I'm going to let
[3:36:54.580 --> 3:36:59.380]  you take over. I appreciate you being here, Matt Bracken of enemiespartondomestic.com. Millie,
[3:36:59.380 --> 3:37:04.260]  Weaver's done a great job. We're going to have her back on the show here very, very soon with
[3:37:04.260 --> 3:37:07.940]  some of the big things that she's been breaking. And of course, oh, and as soon as he gets out of
[3:37:07.940 --> 3:37:14.420]  jail, closing comments from Caitlin Bennett. So another trip we went to along with Virginia,
[3:37:14.420 --> 3:37:19.220]  as everybody knows, is the Women's March in DC. And just like Alex has been saying,
[3:37:19.780 --> 3:37:25.300]  that was the smallest women's march I have ever seen. I was expecting there to be a lot more.
[3:37:25.300 --> 3:37:31.700]  I'm a lot of people, a lot of women were also wearing the pink hats. The reason being because
[3:37:32.500 --> 3:37:39.220]  not all women have, you know, what they call those hats, vaginas. So this march was about,
[3:37:39.220 --> 3:37:44.660]  you know, men becoming women and women becoming men and just all kinds of lunacy. I'm really
[3:37:44.660 --> 3:37:50.260]  starting to think they're losing traction here. They started marching when Trump was elected.
[3:37:50.260 --> 3:37:54.820]  And then they saw that their marching has accomplished nothing except helping them lose
[3:37:54.820 --> 3:38:00.180]  weight and exercise a little bit, which I do encourage a lot of those women to do. They seem
[3:38:00.180 --> 3:38:05.860]  to need it. But yeah, I mean, I think it's really great to see their numbers dwindle and see the
[3:38:05.860 --> 3:38:12.020]  lack of support for the crazy, crazy ideologies they have on display there. I have a lot of videos
[3:38:12.020 --> 3:38:16.580]  coming out, one where we have a bunch of women complaining that the Democratic front runners
[3:38:16.580 --> 3:38:22.020]  are all white. They're very disappointed. They're very upset about this. But it's okay because
[3:38:22.020 --> 3:38:26.980]  they're not racist to be upset about all the white people and the Democratic party. That's
[3:38:26.980 --> 3:38:32.660]  something to look out for on band.video. And then just some other women claiming that gun
[3:38:32.660 --> 3:38:38.340]  rights are not women's rights, just like the usual agenda with them. So keep an eye out on those.
[3:38:38.340 --> 3:38:42.260]  Make sure you check out band.video. And that's where you can check them out. All right,
[3:38:42.260 --> 3:38:47.060]  Caitlin Bennett, we love you. Keep it up. Love the whole site. Love your Liberty Hangout.
[3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:51.140]  Thank you so much for joining us. All right, Matt Bracken knows sometimes I got a preempt part
[3:38:51.140 --> 3:38:55.220]  of him hosting. We love him hosting. He's awesome. He's gonna take over what's left of this segment
[3:38:55.220 --> 3:39:00.340]  in the next. But I just gotta ask you, Matt, I don't know if you're aware, Owen was arrested again
[3:39:00.900 --> 3:39:05.460]  for being in the Capitol wearing a piece of tape over his mouth. But Democrats are allowed to literally
[3:39:05.460 --> 3:39:09.140]  run around protesting right in front of it. And the police were ordered to arrest Owen.
[3:39:09.140 --> 3:39:15.700]  This is getting to be next level persecution. Yeah, I mean, well, for sure, I think that they
[3:39:15.700 --> 3:39:21.460]  can't take mockery, you know, that's it's like a linsky that freaks them out to be mocked. You see
[3:39:21.460 --> 3:39:26.980]  with you see with Roger Stone, he's under a gag order. So, you know, you can be attacked and
[3:39:26.980 --> 3:39:32.580]  you can't defend yourself. I'm going to talk about what's going on with Tommy Robinson next segment.
[3:39:32.580 --> 3:39:38.580]  But you know, Owen, I think is a thorn in their side. Ever since he, you know, he stood up and
[3:39:38.580 --> 3:39:45.620]  and had his say, I think he's a marked man, you know, he's on he's on the list. It's like a casino
[3:39:45.620 --> 3:39:50.580]  where they've got the pictures of the card counters. You know, they're going to get him for tying his
[3:39:50.580 --> 3:39:56.180]  shoe with his left hand. You know, I mean, they're there, no matter what it takes, he's on the list
[3:39:56.180 --> 3:40:02.260]  just like a casino. He's he's on the throwout list. No question. They want to send a message to
[3:40:02.260 --> 3:40:06.660]  everybody. But you know what? He's also on God's list, God's book of life. And he's going to be
[3:40:06.660 --> 3:40:09.860]  at the pro live from March coming up Friday. We'll be covering that. And he's on the list of
[3:40:09.860 --> 3:40:13.300]  info warriors that our listeners support. We appreciate you. You're the ones holding us up
[3:40:13.300 --> 3:40:19.700]  in this fight. Matt Bracken, God bless you. Take over. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, Richmond Richmond
[3:40:19.700 --> 3:40:24.020]  is going to be studied for a long time. And I think it'll always be compared like a binary
[3:40:24.020 --> 3:40:29.220]  star system to Charlottesville. In Charlottesville, they changed the locations, the times they
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:35.620]  pushed people around. Antifa was there. I think that in Charlottesville, nobody was armed if
[3:40:35.620 --> 3:40:41.300]  they were very few and very undercover. Whereas in Richmond, the people that were outside of the
[3:40:41.300 --> 3:40:48.500]  of the fenced enclosure were armed to the teeth. So the police knew that they had to just absolutely
[3:40:48.500 --> 3:40:53.860]  mind their own business and stay out of the way or really, really terrible things could happen.
[3:40:53.860 --> 3:41:00.580]  But nothing happened. And it's like Robert Heinlein said long ago, an armed society is a polite
[3:41:00.580 --> 3:41:06.100]  society. I mean, where have you seen so many happy people walking around carrying so much,
[3:41:06.820 --> 3:41:13.220]  so much armament armament. So Richmond is going to stand out. Now it's not all roses because
[3:41:13.220 --> 3:41:21.140]  it was also a tremendous intelligence collection opportunity for the deep state. You know, the
[3:41:22.260 --> 3:41:27.700]  FBI special agent in charge the sack at Richmond, only for the last like, you know,
[3:41:27.700 --> 3:41:36.020]  few months is a guy named David Archie. He's a domestic intelligence guru. And he used to be
[3:41:36.020 --> 3:41:44.260]  his job before Richmond was he was Mueller's lead FBI investigator. So he is deep state all the way.
[3:41:44.260 --> 3:41:49.540]  And and anybody that's been watching knows that they've had these electronic warfare planes
[3:41:49.540 --> 3:41:56.340]  circling over Richmond. And then during the day of the of the of the day of the of the
[3:41:56.340 --> 3:42:03.540]  lobby day protest, they had all these extra cell towers up, which some people are identifying
[3:42:03.540 --> 3:42:10.580]  as the sting rate towers that automatically divert your cell phone, collect the information,
[3:42:10.580 --> 3:42:17.300]  can scoop way more data out of your cell phone, and then most people would ever realize. And and
[3:42:17.300 --> 3:42:23.380]  you know, this is this is all going to be social network analyzed along with the faces, you know,
[3:42:23.380 --> 3:42:29.060]  digital, the face scanning. So they're going to know everybody who is in Richmond. And that's
[3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:34.260]  going to be, you know, a mark of pride for those who are there. But it's also kind of elevating
[3:42:34.260 --> 3:42:40.820]  your, your risk because to the FBI, this means you were in Richmond, you're not just a keyboard
[3:42:40.820 --> 3:42:46.580]  commando, you know, you're a doer, you're an action guy. So that's going to elevate the risk
[3:42:46.580 --> 3:42:50.980]  assessment for the FBI going forward. And we'll talk about this some more on the other side of
[3:42:50.980 --> 3:42:58.660]  the break. It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people
[3:42:58.660 --> 3:43:06.020]  and Alex Jones of info wars, our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese have bought
[3:43:06.020 --> 3:43:14.740]  control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken. That's why Cobra is
[3:43:14.740 --> 3:43:21.460]  launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on
[3:43:21.460 --> 3:43:28.820]  those loyal to America. Anyone wants to stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump.
[3:43:28.820 --> 3:43:37.780]  We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you expose our false flags and
[3:43:37.780 --> 3:43:46.100]  fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming
[3:43:46.100 --> 3:43:53.540]  him for mass shootings. We committed. Hey, I would thank you for everything you've done for
[3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:58.580]  the info war, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the
[3:43:58.580 --> 3:44:02.500]  globalist and these devil worship and child molesters. And you want them off your back and
[3:44:02.500 --> 3:44:06.740]  off your children's back. And you know what? I'm the same way. And that's why we're on the same
[3:44:06.740 --> 3:44:12.260]  damn team. And it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time
[3:44:13.140 --> 3:44:18.740]  to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future
[3:44:19.620 --> 3:44:25.380]  for humanity. And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because
[3:44:25.380 --> 3:44:29.940]  you are the info war. And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020. However,
[3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:35.140]  you can bottom my heart from my family and from the great crew at info wars. I want to thank you
[3:44:35.140 --> 3:44:40.820]  all because you are the info war. And you know, that's not just words. That's reality. You have
[3:44:40.820 --> 3:44:48.740]  made history. We have made history together info wars.com only has power because of you. And I
[3:44:48.740 --> 3:44:56.980]  suggest you use it. 25 years ago, when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was
[3:44:56.980 --> 3:45:03.540]  honest with the listeners. America was in a coma. We were being absolutely poisoned physically,
[3:45:03.540 --> 3:45:10.180]  culturally and spiritually. The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[3:45:10.180 --> 3:45:17.540]  Fast forward to this year in 2020. And to see the Soros spend over $100 million on the Women's
[3:45:17.540 --> 3:45:24.900]  March here in DC and Los Angeles. And they might have had 30,000 people. Maybe they had 5 million
[3:45:24.900 --> 3:45:29.940]  three years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, I was here. That is emblematic of how his money
[3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:37.860]  and try calm money cannot buy them the Astro turf anymore. So yes, the awakenings happened,
[3:45:37.860 --> 3:45:42.420]  but we're not out of the woods. The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during
[3:45:42.420 --> 3:45:48.580]  this Trump Senate trial. And we're going to be covering it live from DC at ban.video. Please
[3:45:48.580 --> 3:45:54.740]  be Paul Revere and share this link. If you understand why the globalist, why the servants
[3:45:54.740 --> 3:46:01.940]  of Satan hate info wars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not
[3:46:01.940 --> 3:46:07.860]  giving up. That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[3:46:08.420 --> 3:46:12.500]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:18.500]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have
[3:46:18.500 --> 3:46:23.540]  literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves,
[3:46:23.540 --> 3:46:29.060]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[3:46:29.060 --> 3:46:36.500]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheet dogs to stand firm
[3:46:36.500 --> 3:46:42.980]  and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that
[3:46:42.980 --> 3:46:50.420]  we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God. And that's all we ever have to know is that God is
[3:46:50.420 --> 3:46:58.260]  in charge. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:46:58.260 --> 3:47:23.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Matt Bracken.
[3:47:23.060 --> 3:47:35.060]  A few more thoughts on Virginia. Some people have observed that we're already on all the lists
[3:47:35.060 --> 3:47:42.020]  based on the ammunition magazines and bulk ammo we've bought. But what they're collecting out of
[3:47:42.020 --> 3:47:49.300]  Richmond is something more important. It's the social networks. If there is a future resistance
[3:47:49.300 --> 3:47:55.460]  going on, the people that went to Richmond and how they're mapped on social networks is going to
[3:47:55.460 --> 3:48:04.900]  give a roadmap to the deep state for who the leaders and the organizations, how the organizations
[3:48:04.900 --> 3:48:10.580]  are linked. And that's something new and unique from Richmond. But overall on balance, it was a
[3:48:10.580 --> 3:48:16.180]  tremendous victory in the sense that Americans that are maybe not gun owners or just casual gun
[3:48:16.180 --> 3:48:23.220]  owners, saw for their own selves that a couple of tens of thousands and numbers up in the air
[3:48:23.220 --> 3:48:31.700]  of Americans can rally with guns and nobody gets hurt. It's amazing. Once Antifa, if they showed
[3:48:31.700 --> 3:48:38.740]  up, they were practically unnoticeable. They were on the margin and in hiding because it
[3:48:38.740 --> 3:48:43.700]  was a serious day. It was a happy day, but it was a serious day. So it was overall a tremendous
[3:48:43.700 --> 3:48:51.700]  victory and kudos to the people that showed up and even to the law enforcement that for once had
[3:48:51.700 --> 3:48:58.900]  very clear, fixed and unmoving rules of engagement. And that's key. In Charlottesville, by moving the
[3:48:58.900 --> 3:49:06.420]  goalposts, by pushing the crowds around, that is what led to the violence directly. But everybody
[3:49:06.420 --> 3:49:12.660]  who was in Richmond hats off to you. You might face some risk down the road, but what the hell?
[3:49:12.660 --> 3:49:18.180]  By then, if we're in some kind of a civil war, I guess maybe it won't really even matter. But
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:25.940]  overall, it was a great day. And naturally, the liberal Democrats in Richmond, they felt very
[3:49:25.940 --> 3:49:33.780]  threatened. Governor Northam was actually in hiding that day. And since then, it's been
[3:49:33.780 --> 3:49:38.420]  on the books, but I'm sure it's going to be rising to the top. The red flag laws are going to be
[3:49:38.420 --> 3:49:44.660]  going through, which, you know, being a gun owner could be a sign of a mental instability to the
[3:49:44.660 --> 3:49:52.580]  Democrats. And the there's something in Richmond called House Bill 1627, which will make it a
[3:49:52.580 --> 3:49:58.260]  felony to threaten or harass certain officials like the governor. So they're really going after
[3:49:58.260 --> 3:50:04.260]  not only the Second Amendment, they're going after the First Amendment, because the language on the
[3:50:04.260 --> 3:50:11.380]  language changed to HB 1627, where they're changing existing law, tightening it up,
[3:50:11.380 --> 3:50:16.900]  just to where if somebody feels threatened or harassed, that can be enough to charge somebody,
[3:50:16.900 --> 3:50:23.940]  you know, with a felony. So you can see Virginia has just gone off the rails ever since Bloomberg
[3:50:23.940 --> 3:50:29.060]  pumped millions and millions of dollars into the state and sort of snuck the election.
[3:50:29.060 --> 3:50:34.740]  So the key is turnout. In the last election, I've read that only 40 percent of Virginians
[3:50:34.740 --> 3:50:42.100]  bothered to vote. I sure hope that's up a lot higher next time. And if it is, maybe the Democrats
[3:50:42.100 --> 3:50:49.780]  can be swept right out of office, because as it stands now, Virginia is even even after Richmond,
[3:50:49.780 --> 3:50:55.460]  Virginia is still in a very dangerous place. A couple weeks ago, I wrote something called
[3:50:55.460 --> 3:51:03.620]  The 2020 Virginia Showdown, which really lines out what would happen if the gun confiscation
[3:51:03.620 --> 3:51:08.980]  started really rolling through. There would be armed resistance. It wouldn't be a happy day like
[3:51:08.980 --> 3:51:16.260]  Richmond on Monday. If there are gun confiscation crews fanning out across Virginia, it will turn
[3:51:16.260 --> 3:51:21.700]  into a civil war, and it'll make Northern Ireland look like a church picnic. That's a fact.
[3:51:21.700 --> 3:51:28.260]  And so keep your eye on the red flag laws. Keep your eye on these anti-free speech,
[3:51:28.260 --> 3:51:32.580]  threatening and harassing officials, you know, like you may not mock the king.
[3:51:32.580 --> 3:51:37.380]  You might feel harassed by that. It's very anti-American what they're doing there.
[3:51:37.940 --> 3:51:44.660]  Now, while I'm on the subject of First Amendment, I'd like to talk about something that I noticed
[3:51:44.660 --> 3:51:52.580]  just in the last few days. And my meaning isn't to just talk about Tommy Robinson.
[3:51:52.580 --> 3:51:59.940]  We all know who he is. But about social media censorship, Tommy Robinson has been turned
[3:51:59.940 --> 3:52:07.780]  into an unperson, even in a way that Alex Jones and Infowars has not been. I mean, Tommy Robinson,
[3:52:07.780 --> 3:52:13.460]  if you even say a positive word about him on Facebook, you'll get banned. So what they did,
[3:52:13.460 --> 3:52:18.660]  and it kind of reminds me of the Roger Stone situation, you gag a man, then you can slander
[3:52:18.660 --> 3:52:25.060]  him with impunity and he can't fight back, not even his family. They're disallowed from
[3:52:25.060 --> 3:52:31.620]  exercising the First Amendment. Well, in the UK, Tommy Robinson, first he was banned from Twitter,
[3:52:31.620 --> 3:52:37.060]  and I know about that. I was banned from Twitter, and you can't even find out why. All you get are
[3:52:37.060 --> 3:52:42.500]  automated responses, like against, they're against hateful language, something like that.
[3:52:42.500 --> 3:52:47.860]  They won't tell you what you said. You're just gone. So first Tommy Robinson was banned from
[3:52:47.860 --> 3:52:54.020]  Twitter, where he had millions of followers. Then he was banned from Facebook. Then he only had a
[3:52:54.020 --> 3:53:01.940]  YouTube channel. And finally, he was banned from YouTube. So this week, past week, he was in Denmark
[3:53:01.940 --> 3:53:09.940]  where he was receiving a first, a free speech award. And he gave a major speech in an auditorium.
[3:53:09.940 --> 3:53:17.940]  And it was covered in Danish media. And it was posted on YouTube by other organizations,
[3:53:17.940 --> 3:53:25.460]  not Tommy Robinson. So a speech about free speech that was posted on YouTube. I posted
[3:53:25.460 --> 3:53:31.060]  a link to it, not praising Tommy Robinson, nothing like that. I posted a link to it on Facebook.
[3:53:31.620 --> 3:53:37.300]  And, you know, a short while later, I was notified that I was getting a seven day ban.
[3:53:37.300 --> 3:53:42.420]  Well, I've gotten 30 day bans practically every other month, up until a few months ago.
[3:53:42.420 --> 3:53:48.020]  And I'm only mentioning this because it seems like maybe we're seeing some kind of a loosening
[3:53:48.020 --> 3:53:55.780]  of social media censorship, because YouTube still has Tommy Robinson's speech about free speech up.
[3:53:55.780 --> 3:54:00.980]  I mean, maybe it's just too ironic, even for the social justice warriors,
[3:54:00.980 --> 3:54:07.780]  to ban a speech about free speech. Now, when you all know that Tommy Robinson,
[3:54:07.780 --> 3:54:14.100]  he went back to prison, it got out a few months ago. When he got out of prison in the mainstream
[3:54:14.100 --> 3:54:23.540]  media in the UK, he was called a wife beater, a drug dealer, a white supremacist. And he has no
[3:54:23.540 --> 3:54:30.180]  means to fight back because he's essentially gagged. He has no social media presence. Not only,
[3:54:30.180 --> 3:54:37.140]  you know, YouTube, you know, Twitter and Facebook, he can't use Patreon, he can't sell his books on
[3:54:37.140 --> 3:54:44.340]  Amazon, can't use Subscribestar. He's practically an unperson. He went from tens of millions of
[3:54:44.340 --> 3:54:49.300]  followers to, hey, whatever happened to Tommy Robinson? I guess he disappeared. What's the
[3:54:49.300 --> 3:54:58.180]  dude laying low? No, he was made an unperson. So please, I encourage you go on one of any video
[3:54:58.180 --> 3:55:04.900]  service where you can find it and look up Tommy Robinson in Denmark. The speech is amazing because
[3:55:04.900 --> 3:55:10.980]  he really is a terrific journalist. Each of these newspapers and television stations that told
[3:55:10.980 --> 3:55:16.340]  bald-faced landers about them, he was very bold. He would go right into their newsrooms,
[3:55:16.340 --> 3:55:23.060]  the camera crew, and ask them, you know, can you back that up? Of course they can't. And even this
[3:55:23.060 --> 3:55:30.740]  week in Denmark, it's in Danish with translation, a Danish reporter is asking a Facebook representative,
[3:55:31.380 --> 3:55:37.140]  you know, what exactly was he banned for? You can't just say, you know, there were reports
[3:55:37.140 --> 3:55:41.540]  that he had called for the beheading of Muslims. Are you kidding? If that had happened, it would be
[3:55:41.540 --> 3:55:47.300]  in every media, there would be screen captures. And the Facebook guy eventually admits, you're
[3:55:47.300 --> 3:55:52.820]  right, we don't have any proof, but it's not one thing. It's a lot of things. So the powers that
[3:55:52.820 --> 3:56:00.180]  they can just ban you from social media, I mean, totally so that you have no following. And it's
[3:56:00.180 --> 3:56:08.340]  because you're an anti-establishment, anti-elitist who opposes mass immigration. And the Facebook
[3:56:08.340 --> 3:56:16.740]  reps in this interview, they even admit that they're working with the authorities. So it's not
[3:56:16.740 --> 3:56:25.700]  just a private commercial entity like Facebook. It's Facebook working hand in glove with the UK
[3:56:25.700 --> 3:56:34.020]  government to essentially turn a British patriot into an unperson. You can't not only,
[3:56:34.020 --> 3:56:41.380]  he can't speak, but if you say anything positive about him on Facebook, you risk getting banned.
[3:56:41.380 --> 3:56:45.860]  Now, interestingly, after my seven day ban, I went through the process of saying, you know,
[3:56:45.860 --> 3:56:52.820]  it's a mistake, please reconsider. And a few hours later, without any notice,
[3:56:52.820 --> 3:56:58.340]  my posting privileges returned to me. I'm mentioning this because it might indicate
[3:56:58.340 --> 3:57:05.220]  that Facebook is starting to realize what, you know, tyrants and censors they look like
[3:57:05.220 --> 3:57:12.820]  to even ban anybody discussing Tommy Robinson in the context of the loss of free speech.
[3:57:12.820 --> 3:57:19.140]  I mean, how ironic is it that platforms dedicated to speech, you're not allowed to even mention
[3:57:19.140 --> 3:57:26.340]  somebody who has given an award for free speech. So it's, it's just pretty amazing.
[3:57:26.340 --> 3:57:32.740]  Now, I think I'll be back next week. And I would like to talk about China and this virus
[3:57:32.740 --> 3:57:38.020]  is going around. We'll have to see what's going, maybe in a week, we'll have a better idea of this
[3:57:38.020 --> 3:57:44.020]  outbreak, but it's nasty, folks.
