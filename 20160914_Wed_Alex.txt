[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:34.000 --> 01:00.000]  technocracy tank-oper. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, the 14th day
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  of September 2016. All hell has broken loose for the New World Order, kicking off on September
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  11th. They were launching so many of their big plans this month to openly bring in the
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  world government, to incrementally bring in the global financial collapse and to basically
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.000]  crown it off with their global cashless society. But Hillary Clinton really historically collapsed,
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  while leaving ground zero unexpectedly. And a domino effect of other cover-ups are just
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  collapsing down right now. If you go to drudgereport.com, what the New York Times even admits is the most
[01:41.000 --> 01:49.000]  coveted spot in the media, is the large banner black headline daily. He said what? Colin Powell,
[01:49.000 --> 01:59.000]  hell storm. And that is a McHale-Falen article from infowars.com dealing with the fact that
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Colin Powell talked about the fact with Democratic donors, he's basically a Democrat, high-level
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  Democratic donors that Hillary Clinton could not walk up the stairs to the podium last year.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  So massive developments unfolding on that front. It's well known that Hillary's been
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  seriously ill. It's well known she was in the hospital for a year in 2012 and 13. It's well
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  known that she has medical personnel running along beside her with EpiPens for convulsions.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  It's well known that her situation is deteriorating. And now former Secret Service agents are coming
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  up saying yes, she's having seizures. So over a month ago, we told you that we talked to the
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  Secret Service and they said, look, she's falling down more and more. Her situation is deteriorating.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  But here it is, the hacked emails. A lot of other media is focusing in on other areas of the Colin
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  Powell hacked emails that are obviously a treasure trove. Colin Powell's personal email hacked under
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  pressure to endorse Hillary Clinton. In fact, they're in the email saying endorse us and we'll stop
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  saying, hey, look, you had emails that should have been secret. Now the difference is they hadn't
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  passed those laws yet when Colin Powell was in and I by no means am defending Colin Powell.
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  The point is Hillary lied about it, deleted 33,000 emails and it's what's in the emails.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  In Colin Powell's emails is stuff about Hillary Clinton being sick. In Hillary's emails, it's selling
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  access to the Chinese president and selling access to the State Department. Totally illegal.
[03:38.000 --> 03:47.000]  That's the issue. There's a lot of other orbiting points. But the large planetary issue is that she
[03:47.000 --> 03:55.000]  could barely climb the podium steps, three steps. Hillary Clinton is seriously ill.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  And then continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we have big news. One of Putin's best friends they say in
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  Russia was appointed three years ago to head up state run Russian television and he has come out.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  So basically the mouth of Putin has come out and said that the state is basically really worried about
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  the globalist killing Donald Trump, which is obviously a common sense statement. It's a very powerful
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  video. No one has an English translation of it other than subtitles and it's not even the full
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  translation. So we had one. We aired it the fourth hour yesterday. We're going to be airing that again
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  coming up at the start of the next segment. So stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. The websites are
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  infowars.com and prismplanted.com. We've got a bunch of big guests today. Mark Dice has done it again.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  It was first circulating online, but now he went out and tested it with Californians.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  The majority of them, well actually none of them got it. They all believe that the Trumps are hunting
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  and killing extinct dinosaurs like pterodactyls and triceratops. Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.000]  A British special forces sharpshooter in Syria just killed a top ISIS executioner in 3G Hotties
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  with a single bullet over a mile away. Doing so just seconds before the terrorist and his friends
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  were going to burn 12 hostages alive with a flamethrower. The unidentified ISIS leader was said
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  to be on the US most kill list for several months and is known in Syria for being one of the most
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  sadistic ISIS leaders. It was he this week that was sent into a fireball by a British marksman
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  who struck a fuel tank affixed to the leader's back. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is busy on the
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  campaign trail here in the States. She makes little mention of the mess made in Syria and never
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  acknowledges that ISIS terrorists to build a substantial arsenal including US made weapons
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  obtained from the Iraqi army and Syrian opposition groups. Groups of the US State Department
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  armed. No official US policy or even acknowledgement that we've armed these groups and no plan
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  in place to make sure our rogue foreign policies stop arming future enemies. I'm Margaret

[08:29.000 --> 08:42.000]  The Cult of Hillary was called in to answer for their privatized investigation into the Clinton email server
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  debacle. Facing the oversight and government reform committee, Spokespersons for the DOJ, the State Department,
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.000]  the FBI, the Department of National Intelligence, the CIA, the Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the NSA
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  released a frustrated Congress that had been given the cold shoulder when it came to the sharing of key details of
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  Hillary Clinton's endangerment of U.S. national security. And for some of you I had to threaten to send a subpoena
[09:09.000 --> 09:19.000]  just to get you to appear today. We did some math. We got 70 of you sitting here. Between your compensation
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  and your benefits package you make more than a million dollars from taxpayers. Taxpayers are paying you seven
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  more than a million dollars. And you won't even come talk to Congress. What do you do all day if you don't talk to
[09:29.000 --> 09:39.000]  Congress? What is it that you believe we don't have the right to see? See this is the way our government works.
[09:39.000 --> 09:47.000]  We get to do oversight. That's why since 1814 this committee has been doing that. There's executive privilege. Let me
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  help you. There's executive privilege. Has the president invoked executive privilege in this case? No. The
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  answer is no. Good. That's right. The answer is no. Is there any other situation? Look, when it comes to
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  classified information and the classification that deals in the executive order, you know, not all the information
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  that we have in our files belongs to us. We defer to other agencies when it comes to access to their
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  classified information. But you are the ones that put redactions on personal identifiable information, correct?
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  We did on the personal identifiable information. That's correct. Where in the Constitution does it say that I can't see
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  that? It doesn't address it specifically in the Constitution. Here's the problem. You handpicked the 302s to give to us,
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  but the reality is you should give us all the 302s. So let me say this. I think the director made principal
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  decisions about what to say to Congress when he was here and also what to provide to Congress. As far as the
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  where do I find that? Do we just let everybody in government decide that they're based on their own individual
[10:53.000 --> 11:05.000]  principles? See, it's trust but verify is how it works. You don't get to decide what I get to see. I get to see
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  it all. Will the FBI provide to Congress the full file with no redactions, a personal identifiable information?
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  I cannot make that commitment sitting here today. Then I'm going to issue a subpoena and I'm going to do it right now.
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  So let's go. I've signed this subpoena. We want all the 302s and we would like the full file. You can accept
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  service on behalf of the FBI. Certainly. You are hereby served. You understand what Congress might want to know
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  whether or not the attorney client privilege was waived and who the client was? I can certainly imagine. Yeah, me too.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  That's why we want to see the file, agent. I mean, you say it's unprecedented. Mr. Cummings used to be a criminal offense attorney.
[11:47.000 --> 11:56.000]  He got to see all your 302s. Ken Buck used to be an assistant United States attorney. He got to see all your 302s.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  Probation officers get to see all your 302s. Why can't Congress? So I think we've given you the relevant ones.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  Relevant according to whom? I am telling you. I don't think you've given me all the relevant 302s.
[12:09.000 --> 12:18.000]  Well, the remainder of the 302s will come out through the FOIA process. But since when did Congress have to go through FOIA?
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  Correct. These mouthpieces betrayed the American people in full daylight, representing a decades-old shadow government
[12:25.000 --> 12:34.000]  that answers to a well-established network of global multinational corporations that view Congress and the American Constitution as meaningless
[12:34.000 --> 12:45.000]  and that hubris is strong as global government has just a few more building blocks to set before we are all under a legalized one-world government.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  Teddy Roosevelt once said, behind the ostensible government sits enthroned in an invisible government,
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  John Bowne for Infowars.com. I wanted to air that special report that just came out today from John Bowne because it's so powerful
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  and it reminds us that while we're looking at Hillary being caught lying about her serious health problems
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  and while we're looking at the latest hacked emails and while we see Russian state TV worried that the globalist may kill Donald Trump
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  and while we see serious economic developments and the Kentucky governor urged to resign if we're seeing blood, it will be shed if Hillary Clinton becomes president.
[13:26.000 --> 13:36.000]  That guy needs to be president now. We see all of this unfolding, all of this happening. Remember, we are hijacked and run by multinational banks.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  That's why every time they get exposed they say Russia is supposedly running us.
[13:41.000 --> 13:52.000]  When Russia can barely stop from collapsing and is under globalist economic attack and paramilitary attack with asymmetrical warfare all across their borders,
[13:52.000 --> 14:04.000]  we are under attack by the very same new world order as Russia. Does that mean Russia's perfect? No, but the globalists are a scientific evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:04.000 --> 14:17.000]  A scientific evil. I've got mainstream news articles here today. Motherless babies possible as scientists create live offspring without need for female egg.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  That's out of the one in Telegraph. Here's another one. Astonishing self-driving Uber cars.
[14:24.000 --> 14:38.000]  Hit the road and will take over within five years. Their words, not ours. This is a total overwrite of the planet, not just humanity.
[14:38.000 --> 14:49.000]  You are living in 2016. The social engineers have basically suppressed the Renaissance, only given themselves the fruits of it.
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.000]  They're in basically 2050. They're already in the future, technically, and they're getting ready to mop up this reality.
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  Their words, not mine. And people need to understand this, and here's the good news. Humanity is waking up.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  Humanity tends to wake up late in the game, but historically does tend to wake up.
[15:11.000 --> 15:22.000]  So we have huge news on Hillary's health front. It's the top story on DrudgeReport.com, the biggest story in the country.
[15:22.000 --> 15:33.000]  Hacked email, Colin Powell, dim donor, worried over Clinton's health in 2015.
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  They admit this is his email, this is him talking to a high-level Democratic donor, and he's saying, absolutely, I'm worried about her health. She couldn't even climb three stairs.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  She couldn't even get to the speech podium.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  We have it on screen for TV viewers, infowars.com forward slash show.
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.000]  infowars.com forward slash show.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  You can see the free video feed and on stations around the country.
[16:04.000 --> 16:11.000]  Back in 2015, Leeds and Powell discussed Hillary's health.
[16:11.000 --> 16:19.000]  Sheldon Whitehouse, who is a huge Clinton supporter, said they were both giving speeches at the same event a few months back, and she could barely climb the podium.
[16:19.000 --> 16:29.000]  And then they discussed her health on after that. They all are in on it. They know she had brain surgery in 2012 and 13.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  We know she was in the hospital in those two years for more than a year total.
[16:34.000 --> 16:43.000]  Overlapping. We know she's falling down. The Secret Service told us a month ago, basically every 15, 20, 30 minutes.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  We're like, tell us more. And they're like, sometimes it's every hour. Sometimes it's every 15, 20 minutes.
[16:48.000 --> 16:55.000]  The point is, she has got something really bad. It's Parkinson's brain tumor. We don't know.
[16:55.000 --> 17:05.000]  They won't tell us, but she is getting worse. And so Biggs said, because I let Biggs handle the source.
[17:05.000 --> 17:15.000]  Well, what do we do? They said, go to her events, watch the ambulance, watch the handler, watch the special system she uses to get in the vehicles.
[17:15.000 --> 17:24.000]  You're going to end up catching her collapsing. And on Monday, we came one micron from it with Millie Weaver and our crew in Cleveland, Ohio.
[17:24.000 --> 17:31.000]  Last Monday, nine days ago, where there's an ambulance, there's a medical gurney, a hospital bed, people in body armor.
[17:31.000 --> 17:40.000]  She's in a tent for 45 minutes, a small medical tent, comes out, has to cancel her speech, goes back in the medical tent.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  By the way, folks, better understand the Secret Service are risking their lives bringing this type of information out.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  In their entire history, they've never leaked information to the press like this because they understand this is not America.
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.000]  They are serving. This is the globalist. This is the New World Order. These are the controllers.
[17:58.000 --> 18:06.000]  And then, sure enough, seven days later, six days later, she collapses. They've got the media held back.
[18:06.000 --> 18:17.000]  They don't tell the media she's leaving, but one of her supporters catches it on a smartphone, uploads it, sells it.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  And so we see what the Secret Service told us was happening in Cleveland two months ago and what they told us again a month ago.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  On camera, proven. Our credibility up. Our credibility stratospheric. Their credibility near zero.
[18:37.000 --> 18:46.000]  That's what this comes down to. That's how we defeat the New World Order. The problem is they're getting desperate.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  Now, I'm going to skip this network break because this is so important.
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  And then we're going to get into mainstream media, admittedly, still getting talking points from Hillary on exactly what they're supposed to say.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  And we have mainstream media next to mainstream media saying the exact same words.
[19:00.000 --> 19:13.000]  We have incredible censorship taking place. And then we have the invincible ignorance of the very sad, pathetic, low information voter that tends to get their news from mainstream media
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  and who tends to support the Democratic Party.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  And I understand why the Republican Party has been pretty darn bad, but compared to the Democrats, they don't hold a candle to them.
[19:24.000 --> 19:39.000]  To show their ignorance later, we are going to play a special report and have Mark Dice on where there's been a meme on the Internet the last few weeks of the Trump sons, Eric and Donald Jr.
[19:39.000 --> 19:54.000]  Hunting big game. And the meme has been triceratops, tyrannosaurus rex, pterodactyls, things that have been extinct for eons.
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.000]  25 million years of you believe the paleontologist.
[19:59.000 --> 20:12.000]  And we couldn't find one Democrat voter on the streets of Southern California that didn't understand that it's impossible for the Trump sons to be out hunting extinct dinosaurs.
[20:12.000 --> 20:22.000]  And they even had politically correct answers, though. I mean, these people are really, really frightening. They're scary. They call us deplorable.
[20:22.000 --> 20:36.000]  They are deplorably ignorant, and I'm very, very sad for them. And I hope they'd wake up and discover the real world.
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  This next story is incredibly important. It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Drudge is also linked to this report.
[20:45.000 --> 21:01.000]  Putin appointed TV host. They may kill Donald Trump. And this is the man who runs Russia One National Radio and TV official state run media.
[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  This report is extremely important. It's up on infowars.com. And we need to get this report out to everyone.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now, there's an earlier version that's only part of the translation up on the site right now.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  We have the full one you're about to see premiered here, translated into English with my introduction.
[21:20.000 --> 21:28.000]  That will be posted in the next 30 minutes or so. It's going up to YouTube and will be put in the article if you want to see it and hear it for yourself and share it with others.
[21:28.000 --> 21:35.000]  But this is what's going on in Russia. And our media is trying to blame Russia for everything right now, falsely.
[21:35.000 --> 21:45.000]  Because they're globalist and they're the outsiders that have taken over and they need to basically project what's really happening on to an outside country that doesn't have the power to do that.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  China actually is manipulating us to a great extent. Saudi Arabia and others. But when you talk about Russia, very, very little.
[21:51.000 --> 22:00.000]  And the reason this is so important and the reason I'm really hammering on this right now is because where's our media?
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  Our media, the globalist media, covering this right now, you think they want to jump on top of it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  The problem is, you've got all these national talk show hosts and all these different New York Times writers, you name it, calling for the murder of Trump.
[22:12.000 --> 22:22.000]  So, see, they can't call this a conspiracy theory because they're the ones doing it. And then after the report, something even bigger. Here it is.
[22:22.000 --> 22:35.000]  Long time personal friend of Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Kassilyov, who was appointed in 2013 to run state-run media for Putin, came out and asked the question that many Americans are asking.
[22:35.000 --> 22:47.000]  With Trump ahead in the polls, with Hillary floundering and clearly having a medical crisis, will the establishment, the corrupt globalist that have hijacked America, kill Donald Trump?
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  Now, this is really important because the individual saying this is basically the mouth of Vladimir Putin.
[22:54.000 --> 23:03.000]  So this is Vladimir Putin telling the American people, the Russian people, and the people of the world about their concerns for Donald Trump.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  And I think these concerns are extremely valid. Here is the report.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Two important pieces of news regarding Donald Trump.
[23:11.000 --> 23:22.000]  Number one, he is ahead in polls by two points. Number two, Trump declared that if he is president, he aims to have, quote, very good relations with Russia.
[23:22.000 --> 23:34.000]  This combination of Trump's characteristics, his leadership in the presidential race, his ability to speak boldly, his intentions to turn over a new leaf regarding the Russian-American relations.
[23:34.000 --> 23:42.000]  All this puts Trump in a very dangerous situation. Now, they can just simply kill him.
[23:42.000 --> 23:53.000]  The intelligence services of the United States are not interested in the type of President Trump vows to be because the contrived enemy in the form of Russia justifies their existence.
[23:53.000 --> 24:03.000]  American elites are not interested in a President Trump as the establishment world order provides them with reliable sources of lucrative business.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  Trump, on the other hand, who is ready to reach agreements, would bring about a different set of financial opportunities flowing in other directions.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  The American establishment is merciless.
[24:17.000 --> 24:34.000]  Paul Craig Roberts, former assistant secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under President Reagan, has published a guest column on his website back in March by a journalist, Stephen Lendman, who commented on what has become a very popular theme on social media websites, quote,
[24:34.000 --> 24:48.000]  maybe an unfortunate plane crash, other fatal accident, or mysterious and curable fast-acting deadly illness is planned. Will Trump be gone before Republicans choose their nominee in July or perhaps before November's election?
[24:48.000 --> 24:59.000]  This narrative hasn't stopped, but the current state of the presidential race for Hillary Clinton is such where she has used up all of her available ammunition against Trump.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  She has an empty holder, yet there are still almost two months to go until the election.
[25:06.000 --> 25:25.000]  She has already accused Trump of being a Putin agent, that he hates Muslims, Mexicans, and blacks, and his wife Melania is unworthy of the title of the First Lady and that Trump himself is simply unfit and that he's even deranged and that he understands nothing in the way of the U.S. strategy,
[25:25.000 --> 25:44.000]  nor international affairs, and that he's a misogynist. Meanwhile, Trump details his plan of building relations with Russia, goes to Mexico, visits a popular black church, defends his wife's honor in court, and sees to his popularity among women.
[25:44.000 --> 25:54.000]  And the result? The scars put on Trump have nearly closed up, but the holes inflicted on Clinton are needing emergency surgery.
[25:54.000 --> 26:09.000]  Her carelessness with handling classified material while Secretary of State, foreign policy that led to terrorist expansion, her avarice, and the questionable reputation of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation,
[26:09.000 --> 26:20.000]  the dirty tricks of the Democratic National Committee favoring one candidate over the other, and finally Hillary's failing health, whether it's her fainting episodes or the coughing fits.
[26:20.000 --> 26:31.000]  So what's the solution? Shoot Trump? The option isn't far-fetched. After all, the United States has boasted of more president shootings than any other country in the world.
[26:31.000 --> 26:53.000]  Russia has state-run media. Here in the United States, we have global corporate-run media that literally has seized control of our nation, and just as Putin helped kick the oligarchs out of Russia, we're seeing the exact same thing begin to unfold here with Donald J. Trump leading a movement to kick the same oligarchs out of the United States.
[26:53.000 --> 27:09.000]  That's why they've tripled down, even in the Washington Post today, and are now claiming that Putin may be poisoning Hillary. Now, wait a minute. I thought that it was a conspiracy theory that she was even sick, but now the Russians are behind her illness.
[27:09.000 --> 27:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have foreigners already running our country. We already have globalists. And so they're trying to manipulate our nationalism against the Russians, hoping that we don't see the real threat internally that has hijacked our nation.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  I'm Alex Jones reporting for infowars.com.
[27:52.000 --> 28:14.000]  Well, of course, anybody with half a brain should be concerned. This is obviously the next course of action for the globalists if they think they can get away with it. But as you've noticed, everything they do tends to disintegrate and turn to dirt.
[28:14.000 --> 28:29.000]  When we come back from break, I'm going to get into the clip and the news article where the Washington Post is actually writing articles and interviewing, quote, experts saying we need to see if Putin is poisoning Hillary Clinton.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  You know, they call this the new McCarthyism, but McCarthy, it turned out, was pretty much right. He just went after low level people.
[28:35.000 --> 28:46.000]  And it was oligarch globalists financing communism so they could have basically centralized government to control the resources of Russia, China and other areas. But it turns out, Joseph McCarthy was right.
[28:46.000 --> 29:03.000]  In this case, this is just Hillary and the New World Order and the neocons who actually were Trotskyites, actual communists, it's funny enough, running around claiming that anyone that is against the New World Order and for national sovereignty is the opposite of a patriot, is the opposite of a nationalist,
[29:03.000 --> 29:15.000]  and supposedly is on the Russian payroll. Hillary Clinton, Rachel Maddow, her surrogates have all said that the godfather of the Trump movement is Vladimir Putin. That is ridiculous.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  They claim that I get my marching orders from Putin. I've been on air 21 years.
[29:21.000 --> 29:33.000]  It says before, Vladimir Putin was even, you know, president of Russia or vice president for that matter. It's just totally asinine. But they sit there and they push it.
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.000]  No, the globalists of hijacked the country and people working for them are collaborators to global corporate conquest. That's what we're facing.
[29:41.000 --> 29:51.000]  And many of them work for the communist Chinese and are involved in espionage like Hillary, Rodham, Clinton. That's a fact in the DC leaks and the WikiLeaks.
[29:51.000 --> 30:02.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.000 --> 30:12.000]  Could this be the last month we have uncensored free Internet here in the United States? The president has decided the U.S. will no longer oversee an open uncensored Internet here,
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.000]  and unless Congress steps in, he will begin transition of stewardship to the United Nations.
[30:17.000 --> 30:24.000]  Now, this new power grab will be given to authoritarian governments who have a vested interest in censoring undesirable content on the web.
[30:24.000 --> 30:31.000]  The U.S. Congress and its leaders led by Senator Ted Cruz are engaged in an all-out war on Capitol Hill to keep the Internet free.
[30:31.000 --> 30:39.000]  Now, if they're unsuccessful, Obama will hand over their power on September the 30th, and that's a move even former president Bill Clinton warned, quote,
[30:39.000 --> 30:46.000]  a lot of people who've been trying to take this authority away from the U.S. want to do it for the sole purpose of cracking down on Internet freedom
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  and limiting it and having governments protect their backsides instead of empower their people.
[30:51.000 --> 30:56.000]  And our own president is in lockstep with this power grab, an undeniable blow to free speech.
[30:56.000 --> 31:01.000]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[31:26.000 --> 31:39.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.000 --> 32:01.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at Infowarsstore.com.
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[32:16.000 --> 32:25.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  These are all parasites.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfowarsLife.com.
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[32:52.000 --> 32:58.000]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:01.000 --> 33:21.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is happening.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  I want to thank you all for your prayers, your support spreading the articles, the videos.
[33:29.000 --> 33:36.000]  You are soldiers, every man, woman, and child of you, regardless of what color you are or where you're from, in the fight against globalists.
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.000]  They're building a world that's going to be free of humans, where they merge with machines and become gods, they believe.
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  Rachel Maddow and others make fun of me on almost a daily basis for saying that,
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  but all I'm doing is quoting the lead scientist at Google and other major companies.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  This is their goal, whether they're going to be able to attain this goal or not.
[33:58.000 --> 34:12.000]  That is a question, but those of us covering this are not the ones who are insane.
[34:12.000 --> 34:22.000]  We are covering twisted people, and they have this paradox where they try to act like we're the crazy people for covering all the weird stuff they're involved in and not the other way around.
[34:22.000 --> 34:32.000]  I mean, look at this, how to learn telegraph. Motherless babies possible as scientists create live offspring without need for female egg.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  And artificial wombs and the list goes on and on.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  I'm going to extend this for one day and one day only.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  Quite frankly, because we're not ready to launch our new special yet until tomorrow.
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.000]  And I would take advantage of it because contractually, I'm already supposed to be stopping this.
[34:53.000 --> 35:04.000]  But when you're the number one distributor of the largest companies in the nation, storeable foods, you're allowed to, I guess, bend the rules a bit to get people the best deals.
[35:04.000 --> 35:13.000]  30 to 40% off all of the entire line of my patriots supply foods, private labeled under the name InfoWars Select.
[35:13.000 --> 35:21.000]  You can buy the same great food right next to it, InfoWarsStore.com, if you'd rather pay 30 to 40% more and have the my patriots supply label.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  The exact same food, same age produced right here in America.
[35:25.000 --> 35:38.000]  They've got their plants turned up so high that a lot of times this food has been packaged a day or two before it's put on an 18-wheeler and rolled out to your town, your city.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  And nobody can beat these prices, the selection, the quality, you know, there's a nexus for how much you pay and the quality.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Really good quality, but really low price.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  But frankly, you can pay three, four times this and get stuff that is like gourmet.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  But a lot of this tastes really, really good.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  All of it is decent and a lot of it is extremely delicious.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  But there's a nexus point.
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.000]  This is what I chose for my family, but I've chosen for the office what I'm stockpiling because it's super high quality, really tasty, really durable, packaged properly.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  Last the longest and it's the lowest price.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  I mean, there is stuff that tastes like dirt that is more than this.
[36:13.000 --> 36:30.000]  You just cannot find a better bang for your buck than the MyPatriot Supply Food at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[36:30.000 --> 36:46.000]  And by the way, I've gone from having the solar panel system and the well water and living out in the country and having some storeable food to ramping up to going on to solar and putting in another well and getting more storeable food and getting more firearms.
[36:46.000 --> 36:55.000]  And quite frankly, I'm going into the area of getting the gourmet storeable food, which we're not selling it, but I'm testing it all out and trying to make deals right now.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.000]  So we'll also have that little bit of caviar level stuff that you have kind of as dessert with the stockpile.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  So a lot of stuff's happening here.
[37:04.000 --> 37:16.000]  The point is what we sell is what I use and what I've researched and what I am having in my emergency preparedness myself.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  Quite frankly, I'd have four or five other major food sponsors.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  It's just hard to find somebody this good for the price.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  The only other galaxy that comes with storeable food is the super gourmet stuff.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  And quite frankly, I'm diving into it because man, there's some really good stuff out there.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  So I'm in the middle of that enjoyable research.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  I take my son, you know, dove hunting or something for the weekend, or I go camping with the kids or I go fishing with the kids and the family.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  I'm deep in research of gourmet storeable food.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  It'll be showing up in the next month or so at infowarstore.com.
[37:47.000 --> 37:59.000]  And again, the reason I'm doubling down and really getting into this is because it's gone from a possibility to a probability to a certainty that we're going to see things get worse and worse, at least for the foreseeable future.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  But then things will get better after that.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  I don't know how bad this global meltdown is going to be.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  I don't know how big these wars are going to be.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  All I know is most elites move into New Zealand.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  They're leaving the United States.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  They're leaving Israel.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  They're leaving Europe.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  They're running for the hills.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  The Russians are digging in.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  It's in mainstream news.
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  The Russians are buying emergency storeable food and digging in.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  I mean, it is a crazy time.
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.000]  There was a big headline a few days ago or last week that world experts agree the planet has never been in greater danger of World War Three.
[38:29.000 --> 38:42.000]  Now, I'm not saying World War Three is a certainty, but global financial meltdown, crises, social problems are clearly intensifying and have gone from a probability to a certainty because they're already happening.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  And it's getting worse.
[38:43.000 --> 38:55.000]  And you've got George Soros and the rest of the globalists running around trying to divert everybody from the huge crimes they've committed and all the bad things they've done with having us all fight with each other.
[38:55.000 --> 39:05.000]  We're seeing weaponized culture war garbage being carried out along ethnic and religious lines all over the world.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  And that's why I am personally getting prepared.
[39:09.000 --> 39:20.000]  And yes, funding our information war with a symbiotic program of getting people prepared with the very best quality, very lowest prices we can on nutraceuticals, on the supplements.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  But I've gone from maybe 10% getting prepared and 90% offense to 70% offense, 30% defense.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  Now, some will say, well, it seems like you're working harder.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  Yes, I've overall upped my amount of resistance and our operation.
[39:36.000 --> 39:45.000]  So even though I've cut back in the overall pie on how much time I spend trying to save things, we're fighting harder than ever.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  But we're fighting to try to fix things.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  We're fighting to try to save things off.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  We're fighting to try to stabilize.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  We're fighting to try to warn people.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  We're fighting to try to reach out to other countries and other groups that don't want to have World War III to have alliances of just ideology, alliances of sanity.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  We're doing everything we can.
[40:04.000 --> 40:14.000]  And quite frankly, I have to take care of my kids and I was telling you, never in 20 plus years on air have I started digging in.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  And I'm digging in now.
[40:16.000 --> 40:25.000]  And it's because my instinct tells me that we've got some rough times ahead and you're going to see as things get worse and worse, who's who.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  You're going to see people you thought were patriots flip and work for the enemy.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  You're going to see folks you thought were on the fence or with the enemy come over to our side.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Because the battle lines are getting clear.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  20 years ago it wasn't clear who was who.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  10 years ago it wasn't that clear.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Not even five years ago.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  It's crystal clear right now.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  And that's why we go to this next report.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Now the New York Daily News Democrat run are openly saying he should step down.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  It's outrageous.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  It's terrible.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  We have seen Hillary Clinton come out and say that Trump supporters are deplorable and the media come out and say all of them are deplorable and basically aren't even humans.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  We heard her say that the alt-right, that is the real right, doesn't have a right to exist.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  We're hearing final solution type talk.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  We're seeing announcements that are going after the press.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  We're seeing huge developments.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  We're seeing the media work lockstep in deception.
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.000]  And so the governor, who I'm a fan of by the way, just when I see him on TV and stuff talking and his initiative to bring jobs to Kentucky,
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  came out and said, listen, blood's going to get spilled.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  The Tree of Liberty.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  That's the kind of stuff George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan said.
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  It's like when Trump says if we lose the election and the courts take our guns, we have no recourse, I guess, but the Second Amendment.
[41:41.000 --> 41:48.000]  That's what everybody from Charlton Heston to Ronald Reagan to yours truly has said to Ted Nugent.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  I mean, that is a standard refrain of come and take it from my cold, dead hands.
[41:53.000 --> 42:04.000]  Trump should stand down, Trump should resign, Trump should be disqualified because of that statement while Hillary and the globalist destabilize the nation.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  No, this guy is now presidential material down the road.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  Kentucky governor urged to resign after saying blood will be shed.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Well, see, he's a former business owner.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  He's a company owner.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  He's like Trump.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  He doesn't want power.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  He's taking a demotion to be governor.
[42:22.000 --> 42:32.000]  You think real people that actually have jobs and create jobs and work hard like to get things done or problem solvers, you think they want to work in government?
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  The Republican governor in Kentucky foolishly, they say, implied Americans will have to die.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  Hillary Clinton wins this November and calls for his impeachment are now amassing.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  So that's that's that's how they spin it.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  No, calls for him to be given a medal are now increasing.
[42:48.000 --> 43:03.000]  Speaking of the voters value summit Washington D.C. on Saturday, they just now found it a loosely Thomas Jefferson quoting Governor Matt Bevin bizarrely hinted at his own children having to shed blood.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  So this is all hypothetical down the road.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  Someday we might go to the Second Amendment.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  That's in the Declaration of Independence that it's our right and duty.
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  So he quotes Thomas Jefferson and they start running around saying he should have to step down.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  Next they'll say he should be arrested.
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  See, even though the New York Times says kill Donald Trump, that's OK.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  So that's where they're going.
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  I have nine children.
[43:28.000 --> 43:38.000]  It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something to reclaim something that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away.
[43:38.000 --> 43:49.000]  You went on to appropriate a segment of a letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1787, which in part states the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  We have a t-shirt that says that.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  A Gadsden flag yellow t-shirt that we sell in infowarstore.com that says the quote on the back.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  It's a yellow shirt like the flag.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  I mean, they are taking normal Americana and making it dirty now.
[44:07.000 --> 44:21.000]  So here is the governor quoting the third president of the United States to the occupiers, the globalist, the political aliens to our system are freaked out by it because they don't breathe this oxygen that we breathe.
[44:21.000 --> 44:31.000]  They breathe the foul fumes of hell based on bondage and enslavement and systems like North Korea.
[44:31.000 --> 44:39.000]  If Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it's possible that we'll be able to survive that would we ever be able to recover as a nation?
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  And while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not, I would beg to differ, but I will tell you this, I do think it would be possible.
[44:46.000 --> 45:02.000]  But at what price, at what price the roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood of who? The tyrants to be sure, but who else? The patriots.
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren.
[45:08.000 --> 45:27.000]  I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away.
[45:27.000 --> 45:41.000]  But don't let it happen. Oven-buying for the people means oven-buying for the people. This is our right. It is our privilege. This is not something that came by accident, nor will it be preserved by indifference.
[45:41.000 --> 45:51.000]  It takes the people being engaged. When our founding fathers pledged their lives and their fortunes and their sacred honors, this wasn't a bumper sticker.
[45:51.000 --> 46:01.000]  They weren't trying to get elected to something. Every one of them gave some or all of those things a tremendous sacrifice.
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.000]  For those that don't know, maybe you're new listeners, maybe you're a racial man out tuning into the White House, he's quoted the Declaration of Independence.
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  Most of that speech is Declaration of Independence mixed in with a guy that wrote most of it. He's credited with writing about 80% of it, Thomas Jefferson.
[46:16.000 --> 46:24.000]  Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then they debated it and passed it around and changed it, and he rewrote it. He wrote it.
[46:24.000 --> 46:38.000]  So the reason Thomas Jefferson in 1887 sounds like the Thomas Jefferson in 1776 is because it's the same Thomas Jefferson.
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's all Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party. Now, he was the guy who tried in the first Declaration of Independence to ban slavery.
[46:46.000 --> 46:54.000]  He also tried in the first Constitution. You just couldn't do it because it was a half million people and what we do is send folks back to Africa.
[46:54.000 --> 47:03.000]  And there were people that did not want black people to be free, but the point is America at the same time England was trying to ban slavery, was trying to.
[47:03.000 --> 47:21.000]  England did it about 60 years earlier than we did and England led the world in banning it, attacked scores of countries and dozens and dozens of nations ships for 60 plus years, including American ships to ban slavery.
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.000]  That's why by what was it 1810 or so the transatlantic slave trade was over because the British would attack you.
[47:27.000 --> 47:34.000]  And the only reason I raise this is the only people that kept slavery going after that was the Arabs.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  And I'm not attacking the Arabs. Most Arabs aren't involved in slavery. The point is, is that this isn't taught in school.
[47:41.000 --> 47:53.000]  Collectively, we're taught Europe invented slavery, the U.S. perfected slavery, and it's not true. 2% of Southerners owned slaves.
[47:53.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's crazy what a red herring this is. And I'm not defending it. It's just not true that America is all about it.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  America tried to end this evil and America has been all about trying to transcend it all along.
[48:08.000 --> 48:16.000]  And we never even began to scale the heights of the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution and the Renaissance and those ideas that it represented.
[48:16.000 --> 48:23.000]  But just getting a little bit of it created such wealth, the world's never seen it. Such freedom.
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  And that's why the globalists are in competition with the American system. They want to get rid of it because it's the Renaissance.
[48:28.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's the Enlightenment. It is science. It is freedom. It is openness. It is free association. It is the Renaissance that ended.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  Classism. You say, well, still here today.
[48:41.000 --> 48:53.000]  No, I mean, it in its declaration ended it and began a system where anybody in the world could potentially end up become successful and wealthy in America.
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  Anybody born here could end up being the president of the United States or a member of Congress.
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  Who wants to do that? Go set up your own company. Chart your own future.
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  I want to go out to break because what the governor said is so evil, is so horrible, why you better resign.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  They're making classic Americana somehow dirty like pornography.
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.000]  With a little club of myself three years ago speaking for the first time ever, they let somebody have a political speech at the Alamo.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  It was just a warehouse of the 50s and the dollars of public attacks.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  We're great folks. A lot of my family, you know, relatives took it over and said, we're not going to let it be political.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  They got taken over by patriots in the state government and now we do have our political rallies there.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  And I'm so honored to be one of the first people to speak at the Alamo after it was resurrected.
[49:41.000 --> 50:02.000]  Here's part of that speech.
[50:11.000 --> 50:23.000]  Again, I thought I just played a piece of that clip because I mean, I'm proud of America.
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  I'm proud of what we've done. I'm proud of the fact that we have more inventions and more wealth.
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  The United States was 4% of the world's population. We're now 6% out of 100.
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  And we had 50% of the wealth until about 15 years ago.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  And people say, oh, you're rich, you're green, you're evil, you exploited.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  That was the American system outside of globalism.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  Now that globalism is coming in, we're getting poor.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  And everybody else is, but a few tiny elites.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  And they admit that's their system.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  Tiny elites, crony capitalism, aka feudalism.
[50:58.000 --> 51:11.000]  We'll be back with huge news for the latest hack.
[51:28.000 --> 51:54.000]  We'll be back with a new hack.
[51:54.000 --> 52:12.000]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life insurance.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent,
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[52:33.000 --> 52:45.000]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  How about you?
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  1-800-654-1632.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  We shop. You save.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[53:05.000 --> 53:12.000]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[53:12.000 --> 53:20.000]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Pates, a spokesman for the company.
[53:26.000 --> 53:32.000]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage.
[53:38.000 --> 53:46.000]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated four and a half out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.000]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  Go to freefood2.com right now.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  Supplies are limited, and the program may end at any time.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  Go to freefood2.com now.
[53:58.000 --> 54:09.000]  That's freefood2.com.
[54:28.000 --> 54:38.000]  We are back in other news stories up on infowars.com.
[54:38.000 --> 54:47.000]  Concussion pathologist claims Trump and Putin have poisoned Hillary, and the Washington Post actually reports on it with no proof.
[54:47.000 --> 54:56.000]  So not only is Putin magically running Trump and myself and everybody else who doesn't want to live under Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan multinational rule,
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  now they've poisoned Hillary.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  That story is up on infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  But the big story is on DrudgeReport.com.
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  This is such a big deal because this is internal emails with Democrats that are friends of Hillary Clinton.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  People that wouldn't want to be saying she's sick if she isn't.
[55:16.000 --> 55:28.000]  Talking to Colin Powell, hacked email. Colin Powell, dim donor, worried over Clinton's health in 2015.
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.000]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Major Democratic donor Jeffrey Leeds,
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  worryingly discussed Hillary Clinton's health in March of last year, hacked email show.
[55:39.000 --> 55:46.000]  Because they're all part of the same crew, folks. Powell's been a Democrat, just like George Herbert Walker.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  These people vacation together is sick. The email exchange provided to several journalists by DCLeaks,
[55:51.000 --> 56:01.000]  a website with ties to Jussifer 2.0, reveals how Clinton health has been a topic of discussion among political heavyweights for some time.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  I want to just say great job.
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.000]  And our hackbeat reporter, he covers hacking, does a great job for staying up so late last night to be the first to break this.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  On HDTV, these are the emails, she doesn't look so good.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  On HDTV, she doesn't look good.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  Powell, who is believed to have around 30,000 emails hacked, wrote on March 14th.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  She is working herself to death. She will turn 70 her first year in office.
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.000]  In response, Leeds recalled a convention, conversation with Rhode Island Democrat Senator Sheldon White House
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  regarding Clinton's difficulty in traversing a set of steps.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  Sheldon White House, who is a huge Clinton supporter, this is a quote from the email,
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  said that they were both giving speeches at the same time, the same event a few months back,
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  and she could barely climb the podium steps, Leeds wrote.
[56:52.000 --> 56:59.000]  The second fourth will undoubtedly increase skepticism among American voters, already worried over Clinton's increasingly public health issues.
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.000]  You know, for me, and the article goes on, for me, the bigger issue is all these reporters going,
[57:04.000 --> 57:11.000]  look, she wobbled, she stumbled, and then they don't show her falling down and being drugged into the vehicle,
[57:11.000 --> 57:20.000]  singing in MSNBC, and then I have other clips coming up where we have, well, in fact, let's try to play it down, we have time.
[57:20.000 --> 57:26.000]  Clinton on CBS Live saying, yeah, no, she faints all the time, she falls, and then they change it,
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  because he catches himself, he goes, I mean, over the years, she's falling some.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  They edit that out and edit it to where he didn't say that.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  I mean, this is weaponized media. Let's go to that clip of Clinton.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  The story is up on infowars.com.
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.000]  CBS News edits out Bill Clinton saying Hillary has frequently to rarely had similar episodes,
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.000]  because he changes it to rarely later. They edit it together to deceive the public here it is.
[57:51.000 --> 57:58.000]  When you look at that collapse, that video that was taken, you wonder if it's not more serious.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  No, no, she's been dehydration.
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  She's been, well, if it isn't to ministry to me and all of her doctors, because it's frequently,
[58:06.000 --> 58:13.000]  I'm not frequently, rarely, but on more than one occasion, over the last many, many years,
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  the same sort of things happened to her when she just got severely dehydrated.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  Okay, now here's the edited part. This was reared all over the place.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  No, no, she's been dehydration.
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  She's been, well, if it isn't to ministry to me and all of her doctors, rarely,
[58:30.000 --> 58:36.000]  but on more than one occasion, over the last many, many years, the same sort of things happened to her.
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  You saw that. We're going to break, but notice they put roads over it when they made the cut.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[58:51.000 --> 58:58.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[59:01.000 --> 59:07.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[59:25.000 --> 59:30.000]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.000]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[59:39.000 --> 59:44.000]  InfoWarsLife.com and the profit we make. We fight the global. We fight the new world order.

[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us coming up.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  Then Mark Dice, Paul Watson from London. He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  And it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  But first, a special report.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  What are you going to do when you go to the stage with Donald Trump?
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Well, the answer is, don't get on the stage with Donald Trump.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Well, now the official mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, the Washington Post,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  has come out and said that Hillary might not get better from her pneumonia
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  until late October a month and a half from now
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  and may have to miss the first debate or debates with Donald Trump.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Isn't that convenient? We've said over and over again.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  There's no way this woman, who in over a year and a half,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  never gives more than a 15-20-minute speech, who is never on stage more than 30 minutes.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  There's no way that she can stand on stage for an hour and a half with Donald Trump.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Even during Democrat debates, they have to wait an extra 10 minutes or so for her to come back on stage.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And do we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  But in the meantime, we want to start with this eye-opening number.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you for...
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Senator Reporters a week and a half ago in Ohio, where she had to go in a medical tent for 45 minutes
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  with them running in there with stretchers until she could go out on stage
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  and have a five-minute hacking fit and have to cancel her speech.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Then she couldn't give a press conference that afternoon.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  There are hundreds and hundreds of examples of this.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  But don't worry, her husband, Bill Clinton, last night on Charlie Rose,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  came out and said that Hillary is working like a demon.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Over the last many, many years, the same sort of things happened to her
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  when she just got severely dehydrated.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And she's worked like a demon, as you know.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  It's Secretary of State and as a senator and in the years since.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  But more importantly, she's on a grueling campaign.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  So there you have it. Bill Clinton's finally telling the truth
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  and agreeing with Julian Assange that Hillary is a demon.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  I wonder if Hillary will now come out and basically admit
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  that she does want to put the free press' neck in a noose.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Just like the globalists have already put our economy in a noose.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  But bottom line, yesterday we talked about tweets put out by the Democrats
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  saying they were meeting at the DNC, NDC, talking about getting a replacement for Hillary.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  The media said we were conspiracy theorist.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  But today there were hundreds of publications admitting that indeed that
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  they're looking at a possible replacement for Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Now I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  I'm simply saying how do you run this unpopular zombie
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  against Donald Trump when he's rising in the polls and she's falling in the polls,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  especially after she called half of Trump's supporters deplorable
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  and her own minions said they're all deplorable.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  You can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Right?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Do you think it's stuff to defend the remark deplorables to do the...
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Absolutely not.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  I think that her only mistake is that she said half of his supporters were deplorable.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Does anybody around this table, have they not seen Trump's rallies?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Have they not seen Trump's own remarks?
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  What she said was not wrong.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Her only mistake was that she described half of his supporters that way.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become president of the United States.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  She has disqualified herself as the president of the United States.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  So look for false flags.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Look for staged events.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Look for made-up crises.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Look for them to play the race card.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Harder than ever in an attempt to divide and conquer this nation.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  But the truth is, the American people are waking up to the globalist.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  And the fact that America has its problems and we're going to fix it as Americans,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  regardless of what color we are.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  But we don't need George Soros and offshore banks to come in here and stir things up
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  so they can rob and loot this nation.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  We're aware of what's happening and the sleeping giant that is America has risen.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  The people that are the resistance are awake and they're ready to take action.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got breaking news.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I may have to withdraw my support for Donald J. Trump.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  It turns out his sons have been involved in some incredibly evil activities.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  They've been caught hunting endangered species.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  This is terrible news.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  We're going to come back and show you the shocking photos and video straight ahead
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  and get Gavin McGinnis' take on this game-changing event.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers gives the U.S. infrastructure a report card.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  This report card depicts the condition and performance of America's infrastructure,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  assigning a letter grade based on the physical condition of our most basic structures.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  America's infrastructure GPA this year is a D-plus, in other words, barely passing.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Nothing reflects this rating more so than what happened to one Chicago metro rider.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  She's recovering at home after she was hit in the head by falling debris at Union Station,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  literally cracking her skull.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  The accident highlights a severe problem and she wants other metro riders to be aware of what happened to her.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  It was several pounds of concrete, in fact falling from a ceiling.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  Another rider who writes for the Chicago Sun Times said,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  what really bothered me was that Amtrak wouldn't say how often this happens.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Three tracks were shut down for repairs to be made so that normal train operations can resume,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  and other words keeping that D rating intact.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  This puts millions of American lives at risk every day who depend on these structures for basic survival.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinotide...
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Why? Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  What products are you taking?
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  So when I just free up everything and I just went to Autofill.

[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Just go to InfowarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products.

[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  10% off on AutoShip. Win, win, win at InfowarsLives.com.

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Well, I'm not bragging, but it is surreal to routinely have the top link on the Internet.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  Bigger than the top New York Times, bigger than the top story on Facebook, thetopofdrudgereport.com.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  But of course, it does deserve the link, our great Internet news reporter slash hacking news expert.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Michael Thalen stayed up until I'm told 3-4 in the evening last night to get the exclusive on the hacked emails with good old former Secretary of State and former architect of the first Iraq war, Colin Powell.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  And in there, we're talking about Hillary Clinton can't go up two or three stairs to give a speech.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  They're really worried about her health a year ago.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  So this is her own allies worried about it.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  But there's also in the emails, the fact that they kept saying, we'll quit pointing at you using emails in a private server.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  If you endorse Hillary, wow, talk about influence peddling.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  The plot thickens and Gavin McGinnis is a serial entrepreneur, one of the founders of vice media.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  He has the Gavin McGinnis show that airs for a couple hours every day right before my show starts on compoundmedia.com.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Really interesting guy, we appreciate him coming on the broadcast.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  He's a frequent contributor.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  He's seen a lot of big national, international TV shows as well.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  He's a comedian, really smart guy.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  He'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And I want to get into all the serious news, but since I made the joke earlier in the last segment, let me just be clear.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I'm fully behind Trump.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  If I ever had questions about him a year and a half ago, I don't.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  His stamina, his patriotism, being attacked by all these people, going to Mexico, going to Louisiana, all these big coups he's had.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  I mean, he's running against a corpse, Hillary, but I'm really proud of the fact that the guy is an American.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  He is a patriot.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  He makes America young again.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  We had a guest on yesterday making that point.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  It's not even make America great again.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  It's make America feel young again, like we're doing something.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  We're taking action.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  We're not, you know, broke back and drooling in the corner, but America's greatest days are to come.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  They're not over.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Stop going downhill like a snowball headed for hell to quote Merle Haggard, the late, great Merle Haggard.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  You can follow him at Twitter at gabin underscore McInnis M-C-I-N-N-E-S, but most folks know he is.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  My 14-year-old son's a big fan.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  And of course, every other young person I've talked to, but also a lot of folks my age are older.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  So we're going to be going to him in a moment, but since I mentioned this, I said, listen, we got big news here, folks.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  I'm going to have to withdraw my support for the Trumps because it's been circulating for weeks on social media.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  Photos of them big game hunting triceratops, pterodactyl, brachiosaur, diplodocus, other creatures.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  In fact, they've been out in the ocean with big harpoon guns, hunting plesiosaurus.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  I mean, this is a serious situation, okay?
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  And these are seriously endangered species, okay?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Well, Mark Dice goes out and he shows in his video.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  He's coming on next hour reporting from FullWars.com of markdice.com.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  He goes out and he talks to Southern Californians, and this is everyone he talked to.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  I'm not going to play the whole clip and play it next hour, but it seems like a lot of folks are waking up.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  We're taking action.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  People are really starting to see what's happening, except they've still got half the public that can't find their ass with both hands.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I don't say that with pleasure, like Hillary Clinton preying on these people.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  They call us deplorable because we want to bring back prosperity and free market and private property.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  And where, you know, men can wear pants and it's okay.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  But their voters literally, nine out of 10 say put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Their voters say, yes, the Trumps sons are horrible for hunting triceratops.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Folks, triceratops has been gone for 25 million years.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  So let's play just a minute or two of this Mark Dice report because I want to start here with Gavin McEnish here in this second hour.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Let's go ahead and play the invincibly ignorant supporters of Hillary.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  You might have seen the Donald Trump kids are big hunters.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  They go on these hunting trips just for fun and kill these poor animals.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  So now just getting people's reactions to Donald Trump's kids now killing the triceratops in Africa.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Okay. So honestly, my opinion is I think they're just getting away with a lot for the simple fact that they're Donald Trump's children.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Would an ordinary person be able to get away with killing a triceratops or is the Donald Trump's kids just being able to get away with that because they're Donald Trump's kids?
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  I think they're getting away with it because they're Donald Trump's kids.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  I don't think anybody else would just get in trouble and they're honestly just, I don't know, jail time.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Animal rights activists.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Yeah, they'll pay a fine for it and they'll serve their time in jail.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  For killing the triceratops, I think they're the endangered species in some countries.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  So it makes it even worse.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  Yeah, but I agree.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  All right. Thank you very much.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  Triceratops is on the endangered species list. Now Donald Trump Jr., a big game hunter just killed triceratops and posted a picture posing with the dead animal's body.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  He goes into woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I'm going to go out in Austin this weekend and go to the trendy areas as opposed to the smartest areas.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  I'm going to go to UT and I guarantee you.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Californians, that's San Diego, where all of them are 9 out of 10 on average, don't know what planet they're on.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  I bet 8 out of 10 say, yes, arrest Trump for letting his sons hunt stegosaurus, which we all know back in the 1930s, King Kong, King Kong battles and kills a stegosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  So I want to ask Gavin McInnis, how do we defeat this level of ignorance, sir?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  It's not easy.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  I mean, what's going on here is it's clearly fashioned to them. It's clearly sports. They've never been outside. They don't care what happens.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  I mean, if Hillary is so sick that she's collapsing and she's got catheters falling out of her pants, the left says that she's a badass and that she's campaigning while under the suffering pain of pneumonia.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  If we say that the Trump kids are killing dinosaurs, they say it's because Trump is rich.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Am I crazy or are we more open-minded than them?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I think we're into the truth and I think the hatred for Trump on the right is actually a good example of how open to the truth we are.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  I mean, he says something about free speech, persecuting journalists who smear him.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  The right gets really mad. We have almost a third of the right right now is still fighting against Trump.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  Whereas the left, Hillary can do no wrong, just as Trump can do no right.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And you realize you guys aren't in it for the facts. You're not in it for the truth. You're not in it for justice. You're in it for fashion.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  You could have said that Trump's kids think they're doing a favor by preserving the triceratops, but the triceratops has been extinct.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  And I bet you these students would say, yeah, they're just showboating. I mean, the triceratops is never coming back and it's just fake.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  So you're saying it's okay to kill the triceratops?
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  I'm saying it's okay to kill the triceratops. I don't like the triceratops. It's a very deadly animal.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Have you seen those horns? There's a reason God pieced it out of here. It's trouble.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  Absolutely. In fact, thank God that Donald Trump Jr. killed the last triceratops.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  They're a vicious animal. And it's not just those horns that are a problem.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  They've got that huge casing around the horns. They've got their tiny little walnut brain. They're a menace to society.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  I'm glad that the Trump kids are getting rid of them.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  You got a good point about walnut brains. I mean, we need to get rid of it.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  But hey, I bet the triceratops would score higher on the ACT or the different tests than the actual Hillary supporters.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Don't one of them have a brain in its ass? I think the Stegosaurus has a brain. They have a tail brain.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  Exactly. Well, maybe Hillary is the Stegosaurus of politicians.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  What do you make of the current climate? I mean, what moment have we entered?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Because it's so surreal now where she's falling down and the media won't even show her falling down.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  They just show her wobbling and say, what's the big deal? Not knowing their viewers can just go see it online.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  I mean, it's like the mainstream media is finally committing suicide with what little bit of credibility they had left.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  Well, they don't leave. They don't leave their little bubble, so they don't go outside.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  And that's why they can say triceratops killing is wrong, because they've never even looked at big game hunting.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  They don't know anything about any of that stuff. They've never been outside.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  And as far as the Hillary thing goes, all they know is the Internet. They see the alt-right is putting up a frog picture.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  So Hillary starts addressing Pepe the Frog like it's this major search.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And you go, lady, leave Reddit for maybe an hour and a half. Get outside. Get some fresh air.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  And the fact that they think that they can kill this story, I mean, the original guy who put it on Twitter,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  he's got some weird sort of a Bosnian name like Zagar Gadesk or something.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  They've shut him down and then they shut down Paul Joseph Watson. Didn't they? They shut him down.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Oh, yeah. They started taking our videos down. They started taking it down like you can do that.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  I mean, it's everywhere right now. And the fact that they think that they can stop,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  it shows how incredibly naive they are. They're sort of lost in a meme hole.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  They're like that. They accuse us of being the fat guys in the basement drinking the Supergulp.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  But it seems like the entire Democratic Party is locked in the basement only checking out memes.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  That video is out. We know she's sick. And I'll tell you what.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  She is so sick that I am worried about her. Us Trump supporters are petrified.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  We're going to lose her before November. After the election, I don't care what happens to her.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  But right now, I would take a bullet for her.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Yeah, but I agree because they're going to put somebody in better than her.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  I'm really worried about the sympathy vote when they admit she's got a big old fat brain tumor.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Both good.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Same with Obama. I would take a bullet for Obama just to avoid having to hear about the first black president
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  being assassinated for the right. I agree with you. My biggest concern is them pulling a false flag
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  or some nut-killing one of them. I am literally praying every night for Hillary Clinton's safety.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Obama would put us in a state of emergency and he would delay the election at best,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  choose his own candidate at worst, or it's conceivable that he would just continue his presidency
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  for, I don't know, another year, another two years. Bloomberg did it.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Well, Gavin, you know that's still being openly discussed, which is so crazy.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  That's why it's surreal. Did you see the Washington Post?
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  They came out with a concussion pathologist claiming.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  They don't just say it could be. They say he thinks Putin is with Trump poisoning Hillary.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  So we've gone from she's not sick to she's being poisoned. I'm going to skip this break.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  This is so important. So now Putin isn't just running all of us,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  magical unicorn creature that he is, but now he's poisoning Hillary.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  Remember when Alex Jones was nuts? Remember when Info Wars was considered fringe conspiracy theory stuff?
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Now you guys are the same ones and everyone else is nuts.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  I mean, I used to think that the government was too incompetent to come up with scams,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  but we're seeing every day really suspicious stuff.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  Like they're denying that she's sick as we watch her collapse.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  Well, here's another thing that used to be relegated to the fringes of society.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  Remember when she came out of Chelsea's apartment? Wasn't it curious that she was totally alone like that?
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  She had 20 feet of space around her.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  It was meant to make it like she was this goddess just randomly coming out
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  so the little girl from behind the police and Secret Service line could run up out of Wag the Dog.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  It was so staged, it was like Kim Jong-il or Un in North Korea.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  I am open to the possibility that it was a body double.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  And they have all of the bodyguards surrounding the real Hillary and they think,
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  well, she's disposable, she's just some woman from Missouri.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  A lot of presidents have used body doubles. I mean, you know, why not?
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  I mean, why is there no one around her right now? Isn't that odd?
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  I've never seen her with a 30-foot radius of nothing before.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  That's a good point. Why wouldn't you know exactly the Secret Service was supposed to be around her?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  She could be assassinated right now, God forbid.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  And by the way, there were people screaming at her that she was a liar and stuff while this happened.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  It is really unusual and I don't care what happens after November,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  but we have to keep at least a semblance of an election going so Trump can destroy her.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  I mean, it was sort of like a fight where someone was coming out of retirement to step in the ring
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  and all the fans of the Fit Boxer were saying,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  I can't wait to see him destroy this old codger.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  And now we're worried this guy isn't even going to make it into the ring.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Like Trump, it was going to be fun to watch.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  Oh, remember, he couldn't win anything. He wouldn't get a primary.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  We were all a joke a year and a half ago.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  I remember Thanksgiving with family.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  I mean, literally like 15 family members laughing at me at Thanksgiving
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  and I said, watch, he'll be the next president.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  Look at Ann Coulter on Bill Maher's show.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  She said out of all the potentials here, I think Trump is going to be the nominee.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  And the entire audience was hysterical laughing.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  If I had a nickel for every time someone calls me and says,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  oh, your boy Trump just screwed himself, the party's over, he's done.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  It must have happened at least 20 times.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Well, he's literally Hitler.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  In fact, I like that T-shirt.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Tell us about that, Gavin.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  Everyone you dislike is Hitler.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  And it's funny because now Hitler just means a guy.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  It's like the word racism.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  It used to mar you.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Now it just means nice.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  It's the least descriptive way.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And by the way, I agree with you.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  The problem is if you look at state-run media,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  the talking points go out, how they all do exactly what Hillary and the Democrats say,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  and how they want to persecute the alt-right, shut down the press.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  She says, quote, in a fundraising letter two weeks ago,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  that, quote, Breitbart and the alt-right have no right to exist.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  That is literal Nazi quotes that the Jews have no right to exist
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  or these Christian groups have no right to exist
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  or labor unions have no right to exist.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  That is Nazi terminology.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  So now I can't say literally Hitler, even when it's literally Hitler.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Yes.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  Well, I find it more Stalin-esque.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  Did you hear about this guy?
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  I think he works at the post office.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  He didn't want to watch a movie about LGBT awareness and tolerance
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  and how awesome gay people are.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  He said, I don't want to watch that.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  It's against my religion.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  It's not something I support.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  They said, you have to sit and watch it alone in a room.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Watch this video like Clockwork Orange.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  He refused.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  They sent him home for two days without pay.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  He comes back.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  They say, you have to watch this movie or you're fired.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  And you think maybe if this was a private organization,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  it was called Gay Blueberry Muffins,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  and it was exclusive to homosexuals.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Sure, exactly.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  I mean, if some group said, you've got to go watch daisies being picked,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  you're in a frickin' cult, man.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  I mean, another thing that's, it's like crazy.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  Well, they really are out to destroy Christianity.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  They're out to destroy America.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  Yeah, why is that?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  Why?
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  I mean, why is it?
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  I mean, what's going on here?
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  That's a good question.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  I mean, I, I think it could be as simple as daddy issues.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  My daddy is a Christian.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  He's a Catholic.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  I want to make Catholicism immoral and wrong and illegal.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  So I don't feel so bad about blowing 60 grand of his money,
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  taking philosophy of self in college for five years.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  But meanwhile, dad's already dead.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  They're like fighting a dad from 50 years ago.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  We've moved on.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  I see myself as the real liberal.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  And I see a bunch of authoritarian people obsessed with their,
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  you know, weird sexual practices running around that aren't even any fun.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  And I'm just like, your people are a bunch of cooks.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Well, that's the beauty of libertarianism in the information age.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  The truth just seeps out.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And we started an organization here at the show called the Proud Boys,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  where we simply state we are Western chauvinists who refuse to apologize
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  for creating the modern world.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  And we have these meetings where there's the last,
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  we just did one on September 11th, 50 guys show up.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  We take over the whole bar.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  We lock people out of our Proud Boys, cheer USA,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  read from Papua Canons, Death of the West.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  And you feel this tsunami of patriotism going on here,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  especially with young men, where they go,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  we tried being ashamed of ourselves.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  We tried this sort of sabotage society thing.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  And as you say, it's rebelling against the dead dad.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  I think I'm going to enjoy my greatness now.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  And that's what I love about Trump.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  He's not just saying, make America great again.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  He's saying, accept that we're great and enjoy it.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And I'll expand on that.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  I want to make America greater.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  So I've criticized problems.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  I've criticized the police.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  But it doesn't mean I want to kill the police.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  It doesn't mean I realize that we're falling.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  And so I want to make us great and successful and have a renaissance.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  It doesn't mean I hate America.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  And so I always kind of thought the left was misguided.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  But, you know, they just wanted to try to fix things.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  But I agree with you.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  And I had Michael Savage on yesterday, Dr. Savage.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  He said, no, it's true.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  And I would so many listeners call in and guess go,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  hey, that guy Gavin McGinnis, he's right on your show.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  They want to just blow it all up
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  because they can't compete with it.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  They hate themselves.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  They can't compete with real liberalism, real freedom, real renaissance.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  They've tried to steal the mantle of liberalism.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  And so they can't compete with it.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  They want to just blow everything up.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And I think they're starting to realize they chose the wrong team.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  They thought they were choosing the cool rebellious team.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And then they see Milo Yiannopoulos write dangerous faggot tour
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  on the side of his bus and go from college to college getting kicked out.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And then they go, when did I become the church lady?
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  I thought I was a rebel.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Now they're the ones that are saying screw you, authority.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  I want to be on that team and to watch them suffer
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  as they sit there with their rulebook going,
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  you know, I love to say that.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  You know, I'm allowed to do that.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  They're even cannibalizing themselves now.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  They're getting each other fired because they can't keep up with this crazy...
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  Sure, you're taking a bunch of weak nerds and people
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  that were always scared to be a bully and start a fight.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  But it wasn't that they weren't bullies, they were worse than bullies.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Now they've built a system for themselves to be bullies.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  But like you said, only their own people are within their system now
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  so they can only attack each other.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  They haven't successfully taken over everything so they're cannibalizing themselves.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  They want to be dominated too at the end of the day.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That's the weird thing about this.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  I don't think they really want Hillary.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I don't think they really wanted Bernie.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  They're like a spoiled brat who wanted to scream and cry.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  But then they're just sort of testing our boundaries.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  They want a time out, they want to be sent to their room.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  They don't really want to be in control.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  And we've seen what happens when they do get into control.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  It's like ISIS, it's like radical Islam.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  You say, okay, here's your own town.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Where are Burkas?
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  The next thing you know, they're caning some woman
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  because you can see her purple socks.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  And you realize, you guys don't want to be in control.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  You just want a bitch.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  They want to make their economy about bitching and whining and mental illness
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  instead of an economy of factories and rockets and life extension
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  and computer technology and going to the stars.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  I really feel like there's sort of this hysterical girlfriend going,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  go ahead, hit me, bitch.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  You think you can hit me?
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  You're not a man.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Hit me, bitch.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  And then I think the entire left just wants us to go pshh
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  by electing Trump.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  And they'll go, ooh, that kind of turned me on.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Well, I guess we're making America great again.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  That's all that moment where a woman tells you to slap them
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  and you're not going to do it.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  And they're very upset with you.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Now, maybe you give them what they want.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  The point is, is that we are living in a crazy time.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  We're going to break.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  What are some of the other big stories you want to cover?
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  I've got some clips.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I've got some news items I want to get into.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  But I just have this sense of victory and this sense that we're seeing
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  the decline of this mentally ill system that thought it could totally
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  program all of us and control us.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  And then they have jumped the proverbial, you know, big blue whale or shark.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  But how are they going to strike back?
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  I mean, they're not going to give up power.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  What are they going to do?
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  I mean, remember, I was a cook saying that they would try to steal the election.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Trump came out and seconded it.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  Then they came out and said, OK, we are federalizing the election.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  Yeah.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Well, I want to talk about the corruption that Hillary's behind.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  I mean, everyone says it's crazy conspiracy that people die around her.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And I say to those people, where's Obama's death toll?
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  Where's Trump's death toll?
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Where is Obama's chef?
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  He's making a sandwich.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Where's Trump's chef?
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  He's preparing some linguine.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Where are the bushes?
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  I never had any political repercussions from the bushes.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  When I was criticizing the Clintons 20 years ago, I got beat up in parking lots.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  I got sued.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  I got attacked.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I got fired.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  They told me the Clintons are sending a message.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Boom, your nose is broken.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  The Clintons chef is faced down in a river, found dead, drowned.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  I don't know how you end up at the bottom of a river when you're going on a camping trip.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  But that's one of many people that died on a camping trip.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  The guy who wrote why Hillary shouldn't be in the White House, died on the top of a mountain.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Just got shot.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  Psu!
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  They call that a suicide.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  And I think it's interesting that we're seeing all these people pleading the fifth for Hillary's emails and refusing to show up to court.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Because look at Whitewater.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  What happened there?
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  Vince Foster killed himself by shooting himself in the mouth.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  What?
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  The top investigator jumped off his balcony from his apartment and killed himself.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Yeah, McGannis.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  Let's talk about it straight ahead.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  And this is the Renaissance.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  Call it whatever name you want.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  We want freedom.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  We want free association.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  We want it all.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  We want it now.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  And we're going to use whatever words we want.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  A British special forces sharpshooter in Syria just killed a top ISIS executioner in 3G Hotties with a single bullet over a mile away.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  Doing so just seconds before the terrorist and his friends were going to burn 12 hostages alive with a flamethrower.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  The unidentified ISIS leader was said to be on the US most kill list for several months and is known in Syria for being one of the most sadistic ISIS leaders.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  It was he this week that was sent into a fireball by a British marksman who struck a fuel tank affixed to the leader's back.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is busy on the campaign trail here in the States.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  The official mention of the mess made in Syria and never acknowledges that ISIS terrorists have built a substantial arsenal including US made weapons obtained from the Iraqi army and Syrian opposition groups.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  Groups that the US State Department armed.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  No official US policy or even acknowledgement that we've armed these groups and no plan in place to make sure our rogue foreign policies stop arming future enemies.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  Here's how reporting for info wars dot com.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products.

[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  Brain force.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  It's completely different.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  Rob do joins us.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  Tell us what brain force did.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  I've been working all day.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  I get in here at 830.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  I was kind of run down.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  I got my bottle of brain force right there.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  Pop two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  Got four and a half stars.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  People really love it.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Read about it.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  This hour is brought to you by SuperMailVitality.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  We just take a whole bunch of known organic herbs, super concentrate them, cold press them and put them out.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And you can't lose your support in the tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  This stuff has dramatic effects for myself personally.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  Big third party supplement nutraceutical sites give it five delicious stars because it is cold pressed and nobody else is doing this.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  It is super concentrated, 20% off SuperMailVitality.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I quit working out for about a decade.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Then I started working out real hard and couldn't lose weight.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  But as soon as I got on SuperMailVitality and Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, it totally changed my physiology in over three years.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Everybody's seen it.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  I lost 70, 80 pounds overall of fat, but gained muscle.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  I mean, this stuff is amazing.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  In fact, I just finished a bottle in the last couple of weeks here.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  I take a little more than what is recommended on the dosage.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  I used to only take half of what you're supposed to take whenever it comes to tolerance.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  I noticed my SuperMail's gone, so they're running off to get me some right now from the warehouse.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  Get yours at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  And we have SuperFemalVitality.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  It's pretty much the same formula that has a few other herbs in it.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  Works just, I personally like female vitality just even better.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  Has a little bit more of a vitality kick to it.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  I'll just take it a few days, see what happens in the morning.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  See if Papa Dragon isn't lying to you.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  No, I'm telling you the truth, folks.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  We're extending one more day and then it's over.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  The high-quality, storeable foods, special with all the craziness going on out there.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  A man needs to be prepared.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Your family needs to be self-sufficient.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Firearms, combat training, water filtration, high-quality, storeable foods.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  The very best.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  At the regular price, it's a great deal.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  30%, 40% off.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  We'll end today, I promise you.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Tomorrow it's gone.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  M4warStore.com.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  M4warSelect.com.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  M4war's main site is M4warStore.com.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  But you can go to M4warSelect.com for the storeable foods.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  M4warIsLive.com for the nutraceuticals.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  So it's all available there.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  You have built this organization.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  We have changed the entire media landscape.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  More and more media outlets are going to direct sales to fund their operations instead of advertising.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  That way you can contain it.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  You, the broadcaster, are responsible for what you're selling.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  It's a win-win.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  They hear ads on local stations and networks.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  I can't vouch for them.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  I'm sure a lot of them are great.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  But when you hear me endorse a product, I use it.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  I believe in it.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  So thousands and thousands of great products at M4warStore.com.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  Now, going back to Gavin McGinnis, the founder of Vice Media,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  syndicated radio talk show host, has his own popular program that comes on
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  right before mine every single day.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  But I have folks on from his network that are on during me.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  I don't care.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I'm on a full-out war here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  I just care about defeating the New World Order.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  But compoundmedia.com, finding me on Twitter at Gavin underscore McGinnis, M-C-I-N-N-E-S.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Okay, Gavin, you've got the floor.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  I want you to roll here.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  What do you expect to come?
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  What do you expect to see in this election?
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  The energy level is rising.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Again, they're claiming Putin is basically even sucking air into our lungs.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  We're not breathing on our own accord.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  We are zombies of Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  Where is this new McCarthyism going?
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  I mean, it really does seem like they are self-immolating right now in the controlled left.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  Well, what's unique about this election is we've never had more access to information.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  We've never had people more curious about things.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  And it's so easy to look up.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  Like, I'm sorry to be pedantic about this, but I'm obsessed with these mysterious deaths around Hillary.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  And Whitewater is a great introduction to this, where you have the investigator die.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  You have Vince Foster die.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  You have Susan McDougal.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  It's all about a shady real estate deal where Susan McDougal got a loan that Bill Clinton forced her to get.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  She was forced to get this loan, I believe.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Jim McDougal, her husband, dies while in prison.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  The only person that survives is Susan McDougal herself.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  And that's because she refuses to say a word.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  So she does, I think, a year and a half or so for contempt of court.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  And then when she gets out, Bill Clinton pardons her.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Now, what are we seeing right now with Hillary's emails?
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  We're seeing everyone go the Susan McDougal route.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  It seems to be the only way to live when you're up against the Clinton mafia.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  So they're all saying, I'm not saying a word.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Fine, I'll go to jail.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  I know I'll get pardoned by President Hillary when I get out.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  So they're just, they're absolving themselves from the risk.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  And that's because they see a pattern there.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  I mean, what used to be esoteric conspiracy stuff now has all these things you can look up.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And I wrote about it recently on tackymag.com.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  And I said, don't take my word for it.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  Go look it up.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Just choose a random name on the list of, I believe the list is about 70.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Just take a random name from that list and look it up.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  And then, by the way, as we said earlier,
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  compare that list to other presidential candidates list.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  You'll see nothing.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  George Bush has, what, three people died around him?
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  What else is on your radar screen?
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  What else is on my radar screen?
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Well, obviously Hillary's sickness is huge.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  And I think that what I'm really noticing about Trump is that he waited patiently for this.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  Remember, he even acted like, he's like a boxer just biding his time.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  He said, I'm out.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  You know what, if I don't win the election, at least I had a good time.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  You know, I'm doing fine in the workforce.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  So he almost threatened to quit a long time, about two months ago.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  So we all got nervous.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Wait, what's going on?
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  He's always five steps ahead.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  And I think the only thing that's thwarting his brilliant chess moves is the opponent,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  the opposite chess player, is already teetering.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  He's not ready for the knockout.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  He wants the knockout to happen in late October.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  But right now, it looks like she's just going to faint on her own.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  I agree.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  They're openly talking about suspending the election or moving it.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  What do we do about that?
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  I mean, there's got to be rights in the streets.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  If there's rights on the streets for a fake story about a guy having his hands up,
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  there's got to be rights in the streets when the president declares illegally a state of emergency
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  and postpones an election.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  I mean, the left are such gullible pawns that you can create a universe where cops are hunting down black kids.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  And where the Trumps are hunting down a source.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  Where the Trumps are hunting down dinosaurs.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  And not only do people take it, but they start to retaliate.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  I mean, you think you'd Google something before you take to the streets and risk your life on a vigilante quest
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  to even the score when you're not even sure what the score was.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  We just had two cops.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  Did we just have two cops run over by someone?
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Was that in fiat?
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Sure, it's happening all the time.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  So Gavin, expanding on this, clearly even if they still the election, they lose politically.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  I mean, they're done.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  They're bleeding out.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Where do you see this going now in the post-democratic party?
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Kleptocrat, control freak, mind control, Jim Jones, party of controlling language.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  I mean, this thing is falling apart.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Where do you see it going?
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  It's done.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  You always listen to that zombie song, This Will Be Our Year.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  This is our year.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  They're done.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  The word racism doesn't mean anything anymore.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  All this calling everyone Hitler doesn't mean anything anymore.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  We know that the cops aren't randomly shooting black people.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  So after Trump gets elected and they come to us and say, this is a safe space.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  This is a trigger-free zone.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  We just laugh in their face.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  And I always said this with the chocketing.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Remember the chocketing when they were writing Trump with chalk everywhere?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  That was the general sort of populist thing.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  We're not taking this anymore.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  We're not taking you seriously anymore.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  We've had enough of the church ladies.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  And I think it's a great time to be alive.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  It's a great time to be into the truth because it's sitting right there for us.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  They've finally been exposed for all their lives.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  We tried it their way.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  It doesn't work.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  And I really believe that 2017 is the year that we make America great again.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  It's going to be fun.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  Well, I want to expand on that because it really is true that I see in some of the radical, you know, religious people that don't really love God.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  They want to say, you're bad.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  They have God's answers.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  They're judging you.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  It's that very same like super extreme Bible thumping that's so repulsive, but it's like leftist Bible thumping.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  It's even sicker.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  I call them the new Victorians.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  I mean, look at the way they talk about sex.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  It sounds like Victorian England.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  You have to put your hand here.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Then you need permission for that.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  As we were saying earlier about how liberals don't want their own utopia.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  Women don't want to have sex like that.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  They don't want you to put your hand on their knee and say, is this okay?
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  Are you enjoying this yet?
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  You just ruined the whole fun of the thing.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And the fact that these guys got into sex, they got into comedy and they started enforcing their puritanism means that they're done because they started hitting Americans where it counts.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  And I'm not talking about their wallet.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  I'm talking about their funny bone, their genitalia.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  As soon as you start ruining sex and comedy, they've already ruined food with all their rules about gluten.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  And Americans, even ones who aren't interested in politics, go, so wait, what is this now?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  You're telling me I can't even have a good laugh and have sex with my girlfriend?
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Screw you.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  I'm screwing her.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  It is true.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  I mean, it's a cult of eugenics.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  It wants to control biology.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  So it thought I could move that into a political cosmology, but everyone's rejecting it.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  How do you expect them to then try to counter strike against this?
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  Well, it's going to be a complete meltdown and we see this.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  We see this on college campus when Milo's doing his tour.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  The young girls, the feminists who realize that they're going to lose and he's going to do his talk anyway,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  they have these conniptions where they start screaming and fainting and screaming at the ground.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  I mean, they go, no, it's horrible.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  I'm scared.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Please.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  I can't even do it as bad as they do.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  I mean, it's five times worse.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  Help me.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  I'm scared.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  He's talking.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  I mean, these are mental patients.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  You've been doing that for years and it used to be an exaggeration.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  Now you're understating it.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  In fact, will you please do an imitation for us?
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Go ahead and try it.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  Okay.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  They go like this.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  And it's directed at the ground too.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  It's not directed at a person.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  It's just we had reporters there covering six guys in Oregon State who were five of them were Hispanic.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  We're in Trump outfits.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  They shut down the reading room and when the teacher monitor announces she's in charge and no one listens,
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  she starts going, I'm scared.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  No.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  I mean, this is hilarious.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  What the hell, man?
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  They've never had confrontation because they've never had a job.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  If you clean pools, you're going to have that one jerk who doesn't pay his bills and you got to deal with him
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  and you got to go in on a Friday.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Oh my God, the jobs I've had where people get in your face and treat like crap, is this crazy?
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  One in 12 is a nightmare.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  And if you're an entrepreneur, by the way, one in 12 businesses are successful.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  The other are failures.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  And these kids have had illegal aliens doing their jobs their whole lives.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  So when they get out into the real world, they have been incapacitated and they have a meltdown.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  And this is just one of the many great things about Trump.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  As we slowly push the illegals back using attrition and they go back with their tails between their legs,
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  we're going to start having teenagers doing jobs again.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  But excuse me, you're an effing white male.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  You're not allowed to speak.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  Once teenagers work again, everything is going to be right with the world
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  because they'll grow up to be normal entrepreneurs.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Right now, we have these coddled kids that are growing up to hate entrepreneurs.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  They say, you didn't build that.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  You got rich off of your daddy or the government made you rich.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  No, idiot. I lost a fortune making this fortune.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  Over and over again.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Over and there's so much abuse.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  Listen, at least two thirds of new things I launched failed.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  But I always went with something new and I just don't get people that just like sit there bitching all day.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  It's crazy.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  Two thirds of the world's billionaires got there on their own accord.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  You look at the top fortunes, top 500, two thirds of them were bootstrap billionaires.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  But we have this horrible mentality. Even when I'm watching shows with the kids, my kids,
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  everything is, oh, he wanted money and he was evil and they wanted to do a commercial and money is evil.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  And you just think, stop brainwashing our kids to think money is wrong.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  But we all, the leftists, want all our money and increase taxes, though.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  They keep going on Kickstarter and starting charities because they can't make their own money.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  Money is evil in Russia. Money is evil in China.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Because if you got it, you stole it. Here in the free market, if you're rich, odds are you worked your ass off.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  It means you created something new and people came to it.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  So Gavin McDonough, let me ask you this question.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  In a world where the average liberal thinks triceratops are being killed by Donald Trump Jr.,
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  is there any hope for them or we just triage them and cut them off and then just like they kind of wander around like,
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  you know, everybody's got kind of the lobotomized schizophrenic in their neighborhood that kind of just wanders around.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  I mean, how do we handle these people?
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  Most people are apolitical. I wish they wouldn't go to the polls.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  I mean, Obama became president out of spite by disgruntled spinsters.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  Mostly Cougars, angry women voted for him out of spite and they're the ones who put the election over the edge.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  Romney would have won if we had the demographics, the voting demographics we had for Reagan.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  But we had these people forcing themselves into politics.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  The same way we have women forcing themselves into the workforce, pretending that they hate the kitchen, pretending they don't want to be housewives,
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  pretending they don't want to be taken care of.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  It's all these fakes, these phonies, pretending they care about politics and the Trump kids.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  You don't care. You don't even know what a triceratops is.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  So stop getting involved.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I know, it's a racist, but expanding.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  Listen, I agree with you. The Democrats are horrible.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  Our big problem is the Republican Party's been just basically like them corrupt, run by the same special interest.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Trump has overthrown that with the populist movement. That's why the Republican establishment is against him.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  But what do we do about a Republican establishment that will pretty much just go along with so much of this?
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  There's two worlds with your question, right?
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  There's Trump winning and there's Trump not winning.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  If Trump wins, Guy Fox just got into the White House.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  He's lighting up the dynamite kaboom.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  It's a reboot on the whole system.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  It's a reboot on the control the lobbyists have.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  It's a reboot on all these earmarks.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  All these favors, they know it. They know they're out of a job. That's why they hit it.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  They got a big fat dossier on Trump and know that he's been listening to certain shows every day for 10 years.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Right. Hillary Clinton is mentioning you now.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  Yeah, the monocle Republicans know that their days are numbered and that is heaven.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  Now, if Trump doesn't win and we're stuck with Hillary, what do we do?
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Well, we keep fighting. We keep doing shows like this.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  We keep getting the truth out. We keep spreading it.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  I agree. Isn't it almost a bigger victory if they steal it and put her in because then they'll screw things up so bad?
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  The victory against it will be 50 times bigger.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  I'm almost worried Trump gets in. They blame all the collapse that's already ongoing on him,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  but it won't matter because his supporters understand that and aren't dumb.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  Yeah. I mean, Canada elected a guy with Down syndrome, Justin Trudeau.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  He's still, they still don't realize the mess they've made.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  They still watch the dollar plummet and blame it on other things.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  They still see terrorism happen on their soil.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Two people killed in one week and they say, no, it's nothing to do with the liberal system that we've brought upon ourselves with the CBC.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  I don't know how long it will take them to wake up, but the beauty of our crusade is we're telling the truth and lies run sprints.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  We'll run the marathon. And I think that it's inevitable that people come on board.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  Since even starting these proud boys thing, I can't tell you how many millennials,
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  how many children of single mothers have come up to me, including housewives too.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Housewives come up and go, you know, I grew up in a world where the family meant nothing and I always suspected it was wrong.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  And the fact that you were out there venerating the entrepreneur, venerating the housewife is making me realize I was being lied to all these years.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  I mean, in a way it's always-
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  And the truth is she's just trying to pick up a guy that actually got something going on.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  Exactly. It's sort of like selling pot in college.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  All of these trendies who can't pick women up and a guy that's libertarian and conservative can't beat them off of the stick.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  And these guys are such losers, they double down on this liberal BS and the women run from them.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Or it's crazy, man.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Women love anyone who's libertarian, conservative, anyone who has the balls to fight because it's a cave thing.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  They know that if they have young people, if they have babies in the cave, you need someone out there with a flaming stick.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  And that's who we are. You're out there with your flaming stick beating back the hounds, beating back the woolly mammoths that the Trump kids don't kill.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  And that is the future of America, no matter who gets elected.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  Now, wait a minute. I saw it on the Internet. You're saying they didn't kill triceratops or woolly mammoths?
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  They killed some triceratops. They're still running through the streets. They're still out there.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  I got a photo of me out there actually with a woolly mammoth.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  Are you prepared to bug out? Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  How is this even possible? Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing in the past.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  But you must act fast. Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com. That's greens75.com. Greens75.com.

[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.980]  mind. I feel sorry for the people but I can't help it it's still ridiculous how
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:37.880]  dumb they are because they're always pseudo-intellectual they always think
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.960]  they're smarter than you and really they're just idiots that were raised on
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.800]  TV that never lived out in the real world like Evan McGinnis was just saying
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.880]  earlier but here's the bottom line it's a bunch of technocrats that want to have
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.960]  driverless cars that want to have a nanny state where you can't quote do
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.960]  anything dangerous so that you can quote be controlled and dominated they
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:03.080]  have a plan and so sure their current political systems being rejected
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.200]  worldwide nationalism populism is rising free market ism is rising the mail is
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.000]  returning to a certain extent but don't count the globalist out they're still
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  pushing hard but I gotta tell you it's very positive to see hackers across the
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.560]  world battling against Hillary to see real liberals like Julian Assange coming
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.760]  out valiantly and exposing them I mean the world has really spoken Gavin
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:33.560]  McGinnis against this this system yep you know one thing I think that that a
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:38.520]  problem with our side is is anonymity we're so scared of losing our jobs we're
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.720]  so scared of speaking out we go to a dinner party we know here in New York
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:46.080]  City you're gonna be the only Trump supporter at the table and you just
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.760]  quietly sit there and chew your food and see and I think that's really unhealthy
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:54.560]  the thing I hate about that is now the thought police don't even have to show
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:59.560]  up because you're on autopilot you're censoring yourself on your own time so
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:05.200]  what I say to these people is go out there get fired safety last don't wear a
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.160]  bicycle helmet say whatever is on your mind at all times don't I don't care who
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.120]  records it who does immediate safety loses the overall war you only lose by
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.240]  trying to stay safe I found you go out these people are all in their own zombie
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.240]  land it'll start admitting to you that they actually agree with you in most
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.640]  cases yeah it's not healthy it's morally wrong it sits there and it's
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.680]  stews inside you're probably giving yourself cancer by holding this in now
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.440]  there's ways to do it you got to show adrenaline control and not get into ad
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.760]  hominem attacks I like to keep it interrogative here in New York and say
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.880]  well did Trump actually say that or did he just say a disproportionate number of
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:48.760]  Mexicans who cross the border tend to be rapist and the secret here is we're not
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.480]  trying to segregate ourselves from everyone else we're trying to spread the
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.080]  truth and I think a big part of that is engaging the Democrats now admit at
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.920]  colleges and stuff they're promoting actual segregation exactly I I mean I
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.960]  start selling Glenn Beck when I say this but I am into inclusion I want
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.840]  everyone together on this every race every religion every sexual preference
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.200]  every gender I want them to be on board with us and accept the fact that hey you
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.520]  are smart enough you're good enough to do it on your own you don't need the
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.960]  government you don't need something competent bureaucrat with no incentive
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.640]  telling you how to live your life who has no idea your background where you're
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.400]  at exactly I mean I hardly don't want to run my life certainly not some faceless
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.040]  bureaucrat in closing Gavin I want your prediction I'm putting you on the spot
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:41.360]  Trump does he win does he lose do they steal it your prediction in 54 days what
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:47.320]  happens Trump wins we are literally dancing in the street like Muslims on
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.040]  9-11 we can't believe how lucky we are there is hysterical backlash
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:56.160]  a la Maggie Thatcher when she liberated England from their classism and gave them
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:59.680]  a middle class there's gonna be a lot of blaming going on and eventually the
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.560]  left maybe a year in we'll realize that we were right in choosing Trump and
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.800]  America focused on what it's best at and that is liberty prosperity and
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.240]  freedom innovation true liberalism true liberalism yeah we get that word back
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.320]  all right well as we keep the Republicans honest and take that party
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:21.520]  fully over and then have a real challenge with libertarian liberals
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.240]  coming on the Democratic Party yes it could happen it's gonna be it's gonna
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.720]  be a massive cleanup we'll reboot it and we'll update to America 2.0 that's

[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:10.360]  obesity diabetes cancer heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant

[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:18.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:21.400]  well he's an independent reporter for many years we've been talking to him for
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:25.720]  more than 14 years he's markdice of markdice.com best-selling author find
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.600]  his books at markdice.com I want him this short segment played part of the
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:36.440]  video that's up on info wars.com of concerned Americans in San Diego which
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:40.760]  is a more conservative area in in LA most of the people are actually unable to
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:46.760]  even really talk or find their ass with both hands I'm not joking we don't take
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.120]  pleasure in how dumb down they are we actually are trying to expose this so
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:54.800]  we can have a national debate about it now Austin's a little bit better our
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:59.840]  liberals only nine out of ten say put gun owners in forced labor camps only
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.360]  nine out of ten believe that that hydrogen monoxide should be banned or that
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:09.080]  you know the trumps are killing dinosaurs but they really believe woolly
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.600]  mammoth saber-tooth tigers I guess stegosaurus and triceratops that have
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.520]  been dead for millions of years are being killed by the trumps they show
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.240]  folks a document cam shot of a photoshop that was circulating the web and
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:27.800]  they're very very upset about this so we've got him coming up in the
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:33.680]  next segment but let's play a few minutes of him talking to people that
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.480]  are very concerned and actually have the proper politically correct fashionable
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:44.240]  answers to why it's wrong to be killing dinosaurs that no living human has ever
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:51.040]  seen here it is see that incredible stegosaurus see that you might have seen
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:56.560]  the Donald Trump kids are big hunters they go on trips just for fun and fill
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.400]  these poor animals so now just getting people's reactions to Donald Trump's
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:11.360]  kids now killing the triceratops in Africa yeah honestly my opinion is I
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:16.400]  think they're just getting away with a lot for the simple fact that they're
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.160]  Donald Trump's children would an ordinary person be able to get away with
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.360]  killing a triceratops or is the Donald Trump's kids just being able to get away
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.640]  with that because they're Donald Trump's kids I think they're getting away with
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:33.760]  it because they're Donald Trump's kids and I think anybody else would just get
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.360]  in trouble and they're honestly just I don't know with animal rights activists
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:42.280]  yeah they'll they'll pay a fine for it and they'll they'll serve their time in
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.160]  jail and for killing the triceratops I think they're the endangered species in
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:51.600]  some countries so it makes it even worse mm-hmm yeah but I agree all right
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.880]  thank you very much triceratops is on the endangered species list now Donald
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:03.880]  Trump Jr. a big game hunter just killed triceratops and posted a picture posing
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:10.120]  with the dead animals body is that inappropriate is that the wrong thing
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.720]  to be doing I mean yeah definitely that's very appropriate I mean that's
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.760]  the bad example obviously to to give to people around especially for the
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:24.720]  president and your kids are out shooting triceratops and animals should we allow
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:32.800]  a president whose children are hunting triceratops to be in the White House
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:39.520]  that's not the trophy hunt things like lions and tigers and things like that
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.960]  and now the the Trump kids have killed a pterodactyl in their latest hunting
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:49.080]  expedition just getting people's comments on this is that isn't
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.960]  appropriate for them to be trophy hunting those things just for fun when
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:58.240]  it's not for meat I personally wish that people wouldn't do it but at the end
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.040]  of the day if there's a right to do it and there's a service that doesn't
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.920]  literally get a permit to hunt the pterodactyls I guess I don't approve of
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.000]  it I don't like it but if they can get a permit they can do it legally I guess
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.920]  how the hell can these people not want to do it a pterodactyl
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:17.200]  Donald Trump's kids John Jr. and Eric Trump are big hunters and they just
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.680]  killed a saber-toothed tiger okay a lot of animal people a lot of liberals are
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.680]  upset about that do you think that was wrong to kill the saber-toothed tiger
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.720]  I I think yeah it was probably because it's it's not a sustainable animal yeah
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:37.800]  it's pretty rare yeah and it would end the you know what's the word for it
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:44.000]  they're endangered endangered species this is serious broadcast we've got
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.600]  pterodactyls we've got woolly mammoths we've got stegosaurus is under attack the
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:53.200]  Trump children have a time machine they're going back in time and there we
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.720]  finally found what is taking the dinosaurs it was Donald J. Trump Jr.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:05.280]  every four years the American Society of Civil Engineers gives the US
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:09.040]  infrastructure a report card this report card depicts the condition and
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:12.880]  performance of America's infrastructure assigning a letter grade based on the
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.040]  physical condition of our most basic structures America's infrastructure GPA
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:21.360]  this year is a D-plus in other words barely passing nothing reflects this
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.760]  rating more so than what happened to one Chicago metro rider she's recovering at
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:29.000]  home after she was hit in the head by falling debris at Union Station
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.240]  literally cracking her skull the accident highlights a severe problem and she
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:36.640]  wants other metro riders to be aware what happened to her it was several
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.360]  pounds of concrete in fact falling from a ceiling another rider who writes for
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:44.320]  the Chicago Sun Times said what really bothered me is that Amtrak wouldn't say
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:48.360]  how often this happens three tracks were shut down for repairs to be made so that
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:52.880]  normal train operations can resume and other words keeping that D rating intact
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:56.400]  this puts millions of American lives at risk every day who depend on these

[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:32.680]  a few months ago my buddy cube out of my ranch in these Texas we were hunting
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:39.280]  velociraptors I mean I took two down I had a tag for three one of them I kind
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:45.400]  of wounded but it but it got away and I just don't get the criticism that we've
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.960]  seen out there of Donald J. Trump Jr. and Eric Trump for big game hunting in
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.120]  fact if you're a TV viewer you can see this video liberals outraged after
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:00.120]  Trump kills triceratops and a pterodactyl and so mark dice went out he
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.520]  doesn't edit these videos other than to cut them down this is who he talked to
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:08.600]  everybody you talked to in San Diego black white Hispanic old young they all
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.960]  believe that triceratops still live pterodactyl still live the loss of
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.600]  raptor still live I obviously did not kill a velociraptor two weeks ago it's
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.480]  been reportedly extinct for 25 million years whether you believe in that time
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.880]  frame or not point is we don't see these things running around so I'm gonna
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.040]  finish up a clip of this just to illustrate what do you do with people
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:35.200]  this dumb down as we go out at 9 out of 10 people say yeah I say Obama wants to
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:42.040]  ban the harmful chemical or just the chemical or the compound by hydrogen
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:47.800]  monoxide or sodium chloride by hydrogen monoxide's water and of course sodium
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:51.280]  chloride's table saw and almost everyone says oh yeah I want to ban it including
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:55.000]  one guy hitting on McAdoo goes yeah I've got a chemistry degree from Cornell
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.800]  baby so it's like what happened to their brains because they couldn't get you
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.680]  know yeah in a hundred years playing Jeopardy they couldn't win one round who
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.360]  are these people are these the inheritance of the world now we're gonna
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.320]  talk Hillary in the latest emails and all the big stuff that's coming out it's
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:19.120]  huge one of our stories is a top story on drugreport.com the new emails of
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.480]  former Secretary of State Colin Powell where he's talking about how sick Hillary
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:26.040]  is a year ago with Democratic donors we're gonna cover the waterfront but
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:29.640]  finish up before we go to Mark Dice here's a little bit more folks is a
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.080]  maybe something 25 million years old you can you can get it wrong with
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.400]  triceratopsis even though that's the thing that everybody like age three knows
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:40.160]  what triceratopsis it's the three big dinosaurs the stegosaurus the tyrannosaurus
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:43.200]  means terrible lizard in Latin I even know that and then of course the
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.720]  triceratops which means three horned but no then we get into a woolly mammoth
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:55.000]  gone for a hundred thousand years then we get into a sabertooth big cats so
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.840]  let's go ahead and finish up the club. We're just getting people's reactions now
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.920]  Donald Trump's children are posting photos of them now they had killed a
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:10.280]  woolly mammoth on a hunting expedition just for a trophy to mount the head in
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:15.040]  their Manhattan apartment just getting people's reactions so that Trump kids
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:21.160]  now killing a woolly mammoth. I think it's awful that they're doing that and
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.400]  just thinking that it's okay just because they have lots of money that they
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:32.360]  can throw it away by you know taking part in these things whereas I don't think
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:38.960]  it's okay that they're doing that. Now Donald Trump's kids Eric and Donald
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:45.240]  Jr. have killed a sabertooth tiger just for fun you may have seen the photos
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:51.400]  going around social media just getting people's comments on that. Yeah I don't
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.520]  think it's I don't think it's a right move I mean a sabertooth tiger is a
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.760]  beautiful animal and I mean I'm sure it's an endangered species it's pretty
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.160]  rare if you want to like you know go hunt something or kill something why don't
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.680]  you go fish or something you know what I mean or I mean I don't know I don't
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.400]  believe killing anything's right personally especially a sabertooth tiger yeah
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.080]  that's so rare I mean the only reason they're doing is because they have the
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.360]  money to do it and you know I guess and that's what these rich people do for
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:24.720]  yeah they go and kill these sabertooth tigers and woolly mammoths and even I
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.280]  think a pterodactyl they they had killed once too yeah I think I think it's
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:32.560]  inappropriate and you know we'll see what happens. If I may have saw on social
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:38.400]  media today Donald Trump's kids are big hunters they go in Africa and hunts
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:43.440]  exotic animals. Okay. Now Donald Trump's kids have shot and killed a woolly
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:50.640]  mammoth. A lot of people are outraged, just getting people's comments on. You have a
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.120]  nice attractive probably 30 year old woman wearing a lingerie and a leather jacket
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:59.920]  walking around beautiful beach this great heaven of a free market society. I
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.760]  guarantee if she wants my guns I guarantee if she thinks I'm a racist I
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.240]  guarantee if she's living in this la la land heaven compared to North Korea and
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:13.280]  she's worried about dinosaurs that Trumps are killing. So I don't hate this
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.800]  woman I don't call her deplorable but what do you do with the magnitude we're
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:23.920]  dealing with of idiocy. Let's finish up with a Mark Dice. Donald Trump Jr. and
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:31.080]  Eric Trump killing this woolly mammoth just as a trophy for fun. Well I honestly
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.520]  think it's wrong first of all mainly because okay if you are gonna be the
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:42.280]  the future president and you're trying to put an example to the world humanity
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:47.880]  is so evolved in only focusing on the materialistic things that we're living
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.880]  nowadays. And you shouldn't be hunting woolly mammoths. So materialistic. Of course not.
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:57.320]  So transcendent. Okay that's enough I'm gonna go to Mark Dice. It's just we're
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:01.920]  illustrating this not to make fun of them but to understand they tell these
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:06.720]  folks that Donald Trump's a racist. They tell these people that Donald Trump is
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.080]  supporting ISIS when Hillary created it and they're so uninformed they believe
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.600]  it and that's the genius of what Mark Dice does and what J walking dead what we
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:21.400]  do is to illustrate this horror. What's scary is Mark you don't have to even go
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:24.320]  out all day to find these people. This is who you interviewed. I mean I mean I
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.960]  know your methodology it's ours as well when you have people that know what a
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:33.160]  triceratops is you'll show it. What planet are we living on? And those are
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:36.520]  only about half the people that you saw. I try to keep the videos about three
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.480]  minutes because it helps with the ratings. A lot of times people shut a
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.480]  video off after three or four minutes. Sure. So you're saying you had even more
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.480]  that didn't know what a triceratops was. I always have more in the weekly man on
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.080]  the street Monday segments. Yes and the reason I got this idea is because a
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:53.560]  couple years ago there was a story going around somebody posted a photo of
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:57.520]  Steven Spielberg sitting with an animatronic triceratops from the
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.480]  original Jurassic Park and they joked and they said hey you know Steven Spielberg
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.640]  has you know killed this this poor animal and it started being spread around
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:09.880]  Facebook and there were a lot of people it made national headlines that people
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.000]  were outraged about you know some supposed hunter they didn't even know
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.400]  who Steven Spielberg was they saw a photo of what looked to be a dead triceratops
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:21.040]  and a guy sitting there in front of it they thought he that he had killed it so
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:25.520]  I decided again let's go and test this as we've been doing here on my YouTube
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:30.400]  channel for I don't know 10 years I mean weekly for for three years and this is
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.320]  the level of insanity and sometimes the video is a little redundant because I
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.240]  want to make sure folks you're not just picking and choosing here this is
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.240]  California southern California is a very special animal I think we're one of the
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:47.440]  sources one of the centers that's the only place Dahmer than Austin now I
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.080]  wanted to make clear the videos can be a little redundant because I want to
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:55.160]  make sure that people know that there's no deceptive editing where I want you to
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:59.880]  see that I'm asking them the question I'm getting their full comments easily I
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.120]  could cut and splice people answering different questions for different things
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:07.600]  and it would be dishonest I want people to see these are the people these are
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.960]  the questions I mentioned you can hear it three times for most of these I try to
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.480]  repeat myself three times again yeah it's terrible that the you know the
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:19.360]  triceratops they're killing it's this is amazing you should go next level though
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.480]  next time and then confront them and go but I don't be longer video and say you
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:26.360]  know that's a dinosaur that's sorry folks I said 25 million years ago that's
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.080]  when the dinosaurs ended supposedly with the comment or whatever they think the
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.520]  triceratops was 68 million years ago so excuse me but we'll put it back on
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.320]  screen for TV viewers and I'll give folks a definition of a triceratops and that
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:46.920]  entire family but 68 million years ago triceratops is a genus of a herbivore
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.840]  sarstapod if I could read that from distance dinosaur the first appeared
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:57.880]  during the stage of the late Cretaceous period 68 million years ago in what is
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:04.120]  now North America it is one of the last known avant-dinosaur genre and became
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:10.240]  extinct the Cretaceous extinction 66 million years ago and it just goes on
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:14.560]  from there I mean what the hell is wrong with these people well I'll tell you a
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.400]  couple weeks ago I did a segment where I asked people what city Donald Trump is
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:23.200]  from what cities he best known for where does he live I mean hardly anybody
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:27.320]  knew Alex and we target millennials we target people under 30 it's a college
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:33.720]  town and he also talks to 56 year olds that these people who hate Donald Trump
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:38.320]  we think he's a racist they don't even know what city he's best known for being
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:42.520]  associated with I mean as a kid who grew up in the 80s I knew probably when I
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:46.800]  was seven or eight years old and Donald Trump is a rich guy from New York City
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.800]  he does has something to do with real estate they have no idea what region of
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.240]  the country he lives at don't know they don't even know that really one of the
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:59.440]  most famous if not the most famous New Yorker they don't even know that he's
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:03.800]  from New York he's probably the most famous New Yorker hands down yeah they know nothing
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:06.640]  about him and you know a lot of the stuff that we've talked about over the
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.760]  last ten ten years that you've been covering for probably 20 and that was
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:14.040]  laughed at you know you and Gavin McGinnis were talking about this it was
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:19.280]  laughed at ridiculed and now people are finally taking it serious or the
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.680]  establishment is trying to hijack it and spin it now instead of the
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.080]  establishment hacking the elections which you were warning about back in 2004
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:31.280]  or many others now they're just trying to blame the Russians like the idea now
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.320]  they say okay the election will be staged but Putin's running it and Putin
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:40.280]  has poisoned Hillary that's the Washington Post talk about conspiracy
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:45.240]  theorists even Jimmy Kimmel as is admitting that the conspiracy theories
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:48.920]  about Hillary's health are true the mainstream media is eating crow because
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:52.320]  it's so undeniable and if that's my next question they're collapse
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:57.160]  and credibility where do they go from here I don't even know it's a really
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.920]  exciting time to be alive and it's we're on the verge of either a complete
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:06.440]  renaissance or finally plunging off the cliff because if Hillary wins Hollywood
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:12.800]  often sets the society agenda sets the moral agenda but Washington backs it
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.960]  legally and so we're gonna have if Hillary wins we're gonna have the backing
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:22.200]  of the Justice Department to promote all of this complete insanity about
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:26.120]  the transgender bathroom and their piss they know they're losing it's gonna be
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:30.720]  vengeance and we're seeing every day now as we're in the final stretch of the
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:35.600]  election here in the final 50 some days it's getting so dirty the dirty tricks
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.560]  are coming out oh and they're licking their chops marked it to take our
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:41.640]  rights I want to talk about Facebook and Instagram have recently censored
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:45.320]  deleted your videos many others they admit they're doing it massive news
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  censorship we're seeing things to come if they win as you said off the cliff of
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.640]  renaissance I'm betting on renaissance we'll look at the Jimmy Kimmel thing you
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:56.880]  mentioned we have that clip we'll look at Fox who's apologizing to market

[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:06.360]  just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old guys in the unit have
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:10.560]  turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness
[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:14.840]  tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit have been
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:18.760]  part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain a youth drink
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:22.640]  called Patriot Power Greens Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:26.480]  many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:29.960]  lack of energy a thing of the past previously this drink was only
[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:35.080]  available to elite military units but for a limited time the creator of Patriot
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:40.040]  Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:44.840]  our conservative friends but you must act fast do the high demand for members of

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:26.560]  I want to go back to this this paradox where I don't think Jimmy Kimmel is
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.120]  part of the New World Order he just has Hillary on they basically have a
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.840]  script that's written and they go with it and then he says well we didn't hear a
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:36.880]  pop with Hillary let's see if it pops with Wolf Blitzer and it pops and they
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:43.600]  go okay then I guess it's true I mean to their credit when it's proven that a
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.000]  pickle jar doesn't open in a circle like peanut butter a pickle jar it
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.680]  doesn't it opens with a pop it's vacuum sealed Mark Dice was the guy that
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:57.320]  pointed it out first I gave him credit I went and did it here on air they made a
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:02.800]  huge national story I mean thousands of newspapers CNN Fox News CBS NBC making
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:05.880]  fun of me until everybody started calling in the majority of comments were
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:11.320]  like yeah pickle jars open with a pop one millimeter and so then they do it
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:15.840]  they go okay it pops but then they go to break well now it comes out that she's
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  falling down she's collapsing he actually plays the video unlike other
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.800]  media that wouldn't show the collapse they just show her wobbling and say
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:26.320]  we're discredited because they understand they're not gonna sell out
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.080]  their audience and what and what viewers they have left just to appease the system
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.880]  there comes a point where it's self-destructive to serve the New World
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:39.600]  Order and I think we've reached that demarcation line here's a Kimmel last
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:43.960]  night you probably know Hillary was coughing a lot in public last week and
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.960]  then yesterday she was forced to leave a 9-11 Memorial because she was feeling
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.040]  faint turns out on her Friday Clinton's doctor had diagnosed her with pneumonia
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.800]  but they kept it secret until this happened and they were forced to you know
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.200]  these conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton's health would be a lot harder
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  to believe if they didn't actually come true or maybe just maybe there's another
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.080]  story here let's run the video where she had to be helped into the van you
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:14.200]  probably saw this on the news now this is just no you didn't show the full thing we
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.720]  see she's being kind of supported by one of her handlers there and then she
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.440]  stumbles a little bit and they actually Secret Service has to kind of put her
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.520]  into the van they even get in between her and the news cameras but I tell you
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:30.760]  maybe Hillary Clinton doesn't have the money maybe Hillary Clinton had a few
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.840]  too many shots of Trump vodka the night
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.640]  that's enough going back to mark dies longer segment coming up you'll be able
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.280]  to break this down but right now Alex Witt is just one we've played but you
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:47.680]  saw it we saw it every channel they first ignored it Sunday Monday they would
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:51.960]  just show her wobbling and then cut it and say oh we're liars she didn't fall
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:57.720]  down again in a vacuum thinking their viewers wouldn't see the full fall down
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:02.520]  that even Kimmel understood he had to show I mean it seems like we we've
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:07.720]  reached a point where people get it yeah and the media is so deceptive that it's
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.960]  it's thankfully we have organizations like you and in platforms like YouTube to
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.440]  expose them because CNN social media Facebook they're all in on the
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:20.320]  manipulation just last week I was going back and forth with Jake Tapper on
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:24.320]  Twitter he's the CNN chief Washington correspondent about their deceptive
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.360]  reports about Trump appearing on Russian television when they omitted that he was
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.880]  really just talking with former face of CNN Larry King and so I was going back
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.400]  and forth with them on Twitter and he finally admitted well that's a good point
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:40.360]  I guess we probably should have mentioned that it was you know Larry King
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:44.880]  former CNN so I did a video just about me taking him to the woodshed and about
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:49.240]  how deceptive they are that video on YouTube got 200,000 views that's more
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:53.440]  viewers than CNN has on some of their shows that's right Greta Greta Van
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:57.800]  Susteren just quit Fox News she did her first Facebook live broadcast
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.920]  immediately afterwards she was stunned that a million people tuned in and so
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:06.200]  she she follows me on Twitter we were chatting back and forth on Twitter about
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.560]  the new media and she in much to her credit now she's finally realizing the
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:15.360]  power of the illusion is falling that drudge for a decade is said wait till it
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.480]  falls it's happening I mean 30 something million people a week now
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:23.960]  it was 28 million a month ago I'm not bragging that's bigger than CNN they
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:28.960]  just don't get it former Fox News host Greta Van Susteren is now stunned she's
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:32.880]  finally catching up to the technology and realizing that from her kitchen she
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:38.360]  can reach as many people or more as she could on a big people want her from the
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.840]  kitchen they're sick of the fake garbage and that's why I turned down I just
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:47.040]  turned down another offer to host a major show and a major network because I'm
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:51.280]  not gonna be told what to do you know I've had meetings with these big networks
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:56.200]  and I see how the system works I don't sign contract absolutely listen you sell
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:00.200]  your soul you get the money but they then control you they control you they
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:03.200]  control what you can and can't say I mean just when I was in negotiations or
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:08.000]  just pitching shows last year I had the producers who meant well different than
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.440]  the networks themselves the production company they started going through some
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:14.800]  of my videos and some of my tweets and they were getting worried oh can you can
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:18.720]  you delete this video this might be seen as sexist and I mean it's just
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:23.440]  incredible the mind control prison that they're in and you realize these are
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:27.760]  victims they are there they they've signed contracts I mean you know
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:31.720]  figuratively in blood but they can't talk about certain things they have even
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:36.680]  Megan Kelly she has to wear the clothes she had to wear those funny eyelashes
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:40.440]  during one of the debates which made headlines because they were Betty Boop

[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:51.560]  less somebody else's I'm completely out of control and thank God we'll be back

[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:10.160]  United States the president has decided the US will no longer oversee an open
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:13.920]  uncensored internet here and unless Congress steps in he will begin
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:18.080]  transition of stewardship to the United Nations now this new power grab will
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:22.040]  be given to authoritarian governments who have a vested interest in censoring
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:26.600]  undesirable content on the web the US Congress and its leaders led by Senator
[02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:31.000]  Ted Cruz are engaged in an all-out war on Capitol Hill to keep the internet
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000]  free now if they're unsuccessful Obama will hand over their power on September
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.360]  the 30th and that's a move even former president Bill Clinton warn quote a lot
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:43.040]  of people who've been trying to take this authority away from the US want to
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:47.080]  do it for the sole purpose of cracking down on internet freedom and limiting it
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:50.720]  and having governments protect their backsides instead of empower their
[02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:54.280]  people and our own president is in lockstep with this power grab an

[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:33.480]  ladies and gentlemen are the original the big farm is trying to copy what the
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.680]  plants are able to do so your support makes it all possible going back to
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:44.080]  Mark Dice Mark looking at all this where would you I mean you already talked
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:48.120]  about it I think going back to this their system is collapsing folks so fast in
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:51.960]  front of us if state-run Russian TV saying basically the mouth of Putin
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:55.320]  saying his best buddy saying you know they're gonna try to try to kill
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:00.800]  Trump I see that as their only move they're so desperate but then Hillary in
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:07.520]  her low energy and all of her corruption seems to be emblematic of how this
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:12.440]  system is on its last leg you know it's very exciting because we're right on
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:15.040]  the verge like I said either a renaissance or we're going off the
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:18.760]  cliff and we're seeing so many people that are waking up so much that you've
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:23.160]  been reporting that Matt Drudge has been reporting for over a decade finally
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:27.640]  getting recognized and it's so undeniable that the mainstream media has to
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:33.720]  cover it but we're also seeing that the censorship and the manipulation still
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:37.480]  quite powerful things that we've been warning about and documenting for years
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:42.320]  still happening now that most people the young people at least rely on social
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.920]  media for their news things that we were talking about about the trending topics
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.840]  being manipulated finally being confirmed making its way into the
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:56.280]  mainstream and over the UN in one month but it's still happening I mean I just
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:00.920]  just last week I had several Instagram posts removed and a Facebook post
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:04.440]  removed for what they said were terms of service so the censorship is
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.040]  intensified so what do we do we speak out for freedom congressional hearings
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:11.320]  but we also support independent platforms like drudge report dot com
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.880]  info wars dot com mark dice dot com more than ever that's the last phase to get
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:21.960]  censored people who bitch at us all day and say do your own thing we are we try
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:25.880]  to go and spread it all for free to wake people up on the big social networks but
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.880]  we need people to support the actual original platforms yeah and you know
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:34.320]  things that that we've been doing and talking about for years are happening
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:40.160]  YouTube demonetizing sensitive content finally made mainstream news but this is
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:43.160]  something that I've been dealing with social engineering and that they've
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:48.800]  openly announced the Chinese style model of of of will explain to people well we
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:52.080]  have been dealing with this for over a year a lot of alternative media on
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:56.000]  YouTube where they would just turn off ads they would demonetize videos they
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:59.720]  would remove them saying it was just it's just sensitive content it's not
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:03.840]  advertiser friendly and this is literally over a year ago and finally
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.920]  after a big youtuber had one of his videos demonetized he raised awareness
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:14.000]  about this it was a top trend on Twitter hashtag YouTube is over party and so
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.600]  people were finally talking about this but literally this has been happening
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:24.000]  for over a year so even the top trend on Twitter the mainstream media they're a
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:29.760]  year behind and so you know we've been talking about Facebook censoring I've
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:34.320]  had it happen multiple times for we've had a censor us and suspend us for days
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.600]  routinely let me show people a Bloomberg article publishers may get paid for web
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:44.280]  news as you swipes at Google when drugs links to your page you do back flips but
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:48.560]  no they're bitching they say when drugs or anybody else links to them they want
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.200]  you to pay for linking and sending them traffic this is incredible this is how
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.800]  they want a censor this is in the TPP there's no appeal process on Facebook
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.440]  they they just deleted the post they wouldn't let me log in they logged me
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:07.680]  out and they just simply had an okay button and they said you violated our
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:13.160]  terms of service okay and you must approve you must agree that you did or
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.240]  you can't log in and you can't you know that Pavlovian Lee you're gonna agree
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:21.640]  they'll even get into your stuff yeah there was no appeal process they didn't
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:28.640]  even send an email Instagram didn't even send a an email showing which post was
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:32.320]  removed I just happened to notice it because it was the most recent one so
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:37.000]  that's Kafka ask they won't even tell you what you've done wrong no and it gets
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.800]  even worse then I posted a screenshot on my Instagram so I don't really use
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:44.280]  Instagram much I'm more of a YouTube guy and Facebook guy but I took a
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.640]  screenshot of the notification of the violation which didn't even show the
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.160]  meme that was deleted which I'll tell you about it's certainly not even offensive
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.520]  it was quite funny and very relevant so I posted a screenshot saying hey guys
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:01.600]  they've removed my post denouncing discrimination against white people
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:06.680]  regarding the black only dorms and the black segregation black safe spaces so
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:13.040]  Instagram gave me another strike Alex and they deleted that it's that it's
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:17.080]  indefensible to call for white and black segregation if you want to do it on your
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:22.800]  own that's your that's your issue but the point is that this is like saying I
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.240]  won't hire anybody who's Hispanic or everybody who's Asian it's super racist
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:29.320]  it's wrong I'll hire who's capable of the job done I don't care what color you
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:33.560]  are but you're pointing out that all over the country colleges are officially
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:38.840]  segregating again and then you're the racist and I posted another meme it
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:43.820]  just simply showed a 1950s cartoon character and it said only we can call
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:48.240]  each other cracker and it's referring to the controversy about how black people
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:52.120]  and the social justice warriors get really offended if a white person says I
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:55.760]  don't even think it's cool really the n-word because the n-word has an ER on
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:59.960]  the end but if they simply quote or sing along to rap songs that have a certain
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:04.600]  other word that starts with an N and ends with an A people get all offended so I
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.800]  posted this meme and it said only we can call each other cracker this kind of
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:14.440]  making fun of the double standard both Instagram and Facebook deleted that
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:20.640]  post as well well there's no doubt that they're posting censorship now because
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.240]  they're losing the information war and I don't just say this because I want to be
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:29.780]  self-serving or you know because I want to win and basically have hopeful
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:33.840]  thinking wishful thinking I don't see them ever getting away with this their
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:37.880]  whole globalist plan no matter how technocratic no matter how centralized is
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:41.640]  dead on the rival mark I mean I really am very very positive people don't be
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:46.120]  very very negative a decade ago or even four or five years ago I'm very very
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:49.840]  positive right now we've got some bad water to go through you know big storm
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:52.960]  there's gonna be some problems but that which doesn't kill us only makes it
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:58.120]  stronger I think as things shut right now these people are in deep crap well
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:02.560]  that when they banned Milo Unopolis from Twitter they just created perhaps
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:08.600]  thousands and thousands of Milo clones people who use his profile picture and
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.600]  name their Twitter account Milo and so they just really is I am Spartacus you
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.400]  kill Spartacus at the slaver million and we're in Italy and then you create
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:21.640]  50,000 Spartacus's they just gave birth to him and the more they try to hate us
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:25.880]  is it only makes us more powerful I was trending on Twitter for the first time
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:30.520]  after the DNC because I posted a joke about Michelle Obama I simply posted a
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:34.920]  picture and I said hey how nice of them to you know include a transgender speaker
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:40.600]  at the DNC very very progressive and I was trending on Twitter from tens of
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:45.280]  thousands of people calling for me to be banned from Twitter and all they did is
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:50.600]  introduced me to more people and so the more they try to stop us at this point
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:55.160]  their tactics are so ineffective and since we have the truth on our side since
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:59.560]  we are backed by the Constitution since we have so many people that we have
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:04.560]  each other's back that if they try to take one of us down everybody else the
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:07.560]  key we have to keep people say oh I fought censorship in one but I won't do
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:10.240]  it over and over again it's the animating contest of liberty you have to
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:13.320]  fight and fight and fight and fight and fight that's what it's all about like
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:17.480]  breathing breathing is part of living it's not a it's not a job this is what
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.840]  makes us strong the evil we have to oppose is what makes us strong let's go
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.600]  to Kyle in Canada here on the air with mark dice of mark dice calm go ahead
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:30.760]  Kyle hi mark my question is I was just wondering I live in Canada so I was
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:34.600]  kind of surprised by the answers you get out of those Californians but I'm just
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.720]  wondering if you think that the people in those videos agree because you're
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.920]  appearing to be a source of a media outlet or are they just really that
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.120]  ignorant that's a good point I mean a lot of them are just doing it to agree but
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:50.640]  it shows their mind control go ahead mark it's both it's a lot you know
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.680]  different segments all sort of highlight the different aspects of his
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:57.920]  question so it is both many of them don't have any idea what's going on that's
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:01.680]  clear from their answers many of them also because I appear to be an authority
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:05.960]  figure because I have a recap of for new listeners every second you were out
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:10.240]  there in San Diego everybody you talked to said the Trump sons are bad for
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:15.000]  hunting pterodactyls and triceratops extinct dinosaurs so I don't get I mean
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.840]  I think sometimes they might go along with you just to seem friendly but with
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:23.080]  this no I'd say dude that's extinct there's no way he's hunting dinosaurs now
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:27.120]  so yeah something what I do is I tell people you know fake news stories and
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.720]  I think that Jimmy Kimmel has sort of put his own spin on and made it into a
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.920]  segment lie witness news which is kind of a similar thing to what I do which I
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:39.240]  believe is just a copy of what I was doing my own spin on Jay Leno's jay
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:43.440]  walking but you know the latest segment last week on my YouTube channel I told
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:46.600]  people that the Trump kids are you know hunting pterodactyls and they killed
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:51.840]  triceratops and this is you know is this an outrage is this acceptable should
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.120]  they be punished and a lot of people thought yeah you know this is terrible
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:58.680]  this is wrong you shouldn't be hunting endangered species so to answer Kyle's
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:03.440]  question because I have a microphone I have a symbol of power because I appear
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:10.000]  to be an authority figure I represent the you know the media the the agenda
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:13.600]  what is right I pretend so it illustrates the mind control one way or the
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.760]  other a colleague else I know that was only I was really thinking yep thank you
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:22.000]  yeah I think sometimes is the authority figure thing but most the time I mean
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.800]  he'll go so put gun owners in a forced camp he goes yeah I'm sick of it's like
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:29.920]  some old white professor guy you know these people are very dangerous let's
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:34.600]  go ahead and talk to Mike and Oregon you're on here with Mark Dice go ahead
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.520]  hey guys we're both watching our all of us are watching the same thing and we
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:44.080]  got like a punch drunk boxer and Hillary up against the ropes and pretty much
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:47.320]  it's like the Rocky 4 movie they're just refusing that they're on their white
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:51.520]  towel and I'm not sure if somebody's gonna get hurt or not because it's pretty
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:54.800]  sad at this point watching and then everyone's standing by and basically
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.920]  like oh she's just she's fine she's gonna get there and everything but I just
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:06.080]  want to you guys to answer this because of where is Bill and all this he's
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:11.040]  never there I never see him at any of her speeches or get-togethers or
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:14.360]  anything that's a great question yeah I appreciate you bringing on up to Mark
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:20.080]  Dice I mean for me Mr. Dice Bill looks like he's even sicker than Hillary and
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:23.880]  half the time he ain't seen the string sentence together I think they're
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:26.640]  separating them because they don't want to give the impression that it's gonna
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:32.360]  be a third term for Clinton so they're trying to have the two Clintons be
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.520]  completely separate entities and by having him be along by her side it's
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:41.360]  gonna appear as if if it's Bill that's running and so they're trying to really
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:45.920]  create the distinction between Bill and Hillary keeping him in the background
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:51.040]  and you might have already covered this the CBS edited out him admitting that
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:55.960]  she frequently passes out you know since you raised that it's a big deal in
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:00.160]  fact I have the clip of Alex Witt too will play after the break for TV viewers
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:02.880]  it's obviously more powerful than radio listeners radio listeners can't see it
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.720]  which is why I brought TV to radio 18 years ago I would say stuff people didn't
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:11.040]  believe it so I started not just web camming but actually showing people the
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:15.360]  articles and video live on air and got a pioneering this genre that's why they
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:20.760]  say necessities the mother of invention but again they go she didn't fall down
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.720]  look at the video and it's just her stumbling but next she falls on her
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.360]  face such deception and like you said mark they're in their own bubble they
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:33.720]  don't know everyone's hating him even though the study shows 6% of the people
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:37.520]  trust the mainstream media does the mainstream media mark dies know what
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:42.040]  jokes they are no they're they're desperate they're trying I mean they
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:46.760]  literally have fewer view viewers than many YouTube channels it's quite
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:52.000]  obvious especially with when we can share through social media original clips
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.400]  like the CBS clip showing Clinton admit that she quote frequently passes out and
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:01.680]  then CBS for the evening news later that day edits it around to see in
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.800]  frequently let's go to that club right now here it is when you look at that
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:11.920]  collapse that video that was taken you wonder if if it's not more serious no
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:16.840]  no she's in dehydration she's been well if it isn't a mystery to me and all
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:22.720]  of her doctors because it's frequently I'm not frequently I thought rarely but
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:28.000]  on more than one occasion over the last many many years the same sort of things
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:32.920]  happened to her when she just got severely dehydrated now the edit where
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:38.560]  they cut it out this is how dumb I think you are no no she's in dehydration she's
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:43.880]  been well if it isn't a mystery to me and all of her doctors rarely but on more
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:49.120]  than one occasion over the last many many years the same sort of things happen
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.280]  to her when she just got severely dehydrated we'll be back after the break
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:58.320]  and play Alex wit saying she didn't fall down she's doing great look and then
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:03.240]  they cut when she falls down I mean wow this is beyond the sub in shocking just
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:07.440]  happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old guys in the unit have
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:11.680]  turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:15.960]  tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit have been

[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.000]  old it's happening we're breaking with lawless forever
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:55.520]  understand your man understand your body of bad time
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:02.040]  all right and that's what's happening here is Alex wit this lady on MSNBC and
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:05.480]  she's just emblematic and I just picked one of many where they would show well
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:08.320]  she stumbled and they don't show her falling down then we show it
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:13.200]  imagine I mean I could imagine as a talk show host keeping the truth straight
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:17.240]  is hard and all the facts I couldn't imagine like trying to lie and keep it
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:22.600]  all straight I mean wow yeah no rest for the wicked is true and then knowing
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:26.680]  that tens of millions had already seen this online and then cutting it this is
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:29.960]  an arrogant creature let's play the clip for TV viewers radio listeners have
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:35.480]  already described it but here it is what we will see here now is her getting
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:40.320]  into the car she was a little bit unstable there and she was a little bit
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:44.400]  wobbly that's I think an appropriate word to you she could see right there so
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:51.480]  they just cut mark this is this is the essence of these people or MSNBC doctor
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.320]  who was saying that this she's perfectly healthy this just looks like a little
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:01.320]  dehydration wouldn't recommend and you can sometimes you just instinctively know
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:06.680]  when someone is lying and to see this doctor who has taken the oath in order
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:11.880]  to help people be healthy and not lie about their health lying on television
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:16.160]  was just absolutely incredible yeah they cut the clip they deceptively edit
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:20.920]  they re-edited the Bill Clinton clip they even cut him out for one of the
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:24.640]  segments like rubbing on his face as soon as he was asked the question all
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:30.280]  nervous about he can't believe that he's being asked this question it's an
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:36.040]  exciting time but it's still an uphill battle and it's we see every day as the
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:40.560]  election approaches the smears are gonna get worse and worse so we have to
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.240]  remain bid it's an exciting time I mean I tell you I'm up till three o'clock in
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:47.080]  the morning every night working and writing and putting together stuff and I
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:53.880]  know you are too it's really in 54 days 54 days I think they're gonna try to
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:56:57.360]  steal the election I think that's gonna be their move not kill Trump because if
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:59.800]  they kill Trump it's too obvious they may still do that but I think it's still
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.800]  the election yeah you know I mean there've been documentaries about how
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:07.600]  easy it is to hack the electronic voting machines and of course the
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:10.840]  establishment was saying that that was just a conspiracy theory 10 years ago
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:16.280]  and even four years ago but now that it looks like Trump has the possibility of
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:21.280]  actually winning it looks like they may actually be using this as a cover to
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:26.240]  actually go in and then hack the machines under the disguise of attempting to
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.080]  try to absolutely let's throw in a call from Tim and Wyoming I do five more
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:32.600]  minutes if you can talk to a few other college for Paul Watson takes over
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.120]  Tim you got a question from Mark Dice go ahead and get it in yes hi hi mr. I
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:42.080]  thanks for taking my call I appreciate it now mr. Dice I have a question for you
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.080]  I'm from Northern California I never I never found as many stupid people as you
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:51.280]  seem to find that Southern California it's incredible but what's the what's the
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:55.560]  percentage you'd say of people that are actually awake and have a living brain
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:02.320]  in their head he's showing he talks to I mean Mark five percent if that I mean
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:08.440]  it's it's we're at like a 70 or 80% ratio of people who will fall for or believe
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:13.000]  or give idiotic comments in the videos it's a scouting every day after a shoot
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.400]  and we'll go to stand we're not we're not cherry picking turds here this is
[02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:21.520]  what in Austin it's like this is almost as bad no some of the many of the
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:25.200]  episodes nobody calls me out I mean just it's it's like shooting fish in a
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:28.200]  barrel it's sad it might be a Southern California thing I've been in Northern
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:32.840]  California a very nice place people a lot more informed and that's right stay
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:35.320]  there Tim I don't have you have a comeback with Mark Dice we're back in 70
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:38.800]  seconds fourth hour some stations don't carry it they should we love them info

[02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:49.800]  ahead with myself and Mark Dice. The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:54.800]  it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be
[02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:58.240]  cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the

[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:51.480]  why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com
[02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:58.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:09.360]  all right mark dice you got to jump to another interview I'm gonna cut this line
[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:14.640]  or intro out you want to stop tearing well so to see he's mark dice and I'm
[03:00:14.640 --> 03:00:17.520]  Alex Jones your house Tim allow me finish up your point with mark dice go
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:24.040]  ahead yes alex I wanted to I wanted to say that as I say that the percentage of
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:32.800]  people all right well his phone was shut out go ahead again hello yeah you got
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:37.240]  call waiting got somebody calling you want to flip over talk to him I say I
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:40.960]  don't I'm I'll go ahead and ask a question go ahead and ask a question
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:47.400]  the question was the question was are people are people mostly waking up or
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:50.440]  they mostly going back to sleep or staying asleep well I think a lot of
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:53.240]  folks are waking up but it doesn't count the ones going back to sleep don't
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:57.240]  count so I mean that way mark you I mean you agree with that or what he said yeah
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:00.640]  we just saw a report that says that many millennials are conservative so I think
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.560]  there's finally a growing backlash because you know instinctively many of
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:08.280]  them are probably looking around and realizing that there's something
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:11.400]  seriously wrong with this liberal progressive agenda and they're looking
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:16.200]  for for answers so it's it's good that we're here to provide them with the way
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:20.600]  with a direction sign to conservatism and towards true liberty or true
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:25.000]  libertarianism so it's a very exciting time to be alive you know it's amazing
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  to see what what info wars is done now we have Hillary Clinton targeting Alex
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  Jones and I mean it's just the warmest turn mark and all of us are in this
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:37.760]  together and people can find your great books at mark dice calm thank you so
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:41.600]  much mark we'll talk to you soon keep it up thank you feels good and other folks
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:45.520]  like Mark out there taking action is his newest book the Bohemian grow facts and
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:49.640]  fiction inside the lemonade you name it more dice calm and by the way I wasn't
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:53.240]  pooping the caller from Wyoming and Montana I just get frustrated with the
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:58.880]  phones are having problems look it's not the conservatism is perfect and who
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:02.640]  runs that of the different groups that are involved it's that the Democratic
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:08.480]  Party liberalism socialism communism is dehumanization is a plan to make you
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.840]  dependent is a plan to consolidate control is a plan to monopolize the
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:17.480]  human species itself I mean I've got the articles right here where you know
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:24.040]  uber was replaced all human drivers in major cities within five years that's
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.760]  their plan and whether it's feasible or not they're coming after us they want
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:34.600]  control they want to make us absolutely servile the technocracy is the system
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:41.200]  of control it doesn't empower it it it it dehumanizes and so that's what I'm
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.880]  criticizing that's what I'm speaking up against that's what I'm fighting as hard
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:51.080]  as I can and so it isn't just that oh the Republicans and oh Trump are gonna
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:55.240]  save us it's that Trump and the libertarian constitutionalist movement
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:59.040]  took over the Republicans so the establishment of the libertarians over
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:03.200]  to try to confuse the public and that's what's really going on I know we've got
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:08.080]  HB and we've got Janice and Jesse and Greg and everybody else but I'm out of
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:12.080]  time Paul Watson's taken over if he's able to take your calls we can ask him
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:15.000]  if he wants to take the calls that's up to him if not please call us back
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.120]  tomorrow with the weekday show 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central but the fourth hour I've
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:23.720]  added the last year is our different hosts and writers and researchers taking
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.320]  turns hosting the show sometimes it's a round table sometimes I co-hosted
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:32.520]  sometimes it's somebody all by themselves like Paul Watson but Paul the
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:38.200]  entire info or his operation is not second fiddle to anybody in the work
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:43.880]  he's doing and it is Providence it's history that Paul is part of this
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:47.880]  operation just like seeing our information magnified with the drudge or
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:53.480]  magnified with you out there is very very humbling and I take that as a great
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:57.000]  responsibility I do the very best job I can a lot of times for the show I get so
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.200]  overheated and so focused that I get angry because it's the responsibility of
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:06.600]  what we're facing I don't even feel worthy of this but you know what we're
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:10.640]  not even so called judged by who we've been in our lives were judged by in the
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:14.640]  totality of it by the times who were in and what we faced so so many great
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.040]  people are made by the circumstances they were in not even so much where they
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.080]  came from or who they were and so I try to control myself and not get too
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:25.320]  freaked out too angry at myself for not doing the best job and not having all
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:29.840]  the answers in this place I am but that's better than the globalists that
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:32.680]  are just totally arrogant I think they have to show up in Louisiana during a
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:37.200]  flood or show up in Mexico and just you know sit there and talk about jobs for
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:40.480]  Americans while they do everything they can to screw us and I can tell you right
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:45.240]  now I oppose those people that are out to make us poor and dumb down I want to
[03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:50.720]  make us wealthy and powerful and a free open society I stand for Renaissance
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:55.400]  not for slavery all right there's 55 minutes left in transmission
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:05:00.160]  Paul Watson's coming in out of the gate he's hot he's focused he's ready he's
[03:05:00.160 --> 03:05:05.400]  free a British special forces sharpshooter in Syria just killed a
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:10.240]  top ISIS executioner and 3G Hotties with a single bullet over a mile away
[03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:13.720]  doing so just seconds before the terrorist and his friends were going to
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:17.960]  burn 12 hostages alive with a flamethrower the unidentified ISIS leader
[03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:21.640]  was said to be on the U.S. most kill list for several months and is known in
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:25.840]  Syria for being one of the most sadistic ISIS leaders it was he this week that
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:30.160]  was sent into a fireball by a British marksman who struck a fuel tank affixed
[03:05:30.160 --> 03:05:34.280]  to the leaders back meanwhile Hilary Clinton is busy on the campaign trail
[03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:37.720]  here in the States she makes little mention of the mess made in Syria and
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:41.920]  never acknowledges that ISIS terrorist to build a substantial arsenal including
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:45.920]  U.S. made weapons obtained from the Iraqi Army and Syrian opposition groups
[03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:50.360]  groups of the U.S. State Department armed no official U.S. policy or even
[03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:53.920]  acknowledgement that we've armed these groups and no plan in place to make sure
[03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:57.960]  our rogue foreign policies stop arming future enemies I'm Margaret hell

[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:35.480]  it's Paul Joseph Watson it's the fourth hour live and we've got a huge raft of
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:41.760]  news to get to mainly going to concentrate on media hoaxes of course we
[03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:46.460]  had CBS News edit an interview with Bill Clinton we're gonna get to this clip
[03:08:46.460 --> 03:08:53.420]  later where he says openly that Hillary frequently that's frequently collapses
[03:08:53.420 --> 03:08:58.400]  of course in the final broadcast they edited out the word frequently and just
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:03.720]  called it a little Freudian slip and the viewing public of millions didn't hear
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:09.680]  it another brazen example of media censorship and now we've also got CNN
[03:09:09.680 --> 03:09:15.080]  we're gonna get to this soon as well not challenging a guest who said 10
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:20.200]  million Americans get pneumonia every week of course they were trying to
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:25.040]  downplay Hillary Clinton's health problems by saying you money was
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:30.440]  completely common 10 million Americans get pneumonia every week of course that's
[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:35.920]  mathematically impossible because there are only about 350 million people living
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:41.280]  in America if 10 million people got pneumonia in America every week that
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:48.360]  would be 520 million people a year so again they're trying to conflate
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:54.760]  pneumonia with the flu which of course is extremely more common and now Bill
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:57.720]  Clinton's could come out and give a speech we're gonna get to this as well
[03:09:57.720 --> 03:10:02.080]  where he says that Hillary Clinton has the flu oh that's funny I thought her
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:07.960]  campaign said she had pneumonia now it's the flu because if they frame it as
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:12.880]  she's just got the flu it can seem like a common occurrence it can seem like not
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:18.560]  so much a big of a deal so they can't even keep up with the lies anymore it's
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:22.760]  getting completely out of control we're gonna get to those clips later on in the
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:28.160]  show but let's start off with this top headliner but info wars.com
[03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:34.200]  Hillary Clinton sends thank you letter to quote slot who is proud of her
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:39.840]  sexually transmitted disease again this is not the onion Hillary Rodham
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:47.960]  Clinton actually sent a letter saying that this woman was quote courageous for
[03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:54.560]  starting a campaign celebrating and telling women young women to embrace
[03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:59.520]  the fact that they have sexually transmitted diseases again this is not a
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:05.360]  joke this is not the onion this was a real story in fact I made a video about
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:09.680]  this when it first came out back in April this feminist of course she's a
[03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:17.160]  feminist of course and imagine my shock gender studies graduate Ella Dawson came
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:23.120]  out with this internet campaign back in April called shout your status in which
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:28.720]  she encouraged young women to embrace their STDs arguing that there shouldn't
[03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:34.840]  be any social stigma surrounding the issue listen to her tweet from back when
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:41.200]  she launched this campaign quote I'm a slot and I have herpes I'm still a
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:46.760]  person who deserves respect so she launched this campaign on the basis of
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:53.320]  calling herself a slot and saying that having herpes should be celebrated and
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:58.440]  then what happened well lo and behold like all social justice warriors like
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:05.320]  all feminists they spout absolute stupidity and then claim victimhood status
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:10.560]  when they get any kind of blowback and in many cases you know go on to make a
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:16.280]  career out of being a victim so they never have to get a proper job so they
[03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:21.640]  can be like Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn and solicit millions of dollars to
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:25.920]  make videos about you know how video games are sexist and evil and get in
[03:12:25.920 --> 03:12:30.360]  front of the UN and call for free speech to be shut down on the basis of cyber
[03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:35.680]  bullying which in their own words is people saying you suck and that's
[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:40.920]  basically what happened in this case with Ella Dawson she started this campaign
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:46.840]  I made a video about it saying it was completely ridiculous because being a
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:52.120]  slot and having herpes isn't an accomplishment you know Milo Yiannopoulos
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:56.840]  of Breitbart tweeted about it lo and behold what a surprise she got
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:01.640]  criticized well my god the special snowflake actually got criticized for
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:08.320]  claiming that being a slot was a form of activism so she got criticized what did
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:14.200]  she do she immediately reverted to victimhood status and tried to solicit
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:19.880]  sympathy out of it of course she was a vehement Hillary Clinton supporter from
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:25.880]  the very beginning that's to be expected but she wrote an essay recently for
[03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:31.440]  medium.com whining about how sexist trolls that comprise the alt-right
[03:13:31.440 --> 03:13:38.040]  including myself had subjected her to abuse now of course as I point out in
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:44.200]  the article the sum of my abuse was a YouTube video in which I pointed out
[03:13:44.200 --> 03:13:50.320]  that having genital warps because you're a slot a slot in her own words that's
[03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:55.320]  not an accomplishment so she complains that as a result of my video she
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:01.880]  received hundreds of messages from people calling her quote insert the sexist slur
[03:14:01.880 --> 03:14:07.480]  of your choice here and she says one example gives a screenshot of it of a
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:13.840]  Twitter user who called her a quote whore now let's just recap here the woman
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:21.040]  herself says that she's a slot and she's proud of it then has the temerity to
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:25.920]  complain about other people calling her a whore and then say that it's this huge
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:31.480]  harassment campaign against her when she herself has just said that she's a slot
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:37.920]  she celebrates the fact that she's a slot she celebrates herpes genital
[03:14:37.920 --> 03:14:43.360]  warps and chlamydia and then acts all amazed that she would get any kind of
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:49.560]  blowback out of that again it's not just the fact that you know I don't care
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:53.160]  what you do with the body if you want to be a slot go ahead it's not a very good
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:58.640]  lifestyle choice but that's what it is a lifestyle choice it's not a form of
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:04.480]  activism it's not something to be proud of there's a stigma around sexually
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:10.600]  transmitted diseases for a reason because we have to discourage some forms of
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:15.800]  behavior that aren't beneficial that have negative impacts that's called
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:21.760]  common sense herpes which she thinks is so brilliant and empowering it's the new
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:27.680]  feminist cause to get herpes can damage the central nervous system and it can
[03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:32.760]  lead to Alzheimer's disease apparently Alzheimer's disease is all the rage now
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:38.800]  amongst the social justice worries it's so trendy to damage your own central
[03:15:38.800 --> 03:15:46.160]  nervous system and embrace this new social justice cause of catching STDs
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:51.320]  and then having the temerity to shout down anyone to claim that anyone who
[03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:57.520]  voices criticism against that bizarre absurd opinion is a sexist troll is
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:16:06.520]  harassing you so that story she cites my video in the article of Wines about how
[03:16:06.520 --> 03:16:11.320]  she got hundreds of messages from people God forbid disagreeing with her that
[03:16:11.320 --> 03:16:18.400]  catching herpes was something to be proud of but it gets worse Hillary Clinton
[03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:24.520]  sent this woman an official letter you can see it in the article with the
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:29.680]  Hillary Rodham Clinton name right at the top signed at the bottom official
[03:16:29.680 --> 03:16:34.560]  Hillary forward which looks like of course Hillary for hospital logo at the
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:40.720]  bottom praising her because she got all this terrible abuse from people who
[03:16:40.720 --> 03:16:44.520]  called her a whore for her saying that being a slot was something to be proud
[03:16:44.520 --> 03:16:48.480]  of she called herself a slot and then got bought her about the fact that other
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:52.880]  people called her a whore said it was abuse and harassment and Hillary Clinton
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:17:01.040]  vehemently agrees that she is proud she is courageous she's a victim this is
[03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:07.640]  from the letter from Hillary Clinton to a woman who started a campaign saying
[03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:13.280]  that being a slot is something to be encouraged quote I am so grateful to you
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:18.480]  for not only speaking out against the stigma but also for taking a courageous
[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:24.320]  stand against the ridiculous but very real barrage of hate you received online
[03:17:24.320 --> 03:17:30.440]  so according to Hillary Clinton there shouldn't be a stigma around contracting
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:37.080]  herpes and genital warts women feminists like Ella Dawson should be proud of it
[03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:41.960]  should voice the fact that they're embracing it and should encourage other
[03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:46.720]  young women to embrace sexually transmitted diseases this is what
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:53.560]  Hillary Clinton stands for you're gonna have a woman in the White House who
[03:17:53.560 --> 03:18:00.720]  thinks that STDs should be celebrated and that that is a form of activism again
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:07.280]  this is not the onion this is a real story Hillary Clinton thinks that STDs
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:12.960]  shouldn't be stigmatized well in the real world some things are stigmatized
[03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:19.280]  because discouraging them is the right thing to do being a slot isn't something
[03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:23.400]  to be proud of again if that's what you want to be and you're not hurting anyone
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:29.960]  else then go for it but it's a terrible lifestyle choice and then she makes the
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:35.160]  point or the argument Ella Dawson this feminist that you know having herpes
[03:18:35.160 --> 03:18:39.320]  having chlamydia having sexually transmitted diseases there shouldn't be a
[03:18:39.320 --> 03:18:43.960]  stigma attached to it because it's just like having diabetes a little
[03:18:43.960 --> 03:18:50.520]  difference there in the fact that diabetes is not contagious you're going
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:56.240]  to infect other people against their will in most cases unless they're as
[03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:04.080]  sick as she is so again Hillary Clinton embracing somebody who says that being a
[03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:08.480]  slot is a positive thing should be embraced along with the genital warts
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.800]  the herpes the chlamydia and of course the conclusion is that Dawson wrote an
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:20.600]  article a follow-up praising Hillary for her bizarre widely panned disastrous
[03:19:20.600 --> 03:19:26.600]  alt-right speech because again she called out those disgraceful abusers who
[03:19:26.600 --> 03:19:32.800]  harassed her by daring to disagree with the premise that having you know
[03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:37.440]  post-filled legions all over your sexual organs and face was something to be
[03:19:37.440 --> 03:19:44.240]  proud of was trendy was a new social justice cause Hillary Clinton writes a
[03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:52.000]  letter praising that woman absolutely insane we'll be back on the Alex Jones

[03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:21.000]  live on the Alex Jones show I mentioned it in the previous segment absolutely
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:26.600]  huge new evidence of media hoaxes the media openly acting not only as a
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:32.400]  mouthpiece but a surrogate of the Clinton campaign now of course we had
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:37.720]  Hillary's now infamous collapse on Sunday in New York the Clinton campaign
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:43.960]  reacted to that by creating a set of talking points specifically certain
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:49.680]  phrases called their daily message guidance basically ordering all the
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:55.320]  Clinton staffers all the surrogates to go out in the media and to use these
[03:24:55.320 --> 03:25:02.440]  phrases over and over again one of them was that Hillary was going to quote
[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:09.000]  power through her health concerns they claimed she's so vigorous she's so
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:14.800]  strong that even with the pneumonia she powered through it even though you know
[03:25:14.800 --> 03:25:19.920]  she basically completely collapsed her legs couldn't even support her weight we
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:24.320]  all saw what happened but they went out into the media with this narrative with
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:29.440]  these talking points with these exact phrases now you would expect them to do
[03:25:29.440 --> 03:25:34.440]  that but you would also expect them to be called out by the hosts when they make
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:38.880]  those phrases and try to back them up but that's not the worst of this the
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.960]  worst aspect of this is that when these Clinton staffers when these Clinton
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:50.360]  surrogates got on MSNBC got on CNN and came out with this phrase that Hillary
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:57.800]  was powering through her health concerns to meet her obligations the hosts of the
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:06.840]  show on CNN on MSNBC then adopted those same phrases and began themselves
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:13.480]  regurgitating them let's go to the clip she made a determination with her doctor
[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:16.800]  that you would power through this she made a decision to just power through
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:20.900]  this we've decided to power through sometimes just power through this
[03:26:20.900 --> 03:26:25.200]  continue to power through yes she tried to power through it She decided to power
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:28.600]  through it well you know Brooke she just wanted to power through she just wanted
[03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:31.640]  to power through her schedule so she wanted to just power through and keep
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:35.680]  doing it appreciate all of her desire to to power through power
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:39.980]  through and get things done if she tried to power through it it was Hillary
[03:26:39.980 --> 03:26:45.460]  Clinton's decision essentially to power through the candidate who famously wants
[03:26:45.460 --> 03:26:48.820]  to power through these things and she's gonna try and power through we say when
[03:26:48.820 --> 03:26:52.180]  you get a call just power through power through they thought she could power
[03:26:52.180 --> 03:26:55.980]  through they thought she could power through they thought that she could power
[03:26:55.980 --> 03:26:59.500]  through it wants to power through things that too that the powering through
[03:26:59.500 --> 03:27:02.820]  governor Jennifer Grandholm said women just power through these things and I
[03:27:02.820 --> 03:27:05.860]  get it I try to power through all my illnesses at Hillary Clinton had a very
[03:27:05.860 --> 03:27:10.340]  busy day on Friday and she powered through that day yet she powered through
[03:27:10.340 --> 03:27:14.980]  powering through illness is what women do every day she continued powering
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:18.460]  through I think about mothers the powering through I mean she powered
[03:27:18.460 --> 03:27:21.420]  through that week I'm gonna power through that was that was that was her
[03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:23.500]  way
[03:27:28.060 --> 03:27:32.500]  understood that clip at the end for those watching on the video stream look
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:37.660]  like she was powering through now again let's emphasize the point about that
[03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:44.340]  video it began with Clinton staffers and Clinton surrogates using those phrases
[03:27:44.340 --> 03:27:49.500]  as they had been instructed to do by the Clinton campaign this is out of
[03:27:49.500 --> 03:27:55.580]  political quote those phrases projecting strength prudence and vigor were
[03:27:55.580 --> 03:27:59.180]  among the six bullet pointed talking points about Clinton's health the
[03:27:59.180 --> 03:28:04.700]  campaign distributed to its army of outside surrogates Tuesday morning the
[03:28:04.700 --> 03:28:08.900]  marching orders part of the quote daily message guidance from Brooklyn
[03:28:08.900 --> 03:28:12.940]  headquarters instructed Clinton allies on how to answer questions about the
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:18.020]  Democratic nominees pneumonia and about how she dealt with the untimely setback
[03:28:18.020 --> 03:28:23.260]  so again you would expect them to regurgitate those phrases the Clinton
[03:28:23.260 --> 03:28:27.500]  staffers the Clinton surrogates but as you saw from that clip which was put
[03:28:27.500 --> 03:28:32.940]  together by the Washington beacon not only did those statements those you know
[03:28:32.940 --> 03:28:38.660]  stock talking points those stock phrases power through go unchallenged by the
[03:28:38.660 --> 03:28:47.020]  hosts on MSNBC on CNN they then adopted them for themselves and began using the
[03:28:47.020 --> 03:28:53.580]  same term in their own subsequent shows that Hillary was powering through so
[03:28:53.580 --> 03:29:00.820]  again absolutely brazen evidence of media hoaxing brazen evidence of the fact
[03:29:00.820 --> 03:29:07.020]  that CNN and MSNBC will not only allowing those Clinton staffers to come on
[03:29:07.020 --> 03:29:12.300]  air and spout those talking points spout that narrative spout those phrases
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:18.940]  unchallenged they themselves adopted the phrases and regurgitated them
[03:29:18.940 --> 03:29:25.060]  absolute brazen evidence of the fact that the media is controlled in the
[03:29:25.060 --> 03:29:29.780]  United States we know they've said openly look we're dispensing with all
[03:29:29.780 --> 03:29:36.020]  objectivism to try and sink Donald Trump they pretend to be neutral now
[03:29:36.020 --> 03:29:42.140]  they're not even pretending now they're openly spouting slogans handed directly
[03:29:42.140 --> 03:29:46.380]  to them by Hillary Clinton's campaign we'll be back with more evidence of
[03:29:46.380 --> 03:29:52.340]  media hoaxing on the Alex Jones show live stay tuned we're on the March the
[03:29:52.340 --> 03:30:02.580]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network every four years the
[03:30:02.580 --> 03:30:06.980]  American Society of Civil Engineers gives the US infrastructure a report card
[03:30:06.980 --> 03:30:10.300]  this report card depicts the condition and performance of America's
[03:30:10.300 --> 03:30:13.980]  infrastructure assigning a letter grade based on the physical condition of our
[03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:17.980]  most basic structures America's infrastructure GPA this year is a
[03:30:17.980 --> 03:30:22.220]  D-plus in other words barely passing nothing reflects this rating more so
[03:30:22.220 --> 03:30:26.380]  than what happened to one Chicago metro rider she's recovering at home after
[03:30:26.380 --> 03:30:30.300]  she was hit in the head by falling degree at Union Station literally cracking her
[03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:34.140]  skull the accident highlights a severe problem and she wants other metro
[03:30:34.140 --> 03:30:37.620]  riders to be aware what happened to her it was several pounds of concrete in
[03:30:37.620 --> 03:30:41.100]  fact falling from a ceiling another rider who writes for the Chicago Sun
[03:30:41.100 --> 03:30:44.980]  Times said what really bothered me was that Amtrak wouldn't say how often this
[03:30:44.980 --> 03:30:49.020]  happens three tracks were shut down for repairs to be made so that normal train
[03:30:49.020 --> 03:30:53.580]  operations can resume and other words keeping that D rating intact this puts
[03:30:53.580 --> 03:30:57.140]  millions of American lives at risk every day who depend on these structures for
[03:30:57.140 --> 03:31:01.680]  basic survival I'm Margaret Hall reporting for info wars dot com more than
[03:31:01.680 --> 03:31:05.900]  two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[03:31:05.900 --> 03:31:09.900]  called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have known for
[03:31:09.900 --> 03:31:14.100]  decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government
[03:31:14.100 --> 03:31:18.540]  knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad
[03:31:18.540 --> 03:31:22.980]  member of the halogen family in the water they took the good halogen and put

[03:34:07.340 --> 03:34:12.220]  personally I've tried I've looked at buying larger quantities of storeable
[03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:18.100]  food in Europe the prices are absolutely ridiculous you're talking four to five
[03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:24.700]  dollars for a small packet of dried food I mean nobody can afford it at those
[03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:30.780]  prices this you get the excellent discount on top of the already extremely
[03:34:30.780 --> 03:34:34.940]  reasonable price I mean you compare these prices in the US to what's available

[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:47.860]  of 25 years it's made in the USA the government is stocking up on food the
[03:34:47.860 --> 03:34:53.180]  elite are stocking up on food in their hideaways in New Zealand and places like
[03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:57.940]  that and it's extremely affordable and again if nothing happens if there's no
[03:34:57.940 --> 03:35:03.220]  food emergency then you just eat the food and you save money anyway because of

[03:35:22.780 --> 03:35:28.100]  that FEMA reports predict up to a 395% increase in food prices that could

[03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:56.860]  why it's so important to support us right now at this critical time by taking
[03:35:56.860 --> 03:36:04.220]  advantage of that storeable food special at info wars store dot com now back to
[03:36:04.220 --> 03:36:12.580]  media hoaxes so we've got CNN MSNBC openly taking delivery of Hillary
[03:36:12.580 --> 03:36:19.580]  Clinton's quote daily message guidance and regurgitating the exact phrases
[03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:25.340]  powering through that Clinton surrogates that Clinton staffers were sent out
[03:36:25.340 --> 03:36:31.220]  there to regurgitate themselves now it's out in the open they've openly
[03:36:31.220 --> 03:36:37.060]  embraced their roles as surrogates of the Clinton campaign delivering those same
[03:36:37.060 --> 03:36:43.460]  talking points that were delivered to them here's yet another example Bill
[03:36:43.460 --> 03:36:50.620]  Clinton went on CBS with Charlie Rose and basically slipped up had a Freudian
[03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:56.780]  slip and said that Hillary Clinton frequently collapsed now the problem is
[03:36:56.780 --> 03:37:03.740]  they edited it out of the final interview thankfully the transcript was up on the
[03:37:03.740 --> 03:37:09.340]  CBS website people found it and noted that this key phrase had been excised
[03:37:09.340 --> 03:37:14.660]  out of what Bill Clinton said we have the original clip this is what was not
[03:37:14.660 --> 03:37:19.780]  heard when the interview was actually broadcast on CBS news so let's play the
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:26.220]  original clip when you look at that collapse that video that was taken you
[03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:32.580]  wonder if it's not more serious no no she's been dehydration she's been well
[03:37:32.580 --> 03:37:37.380]  if it is it's a mystery to me and all of her doctors because it's frequently I'm
[03:37:37.380 --> 03:37:42.740]  not frequently nothing rarely but on more than one occasion over the last many
[03:37:42.740 --> 03:37:46.540]  many years the same sort of things happened to her when she just got
[03:37:46.540 --> 03:37:53.860]  severely dehydrated so again that's Bill Clinton on CBS news that was the
[03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:58.700]  original clip that was what didn't air when the final broadcast went out he
[03:37:58.700 --> 03:38:04.900]  said saying Hillary has quote frequently well not frequently rarely similar
[03:38:04.900 --> 03:38:10.300]  medical episodes in the past so they edited out where he said frequently now
[03:38:10.300 --> 03:38:15.820]  because Hillary Clinton went on Anderson Cooper CNN last night he asked her you
[03:38:15.820 --> 03:38:20.820]  know how often she'd had these episodes she could even remember I mean if you
[03:38:20.820 --> 03:38:26.220]  faint a limited number of times you're going to remember it I fainted once in
[03:38:26.220 --> 03:38:29.980]  my life and for damn sure I remember it and I remember how many times it
[03:38:29.980 --> 03:38:35.420]  happened because it's not a pleasant experience you only wouldn't remember how
[03:38:35.420 --> 03:38:40.300]  many times you fainted it if it happens all the time which evidently with Hillary
[03:38:40.300 --> 03:38:45.220]  Clinton it does and Bill Clinton knows that for a fact and he said it during
[03:38:45.220 --> 03:38:50.740]  the interview in that Freudian slip but of course the American people can't
[03:38:50.740 --> 03:38:55.380]  be trusted with that knowledge so it was edited out of the final broadcast by
[03:38:55.380 --> 03:39:04.620]  CBS news absolutely brazen evidence yet again of more media censorship now we're
[03:39:04.620 --> 03:39:09.700]  gonna get back to Bill Clinton in a second but this is up on info wars.com
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:17.300]  CNN 10 million Americans get pneumonia every week sub headline no they don't
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:24.100]  this was a CNN guest Hillary Rosen a rampant Clinton apologist again a surrogate
[03:39:24.100 --> 03:39:30.780]  who went on CNN and said that Clinton's illness isn't a big deal because every
[03:39:30.780 --> 03:39:36.420]  week in America 10 million people come down with pneumonia this is the quote
[03:39:36.420 --> 03:39:40.980]  she was asked are you worried at all that her being away for a day two days
[03:39:40.980 --> 03:39:45.300]  three days we don't know totally yet could hurt her politically asked host
[03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:51.340]  Brooke Baldwin the response from Rosen quote look 10 million Americans a week
[03:39:51.340 --> 03:39:55.900]  catch pneumonia I don't think people begrudge her a couple of days rest
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:40:01.180]  cause the problem with that is if 10 million Americans a week are getting
[03:40:01.180 --> 03:40:07.980]  pneumonia there are 52 weeks in a year that's 520 million Americans who catch
[03:40:07.980 --> 03:40:14.980]  pneumonia every year and that's nearly 200 million more Americans than there
[03:40:14.980 --> 03:40:22.980]  are Americans population of America is 350 million it's impossible for 520
[03:40:22.980 --> 03:40:28.140]  million Americans to catch pneumonia every single year but again remember
[03:40:28.140 --> 03:40:34.100]  CNN a few days ago you had the reporter on there saying the Hillary aides were
[03:40:34.100 --> 03:40:39.020]  smashing cell phones with hammers the host immediately stopped him in his
[03:40:39.020 --> 03:40:42.660]  tracks and said wait we have to fact check that that doesn't sound right we
[03:40:42.660 --> 03:40:46.860]  got a fact check that so they fact check that turned out to be completely accurate
[03:40:46.860 --> 03:40:55.940]  this completely asinine statement was never fact checked because of course it
[03:40:55.940 --> 03:40:59.980]  would have made her look extremely embarrassed and it's completely untrue
[03:40:59.980 --> 03:41:06.540]  but notice the new narrative is to try and make it look as if pneumonia is just
[03:41:06.540 --> 03:41:11.300]  completely common that everybody catches pneumonia I mean what's the big
[03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:16.540]  deal for a 69 year old woman who's already seriously ill to have pneumonia I
[03:41:16.540 --> 03:41:21.100]  mean everybody gets it right 520 million Americans a year get
[03:41:21.100 --> 03:41:26.020]  pneumonia even though there are only 350 million people in America but let's not
[03:41:26.020 --> 03:41:31.460]  even challenge that but notice they're trying to equate pneumonia with the flu
[03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:37.380]  to try and make it look extremely common to try and downplay the fact that this
[03:41:37.380 --> 03:41:42.300]  is a major issue when it comes to Hillary Clinton's health again this
[03:41:42.300 --> 03:41:47.940]  wasn't challenged this wasn't fact checked then we go to this clip which
[03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:53.700]  just went up today actually it was Bill Clinton giving a speech today in which
[03:41:53.700 --> 03:42:00.180]  Bill Clinton said that Hillary Clinton didn't have pneumonia that she had the
[03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:09.220]  flu let's go to this clip look I'm first I'm glad to have a chance to stand in
[03:42:09.220 --> 03:42:14.460]  for Hillary today she did it for me for a long time it's about time I showed up
[03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:21.820]  and did it for her but I just talked to her she's feeling great I think she'll
[03:42:21.820 --> 03:42:28.300]  be back out there tomorrow so I it's crazy time we live and you know when
[03:42:28.300 --> 03:42:31.060]  people think there's something unusual about getting the flu next time I
[03:42:31.060 --> 03:42:36.340]  checked last time I checked millions of people were getting it every year but I
[03:42:36.340 --> 03:42:44.100]  thank you so again Bill Clinton got up in a speech today and said that Hillary
[03:42:44.100 --> 03:42:48.500]  Clinton has the flu and you know what's the big deal what's unusual about that
[03:42:48.500 --> 03:42:54.300]  millions of people get the flu every year well it's not the flu even if you
[03:42:54.300 --> 03:42:58.780]  believe the pneumonia explanation that's what her campaign said they didn't say
[03:42:58.780 --> 03:43:04.380]  she had the flu they said she was treated for pneumonia which of course is a
[03:43:04.380 --> 03:43:10.700]  damn sight more critical more potentially damaging than the flu so notice
[03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:14.380]  how they're mixing it in now with the flu to try and claim that it's a
[03:43:14.380 --> 03:43:20.180]  completely common occurrence why are we even studying this issue why are we
[03:43:20.180 --> 03:43:24.220]  even concerned about it if she's just got the flu I mean everybody gets the
[03:43:24.220 --> 03:43:30.220]  flu right since when did she just have the flu they said it was pneumonia now
[03:43:30.220 --> 03:43:34.420]  you've got CNN saying you know 10 million people come down with
[03:43:34.420 --> 03:43:40.140]  pneumonia a year a week sorry again trying to equate it with the common
[03:43:40.140 --> 03:43:45.060]  occurrence of the flu now you've got Bill Clinton who himself is obviously
[03:43:45.060 --> 03:43:51.020]  extremely ill has been for a while falls asleep at the height of the DNC when
[03:43:51.020 --> 03:43:56.980]  Hillary's giving her speech you know he's had heart surgery up there again
[03:43:56.980 --> 03:44:01.500]  they've told so many lies they're just confused now or is it just confusion or
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:06.140]  is it genuinely trying to equate the flu with pneumonia to try and dismiss it as
[03:44:06.140 --> 03:44:11.940]  no big deal here's another article out of the American Mirror on a similar
[03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:15.660]  subject campaign acknowledges Hillary still hasn't recovered from Sunday
[03:44:15.660 --> 03:44:20.660]  collapse Hillary Clinton's campaign sent an email to supporters on Wednesday
[03:44:20.660 --> 03:44:25.100]  acknowledging she hasn't yet recovered from her collapse on a New York City 3
[03:44:25.100 --> 03:44:32.420]  on Sunday but that she's on her way to a hundred percent so again they say she
[03:44:32.420 --> 03:44:39.420]  hasn't recovered four days later yet within 90 minutes the Clinton campaign
[03:44:39.420 --> 03:44:45.500]  came out with a statement before the now infamous video hit the internet saying
[03:44:45.500 --> 03:44:50.660]  that she was quote feeling great and all the mainstream media outlets
[03:44:50.660 --> 03:44:55.900]  regurgitated that talking point completely unchallenged CNN did it I
[03:44:55.900 --> 03:45:01.540]  made a video about it on Sunday saying that within 90 minutes of this supposed
[03:45:01.540 --> 03:45:06.980]  overheating and dehydration which is how they initially tried to spin it before
[03:45:06.980 --> 03:45:12.900]  the video came out before we all saw what happened within 90 minutes they said
[03:45:12.900 --> 03:45:17.780]  she was feeling great she was out on the street hogging a child even though she
[03:45:17.780 --> 03:45:22.020]  had pneumonia let's not ask any questions about that but again within 90
[03:45:22.020 --> 03:45:26.820]  minutes the campaign the media said she was feeling great yet still now four
[03:45:26.820 --> 03:45:32.220]  days later they admit she hasn't fully recovered from the collapse so which is
[03:45:32.220 --> 03:45:40.620]  it again caught in another brazen lie how many do we need to see but of course
[03:45:40.620 --> 03:45:45.740]  the mainstream media says and this is a line up on m4wars.com your sexist if you
[03:45:45.740 --> 03:45:50.340]  question Hillary's health because it's not like the mainstream media obsessed
[03:45:50.340 --> 03:45:56.180]  about John McCain's health add-in for an item all throughout the 2008
[03:45:56.180 --> 03:46:03.140]  presidential campaign is it we had cursed and powers on CNN trying to trot out
[03:46:03.140 --> 03:46:07.540]  this narrative now Kathleen Parker writing for the Washington Post a
[03:46:07.540 --> 03:46:11.300]  sailed other media outlets asking if Hillary Clinton can physically handle
[03:46:11.300 --> 03:46:18.220]  the rigors of being president following her medical episode on Sunday so again
[03:46:18.220 --> 03:46:21.700]  just forget about the video forget about the pneumonia forget about the blood
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:28.100]  clots it's sexist to even ask the question despite the fact as the Daily
[03:46:28.100 --> 03:46:33.500]  Mail reports the first Clinton health cover up revealed doctor tells how
[03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:38.260]  Hillary kept blood clots secret from her staff and had nurse travel with her
[03:46:38.260 --> 03:46:43.900]  in plain clothes to administer drugs isn't that interesting given our story
[03:46:43.900 --> 03:46:48.780]  yesterday about the neurological test that Hillary Clinton was seen receiving
[03:46:48.780 --> 03:46:53.500]  before her collapse the article states Hillary Clinton allowed her staff to
[03:46:53.500 --> 03:46:56.780]  mistakenly think that she had pulled a muscle rather than tell them she had a
[03:46:56.780 --> 03:47:04.060]  blood clot in 1998 so it goes back that far the Democratic presidential
[03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:07.220]  candidate who was first lady at the time did not correct White House staffers
[03:47:07.220 --> 03:47:11.380]  when they assumed a problem with her right leg was due to over exercising so
[03:47:11.380 --> 03:47:19.740]  she's been lying about her health since at least 2008 18 years ago the week
[03:47:19.740 --> 03:47:25.220]  reports half the country thinks Clinton has lied about her health to the public
[03:47:25.220 --> 03:47:30.420]  50% of Americans think that Hillary Clinton has lied about her health and
[03:47:30.420 --> 03:47:37.100]  this poll also finds that 30% almost three in ten Americans think she will
[03:47:37.100 --> 03:47:45.660]  die before 2020 so 30% of Americans now think that Hillary Clinton won't even
[03:47:45.660 --> 03:47:52.180]  make it through her first term as president now to me these numbers of
[03:47:52.180 --> 03:47:58.220]  50% thinking she's lied about her health seem quite low I mean this poll was
[03:47:58.220 --> 03:48:03.580]  conducted September 12th September 13th so it was after the infamous collapse
[03:48:03.580 --> 03:48:08.700]  maybe it was before the mainstream media actually started to grow a pair and
[03:48:08.700 --> 03:48:14.340]  actually call her out on it and say that even they'd been deceived but again
[03:48:14.340 --> 03:48:20.020]  50% of Americans distrust Hillary Clinton on her health almost three in ten
[03:48:20.020 --> 03:48:25.780]  think she won't even make it through her first term
[03:48:25.780 --> 03:48:31.260]  Breitbart reports doctors raise concerns over Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis and
[03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:35.340]  treatment doctors are raising concerns about Hillary Clinton's recent
[03:48:35.340 --> 03:48:38.660]  pneumonia diagnosis and treatment suggesting a case of the disease that
[03:48:38.660 --> 03:48:44.220]  causes the patient to collapse should be treated more seriously executive
[03:48:44.220 --> 03:48:47.420]  director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons Dr. Jane
[03:48:47.420 --> 03:48:52.140]  Orient another conspiracy theorist who previously said Clinton's coughing fit
[03:48:52.140 --> 03:48:56.060]  appeared more serious than allergies spoke to Breitbart news during phone
[03:48:56.060 --> 03:49:00.460]  interview on Monday she said quote most people with pneumonia are sick in bed
[03:49:00.460 --> 03:49:04.180]  and they have a fever and it's very hard for them to be up and about
[03:49:04.180 --> 03:49:08.940]  orient who identifies as a Republican again massive conspiracy theorist they
[03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:12.780]  explained during the interview I would have advised her to cancel the event
[03:49:12.780 --> 03:49:17.740]  obviously she didn't get the memo that Hillary Hillary Clinton was powering
[03:49:17.740 --> 03:49:23.300]  through she failed to regurgitate that talking point so again the questions
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:29.380]  continue to swirl about Hillary Clinton the cover-ups have become so convoluted
[03:49:29.380 --> 03:49:35.100]  that people like Bill Clinton her own staffers can't even keep up with the
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:42.900]  narrative they keep contradicting themselves let's switch to global news now
[03:49:42.900 --> 03:49:48.020]  Austrian Cardinal tipped to be the next pope warns of an Islamic conquest of

[03:55:27.580 --> 03:55:33.380]  let's hit a few final news stories this is out of the national post of Canada
[03:55:33.380 --> 03:55:37.620]  feminist Trudeau under attack for attending gender segregated event at
[03:55:37.620 --> 03:55:42.900]  Ottawa mosque Canada's self-styled feminist Prime Minister mr. it's the
[03:55:42.900 --> 03:55:47.420]  current year was praised Tuesday by one of the world's most powerful women for
[03:55:47.420 --> 03:55:50.940]  his commitment to gender equality even as he was taking it on the chin from
[03:55:50.940 --> 03:55:56.660]  other women for appearing at a gender segregated event the previous day so of
[03:55:56.660 --> 03:56:02.620]  course he went to a mosque and the proud feminist Justin Trudeau stood there at
[03:56:02.620 --> 03:56:10.500]  this gender segregated event again why is Trudeau validating gender segregation
[03:56:10.500 --> 03:56:15.900]  if he's a proud feminist you can only pick one Justin it's women's rights or
[03:56:15.900 --> 03:56:22.420]  it's Islam you can't have both another story out of information liberation
[03:56:22.420 --> 03:56:27.980]  Germany far left MP smuggles in African refugee in his trunk brags about it on
[03:56:27.980 --> 03:56:32.220]  Facebook a far left extremist politician in Germany smuggled in an
[03:56:32.220 --> 03:56:36.260]  African refugee into Germany again completely illegal in the trunk of his
[03:56:36.260 --> 03:56:40.900]  car then bragged about it on Facebook no surprise given that you know the head
[03:56:40.900 --> 03:56:44.780]  of the Green Pass he gets up in front of the German Parliament and says that
[03:56:44.780 --> 03:56:50.940]  Germans will be a minority in their own cities within 20 years and that that's a
[03:56:50.940 --> 03:56:57.260]  good thing you know Antifa openly calling for white people to be killed
[03:56:57.260 --> 03:57:02.980]  they're racist they hate their own country and again yet another example of
[03:57:02.980 --> 03:57:07.660]  that meanwhile over in London London's first Muslim mayor is appointed a
[03:57:07.660 --> 03:57:13.220]  deputy integration mayor who's worked with cage an extremist organization who
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:18.860]  described Islamic State executioner jihadi John as a beautiful man well
[03:57:18.860 --> 03:57:24.140]  imagine my shock this is the guy who shared a platform with an ISIS supporter
[03:57:24.140 --> 03:57:30.060]  nine times before he was elected this is a guy who says that moderate Muslims
[03:57:30.060 --> 03:57:37.340]  a quo uncle Tom's now he's appointing people as integration ministers who
[03:57:37.340 --> 03:57:42.940]  openly worked for extremist organizations that praised people who
[03:57:42.940 --> 03:57:50.140]  chopped heads off that's our new mayor in London is that isn't it wonderful the
[03:57:50.140 --> 03:57:55.460]  cultural enrichment that we're now enjoying let's get to a couple of final
[03:57:55.460 --> 03:58:00.060]  stories here we've got one out of CNN political prediction market Clinton
[03:58:00.060 --> 03:58:04.380]  odds for White House dropped 14 points Democratic presidential nominee
[03:58:04.380 --> 03:58:07.740]  Hillary Clinton's odds of winning the White House dropped 14 points since
[03:58:07.740 --> 03:58:13.780]  Friday of course we had the basket of deplorables comment she's dropped from
[03:58:13.780 --> 03:58:21.020]  72% again these odds are sometimes more accurate than the actual polls we know
[03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:25.620]  people are sometimes reticent to answer truthfully in the polls ever since the
[03:58:25.620 --> 03:58:30.460]  basket of deplorables ever since the collapse Hillary Clinton is losing
[03:58:30.460 --> 03:58:35.140]  steam fast Trump is also up in Ohio that's gonna wrap it up though nightly
[03:58:35.140 --> 03:58:46.140]  news coming up Alex Jones will be back tomorrow breaking news at info wars.com
