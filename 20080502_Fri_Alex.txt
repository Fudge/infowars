[00:00.000 --> 00:08.040]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:08.040 --> 00:15.440]  radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:18.840 --> 00:25.520]  we go where the news and information is not the hype but the news and
[00:25.520 --> 00:31.840]  information is actually important to all three humans on this planet and rarely
[00:31.840 --> 00:36.680]  does the news that we're covering coincide with what the dominant mainstream
[00:36.680 --> 00:46.520]  media is reporting on but today and throughout the weekend it will be and
[00:46.520 --> 00:51.280]  that is the DC madam predicted she would be
[00:51.280 --> 00:59.640]  suicided on this radio show in multiple interviews one only a month and 15 days
[00:59.640 --> 01:08.260]  ago today back on March 13th and we're gonna play that compilation in full the
[01:08.260 --> 01:11.320]  one John put together yesterday other people have been digging up other
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.960]  things she said on the show about how if she basically didn't get a fair shake
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.400]  she was gonna start naming big names well she probably should have named those
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.800]  big names I told Wayne Madsen yesterday you better name your sources you better
[01:24.800 --> 01:30.760]  go public now if you know it's Dick Cheney and of course John McCain who
[01:30.760 --> 01:36.000]  were being serviced by Debra Jean Palfrey's girls the DC madam I mean this
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.720]  is something where I don't even like talking to people on the phone about
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.480]  this now because everything I know is out in the open don't send a hit team or
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.000]  have two Austin police officers who just got back from Iraq and work for the
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.560]  Mossad or whoever pulled me over and shoot me five times and then say I had a
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.000]  gun like they just did a CIA commander a couple days ago who was leaving George
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.720]  Bush's seniors house it looks like I mean it's getting really bad folks when
[02:03.720 --> 02:08.960]  they got police hit teaming people right on the side of the Houston highway who
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.880]  was involved with the Houston police chief and the CIA clandestine officers
[02:13.880 --> 02:20.600]  club and everything else and oh it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier by
[02:20.600 --> 02:32.000]  the minute I got a bunch of calls from CNN Fox you name it yesterday afternoon
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.200]  and now I'm told that her all over of era was plugging me on Fox last night
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.520]  popular talk shows now looks Jones talked to her and she said she wouldn't
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.400]  commit suicide Fox called me and say can we play the clip and I said sure knock
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.880]  yourselves out I mean that's the whole point of that is getting the sound they
[02:50.880 --> 02:54.200]  had Larry Flint on I'm told on the same show but I haven't gotten the full
[02:54.200 --> 02:57.880]  transcript of the transcript of Larry Flint that's an article Paul Watson wrote
[02:57.880 --> 03:04.200]  today for prisonplanet.com and Larry Flint came on and said that I believe
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.480]  they murdered her I talked to her she was up beat she was gonna keep fighting and
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.320]  I believe that they murdered her they then trotted out this individual who
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.840]  get this writes a government apology books saying the CIA didn't kill Robert
[03:18.840 --> 03:22.720]  Kennedy that matter that the film footage has been released of three CIA
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.320]  section chiefs some that were involved by the way the JFK assassination there or
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.920]  that they were handling Sir Han or that the forensics the coroner the
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.160]  acoustics experts the head of the National Forensics Association we had
[03:36.160 --> 03:42.960]  him on a few weeks ago have all analyzed it and it's clear that CIA operative Mr.
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.880]  Caesar who happened to by the way work at a skunks work base shot him in the
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.000]  back in the back of the head it matters suit had point blank burns on it and
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.560]  witnesses saw it doesn't matter now this guy who wrote a government apology
[03:59.560 --> 04:03.960]  saying Vince Foster committed suicide saying that Bobby I mean Robert Kennedy
[04:03.960 --> 04:10.280]  was shot once I mean only shot by Sir Han only by one shooter he wrote a bunch
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.720]  of other apology pieces I mean that's what this guy does and he's also been
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.200]  caught according to mainstream news fabricating false statements of people
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.160]  before he claims Sir Han Sir Han told him that he did shoot Kennedy Sir Han's on
[04:25.160 --> 04:28.600]  record saying he remembered nothing he'd be given an amnesiac people who were in
[04:28.600 --> 04:31.440]  the room when this guy interviewed Sir Han said that Sir Han said no such thing
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.960]  he has no tape of it he has no tape of Deborah Jean Palfrey telling him that oh
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.840]  I'm gonna kill myself within minutes of it being announced he's in time magazine
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.800]  online oh she called me and said she was gonna do it but we have a tape saying
[04:46.800 --> 04:50.920]  she wouldn't see we have the tape but the media ignores that other than her

[08:24.520 --> 08:33.160]  Reserve is a federal agency it's not a federal agency and she was not suicide
[08:33.160 --> 08:40.480]  she was suicided I'm not gonna open the phones up until later in the broadcast
[08:40.480 --> 08:44.800]  with Tex Mars and then with Michael Hoffman with us for two hours by the

[09:09.920 --> 09:15.280]  but who knows what'll happen he's with us for two hours today but I will anytime
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.120]  there's new developments the Deborah Jean Palfrey murder case I will be covering
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.280]  that folks this isn't just about him killing this poor woman it's about how
[09:25.280 --> 09:31.520]  stupid they think we are they kill a high-level CIA spy master in Houston they
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.040]  just have the cops pulling him over gun him down shoot him repeatedly and go
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.960]  along with that they are they killed miss Britain one of her call girls who
[09:43.960 --> 09:47.480]  had been reportedly hooked up with some high-powered people connected to the
[09:47.480 --> 09:50.680]  White House and that's probably why they then froze her bank accounts and
[09:50.680 --> 09:53.320]  raided her that happened right after she quote
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.000]  suicided and she was just going into court for prostitution and she did shoot
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.360]  her mouth off and said I'm gonna fight this and and I'm gonna talk about why
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.680]  you're not going after the high-powered Johns this is hypocritical well you
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.760]  should have just gone to court and shut your mouth according to the system
[10:09.760 --> 10:15.520]  because they killed her who was just facing a few months in jail max her whole
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.280]  family said she was about to graduate from college happy miss Britain but she
[10:20.280 --> 10:27.000]  hung herself and then now her employer hung herself this is how it works you
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.760]  pull up in your car you get out you get tased you get drug into the shed and
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.040]  they hang you you never even know they killed you that's really their favorite
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.320]  way of doing it I mean even if you're a man who can fight back they hit you with
[10:40.320 --> 10:45.040]  high-powered tasers that are two three times more powerful and just instantly
[10:45.040 --> 10:52.720]  you're knocked out and they hang you that's how it works so I mean you know
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.080]  one of the US attorney assistants there in Maryland who was investigating all
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.920]  this they stabbed him 30 plus times with a knife the police first reported he was
[11:00.920 --> 11:03.600]  tortured to death they ran over him with his own car afterwards then later they
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.920]  said oh no he murdered himself he stabbed himself 30 plus times tortured
[11:07.920 --> 11:16.280]  himself and then drove his own car over him in in a creek like I said folks they
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.440]  may start publicly executing us and having the executioner where the battle
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.200]  acts cuts your head off on television during the halftime Super Bowl and then
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.200]  call it suicide I mean I joke around about this but they could just have they
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.920]  got listen they don't even have to hire foreign hit squads or hit men anymore
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.320]  they don't even do that under national security they take a large portion of
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.320]  the special operators out of Delta Force Navy Seals on their graduation in Delta
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.200]  Force they have you read the prints in 10 hours by Machiavelli and then you've
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.040]  got to write an essay on it and if you say in doesn't justify the means I won't
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.240]  kill innocent people I don't believe in corruption and you know guarding good
[11:57.240 --> 12:01.760]  with pure evil as they twist it and they go oh you answer correctly you'll be
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.520]  put into this area now but if you answer yeah I believe in killing innocent
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.080]  people and murdering children everything else you then get tested out in
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.640]  firing hits and other things and then you get taken out of Delta Force and put
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.760]  into death squads domestically normally and say in Texas commanding losses at
[12:17.760 --> 12:21.680]  this Mexican troops and you can car bomb and shoot judges and do whatever you
[12:21.680 --> 12:27.320]  want it's just back of the paper or a local cop investigates your your your
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.040]  drug dealing operations or your child kidnapping rings or any of the things
[12:31.040 --> 12:35.560]  you do you just kill the cop and his fellow cops are cowards they show up
[12:35.560 --> 12:39.320]  and see the cop tortured to death me and they're higher up say guys unless you
[12:39.320 --> 12:44.120]  want this to happen to you you know officer brown committed suicide the
[12:44.120 --> 12:48.560]  cops stick their tails right between their legs and that's the end of it
[12:48.560 --> 12:53.720]  there's a problem you see in places like New York City where people
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.480]  historically in the last 150 years they didn't previously laid down the
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.720]  corruption you had it bloom and you had swaggering corrupt thugs walking in
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.800]  robbing shops demanding payola demanding you hire their pay your their
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.400]  family members demanding your 18 year old daughter 16 year old daughter have
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.160]  sex with them and the people learn to grovel and and go along with it now in
[13:18.160 --> 13:24.000]  Texas and Alabama and Arizona and California and Tennessee and places
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.400]  like that you did that it wasn't even a thing about being tough it was it was
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.880]  the people were it was really genetic see the vanguard came over the sea the
[13:33.880 --> 13:39.360]  most radical the most aggressive and then and then most of them got killed and
[13:39.360 --> 13:42.240]  only the strongest revived of that and then when you get down to the frontier
[13:42.240 --> 13:45.800]  states only the most vicious of those survived and so people tried to run
[13:45.800 --> 13:49.880]  organized crime in the south and people just immediately kill you I mean it was
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.200]  like oh you threaten me you die but now we've been domesticated turned into
[13:54.200 --> 13:59.080]  coward scum now we have triad gangs Mexican gangs government gangs total
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.920]  slaves groveling cowards everywhere home of the cowards home of the slaves
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.880]  scum filth in Texas just how it works folks and the government's trying to get
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.800]  your guns so you can't fight back so they can just fully have their way with
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.680]  you and so now we're gonna live like they live in Chicago we're gonna live
[14:16.680 --> 14:20.440]  like they live in Moscow we're gonna live like they live in New York we're
[14:20.440 --> 14:29.040]  gonna live like coward slaves that's how it works that's the journey into
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.760]  enslavement but we will open the phones up only if you saw Fox News coverage of
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.240]  what exactly they said I'm told they even played a clip on one Fox show of my
[14:39.240 --> 14:49.680]  radio show and did give credit that that it was the fact that pal free said
[14:49.680 --> 14:52.520]  that she wouldn't commit suicide of course they're just trying to create a
[14:52.520 --> 14:56.480]  new big controversy for ratings over all of this but that's fine use the enemies
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.080]  own tactics against them because we need to get this out that she was murdered
[15:01.080 --> 15:04.840]  but but again let me just say clearly on the record because I'm getting a lot of
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.160]  death threats they've been killing people in Austin lately let me just say
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.720]  it unequivocally if I get murdered and they say it's
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.240]  suicidal I had a heart attack or or or a bolt of lightning strikes me or Austin
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.600]  cops who just so happened to just get out of you know a one of the military
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.600]  contractor companies you know if two rookie cops pull me over and kill me
[15:26.600 --> 15:35.120]  okay I did not aim a gun at them okay I'm not doing that and or if you know I
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.280]  hang myself not true I don't care you know if they lie on the media and say
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.480]  my wife said I was suicidal you notice they never actually have the wife on
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.240]  TV they just say the wife said that and then they call up and threaten the wife
[15:48.240 --> 15:54.000]  to shut up if any of that happens to me or anybody else I mean stop believing it
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.680]  we have this exact demo the same signature as it is in all the cases see
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.960]  it'd be hard for them to get into her house and kill her with her mother but
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.200]  get her out of the car and that's now being reported that well she went out
[16:07.200 --> 16:12.120]  and never came back she just went out in the car and yet then pulls up got the
[16:12.120 --> 16:17.160]  little garage area the little shed storage shed you know under the car port
[16:17.160 --> 16:22.200]  and drag her in there hang her I mean you're talking about a two three minute
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.200]  job guaranteed if you talk to neighbors there was a power company truck will
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.800]  probably pulled up in front maybe police officers see how this works now is
[16:32.800 --> 16:36.080]  they've got hit teams on every major police department started back in LA
[16:36.080 --> 16:39.760]  first in the mid 60s now admitted you can go read that in your crime history
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.960]  Darrell Gates even brags about it with CIA hit teams in LA and then they they
[16:44.960 --> 16:52.160]  call them the Vikings today the subgroup in LA but how this works is a
[16:52.160 --> 16:55.640]  I've even met some of them by the way and I mean the real deal folks how this
[16:55.640 --> 17:03.520]  works is is let's say they're gonna run a hit on me they'll wait till my wife's
[17:03.520 --> 17:10.360]  out of town generally and they'll just open my back door come in on me when
[17:10.360 --> 17:19.000]  I'm asleep hang me right there in the closet and then in case I fought back
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.880]  in case something went wrong they'll have cops waiting down the street that's
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.480]  what it looks like with this guy they just whacked in Houston and and let's
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.040]  say I happen to be up let's say I happen this you know one chance out of ten
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.920]  fight them off or get out the cops will run me off the road claim I shot at them
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.440]  and you'll you you'd see me driving down the road running they would already have
[17:40.440 --> 17:43.720]  my cell phone already jammed that immediately I mean they plan this out
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.560]  this is a military op they've even in some of these ops got helicopter
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.560]  standing by with weapons I mean they're gonna get you and that's how they
[17:53.560 --> 17:58.180]  operate and so if I was going to fight my way out of my house they'll just have
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.000]  Austin PD there to kill me nobody'll ask you know why these guys were deployed
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.680]  why they were waiting down the street it's all about the gang it's all about
[18:07.680 --> 18:13.160]  the evil but your whole illusions being shattered you're killing so many people
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.400]  doing so much obvious stuff CIA cocaine plane just crashed again with four
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.880]  tons on board pure from the source CIA torture plane why do you think these
[18:22.880 --> 18:26.240]  guys will fly torture victims what I think because they're making millions
[18:26.240 --> 18:33.240]  just the pilots are alone they're all I mean it's just they admittedly pay off
[18:33.240 --> 18:38.840]  kernels around a million dollars in Iraq for one tour a private gets 30 grand a
[18:38.840 --> 18:50.120]  year extra cash you understand the magnitude of all of this and it's total
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.080]  corruption just just absolute you've got total corruption and beneath it a bunch

[36:02.560 --> 36:08.560]  happened dot com in the mid-1990s was exposed events foster killing but
[36:08.560 --> 36:11.960]  before we do that I want to tell you about a couple of our sponsors to make

[36:24.440 --> 36:28.440]  with food in countries with ethnic cleansing they euthanize the elders and

[37:36.400 --> 37:41.400]  quick because I got to Fox News clips one this morning covering what ever gene
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.400]  Palfrey said here on the show before she died a month and a half ago and then
[37:45.400 --> 37:52.000]  her all over last night but right now let's go ahead and go to Mike Rivera to
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.360]  break down what we're witnessing Mike try to boil it down for us well just
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.480]  really simply Deborah Jean Palfrey both on your show and on my show had
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.480]  indicated she was never ever going to consider suicide and went so far as to
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.440]  say that if she were ever found dead that it looked if it looked like a suicide
[38:09.440 --> 38:12.880]  that it was not that it was going to be murder there was still information that
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.480]  she'd been holding back she did used it to make some kind of a deal with the
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.720]  prosecutors that obviously had not worked and everyone's talking about this
[38:21.720 --> 38:25.680]  55-year potential sentence she was facing but the reality is within the
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.240]  sentencing guidelines it may have been as little as four years for the specific
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.400]  crimes that she was convicted of and so you know if you look what happened
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.400]  to uh... uh... uh... the uh... the homemaking lady i'm blanking on her name
[38:39.400 --> 38:44.400]  uh... the uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... it would have been only
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.920]  four years and uh... you know that's not something that anybody's going to kill
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.320]  themselves over uh... there was always the appeals process to go through but
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.720]  supposedly you know gene was looking at a tell-all book where she was going to put
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.320]  all of the stuff out there including the stuff that had not been in the original
[39:00.320 --> 39:03.880]  phone records and obviously there's a lot of people who are sleeping a lot
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.680]  better in washington dc tonight now that miss palfrey and this other one brandy
[39:08.680 --> 39:11.720]  britney uh... uh... have been so conveniently
[39:11.720 --> 39:13.720]  suicided
[39:13.720 --> 39:16.200]  now now there's also
[39:16.200 --> 39:21.400]  a individual uh... who has suddenly come out in claim with no evidence
[39:21.400 --> 39:23.840]  that she magically called him
[39:23.840 --> 39:24.760]  and said
[39:24.760 --> 39:27.440]  it i'm not going to go to present i'm gonna kill myself
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.640]  and that magically within an hour of this being announced was already on time
[39:30.640 --> 39:31.680]  magazine
[39:31.680 --> 39:33.520]  uh... online
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.200]  and we have an article up on prison planet
[39:35.200 --> 39:37.680]  dot com about this guy where it's come out that
[39:37.680 --> 39:40.160]  uh... mainstream media's reported that he has
[39:40.160 --> 39:42.600]  uh... reportedly made up statements before
[39:42.600 --> 39:45.800]  claiming that sir hand sir hand
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.620]  uh... told him those serans always told everyone he remembered nothing
[39:49.620 --> 39:50.680]  told him
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.000]  but the witnesses who were there city didn't say it sir answers is a lie
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.960]  uh... that he did remember shooting at
[39:57.960 --> 39:59.800]  robert kennedy
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.920]  and i've seen reports that you reportedly have debated this guy are you
[40:02.920 --> 40:04.440]  aware of i'm talking about
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.240]  oh yeah it's dan molda and uh... we went head to head over the vincent foster
[40:08.240 --> 40:08.840]  case
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.000]  he still has a web page uh... at his website
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.080]  uh... where he specifically goes after me on the foster case
[40:15.080 --> 40:18.520]  uh... because i had publicly challenged him on the uh... inconvenient
[40:18.520 --> 40:20.560]  fax to the suicide conclusion
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.200]  and what he basically says on his page if he acknowledges all these fax i
[40:24.200 --> 40:25.160]  point out are true
[40:25.160 --> 40:28.360]  but it simply dismisses them as red herrings and it's not important and
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.480]  this is not what you should pay attention to and he goes back to the
[40:31.480 --> 40:34.960]  official story again and again but uh... you know he's basically another
[40:34.960 --> 40:38.800]  individual in the same mold as gerald posner he makes his money
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.320]  uh... supposedly pretending to be an independent that's not a lot of it
[40:42.320 --> 40:44.560]  admittedly has worked with the cia
[40:44.560 --> 40:47.920]  and it's kind of all these fake pentagon news and billions and fake
[40:47.920 --> 40:49.760]  newscast and
[40:49.760 --> 40:52.000]  it's amazing he does white washes on
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.120]  rfk jfk
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.240]  vince foster and now he pops up and says all i talk to her she said she was
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.760]  gonna kill herself
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.560]  well far as i'm concerned the fact that they trotted out dan molde on this
[41:05.560 --> 41:07.480]  uh... you know on this story so quickly
[41:07.480 --> 41:14.320]  is a flashing neon sign saying cover up cover up cover up
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.960]  continue i had had any doubt at all
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.240]  uh... that that this was not an assassination the fact that molde is
[41:20.240 --> 41:22.360]  attached to it basically erased them
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.840]  uh... you know that that's a clincher as far as i'm concerned
[41:26.840 --> 41:29.920]  well we know that they don't even our hit men now it's just institutionalized
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.520]  special forces hit teams and local police hit men everywhere
[41:33.520 --> 41:36.560]  uh... but they just murdered his palestinian activist cut his body up
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.240]  bound him and local police in austin said it was a
[41:39.240 --> 41:40.240]  suicide
[41:40.240 --> 41:43.640]  the first police said it was a murder they're killing u.s. attorneys assistant
[41:43.640 --> 41:46.920]  u.s. attorneys torturing him the first police say it's a murder scene later
[41:46.920 --> 41:48.720]  they say it's torch uh... that it's
[41:48.720 --> 41:49.920]  that it's suicide
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.360]  i mean is it the establishment in risk of just totally turning us into a third
[41:53.360 --> 41:54.480]  world country
[41:54.480 --> 41:57.720]  where the everybody knows that the police are murders
[41:57.720 --> 42:01.440]  i think we're already there i mean uh... if you look at the video from that
[42:01.440 --> 42:02.040]  uh...
[42:02.040 --> 42:05.040]  uh... gentleman carney down in houston the other day
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.280]  i mean the cop just walks up and blows them away while he's trying to get out of
[42:08.280 --> 42:09.280]  the car
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.920]  uh... and you know just absolutely just laid him right out there on the ground
[42:12.920 --> 42:16.120]  with without any questions will see that video by the way is out there i've
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.000]  been
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.400]  i've been to tell everybody that soon they'll be blowing our heads off on
[42:20.400 --> 42:22.680]  tv i kept saying that i said that
[42:22.680 --> 42:24.760]  uh... last week i said that last month
[42:24.760 --> 42:29.120]  i'm not joking they'll probably make me kneel down machine gun me in the back
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.680]  battle axe my head off your head off
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.880]  uh... maybe tie us down and drawn quarters
[42:34.880 --> 42:37.880]  and then say we committed suicide i mean it's getting that crazy
[42:37.880 --> 42:39.120]  he walks up
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.200]  and the guys can you just shoot scene
[42:42.200 --> 42:44.760]  it just absolutely blows away and i just want to say something on the record
[42:44.760 --> 42:46.280]  here right now alex
[42:46.280 --> 42:49.440]  you found very cheerful to me
[42:49.440 --> 42:51.400]  you found very happy very contented
[42:51.400 --> 42:54.680]  well i have been getting a lot of really serious death threats lately
[42:54.680 --> 42:58.720]  well i'm not surprised and it's just an indicator of uh... of how effective you
[42:58.720 --> 43:01.720]  are because you know they all saying if you're catching the flak it means you're
[43:01.720 --> 43:02.880]  over the target
[43:02.880 --> 43:05.680]  uh... but you're absolutely correct they're getting very brazen in this
[43:05.680 --> 43:08.040]  ability to simply whack people at will
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.600]  and uh... it's like they don't even care if we know what's going on or not they
[43:11.600 --> 43:13.160]  just go through the motions
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.520]  and uh... they know that as long as they can create some kind of a plausible
[43:16.520 --> 43:20.600]  deniability the courts in the congress will do absolutely nothing about it
[43:20.600 --> 43:24.920]  but i'd you know what we're getting back to deborah jean palfrey of course she
[43:24.920 --> 43:26.640]  was on my show a little while ago
[43:26.640 --> 43:31.000]  and basically there was more yet to come out and uh... i'm certain that
[43:31.000 --> 43:31.920]  probably
[43:31.920 --> 43:36.200]  uh... her mother safety deposit box if she has one has been gotten into
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.720]  uh... probably uh... on closer examination will find that
[43:39.720 --> 43:43.240]  uh... what was left of deborah jeans property has been gone through at her
[43:43.240 --> 43:44.400]  mother's house
[43:44.400 --> 43:47.400]  uh... i am hoping i know a lot of people are hoping that deborah jean had a
[43:47.400 --> 43:49.200]  couple of dead men switches set up
[43:49.200 --> 43:51.280]  where some of this information was uh...
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.800]  uh... still being paid
[43:52.800 --> 43:56.760]  because uh... you know it was an indication that this went really very
[43:56.760 --> 43:57.520]  high
[43:57.520 --> 44:00.800]  that was uh... it reached far more than simply the the uh...
[44:00.800 --> 44:02.200]  the escorts ring
[44:02.200 --> 44:06.640]  uh... that was linked in in fact with this other gentleman jonathan uh...
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.280]  uh... i'm i'm blanking on a name the guy who stabbed thirty times
[44:10.280 --> 44:13.040]  uh... that yeah the assistant u s attorney
[44:13.040 --> 44:14.520]  yeah the assistant u s attorney
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.240]  that in point of fact this is the tip of another monster scandal uh... as as
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.080]  shocking as the franklin scandal and they're out to cover up and and just
[44:23.080 --> 44:26.200]  shut this down just as quickly as they can
[44:26.200 --> 44:31.040]  well i see a key nexus here you have the uh... britney
[44:31.040 --> 44:34.520]  miss britney who worked for her
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.520]  and balfour said on the show that she believed the evidence pointed towards
[44:37.520 --> 44:39.600]  murder that she wasn't suicidal that
[44:39.600 --> 44:42.600]  she was facing a few months in jail that she was going to fight it
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.000]  that she was angry that she was gonna list names she was tired of hypocrisy
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.280]  uh... and then suddenly she hangs herself in her four hundred plus thousand
[44:50.280 --> 44:50.960]  dollar
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.000]  uh... paid off home
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.880]  now they expand out from there
[44:54.880 --> 44:56.440]  as soon as they murder her
[44:56.440 --> 44:58.760]  suddenly they sting palpher
[44:58.760 --> 45:01.960]  and i don't know why palpher even brought this up on air with her couldn't see it
[45:01.960 --> 45:05.240]  they wanted to have an indictment on her
[45:05.240 --> 45:06.600]  to discredit her
[45:06.600 --> 45:08.800]  if she was able to leak this stuff out
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.640]  while they investigated and found out if she did have dead man switches
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.920]  and then once she was convicted she had made noises on this show on your show
[45:16.920 --> 45:20.000]  and others that she was going to go ahead and release the big names
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.560]  not just a phone list and so they had to kill her
[45:22.560 --> 45:25.880]  and you watch on the next month they're gonna kill more of her girls
[45:25.880 --> 45:28.600]  they'll probably taser them and hang them the same way
[45:28.600 --> 45:31.960]  they love to kill you in your garage folks they'll also you know
[45:31.960 --> 45:33.680]  uh... what they do is
[45:33.680 --> 45:35.240]  you drive in your garage
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.120]  they come out from behind boxes
[45:37.120 --> 45:38.840]  they taser you
[45:38.840 --> 45:41.920]  uh... then they put you in your car carbon monoxide you know they turn the car
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.600]  on all you killed yourself that way
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.640]  i mean they have all these favorite ways of doing things
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.840]  and so i see that nexus point that's why they sick the fb i on her
[45:50.840 --> 45:53.320]  that's why they charge her because again
[45:53.320 --> 45:55.400]  the first thing they do they think you're going to
[45:55.400 --> 45:57.440]  able danger you got this kernel
[45:57.440 --> 46:00.520]  who's saying the government was protecting the hijackers so they they
[46:00.520 --> 46:03.760]  started you know going after him for sixty eight dollars in phone bills
[46:03.760 --> 46:06.440]  to his wife and bring that out that he's a crook
[46:06.440 --> 46:08.360]  for something that was like taking a pencil home
[46:08.360 --> 46:10.080]  a microbarrow your comments
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.800]  yeah absolutely where we're seeing the government and basically i'm seeing
[46:13.800 --> 46:17.680]  panic reactions here there's a lot of stuff that's bubbling to the surface
[46:17.680 --> 46:21.760]  uh... and uh... you know what we're we're dealing with an administration we're
[46:21.760 --> 46:23.080]  dealing with a government
[46:23.080 --> 46:27.680]  uh... which i think long history of uh... cleaning house as as luther park
[46:27.680 --> 46:28.360]  put it
[46:28.360 --> 46:31.640]  uh... during the clinton years just before he himself was gunned down
[46:31.640 --> 46:33.080]  and uh...
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.960]  you know if the idea that we have uh... these assassination teams running
[46:37.960 --> 46:39.800]  across the country is not new
[46:39.800 --> 46:42.880]  uh... it was reported not too long ago that israel
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.600]  has assassination teams inside the u s with the u s government permission and
[46:47.600 --> 46:50.640]  that they're going after people who are perceived as a threat to the status
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.000]  quote israel including possibly this palestinian gentleman who was tied up
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.400]  and drowned and then claim to be a suicide but you know it is getting so
[46:58.400 --> 46:59.720]  overt
[46:59.720 --> 47:02.520]  i mean when you have people who are are tied up
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.240]  and duct tape and thrown in the lake and they claim it's suicide you know
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.320]  nobody's buying that nobody is believing i mean as you said even fox news on
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.360]  fox and friends is expressing doubt that palfry committed suicide
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.080]  what you know when fox news is is expressing doubt that the story has
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.960]  really started to fall apart
[47:19.960 --> 47:21.600]  and uh... you know but uh...
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.400]  uh... they obviously don't care they don't care if we know they're carrying
[47:25.400 --> 47:26.600]  out these murders
[47:26.600 --> 47:29.800]  uh... maybe they don't know i think this is a message i mean they also mr
[47:29.800 --> 47:35.160]  hamed they sliced him up he was also sliced open uh... mike we talked to the
[47:35.160 --> 47:39.000]  to the head uh... a person in his mosque wash the body
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.880]  and it was not an autopsy he was butchered and tortured and just sliced
[47:42.880 --> 47:44.600]  into huge pieces
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.840]  that they brought him a bag with just everything slapped and stabbed open
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.160]  the but the head all had bashed out brain gone
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.280]  yeah that's uh... you know and yet for our our police authority and the media
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.960]  to claim it's a suicide
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.600]  really indicates just you know how completely totally compromise the
[48:02.600 --> 48:03.560]  mainstream media
[48:03.560 --> 48:06.480]  and even our domestic law enforcement is right now
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.120]  and you know people want to know why we don't respect the police anymore it's
[48:10.120 --> 48:13.920]  because the police are not working for law enforcement they are enforcing the
[48:13.920 --> 48:17.000]  dictator exactly do people put cops listen to me
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.560]  do people respect mexican cops to you
[48:19.560 --> 48:24.960]  everybody knows their systemically system-wide corruption
[48:24.960 --> 48:26.720]  do people
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.080]  respect russian police no
[48:29.080 --> 48:32.040]  did people respect the nazis no
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.440]  did do we respect communist chinese police no
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.880]  i mean it's real simple
[48:38.880 --> 48:41.000]  mike this is disgusting
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.120]  it is we respect only those people who are deserving of respect
[48:45.120 --> 48:47.840]  and i know if you go into the court system that the judge will say i'll
[48:47.840 --> 48:49.160]  teach you to respect me
[48:49.160 --> 48:52.120]  and the response there is no you can teach me to fear you
[48:52.120 --> 48:55.320]  but you can't teach me to respect you respect has to be earned
[48:55.320 --> 48:58.000]  and we're in a state with our country right now
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.360]  where you know respect and trust take decades to build and it's shattered with
[49:02.360 --> 49:03.640]  the first lie
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.240]  we have a country in which the american people know the government is lying
[49:08.240 --> 49:11.520]  they're carrying out a fascination they're starting wars with live
[49:11.520 --> 49:14.560]  i don't think there's hardly anybody in this country that really respect the
[49:14.560 --> 49:17.760]  government anymore even those people getting government paychecks well i
[49:17.760 --> 49:19.680]  want to add no in their heart of heart
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.160]  what's going on exactly i want to add they ordered these men and women to
[49:23.160 --> 49:25.280]  torture and i'm they're just as guilty
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.480]  but the people above them are even more guilty they ordered him to torture now
[49:28.480 --> 49:31.480]  we even have the executive order not just the white house in just department
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.480]  memos
[49:32.480 --> 49:34.120]  and chief council memos
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.080]  and then one guy who tortured people to death under orders
[49:37.080 --> 49:38.520]  in uh...
[49:38.520 --> 49:39.640]  cobble
[49:39.640 --> 49:42.960]  he went public in his defense said okay i'm gonna give you the orders which are
[49:42.960 --> 49:43.840]  now public
[49:43.840 --> 49:48.840]  they sealed it that under patriot act charged him under terrorism
[49:48.840 --> 49:49.920]  you understand
[49:49.920 --> 49:52.800]  guys they will stay will set you up
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.720]  i don't understand how the i mean
[49:54.720 --> 49:55.760]  the hit man
[49:55.760 --> 49:57.720]  that go and kill c i a
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.200]  uh... field guys like the guy in houston
[50:01.200 --> 50:04.760]  that that cop no the cops and just i mean don't you know you're gonna end up
[50:04.760 --> 50:05.680]  getting it now
[50:05.680 --> 50:07.320]  don't the idiots know
[50:07.320 --> 50:09.440]  uh... that uh... whoever you know
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.320]  killed palphery is going to end up dead the next year
[50:13.320 --> 50:16.560]  yeah absolutely the first rule of assassination you kill the assassins
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.000]  when lee oswald was not killed at the texas movie theater
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.840]  that's when jack ruby was sent in
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.240]  uh... to kill him and then as soon as jack ruby was in his jail cell
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.000]  uh... he was given injections that uh... made him sick and eventually died
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.640]  and yet the assassins will be assassinated himself and that's a
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.080]  message you need to get out
[50:34.080 --> 50:37.160]  because these people running around and carrying out these killings they are

[54:12.120 --> 54:29.160]  okay let's go ahead and go to the first clip this is our Aldo Rivera last night
[54:29.160 --> 54:34.760]  talking about the Jevrojean Palfrey case and how it could be a murder and of
[54:34.760 --> 54:39.660]  course reporting on her interview here last month or now a month and a half
[54:39.660 --> 54:46.400]  ago in March so clearly she had suicide on her mind however in the most recent
[54:46.400 --> 54:51.600]  months she spoke to Alex Jones a well-known conspiracy theorist radio
[54:51.600 --> 54:55.720]  talk show host quote no I'm not planning to commit suicide I'm planning on going
[54:55.720 --> 54:58.520]  into court and defending myself vigorously and exposing the government
[54:58.520 --> 55:03.120]  that was just pre-conviction then when one of her hookers remember the
[55:03.120 --> 55:09.120]  University of Maryland professor Brandi Britton right who was also convicted a
[55:09.120 --> 55:14.720]  prosecution charge in 2006 Brandi Britton killed herself and at the time
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.480]  Debra Jean Palfrey said I guess I made up something that Brandi Britton wasn't
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.320]  made up but still the blogs are alive Greg with conspiracy theorists who say
[55:24.320 --> 55:29.520]  that because she had all this additional information you know that senator
[55:29.520 --> 55:33.480]  David Bitter the Republican from Louisiana was among her clients they
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.600]  say that there was a whole list of other rich and powerful names that you could
[55:37.600 --> 55:41.560]  have exposed right and chose not to for one reason or another this Toronto does
[55:41.560 --> 55:47.680]  not die with her though well I the best witness though dies with her you know
[55:47.680 --> 55:52.800]  the I believe that this was exactly because there were multiple handwritten
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.800]  suicide notes in that shed where she hung herself by a metal beam in the
[55:58.800 --> 56:04.440]  ceiling the probability the overwhelming probability is that it is as the
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.000]  initial report suggests a clear cut suicide but I do maintain that you will
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.680]  be hearing a lot more of this from conspiracy theorists who say that this
[56:12.680 --> 56:19.520]  is a murder designed to murder designed to look like a suicide to cover up more
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.160]  information it's far-fetched but I believe that you'll be hearing a lot
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.440]  they say that she'll be the Vince Foster's the Vince Foster of the
[56:26.440 --> 56:31.200]  government yeah well at least he didn't do it in front of his family look the
[56:31.200 --> 56:35.640]  Department of Justice according to Dan Moldare the crime reporter I talked to
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.320]  you said you know what five decades behind bars for running this prostitution
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.520]  recent this is as quote this is the Department of Justice using a cannon
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.040]  to kill a fly you agree I totally do but I also think that you would have
[56:47.040 --> 56:50.920]  gotten something more on the order of five years I don't believe 55 years was
[56:50.920 --> 56:56.560]  ever really on the table her age five years wasn't that old she's a mid 50s
[56:56.560 --> 57:00.160]  her poor mom 76 years old is ill she was the sole support for her mom
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.440]  all right the mom now we'll come back and play the next clip then text Mars in
[57:03.440 --> 57:06.360]  studio but as we start the next hour we're gonna come back with this
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.920]  morning's clip from one of the Fox National TV programs the key here is
[57:11.920 --> 57:16.280]  that we have an individual who debunks for the government who has been caught
[57:16.280 --> 57:22.360]  reportedly making things up making up quotes popping out of a jack-in-the-box
[57:22.360 --> 57:27.080]  and then the reports up on prisonplanet.com just just coming out of
[57:27.080 --> 57:33.520]  nowhere and saying he talked to her and she said that she was gonna kill
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.320]  herself if she had to go to prison which is the opposite she said here that
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.840]  she would never kill herself and then I also talked to her off air during some
[57:42.840 --> 57:45.680]  of the breaks remember saying are you worried they'll kill you and she said
[57:45.680 --> 57:49.960]  well yes but it is scary I do get followed some you're hearing an
[57:49.960 --> 57:53.560]  exclusive here I was gonna wait to bring this up later in the show but why not
[57:53.560 --> 57:56.640]  just bring it up now I just want to get everything I know about this lady out
[57:56.640 --> 58:01.800]  then and that's basically it and I said so you'll never commit suicide even if
[58:01.800 --> 58:05.400]  and I believe John Harmon may be a witness to this because he doesn't on
[58:05.400 --> 58:08.480]  purpose listen to me during the breaks but he's in Minnesota I'm in Texas so
[58:08.480 --> 58:11.960]  when I talked to a guest he hears it so I think I'll I meant to ask John today if
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.560]  he remembers me talking to her during a break because I talked to guests a lot
[58:14.560 --> 58:18.320]  during the break and I said would you ever commit suicide you need to be clear
[58:18.320 --> 58:21.400]  about this and she said look there's no need everybody knows I'll never commit
[58:21.400 --> 58:26.400]  suicide I'm gonna fight this even if I go to prison I'm gonna appeal this and
[58:26.400 --> 58:30.320]  I just wish I'd have got her to say that on air so there there you have it
[58:30.320 --> 58:33.120]  we'll get right back

[59:51.440 --> 1:00:11.440]  Government coverups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:46.440]  Text Mars will be in studio with us coming up in the next segment and Michael Hoffman. A lot of key issues. He's also reported on government assassinations, how they do it on key dates. It was the High Holy Day of the Satanist yesterday. You know it is May Day. They have their little religious ceremonies right out in front of you, don't they? But here is one of the Fox News national programs this morning. Go ahead and roll it.
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:01:01.440]  Deborah Jean Palfi. Better known. No wait why are we showing Charlie Ringel in his. Alright I'm going to ignore that because that is teasing a story that's going to really outrage you coming up shortly. You know the DC madam. She killed herself in her mom's shed.
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:20.440]  Kimberly Guilfoyle. You know this stuff. You're a legal analyst. Do you think it's murder? What do you think it is? I think they should definitely investigate this case. They already put sort of a neat little bow on it and said oh this woman killed herself because she was in despair. She was going to be sentenced in July. She was looking at a maximum of 55. We all agree there's no way she was going to get that amount of time.
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:35.440]  Maybe a couple of years. Now there's some reports saying that she said to certain people I will kill myself before I go to jail. But guess what? There's videotape of her on the Alex Jones show on two separate occasions saying specifically that she would never kill herself.
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:51.440]  And she has also stated to other friends and people that she would not kill herself and if anyone, if someone might try and kill her and if there was any kind of attempt to make it look like a suicide, don't believe it that it was murder. And her mom said she wasn't depressed or upset at all. And there was another call girl that worked for her.
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:02:09.440]  Brandy Britton who was also found hanged a couple days before she was to give testimony in January of 2007. So two women involved in this case where there's 10,000 to 15,000 phone names potentially of high powered people in Washington. They both hanged themselves. Come on.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:23.440]  Well, what do you think the police are not telling the public? And from your experience as a prosecutor, do they usually come out on what appears to be a suicide so quickly and claim it as a suicide? Well, there are reports that there was a suicide note. We do not know the contents of it.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:40.440]  Right. So you say, okay, wait, she's hanged herself. There's a suicide note. This appears pretty obvious. Depending on what the contents are, the police should check into this. And I think they're not just going to summarily dismiss it. So there might be a lot more developments on this story. And it's not one that you should just say is a case closed.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.440]  You're going to be covering this on the lineup of this weekend.
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:46.440]  Yeah. Well, we're going to be, we're all going to be on together Saturday night at 10 p.m.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:47.440]  All right. Wonderful.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:48.440]  Yeah. You don't want to miss that.
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:03:01.440]  Absolutely. And they're going to be playing audio clips of this radio show. I'm told Saturday night on Geraldo Rivera live. So you'll definitely want to tune into that. Again, I'm no friend of Fox don't like them.
[1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:06.440]  Don't like the way they operate the demonization, the things they've engaged in, but they're specially for ratings.
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:19.440]  I is covering murders and stirring up big controversies. And they know I saw the blogs on the Washington Post with like thousands of comments and 90 plus percent would be they killed her. Just like Princess Diana, everybody knows they killed her.
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:21.440]  The evidence is there, but the government still says it didn't happen.
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:39.440]  But the big thing here is they have this individual that professionally quote debunks Dan Moldead says she had done time once before, he recalls, and it damn near killed her.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:48.440]  She said that there was enormous stress. It made her sick and she couldn't take it that she wasn't going to let that happen to her again.
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  And so that is supposedly this individual saying that well, I don't have it on tape, but then it turns out that the family of Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan himself.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:10.440]  When he visited him in prison, the jail guards, everybody are saying that Sirhan Sirhan has never said he remembers he just he was given an amnesiac in his drink by the girl in polka dot address.
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:18.440]  And now even the BBC Associated Press NBC admit that the CIA killed RFK.
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:29.440]  They were filmed there by multiple news agencies, top CIA section people like Frank Sturgis and others.
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.440]  It's just amazing. And this is the guy that does white washes on that.
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:38.440]  By the way, the LA Coroner said he was shot four times, three times in the back, once in the back of the head.
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:41.440]  Sirhan Sirhan was in front and was grabbed over the first shot.
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:45.440]  So we know it's a fraud. And the guy that shot him is known CIA.
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:47.440]  Mr. Caesar.
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:05:14.440]  Well, they're right back with Tex Mars.

[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:25.440]  We're going to be covering a host of issues this hour, a little bit into the next hour, with Tex Mars and Michael Hoffman, historian, former AP writer, who's going to be with us for two hours.
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:35.440]  We're going to go into overdrive today with Mr. Hoffman because I'm going to have Tex a little bit in the next hour and then I'm going to spend a few minutes with the latest developments on the Deborah Jean Palfrey case.
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  But Tex Mars is going to talk about a host of issues, a multi-time New York Times bestselling author, Air Force officer, of course, space and aeronautics, professor.
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:52.440]  He married my wife and I and Wanda, his wife is such a sweetheart and good family friends.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:58.440]  I just time flies though. We used to have dinner every once in a while, so now we're so busy we hardly ever see each other.
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:03.440]  We got to make time to do that, but I really appreciate Tex Mars coming into the studio.
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:13.440]  Alex, great to be with you again and you know, since I saw you last, it seems like the elite have ratcheted up their efforts at control of the people.
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:21.440]  And I'm so amazed at their ability to do that and yet I believe it's because of the psychological control.
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:32.440]  I actually call it a magic type of alchemy and I'm also delighted to see your organization here because you have people here that really care.
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:34.440]  And I want to say something before we begin.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:42.440]  I want to mention that I knew you before you were nationwide and I'll never forget the first time I saw you on television, cable access.
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:45.440]  Now, I want people to understand something, Alex.
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:49.440]  You volunteered to go down to Austin Cable Access.
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:54.440]  You became the number one program on Austin Cable Access, which was very well watched, I might add.
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.440]  I watched you for the first time, a friend mentioned this, Alex Jones.
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.440]  You weren't getting paid a cent for this.
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:02.440]  You weren't in it for the money.
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:04.440]  If anybody believes that, that's nonsense.
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:12.440]  I saw you, Wanda was sitting by me and I said, do you know why that man is going to succeed in riling up the establishment?
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:15.440]  He's exposing the evil doing in this world.
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:17.440]  And I'll tell you why he's going to succeed.
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:19.440]  I've mentioned this to you before, but I want the audience to know.
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  Three words, okay?
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:23.440]  Three words.
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:26.440]  A passion for truth.
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:30.440]  I guess that's four if you count the A, passion for truth.
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:32.440]  I saw that in you.
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:38.440]  There are other things, intelligence, the fact that you're willing to dig in to find out the information, the truth.
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:41.440]  And you're able to articulate it.
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  But more than anything, the passion for truth, that has not left you.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:48.440]  I'll tell you, I've watched, I've seen every one of your videos.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.440]  I saw your book.
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  Most times I can't even watch myself.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:55.440]  You know, and when you do that, though, you're going to have enemies.
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.440]  Oh, I've got plenty.
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  Oh, yeah.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:03.440]  Because passion for truth drives up those who want to reject the truth, who want to avoid it.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:05.440]  So I thought I'd just add that.
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:07.440]  Well, Tex, let me just, I mean, please don't make it about me.
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.440]  I'm just an average person who's upset about what's happening.
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:12.440]  And I'm pretty obnoxious, but I've gotten a little bit better over time.
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:15.440]  But I have to add, you know, I learned more from Tex Mars than anybody else.
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:29.440]  I remember seeing people air your documentaries, your presentations in like 1992, 93 on access television when you were just exposing the Clintons in the New World Order and just starting to write books about that subject.
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  And, you know, then Oklahoma City happened and, and I saw you talking about that in 95.
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.440]  That's right when I got on air.
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:42.440]  So, and of course, think how many people you've also woken up other than me and think of all the other people I've woken up.
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.440]  And all our listeners have woken up. That's what's so beautiful about this.
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:50.440]  But as you said, evil Katie bar the door realizes we're breaking in on them.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:52.440]  So they're throwing everything they've got.
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:53.440]  Oh, right now.
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.440]  And, and I mean, just overall with the whole world, they have no shame.
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:11:59.440]  And, and now they have no fear of the people.
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:11.440]  The only ones they fear are the listeners of the Alex Jones show, the very few because your listeners also, and I get emails from all the time, they too have a passion for truth.
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:19.440]  Alex, one of the things I would really like to hit today, the main subject is something that is so amazing that's going on.
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:23.440]  I believe they've gone a little bit beyond the police state.
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  The police state is the umbrella, the taking away of our constitutional rights, of course, and the bill of rights, the stripping of those rights.
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.440]  But now they're creating, and I want the people to understand this.
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.440]  It is so important.
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:44.440]  The elite are creating a new reality, a new reality.
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:48.440]  This is a psychological battering of the public.
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:54.440]  Now we've already had, of course, 9 11 and the terrorist scare, the fear mongering.
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:03.440]  But, and this gets to people's basic needs of survival, of security, of safety, and they're using this against us.
[1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:20.440]  But wait, now they're ratcheting it up, not only are they causing engendering and stilling fear for our security, our safety, but now food, water, oil, which is the wellspring of our entire economy.
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:33.440]  These three resources, oil, water, food, they have decided to batter us into submission through these three key resources.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  Oil is everything for the economy.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  It means everything for people's pocketbooks.
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:43.440]  It means impoverishment as the price of oil escalates and goes skyward.
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:45.440]  Then there's food.
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:48.440]  If people can't eat, they can do nothing.
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:55.440]  I still remember Abraham Maslow back in the 60s, developed this concept, which is true, has been confirmed over and over.
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:04.440]  When people are worried, concerned, frightened over their basic needs, I'm talking about food, I'm talking about water, okay?
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.440]  And their ability to live a decent lifestyle, okay?
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  Shelter and so forth.
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  When those needs are not met, they don't worry about abstract things like liberty and freedom.
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:26.440]  However, the establishment says, if they've been domesticated so that they can, quote, get that standard back, what they don't know is, this is the same elite that has engineered all this.
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:33.440]  And what you're saying, Tex, and I want to see you flush this out because you wrote a book about it years ago, is what the United Nations said they do in the 60s in the Club of Rome.
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:41.440]  And now that just republished the head of the CFR, Richard N. Haas's quote of, and reading a lot on air, I'm sure you've seen it where he says, we're going to have a twin rail.
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:42.440]  This is a 93.
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:46.440]  He said we're going to have terrorism, which we threaten them with to give up their rights.
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:52.440]  But then we're also going to have the global carbon tax in the name of saving the earth to regulate and bring in neofutilism.
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:15:00.440]  And he said, this is a quote, this makes humanity the enemy, and then we can direct the state against the enemy.
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:01.440]  Now, that's a key.
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.440]  That's a key.
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.440]  Humanity is the enemy.
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:05.440]  You see, here's the new reality.
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:07.440]  It's a contrived hoax.
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:13.440]  Just as 9-11 was, just as the Oklahoma City bombing was, just as Al Qaeda is a contrived hoax.
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:17.440]  Now we have a contrived host of resources.
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:19.440]  It's artificial scarcity.
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:20.440]  Absolutely.
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:24.440]  The lie is we're going into, now listen to this, an age of scarcity.
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  And because of that, we all have to be good soldiers and agree to share with the rest of the world.
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:33.440]  We have to share our water.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:34.440]  We have to share our food.
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:40.440]  Well, we're not going to share, but we're not going to share with the people.
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:43.440]  They claim there's a middleman called the New World Order.
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:44.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:46.440]  Well, they're getting enriched by all this.
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:51.440]  And if the price of gasoline, the pump goes to $10 a gallon, quit your belly aching, man.
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:55.440]  I mean, we're doing you a favor even letting you drive a car.
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:57.440]  I mean, we're helping you.
[1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.440]  You don't really deserve this.
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:01.440]  I mean, there's a scarcity of oil.
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:02.440]  And it's because of peak oil.
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:07.440]  And then they can also blame Alaska and pointed a few hippies they financed as NGOs.
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:12.440]  When we've had all the old company executives on more oil than Saudi Arabia and the government isn't going to let it out of the ground.
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:15.440]  Oh, but hippies are stopping them from getting it.
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:21.440]  Well, yeah, we haven't had a, for example, in the oil area, we haven't had a new refinery built since the 1970s.
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:23.440]  They blame it on the environmental movement.
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:32.440]  But wait, who actually funded, who actually founded and sponsor today these environmental organizations?
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:33.440]  So all companies.
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:35.440]  Sierra, Nature Conservancy.
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:36.440]  Sure.
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  The mass of their money doesn't come from the unwashed hippies.
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:39.440]  Rockefellers founded it.
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:40.440]  Absolutely.
[1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:46.440]  And we got the old company documents in 2001, Associated Press did, where they said 95 in a consortium meeting, the Big Ten.
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:49.440]  They said Exxon, Mobile, all of them before they'd merged.
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  They said we're going to buy up these 214 refineries and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:58.440]  Yeah, these are artificial hoaxes.
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.440]  Now, then they have the media to control this.
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:02.440]  And then comes the idea of peak oil.
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  Now, you know, I come from East Texas.
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:08.440]  My brother was a high-level executive in Sun Oil Company.
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.440]  And he used to sit around with me.
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:11.440]  We used to talk about this.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:13.440]  Listen, back in Fort Nature's, Texas.
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:14.440]  So was my grandmother.
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:15.440]  Is that right?
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:16.440]  Yeah, my great-grandpa worked for Sun Oil.
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:21.440]  And back in the 70s, you know, when we had the first big energy crisis with Nixon in office,
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:25.440]  and there were lines at the gas pump, the service stations, miles long,
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:27.440]  my brother was just shocked about this.
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  Because remember, he was the Sun Oil.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:32.440]  He was able to see the figures of what their inventories were.
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:35.440]  He says, the United States is brimming with oil.
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  There's no cutoff from the Middle East.
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:38.440]  Brimming with oil.
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:40.440]  And the tankers continued to come in.
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:42.440]  But it wasn't being refined.
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:46.440]  Because they had decided it's time to drive up the price.
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:49.440]  Now we know that Kissinger agreed with the Shah of Iran and others
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:51.440]  to allow the price of oil to escalate.
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  That's now public.
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.440]  And now we're seeing the same thing now.
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:56.440]  Call the conspiracy theory in the 70s.
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:57.440]  Yeah.
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:59.440]  And here's an interesting thing, too.
[1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  Even at this time, 30 years ago, my brother told me something interesting.
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:08.440]  He said the oil fields, the oil wells that we first drilled
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:11.440]  and thought we'd brought all the oil out of the ground from.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:13.440]  And then we capped them.
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:15.440]  They put all the concrete and closed them back up.
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:16.440]  We're going.
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:17.440]  It's Sun Oil.
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:18.440]  I'm sure this is true of every oil company.
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  We're going back now, 20, 30 years later, uncapping them.
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:23.440]  And guess what?
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:25.440]  We find they're full of oil again.
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:26.440]  It just comes back.
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:27.440]  It replenishes.
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:28.440]  It percolates up from the earth.
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:29.440]  There's processes going on.
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:33.440]  And there's hundreds of universities are proving that it is not dead dinosaurs.
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:34.440]  No.
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:35.440]  No.
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:36.440]  That's fossil.
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:37.440]  Again, more and more.
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:38.440]  Fossil oil.
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:39.440]  Yeah.
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:40.440]  That's sort of silly stuff.
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:44.440]  The oil came about at the turn of the century, you know,
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:48.440]  a Rockefeller with a standard oil company had a monopoly that was broken up
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:51.440]  supposedly by the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.440]  1906.
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:53.440]  It was just in the news the other day.
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.440]  They came back and they admitted the family owns the company
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:59.440]  and they're about to fire Rex Tillerson because he won't go along with global warming.
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  Well, of course, global warming is another scam that they have.
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:08.440]  Now, back to this fossil fuel, so-called, you know, the very idea of it,
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.440]  hey, oil is dead dinosaurs that have decomposed in the earth.
[1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:13.440]  That's our oil.
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.440]  When you run out of dead dinosaurs, you run out of oil.
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:17.440]  That's the claim.
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:18.440]  It's so silly.
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:19.440]  People don't really think about it.
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:20.440]  Here's where this came up.
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  Around the Los Angeles area, they had the oil tor pits.
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:28.440]  And of course, being gooey and sticky, there were a certain number of animals,
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:31.440]  even back in prehistoric times, that got into the oil tor pit.
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  And guess what?
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  They couldn't get out and they died there.
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:35.440]  They found their remains.
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  This caused many people to say, hey, that must be where the oil came from.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:39.440]  Exactly.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:40.440]  Uneducated people.
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:41.440]  Stay there.
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:42.440]  Text Mars.
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  We're going to be right back after a break for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:47.440]  We're going to have some behind the scenes right now.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  It is a big idea.
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  A new world order.
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:59.440]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:01.440]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:04.440]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:07.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:10.440]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:15.440]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:23.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:27.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:30.440]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.440]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:32.440]  They're not after money.
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:33.440]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:34.440]  They're after power.
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:35.440]  Yes, they're after music.

[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:09.440]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.

[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:49.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:52.440]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor,
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:54.440]  even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:59.440]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:03.440]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:08.440]  protect a complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:10.440]  improving mileage and only one tank full.
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:13.440]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction,
[1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:15.440]  but it extends the life of your engine.
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:19.440]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment,
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:27.440]  for only $9.95, and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:29.440]  Call Triple 8, use SFR 1.
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:33.440]  That number again is Triple 8, use SFR 1,
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:37.440]  or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.

[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:48.440]  Do it today!
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:23:58.440]  Welcome back, Genesis listeners.
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:01.440]  Say hi to all the present-pointed-out TV viewers.
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:04.440]  We have a text at Mars here in studio with us,
[1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:07.440]  going back into oil,
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:10.440]  shifting gears back into that.
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:14.440]  Yeah, they came out 150 years ago when they first discovered oil,
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:16.440]  and we're looking at coal.
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:20.440]  There is some small deposits where you find the imprints of ferns.
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:24.440]  There's very small amounts of coal that they found in association.
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:27.440]  As you said, they found tar pits in Africa, the U.S.
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.440]  I've seen the history, and they said,
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:32.440]  oh, the juice from these animals made this.
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:34.440]  Of course, now they admit the laborer tar pits
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.440]  was them getting caught up in it.
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.440]  And animals dying in it.
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:41.440]  So continue with this system.
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.440]  Well, first of all, we need to understand something.
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:46.440]  We need, we're being attacked.
[1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:48.440]  Our minds are being attacked.
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:51.440]  We're being told to accept a new reality
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:55.440]  that we're going to have to accept being a third world impoverished nation.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:59.440]  That we're going to have to accept food prices doubling, tripling.
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:03.440]  We're going to have to accept the fact that our water is going to be controlled from down,
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:06.440]  and the price of that is going to go up dramatically.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  This age of scarcity, this new reality,
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  this is what we have to watch out for.
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:13.440]  Now, how do we fight back?
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:16.440]  First of all, we have to understand the truth,
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:20.440]  which is for 200 years, America has been the land of plenty,
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:22.440]  and we have plenty.
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.440]  This planet is awash with oil.
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.440]  Once we understand that, once we understand that water is incredible,
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:31.440]  most of the world's surface has water.
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:33.440]  They're now saying water isn't renewable.
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:35.440]  They're teaching school children that.
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:37.440]  The reason why, let's go back to the water.
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:40.440]  We'll go around and round up all these three key resources
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  in the so-called age of scarcity.
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:46.440]  Remember, billionaires like T. Boone Pickens from Oklahoma,
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:49.440]  he has bought up the water rights in West Texas
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:52.440]  for about three states underground the water rights.
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.440]  He's going to build pipelines just like oil pipelines,
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:58.440]  and water is going to cost more than oil within a decade.
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:00.440]  That's their plan.
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:02.440]  The UN has said it 30 years ago,
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:05.440]  again, a key point here for everybody to understand,
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:08.440]  to totally back up what you're saying, Tex.
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  I remember not just reading Club of Rome documents and all of this.
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  They go back 40 years, 30 years where they had met all of this.
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.440]  I remember on NPR and on PBS shows and Charlie Rose,
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:21.440]  they would say, the new old daughter will be built on shortage.
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:23.440]  You know, when you have Kissinger on,
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:26.440]  we built oil, water, timber, everything.
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:29.440]  And of course, they get to tax us now on what humans put off,
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:32.440]  and it's one of the four, you know, life-giving building blocks,
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:36.440]  water, sun, carbon dioxide, oxygen on this planet.
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:38.440]  But I've heard them on NPR.
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:40.440]  Americans are soon going to have our tentative living taken.
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:43.440]  We deserve it. It's like a little liberal sacrament.
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.440]  Oh, we're going to pay now. They admit it's a scam.
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  I mean, they are just going to go ahead, Tex.
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:51.440]  Well, back to this water, not only T. Boone Pickens,
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:54.440]  there are many more. For example, Maurice Strong is a Canadian,
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:57.440]  but he comes down to Colorado with his wife, Hannah.
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:00.440]  The first thing he does is this rich Illuminati.
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:02.440]  He's admittedly into the occult.
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:06.440]  Oh, absolutely. Well, he builds a temple to the occult,
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:10.440]  a new age temple there in the Baca Grande area of Colorado.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:14.440]  Remember, now he's a rich, fabulously rich Canadian.
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.440]  But there he is in Colorado. Why?
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:23.440]  Because he bought up for a song the water rights to Colorado, Nevada,
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.440]  Arizona because of this Baca Grande, trillions of barrels.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  And by the way, governments aren't allowed to sell the aquifers,
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.440]  but they do. Oh, oh, yeah.
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:35.440]  Now, and that's why they're now saying you can't drill a well.
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:37.440]  You can't have your own water. Go ahead. Oh, absolutely.
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  They're going to control us and they're going to watch people that now
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:42.440]  have well on the country. There's two million cops.
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  They're talking about three million in viral cops without warrants.
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.440]  Just everywhere spying. Go ahead.
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:50.440]  Well, the satellites are watching too. Yeah, that's right.
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:53.440]  The satellites are watching too. The military satellites.
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:55.440]  Don't drill your own well, but they'll be watching.
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:58.440]  No, no, they admitted now that local police are going to have it too.
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:01.440]  Now, the interesting thing about Maurice Strong, for example,
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.440]  and I talk about him quite a bit in my book, Circle of Intrigue,
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:08.440]  the hidden inner circle of the global Illuminati conspiracy.
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:13.440]  Strong was the head at the time when he bought up these water rights
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:18.440]  here in the United States, head of the United Nations Environmental Program.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  Then he went back up to Canada and he bought into Hydro Canada.
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:27.440]  Now he owns most of the water rights of the Canadian people.
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:30.440]  Now, the reason why they did this, why they bought up all these water rights,
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  all these aquifers very slowly, very quietly over the last two decades,
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:40.440]  they are now going to drive up the price of water to unbelievable levels.
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:45.440]  It's going to be such a precious resource and they're going to watch every little drop.
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:48.440]  Forget about your lawns, forget about your home gardens
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:51.440]  and people who live out in the country that have their own wells,
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  they're going to have to put meters on them.
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:54.440]  They're going to watch everything.
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  And this is feudalism.
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  And because privatization and all of the municipal water companies
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:01.440]  have been forced to sell their operations to the rich.
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:04.440]  Has anybody wondered why it's Dutch, German, British, Israeli?
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.440]  They own all the water districts now.
[1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:07.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:08.440]  And in fact, I get the reports all the time,
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:11.440]  they'll come in and buy the city's water, pay off the politicians,
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:13.440]  and then double triple prices overnight.
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:15.440]  Now, the food industry is exactly the same.
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:18.440]  We're going to come back and talk about that with Tex Mars.
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:21.440]  And then during this break from President Planet TV viewers
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  or for infowars.com, they're in that stream listeners.
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:25.440]  We're going to go ahead and switch over to that stream right now, folks.
[1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:28.440]  You'll be able to hear me and Tex at the InfoWars screen
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:30.440]  and continue this discussion to all our MNF affiliates.
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:34.440]  We'll be right back in three minutes for all of you that are out there.
[1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:39.440]  We're trying to stop the New World Order.
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:43.440]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:30:09.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:16.440]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:45.440]  Thank you very much.
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:52.440]  Thank you very much.
[1:31:40.440 --> 1:31:42.440]  Don't be a victim. Be a victor.
[1:31:42.440 --> 1:31:45.440]  Stock up now, tbotech.com.
[1:31:45.440 --> 1:32:14.440]  That's tbotech.com.
[1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:43.440]  Thank you very much.
[1:32:43.440 --> 1:33:00.440]  That's tbotech.com.
[1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:02.440]  We're having two parallel discussions during the break.
[1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:07.440]  We're talking about why did they kill Paul 3 on May Day, the High Holy Occult Day.
[1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:09.440]  And then they got into environmentalism and how they believe it.
[1:33:09.440 --> 1:33:13.440]  It's earth worship, sun worship, and then now we see that topic,
[1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:19.440]  because it's all interconnected, nexusing with how they want to control the resources through feudalism
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:22.440]  because they quote worship the earth, but then they're the ones actually destroying the earth
[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:25.440]  because they believe in this yin and yang, the Illuminati Code,
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:27.440]  and they destroy and they rebuild.
[1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:30.440]  But in their own state of documents, it's official.
[1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:35.440]  They say that they're going to take the water, the food, the land, the oil,
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:40.440]  jack up the prices to bring you all back to a feudal level so you can't afford to have children.
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:44.440]  And as I told you they would do, they've now proposed one child taxes in the U.S.
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  as it started in China and then seven years later, it started in the mid-70s
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:51.440]  and then in the early 80s became mandatory.
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:53.440]  They signed IMF World Bank deals.
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:56.440]  They signed on the State Department memorandum 200.
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:57.440]  This is all coming.
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:33:59.440]  You think it's bad now with a cop on every corner?
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:05.440]  New environmental regulations, animal ID, premise society, thousands of dollars in fines for tiny things,
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:06.440]  total control.
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  They're flattening tires, burning down buildings now, the fake environmentalists.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:12.440]  Soon they're going to be in uniforms.
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:13.440]  They already are.
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:16.440]  Al Gore, 10 million strong youth army in the U.S.
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:18.440]  Text, please continue.
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:22.440]  Well, you know, several years ago I wrote this book, Days of Hunger, Days of Chaos.
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:26.440]  I want you to have a copy of it, Alex, because in this book,
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:30.440]  the subtitle, by the way, is the coming great food shortages in America.
[1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.440]  A lot of people said, hey, this can't be.
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.440]  You know, I don't believe this kind of stuff.
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:37.440]  But here's a book over 200 pages that I wrote.
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:42.440]  This was the first book to expose Monsanto, Dow Chemical and the others,
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:47.440]  their plans for the Terminator gene to be implanted in the seeds.
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:48.440]  You wrote this nine years ago.
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:49.440]  I remember.
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:50.440]  Absolutely.
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:51.440]  And people couldn't believe it.
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:52.440]  They couldn't believe it.
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:54.440]  The Terminator seeds would be used by the farmers.
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:57.440]  They saw their own documents and you knew that they planned to create this artificial.
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:34:58.440]  Go ahead.
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:34:59.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  Now, think of this.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:02.440]  Maria Bertini, I quote her in the book.
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:03.440]  Who is Maria Bertini?
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:08.440]  She was the head of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:10.440]  There is a World Food Authority.
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:13.440]  They've already set it up, okay, at the United Nations.
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:19.440]  In fact, they have erected a building, a gigantic complex in Brussels, Belgium.
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:20.440]  All right.
[1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:23.440]  Next, my next newsletter, I'm going to have a picture of that building.
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:26.440]  It seems to be 10 times as big as the United States Capitol.
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:29.440]  It must have thousands of bureaucrats.
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:30.440]  They are ready to go.
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:34.440]  They're going to control the world's food, including America's food.
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:38.440]  They had that Beijing Conference, 96, 97, which one?
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:41.440]  And the head of the UN Food Program said, we will use food as a weapon.
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:42.440]  We have used it as a weapon.
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:44.440]  We do not apologize.
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:45.440]  That was Bertini.
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.440]  And she said, and I want to quote her, food is power.
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:52.440]  Food is power.
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:54.440]  And the head of the United Nations Food Program.
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.440]  With this gigantic building, they probably employed three or 4,000 bureaucrats in this
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:03.440]  one building in Brussels, Belgium for food.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:08.440]  And remember also, the United Nations last year had an international water conference.
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:09.440]  They're warning people.
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:13.440]  They're going to be wars between nations over water.
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:15.440]  Already, we're seeing food riots.
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:21.440]  Everything is, it was taking place so that they can program our minds.
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:24.440]  This is alchemical attacks, alchemical magic.
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:32.440]  We're being taught that food and water and fuel now are these incredibly scarce commodities.
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  That's right.
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:34.440]  But don't worry.
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  Government's going to help us.
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  One child.
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:37.440]  Oh, yeah.
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:38.440]  There were less people.
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:42.320]  As Ted Turner's been saying, there are suddenly all of the news saying, if we had less people,
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:44.440]  you could have the Mercedes again.
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:48.440]  Well, it isn't interesting that Ted Turner, who, you know, the guy that what's called
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:50.440]  Christians, losers and bozos.
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.440]  Ted Turner, who's been favored by the Illuminati rich all his life.
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:58.440]  He says, we must all have no more than one child.
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  He has five.
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:00.440]  But yeah, he has five.
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:01.440]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:05.440]  He has five himself.
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  All of this is a setup, of course.
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:13.440]  This zero population growth, which by the way, George Bush Senior used to be the head of
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:14.440]  it.
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:19.440]  Rockefeller made him the head of the zero population growth organization years ago.
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:25.440]  But so we have an attack on human beings, as you mentioned earlier, Alex, and these three
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:29.840]  key resources, I want to bring something to people's mind.
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:33.880]  If they're attacking our minds, what do we do to recover?
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  What do we do?
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:35.880]  Of course, we tell the truth.
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:42.960]  But listen to this, rather than going into this mindset, this programmed magical trance,
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:46.440]  that there is an age of scarcity, we need to strike back.
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:48.560]  And let me tell you how we can do it.
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:52.600]  We need to bring up proof, just as you and others did with 9-Eleven.
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:56.960]  What you did, Alex, you said, we will not accept the establishment version of event.
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:57.960]  Why?
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:00.560]  Because it doesn't correlate with the truth.
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:06.840]  And then you and a few others begin to bring this incredible array of truth to the fore.
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:10.760]  Books, videos by you and others, radio programs.
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:15.720]  You have been smashing the 9-Eleven, the establishment version, the lie.
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:21.840]  And now they've got the lie about oil shortages, oil scarcity, water scarcity, food scarcity.
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:24.720]  But as I said, Richard in Haas at the CFR, we can use his own quote.
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:26.080]  He said, these are made up.
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:27.080]  He says it.
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.520]  But we're going to have terror on one part, and then we're going to have the environment
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:33.520]  on the other for scarcity to wage war on the people.
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.200]  And they say, because when we have too much resources, we have time on our hands, we have
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:39.320]  liberty, we can politically get involved.
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:40.320]  There you go.
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:42.400]  We go back to the basic needs.
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.920]  The basic needs are met, people look for higher abstract things, self-actualization.
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:48.920]  That's the hierarchy of needs.
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:51.160]  That's the hierarchy of needs.
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:55.040]  And people then say, wow, we want liberty, we want freedom, but they're willing to give
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:00.040]  up their liberty and freedom if they need to eat, if they're thirsty, if they're worried
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:06.040]  about how they're going to afford a home for their family because of the oil prices going
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:08.160]  up and smashing the economy.
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:13.000]  What we need to do is show that these are lies, there is no age of scarcity.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.240]  The world is awash and petroleum.
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:18.120]  And the rest of this program, it's a cornucopia.
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  And I want to prove that.
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:20.760]  I've got just some news items.
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:26.120]  If we just do basic research, we're going to find there's oil coming out of the use,
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:27.720]  the old saying, out of the world's ears.
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:28.720]  Well, I want to be clear.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:29.720]  Because the planet patrolled you.
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:30.720]  I want to be clear.
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:31.720]  I have family.
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:35.240]  I don't myself that has some nice oil in Texas, in East Texas.
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.840]  And they don't like all the lies, even though it's making them make more money.
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:43.800]  I'm telling you, as somebody whose family's worked as petroleum geologists, worked in
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:48.240]  oil companies, worked as plant heads, worked as rough necks, the whole lease hounds, you
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:49.240]  know, we're Texans.
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  Are your families in it?
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:51.240]  I'm in it.
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:54.800]  And in East Texas, where my family's from, almost everybody's got an oil well.
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:56.960]  We call it mailbox money.
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  Well, we wake up in the morning, we smell oil, where I came from, Portland, just Texas.
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:01.960]  Exactly.
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.320]  And the thing is, is that everywhere they drill, they come, I mean, just shooting out,
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:06.320]  natural gas, helium.
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:11.000]  And the people's backyards in some place around Kilgore and other places in Texas.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  It's ridiculous.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.160]  And it's from Illinois to Oklahoma to Cal, Al Gore owns big oil fields in L.A.
[1:40:17.160 --> 1:40:18.160]  Well, he owns those.
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:20.200]  Here's the thing about Al Gore, we have to understand.
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:26.880]  Remember what we said, that the oil companies funded, founded, and sponsor the environmental
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:32.360]  organizations so that the environmental organizations can create the pretext of scarcity.
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:35.960]  We would love to build new refineries, but we can't because the environmentalists.
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:41.280]  We would love to go into the ocean, the offshore areas off of California and Oregon and over
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:44.560]  on the Atlantic side, but the environmentalists won't let us.
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:49.240]  And then, oh, and then Schumer gets on TV and says, we would have a one cent decrease
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:53.160]  in 20 years when I've had the executives on who were there.
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:58.280]  And they admit that on one North shore, there's almost as much as there is in Saudi Arabia.
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:02.280]  There's more in the whole area and it's almost sweet crude shooting out.
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:04.720]  And they want, they could put in five new pipelines in a year.
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:05.720]  They will not do it.
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:06.720]  Absolutely.
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:09.520]  Now, why would Al Gore promote this global warring?
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:11.040]  Why would he promote environmentalism?
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:12.400]  Why would he become the new guru?
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:15.400]  They'd rather have a monopoly than a free market price.
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:22.040]  Well, not only that, remember the Gore family, Albert Gore senior and now Albert Gore junior,
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.720]  their shields for Occidental Petroleum.
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.200]  Orman Hammer funded him.
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:31.120]  I mean, I can show you pictures of him sitting around the swimming pool together.
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:32.360]  He is the majority owner.
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:36.880]  I remember that when his dad died and then seeing press reports years ago, the former
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:43.040]  Senator Gore, that Al Gore now owned the controlling stock in Occidental.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:46.720]  So he's an oil man, just like Bush with Harkin Oil and the others.
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.640]  He's an oil man, Cheney with Halliburton, an oil servicing company.
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:55.160]  We have oil man, Al Gore is an oil man.
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.920]  He was brought up in oil.
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:03.920]  His father was a paid shield for Occidental Petroleum, which was owned by the way by a,
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:09.480]  and this is really an oxymoron, a communist capitalist, Armand Hammer, that every year
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:10.760]  ran back and forth.
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:15.160]  But it's just a visit with the, with Carol Wigley said who boss of a communist Russia.
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:16.560]  They want monopolies to deal with.
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:18.480]  So they help put the communists in.
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.760]  Well, Al Gore now is going to become a billionaire.
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:28.520]  He recently became one of the principles of a corporation worth $683 million, I believe.
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:30.320]  And they trade in the energy stocks.
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:31.320]  Yeah.
[1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:32.320]  Yeah.
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:33.320]  Absolutely.
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:36.880]  But remember, the important thing is they must create the scarcity that they're lying
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:37.880]  about.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:43.880]  And the only way they can create it is by bottling up all the world's oil, all the world's water,
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:45.960]  all the world's resource, including the food.
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:50.480]  That's why the agribusiness corporations, Willie Nelson has done a great thing.
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:55.760]  They have the little farmers, but they only are producing a small percentage of the food.
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:58.320]  It's the agribusiness corporations.
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:42:59.320]  They own this.
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:03.800]  Since they moved in now, well, was it 50 years ago this that we could supply the world three
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:07.560]  and a half times over with what we had currently.
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:11.240]  Now we are bringing 30 plus percent of our food in there.
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:12.240]  There is so much food.
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:16.440]  And the warehouses are bursting at the seams with food now around the world.
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:19.240]  You know, when I was a young man, they've been speculating and hoarding and waiting
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:20.240]  to sell.
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:23.760]  Well, of course, the commodity speculators, they are the speculators.
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:29.200]  If they drive up the price of wheat, 67 percent, they're the ones that own all the futures
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:30.360]  and the futures markets.
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:31.760]  Chicago is the.
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:32.760]  So they're holding.
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:34.040]  The world's leader of the world, the commodity.
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:35.040]  They're holding on to.
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:36.040]  Chicago or Illinois.
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:37.040]  Exactly.
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:38.040]  They're holding on to it to drive it up.
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:39.040]  Explain how that works.
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:43.920]  Well, first of all, they buy a futures, OK, which is really a bet.
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:48.240]  It's a Las Vegas bet saying that food prices will go up.
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:51.040]  And when they go up, they make billions of dollars.
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:53.760]  If the food prices don't go up, they don't make their billions.
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:58.760]  And so by holding the food just like the oil, they guarantee and rig the future to create
[1:43:58.760 --> 1:43:59.760]  scarcity.
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:03.720]  They can, for example, claim, because remember now, they're the angry business corporations.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:07.000]  They can claim there's a blight on wheat in the wheat supplies room.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  They can claim that that a that the winter frost killed the coffee down the South America.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  They can also blame it.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:15.880]  And I've actually looked at these numbers now.
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:21.680]  They can also blame it on the ethanol when that's a tiny fraction of it, which the Saudis
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:22.680]  want shut down.
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:26.720]  Well, and of course, ethanol is a silly thing because the world is a washing petroleum.
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:28.520]  It is silly, but they don't like it.
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:33.280]  Now I want to prove our point on this planet petroleum because a lot of people out there
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:36.200]  say I've heard so much about peak oil.
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:37.760]  Really we are running out of oil.
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:44.240]  Now first I want to mention that I began reading about peak oil back in the 1960s.
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.600]  And I would read articles that my dad also worked at an oil refinery and we would get
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:52.560]  all these oil and gas industry publications in.
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:54.880]  I would read them and there would be fear articles.
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:45:00.240]  For example, I remember specifically when I was a senior in high school, 1961, I read
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.200]  this article that really shook me up here.
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:09.600]  I was a 17 year old kid and what did it say, the world was running out of oil and by 1980
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:11.640]  there would be no more oil left in the world.
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:12.640]  By 1980.
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:13.640]  Yes.
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:14.640]  And we'd have an ice age too.
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:15.640]  Yeah.
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:18.880]  And they keep moving up the date of when the oil is going to run out.
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:22.640]  Like they say that we're about to have 10 years of super cooling, but that's the global
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:23.800]  warming coming.
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:29.440]  Well, you know, Alex, first of all, no one has ever looked at if it were true.
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:31.160]  I wish global warming was a fact.
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:32.160]  Well, let me tell you why.
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:33.160]  The Haberian Maxim.
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:34.160]  I see no.
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:35.160]  It does.
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.480]  And, and, and farmers could plant more crops, there would be more food.
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:42.840]  It would be a green, green world if we had global warming because the frost wouldn't come
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:43.840]  and kill off things.
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:45.440]  They'd have vineyards again in London.
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:46.440]  Absolutely.
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:49.320]  And if the Arctic ice melted, guess what?
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:52.880]  We could take those icebergs as a break and off, bring them and that would be the water
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:53.880]  source.
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:54.880]  Well, well, Texas.
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:55.880]  Wow.
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:56.880]  Exactly.
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:59.200]  But wait, they could, you know, bring those around, pull them around and you would
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:02.600]  have billions, trillions of barrels of water.
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.560]  But wait, then you could get through the permafrost, which wouldn't exist anymore.
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:10.600]  And all of the oil in the Arctic, can you imagine we would really be a washable?
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:12.080]  Let's have global warming.
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:17.400]  But listen, there is, unfortunately, unfortunately, there is no global warming because as you
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:23.960]  know, you well know, your researcher, the, the world's four top weather tracking organizations
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:29.800]  now say we are going into a global cooling because the sun had heated up briefly.
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:30.800]  Now it's cool.
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  Yeah.
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:34.600]  And the entire solar system's moons, a natural cyclical thing.
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:40.320]  Well, I mean, take, take Mars, ice cap was receding and now it's getting bigger again.
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:43.640]  They just started and they have exact measurements with the, with the satellites, but I have
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:47.080]  David Rothschild on and he just said, Nope, there's no ice caps.
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:51.200]  And I, and we confronted Robert Kennedy, Jr. He said, there's no ice caps on the Mars.
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:52.200]  Everybody knows that.
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:56.280]  And then they went, he went on to say a Rothschild that Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:57.280]  sun than earth.
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:02.600]  Well, you know, in Minnesota, you go up to Duluth, Minnesota.
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:05.560]  And I'll tell you in the wintertime, there's plenty of ice and snow.
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:06.560]  Okay.
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.920]  I love the people in Minnesota don't want to live there.
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:09.920]  But you know what?
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:13.140]  You go there in, in, in summertime and it actually gets pretty hot there.
[1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:15.560]  There is no ice in the summer in Minnesota.
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:17.080]  Does that mean we're in global warming?
[1:47:17.080 --> 1:47:19.120]  No, it means we've gone into a new season.
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  It's summertime.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  Here's the.
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:25.280]  They also fair monger every summer in the middle of August, they'll be saying record
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:26.280]  heat.
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:27.280]  And I'm going to, I grew up in Dallas.
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:29.160]  I remember 115 days.
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:30.640]  I remember a red sun.
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.640]  I remember the grass all dead and they're telling me in Texas at 105 some deadly super
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:36.640]  wave.
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:39.880]  I have seen the mercury in 115 for a month straight.
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:44.960]  The Algors of this world cannot wait for June, July and August to get here when the
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:49.320]  temperature naturally every summer goes up and then they can say, psychology, psychology.
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:50.320]  Yeah.
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:51.320]  Here's an example.
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:55.960]  If, if you give people the scientific name for water, uh, they will say bannet or you
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:59.600]  tell them, uh, sodium chloride, should we make kids eat sodium chloride?
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  Oh, no, bannet.
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  Yeah, man.
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  It's bad for them.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:04.960]  If they didn't have sodium chloride, people would die.
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:05.960]  They've got to have a certain.
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:06.960]  I mean, that's my point.
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:07.960]  Yeah.
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:08.960]  Texture.
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:09.960]  So I've been going back to satellites.
[1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:14.240]  They have now said five years ago, we're going to have a spy satellite to watch farmers.
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.480]  Make sure you're not planting trees in environmental areas.
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:18.400]  Make sure you're not cutting down things.
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:21.520]  They're now saying they want to cut down trees because they also put out carbon dioxide.
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:23.280]  That was the new thing that now trees are bad.
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:28.400]  Uh, and, and I mean, that was yesterday and there's actually haters of nature.
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:29.400]  They are.
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:30.400]  They're haters of nature.
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:31.400]  Yeah.
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:32.400]  Let's be clear.
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:33.400]  They claim to be lovers, but they were haters.
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:34.400]  They claim they want to save the earth.
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  But that was my next point.
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:36.800]  Why do they really love to hurt it?
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:42.960]  Well, you know, around the Chicago, Illinois, uh, when, uh, you know, the old, uh, horse,
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:45.640]  uh, Greeley saying, go west, young man, go west.
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:49.600]  Well, many people moved to Illinois, uh, in the United States and settle around there.
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:50.920]  At that time, they didn't have any trees.
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:52.120]  They brought trees from the east.
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  They planted them.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:54.440]  And then of course the seeds went through there.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:55.760]  That's why there's more trees now.
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  There were.
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:57.760]  Yeah.
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:48:58.760]  There's, there's more trees in America than there were a hundred years ago.
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:02.200]  It's more green than, than it was interestingly enough though, environmental organizations
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:08.120]  in Illinois are now demanding they, they have actually counted, they say the trees
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:13.480]  in suburban Illinois, uh, Chicago, they say they're 80,000 trees and they're demanding
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:15.320]  those trees be cut down.
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:17.840]  They want to cut down all the 80,000 trees.
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  Why?
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:24.760]  They say, well, originally Illinois was a plain state and it had all these grasses.
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  Yeah.
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:26.760]  See, that's the term.
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:27.760]  We want to return to the native grasses.
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:28.760]  Yeah.
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  Yeah.
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:30.760]  Your new trees are an invasive species.
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:31.760]  Yeah.
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:32.760]  But see, that's it.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  Well, they're beautiful trees.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.040]  And for, you know, listen, listen, thankfully, listen, they make, yeah, they make you do
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:41.240]  asinine things because they know psychologically, you know, as a psychology professor, you
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:45.280]  know, if they can make you do something stupid, they can make you do anything else they want.
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  Yes.
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:49.880]  Now, if it's true that Illinois once was grassland and they want to cut down all the
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:55.520]  trees and return to grasslands, but at one time was not Illinois ice covered.
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:49:56.520]  Yes.
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:58.040]  Why don't we return to the ice then?
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:02.840]  At one time it was, uh, at what historical point do we go back to, you know, but at one
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:04.400]  point it was an inland sea.
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:05.400]  There was the inland sea.
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:10.520]  Well, of course, all of these things are a means of mind control of causing radical
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:15.480]  transformation in society, just like this new reality, this age of scarcity.
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:20.880]  Now, what I, what I would really like to is to give some evidence of how we are a wash
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:21.880]  in petroleum, Alex.
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:22.880]  Okay.
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:23.880]  Stay there.
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:25.400]  You don't need to have the tools, any ammunition to use.
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:26.400]  Stay there.
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:27.400]  I want to come back down during this break.
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:32.680]  If people are watching on presentplanet.tv or if people, uh, are, uh, listening on the
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:36.120]  info wars.com streams, they'll be able to hear me and text talk about another subject.
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:38.200]  We're going to come back and finish up with that.
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:40.920]  Alex Mars in studio with us, absolutely amazing.
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:50.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:52.200]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:56.720]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:50:58.240]  hour there is hope.
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:01.080]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:05.520]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:07.040]  world order master plan.
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:11.300]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:51:11.300 --> 1:51:16.680]  In the info war, presentplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:19.520]  Presentplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:24.080]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:27.120]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:31.280]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:32.720]  online video library.
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:37.160]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much
[1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:38.160]  more.
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:43.640]  The info war is waiting for you to set it free, join presentplanet.tv, burn the info bombs
[1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:50.240]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the new world order, presentplanet.tv.
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:53.480]  The election cycle draws near and we don't have much time left.
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:57.460]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now
[1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:00.720]  with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:04.760]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:10.360]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating,
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:14.520]  and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:18.360]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:22.200]  spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:25.640]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:30.240]  only two choices, be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:33.640]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since freedom
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:37.800]  to fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:41.320]  We invite you to make the change, help take back our government now.
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:45.600]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the tools you need for the information war.
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:47.680]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:50.440]  Visit TakeBackWashington.com
[1:52:50.440 --> 1:52:54.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:52:59.600]  the water?
[1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:03.480]  Yes, because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:04.480]  the skin.
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:09.120]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to

[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:15.960]  algae, and fungus.

[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:21.800]  comes first.
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:26.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.040]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:57.360]  OK, we're coming back in fast here, got to keep Tex a little bit in the next hour, he's
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:01.960]  going to have to do that, Texmars.com will give you all the contact info, how to get his
[1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:04.520]  free newsletter in a lot more in a few minutes.
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:08.680]  But before we do that, I want to be clear here, using the satellites, having local police
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:13.880]  dial into them, spying on you, micromanaging, that federalizes the locals, violates your
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:18.480]  Fourth Amendment, you think you're under control and surveillance now, it's all going
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:23.040]  to be done of the guys of saving the earth, meanwhile they're doing the genetic engineering
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:25.880]  and everything that really is hurting the earth.
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:31.000]  So we have all of that going on, and meanwhile you read them on Santo documents and they
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.520]  say, you know, we're going to contaminate everything, then claim ownership of the world,
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:40.800]  this is systematic wrecking of economy, systematic destruction, artificial scarcity, Texmars,
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:44.160]  please continue with all the points you were going to make about that, about the depression,
[1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:47.600]  how they had the milk trucks, how they really had plenty, how they cut down on the credit,
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:50.520]  artificially did it, all the news articles, you've got the floor.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:59.000]  Well, it's important to understand that these are contrived chaos events, contrived chaos.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.600]  Remember the elitist motto, even 33rd degree freemasonry, is Ardo abayo, order out of chaos,
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:11.520]  they create the chaos, and now they're doing it with oil and the economy, they're doing
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:20.320]  it with food, and they're doing it with water, not to even mention the contrived terrorism
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:24.440]  that we have today, that is the umbrella for all this, what I want people to know though
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  is we can fight back, we can fight back, how do we do it, when they say that we're moving
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:35.640]  into an age of scarcity and all of our lives have to change, and we have to become a third
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:40.040]  world impoverished nation, and we just have to suck it up, that's just too bad, and we
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:45.920]  have to put up with $4, even $10 at the gas pump for a gallon of gasoline, we need to
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:52.680]  say no, absolutely a lie, there is no age of scarcity, we are planet petroleum, we're
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:58.200]  planet aqua, we've got plenty, and we need to prove it, because we can't prove it.
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:00.280]  Wait a minute, the blue planet has no water.
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:05.160]  Well, it does have water, of course there's water, there's water everywhere, there's always
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:06.160]  been water everywhere.
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:08.760]  The water is deadly poised and we must tax it.
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:14.600]  Well, yeah, there's carbon dioxide, there's solutions that they come up with, of course,
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:19.520]  it's like in the food area, I understand that Barack Obama introduced as a senator introduced
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:26.240]  legislation that would tax the American people, one and a half percent of their income, the
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:32.040]  money would go, again this is a new tax levied against us, the money then, the billions that
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:37.800]  they plunder from the people would go to the United Nations to feed the hungry of the world.
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:42.080]  And then that means, just like Bill Gates gives 80 plus billion of the Warren Buffett,
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.920]  you hear it's to help Africans, it's to sterilize them, give them HIV, they've been caught,
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:52.640]  force them to eat GMO food, force big agrarian, all the help they give you is really an assault,
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:54.240]  it's just like taking money from the money.
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:58.680]  Oh, absolutely, John McCain on the other hand, to show that we're not knocking any one political
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:05.560]  candidate, John McCain on the other hand said, hey, for this summer only, let's knock off
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:11.920]  the tax for the gasoline, that'll save everybody $30 a month, isn't that great?
[1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:15.960]  But he doesn't see any problem at all with gasoline tripling in price.
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:21.640]  He probably would not see one problem with gasoline going to $10 a gallon and all companies
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:22.640]  enriching themselves.
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:24.440]  Well, that's a tax for the globalist right there.
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:25.440]  Well, it is.
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:31.000]  So, they say no problem with the oil company profits being at spectacular record highs and
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.400]  these contrived shortages.
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:36.520]  And I remember hearing them 10 years ago, 5 years ago on NPR, my wife listens to it cooking
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:42.400]  dinner and I listen and it's always soon the Americans will learn, oh, I can't wait,
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:46.040]  we're so greedy and bad, soon, you know, we've been living outside our means.
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:50.160]  Oh, oh, sure, you shouldn't be driving around those big cars and going places.
[1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:54.280]  And by the way, you should be living in those cramped cities, you know, you should be living
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:55.360]  downtown.
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.640]  After all, you shouldn't, what are you doing in the suburbs?
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:01.560]  Smart growth, that was, you know, that waste, but really it's all about control.
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:04.640]  And I know a lot of wealthy people, they say, well, you know what, so what, I can pay five
[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:05.640]  bucks a gallon for gas.
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:09.120]  Yeah, but their businesses are connected to the general public who can't.
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:10.600]  This is going to hurt everybody.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:17.640]  I don't, I don't think that McCain or Obama or Hillary Clinton or George Bush have ever
[1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:21.520]  driven up to an Exxon and put gasoline in their car.
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:25.360]  Remember, George Bush senior, they don't do that, he doesn't know what a grocery store
[1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:26.360]  scanner is.
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:27.360]  Exactly.
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:28.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:29.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:31.880]  It just shocked him.
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:40.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:46.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:49.560]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:49.560 --> 1:58:55.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:01.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:09.120]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:14.120]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:18.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:21.120]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:22.120]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  They're not after money.
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:24.120]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:24.120 --> 1:59:25.120]  They're after power.

[1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:43.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:54.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:54.480 --> 2:00:11.560]  All right, Texas, it does come out that there's tons of oil, a lot of the truth does come
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:12.560]  out.
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:17.360]  It's just the general public is still convinced that summer is global warming, and I noticed
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:21.560]  the propaganda intensifies then, continue here with what's really happening.
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:25.240]  Well, let's look at this planet awash with oil.
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:30.120]  Here I have from Yahoo, one of the major American news sources.
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:36.040]  This claim, it says, all futures jump to record over $115 a barrel on supply concerns.
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:38.240]  In other words, we're running low.
[2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:39.440]  We don't have enough.
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:44.880]  But wait, wait, you know, the foreign press doesn't seem to want to lie as much as the
[2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:45.880]  American press.
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:47.360]  Maybe it's not as control.
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:49.080]  Here's the times of London.
[2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:54.480]  Now, just as Mighty and Newspaper, as I was mentioning, as the New York Times or the Chicago
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:57.480]  Tribune or the Houston Chronicle, what does it say?
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:03.960]  World not running out of oil, say experts, and it begins, says, doom-laden forecast that
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:09.800]  world oil supplies are poised to fall off the edge of the cliff or wide off the mark,
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:13.200]  according to leading oil industry experts.
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:14.200]  Wow.
[2:01:14.200 --> 2:01:18.080]  Who would have known would John McCain tell us this?
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:19.080]  Would Barack Obama?
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  Would Hillary?
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:21.080]  Would George W?
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:22.080]  Now, here's something interesting.
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:28.400]  If we want to see that the world is awash with oil, remember what I said was it's not
[2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:31.040]  a matter of how much oil in the world.
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:32.040]  The world has to...
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:33.040]  It's a delivery system.
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:38.360]  It's a delivery system which is controlled, a contrived crisis to drive up the prices.
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:42.960]  Well, it's like diamonds are really on the mid-scale or lower-scale of even semi-precious.
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  They're not even highly semi-precious.
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:48.720]  I mean, in Africa, they just lay around on the ground, but people will fight, mortgage
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.680]  their house, work a year to pay for a big rock for their wife, because that's the symbol,
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:57.160]  and literally they have giant warehouses just filled with diamonds.
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:59.600]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:05.960]  Maybe people haven't heard about the oil discovery done in Brazil, but listen to this from Bloomberg.com.
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:06.960]  Bloomberg, okay?
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:11.760]  One of the top sources of financial and industry information in the world.
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:12.760]  It says Petrobras.
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:19.000]  Now, that's the petroleum company that's owned by the nation of Brazil, okay?
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:24.560]  Now, Petrobras, by the way, is a corporation as big as Microsoft General Motors and General
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:25.680]  Electric.
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:28.560]  It's right there in the top five in all of the Americas.
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:34.000]  It says Petrobras discovers world's third largest oil field.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  This just came out.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Listen to this.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.360]  This is a story that just ran April 14th.
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:46.880]  It says Petrolio Brasilia, that's Petrobras, offshore, Carioca, feel may hold 33 million
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:52.560]  barrels of oil, enough to supply every refinery in the United States for six years, making
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:57.840]  it the third largest oil field ever discovered off of Brazil in the Atlantic.
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:00.040]  Can you imagine the oil there?
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:01.040]  Petrobras?
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:02.040]  Amazing.
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:03.280]  And the Russians are founded.
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:07.000]  Everybody's, it's just everywhere, it's just, listen, the United States, according to the
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:13.240]  industry experts so-called, claim that we have 29 billion barrels in reserve.
[2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:17.320]  Hey, they've got 33 billion down there in Brazil.
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:19.400]  Forget about Hugo Chavez and Venezuela.
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:21.280]  I'm talking about Brazil.
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:24.480]  Did you know that the Brazilian stock market went wild with this?
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:29.240]  The telephone companies, anything that's Brazilian went wild, I mean, is booming right
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:30.240]  now.
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:31.240]  Why?
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:33.120]  They have oil that's going to be coming out their ears.
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:34.560]  But wait, that's not all.
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:37.280]  Look, why do you think we're in Kosovo?
[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:38.960]  Again, just like why we're in Iraq.
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:44.640]  Look at this, look at this news item, large potential Albanian, that's right there in
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:50.280]  the Kosovo area, oil and gas discovery underscores Kosovo's importance.
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:54.440]  One reason that I read 10 years ago that they staged the invasion was because they found
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.440]  oil, uranium, silver, nickel.
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:57.440]  There it is.
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:03:58.440]  Oh.
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:03:59.440]  There is a confirmation.
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:01.360]  Al Qaeda helped again to take over the country.
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:03.640]  Now let's look at the United States itself, okay?
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:07.560]  Oh, well, we have to get 60% of our oil from foreign sources.
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:08.560]  Really?
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:13.440]  Well, look at this, the Bakken Oil Formation, welcome to the next oil boom.
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:20.520]  The U.S. Geological Survey has just published its official results of a groundbreaking study
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:22.200]  over up in North Dakota.
[2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:23.200]  Who would have believed it?
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:25.320]  South of North Dakota and Montana.
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:30.200]  They have found a store of oil that could last America, could take care of all of our
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:33.600]  oldies for a thousand years in South of North Dakota.
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:36.760]  Final segment with Tex Mars, then Michael Hoffman coming up.
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:38.720]  We're going to take this break and then be right back.

[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:51.080]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:55.160]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth and those crow's feet
[2:05:55.160 --> 2:05:56.680]  over by my eyes.
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:00.600]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those
[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:01.600]  wrinkles.
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:03.920]  Then I heard about a product called Tottenall.
[2:06:03.920 --> 2:06:08.320]  Tottenall is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce
[2:06:08.320 --> 2:06:11.280]  the appearance of wrinkles, and it works.

[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.200]  Hemp, used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:01.400]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:04.680]  grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[2:07:04.680 --> 2:07:08.160]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:53.800]  Please the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:53.800 --> 2:08:00.040]  It is the final segment with Tex Mars.
[2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:04.960]  I'm going to recap briefly what's happened with the never-teen Paul Freemurder and that's
[2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:09.400]  even what mainstream television, before we finish up with how they're having these contrived
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:16.680]  artificial scarcity stacks in this key area that you're exposing.
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:19.560]  You said you were watching Nancy Grayson, she was saying this is suspicious.
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:22.640]  We played some clips from Fox where they're saying it's suspicious.
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:28.320]  This is getting ridiculous when the prostitute under who was a college professor going to
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:34.000]  get an extra PhD at the time was facing six months in jail and hung herself saying she
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:39.240]  was going to shoot her mouth off and then now she's telling everybody if they kill
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.040]  me, I was killed, I'm not going to kill myself, then they have this government spook type
[2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:48.200]  come out who makes up all this stuff and has a history of it saying she just called me
[2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:52.600]  and said she was going to kill herself and then the media runs with that, I mean they
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:54.680]  are really getting desperate.
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.640]  Well they're getting desperate but they're also getting bold.
[2:08:57.640 --> 2:09:02.520]  They're shameless and by the way, the Nancy Graces, the Fox News, we'll see how far they
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:07.080]  go with this because this is an explosive issue and it could go up as you mentioned
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:11.120]  to the McCain's and the Cheneys and so forth.
[2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:15.960]  I think we also need to look for Vicki Iceman, you know, is she still available?
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:17.320]  Is she still alive?
[2:09:17.320 --> 2:09:18.320]  Where is she?
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:23.200]  Did you hear about this weird thing with McCain's little girl that he was having a little
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:24.200]  tea to teat with?
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:28.040]  Well, there was a high level CIA operative who did things with a police chief and CIA
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:35.600]  director and was all over TV and headed up one of the regional intelligence agent groups,
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:40.280]  clubs and the cops reportedly started chasing him, he ran and then he stops.
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:44.480]  Well, first they said he ran, he didn't run, he gets out of the car nicely and they blast
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:45.480]  him.
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:47.240]  So it turns out the first story was a lie and it's on video.
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:50.640]  The cop just walks up, the guy's there and the cop's shooting and of course we know they
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:54.240]  have hitmen on the police forces in every major city, especially Houston, as one of
[2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:55.240]  the worst.
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:10:00.440]  I mean now there's a lot of weird stuff going on and this local Palestinian had Israelis
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:04.920]  with machine guns running around in his yard, the neighbor said and he was an activist,
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:06.080]  peaceful activist.
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:10.400]  He was a school teacher and then they tortured him to death and duct tape all over his body,
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:13.360]  threw it in the river and the APD first said, oh yeah, he was murdered.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:17.160]  I talked to people at TV stations that heard the scanners and the police said that too,
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:20.680]  that yeah, we thought he was murdered and then no, the higher up said, no, no, no, this
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:23.520]  is quite normal to be all tied up and sliced up.
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:24.520]  Yeah.
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:31.480]  Well, it goes all the way back to the LBJ era when the guy was shot 32 times in the back
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:32.960]  and they said he committed suicide.
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:37.240]  He was one of the guys that knew the truth about the voting irregularities.
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:38.240]  But that's when you know it's the government.
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:40.240]  And the LBJ election.
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:44.640]  Because if it's a normal murder, they'll actually go around and maybe investigate.
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:48.320]  But when it's a government op, you could, I mean, the cops walk up and execute this
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:50.080]  guy and they're saying, oh, it's no big deal.
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:51.720]  You know, Alex, I've known you for quite a while now.
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:57.040]  I know you're a precious wife, a violent, you're a happy guy because you love to expose
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:58.040]  evil in the world.
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:02.200]  I think it gives you happiness to do that and thank God for that, that kind of attitude.
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:06.880]  And that's why, I'm going to say it right now, Alex Jones would never, ever, ever commit
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  suicide.
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  Neither would Tex Barnes.
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:10.720]  No, I don't even believe that's at silliness.
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:12.360]  They're going to have to torture me all the way to death.
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:13.360]  Are you kidding?
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  I want to live as long as possible.
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:15.360]  Absolutely.
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:16.360]  Hey, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:17.360]  I wake up with a smile.
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:18.960]  I told my wife, I want to be resuscitated.
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:20.960]  I want to be Darth Vader.
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.480]  I mean, do not unplug me if I'm going to come over 20 years.
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:27.320]  I told her, I mean, I want full.
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:28.560]  Well, here's the whole thing though.
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:30.600]  We see with the Palfrey case.
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:35.240]  It doesn't matter that you go on the air and tell everybody, I will never commit suicide.
[2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:38.600]  They're going to kill you anyway because they think they can cover it up.
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:40.200]  They're that bold now.
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:43.240]  Here you and I are right here on national radio and TV.
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:45.600]  We're saying we will never kill ourselves.
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:52.520]  And we, and people know that, but if we're ever suicided, you know, they don't care.
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:55.920]  Even though people are going to remember the fact, hey, I'll listen to Alex and Tex that
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:11:56.920]  day.
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:11:57.920]  They'll never kill themselves.
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  And we never would.
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:01.000]  I made the joke last week in a month ago.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.700]  I say they're going to start killing us on TV with them shooting us and say it's suicide.
[2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:07.480]  And now they're basically doing that in Houston.
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:11.360]  One of the, one of the things that happens here is this does create fear.
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:16.920]  If they can kill this Palfrey girl who's had all this visibility, who might they kill?
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:20.840]  I mean, if the little people of the world have no chance at all, if they could kill
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:25.480]  an Alex Jones or a Tex Morris or a Deborah Palfrey, this is the fear.
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:31.960]  I think they may even enjoy the fact that it's like, yeah, Palfrey can say, I would
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  never kill myself.
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:36.840]  And the next thing you know, they're claiming she committed suicide.
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:42.240]  So, so I think this is another way of creating this psychological alchemy of fear.
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:43.240]  I agree.
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:47.040]  But also the way they hung her in the shed, you know, she pulls up under the little car
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:50.560]  port, little thing outside of trailer, you know, they, they stun gunner, they take her
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:51.560]  in and hang her.
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:52.560]  That's their fate.
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.360]  Just like they killed the other girl that worked for her.
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:56.600]  I mean, I mean, what if they killed 10 of her girls?
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:57.600]  Yeah.
[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:01.200]  I mean, it just gets more and more, but, but they do run the risk of losing all credibility.
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:03.520]  I mean, Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:04.520]  Bush has a 30%.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:05.520]  That's right.
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:06.520]  That's right.
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:10.920]  And here again, we go back to this energy situation, to the food situation, to the water
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:15.280]  situation, what, what Americans need to do, what listeners need to do that are, that
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:16.760]  are hearing us today.
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:21.160]  We need to go to the sources of truth and we need to discover the fact that the world
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:27.040]  has plenty of oil, plenty of food, plenty of water, and we can get much more through
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:31.880]  increased technology, which we have right now with new, the new drilling technology.
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:36.040]  Let me, let me tell you, we can go to the middle of the Atlantic and go down thousands
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:41.280]  of feet and bring up all the oil that we would ever need for 10,000 years.
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:44.620]  And so we need to say, you're lying to us just like with 9 11.
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:48.960]  We need to prove these people that they're nothing but a bunch of inveterate liars.
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:51.760]  Now, if we do that, we can turn things around.
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:56.240]  Speaking of new drilling technology, I have a uncle and they drilled on his property a
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:59.240]  couple of months ago, 16,000 foot well.
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:00.240]  Wow.
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:02.120]  And I mean, it's like the spindle top.
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:03.120]  Yeah.
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:04.120]  I mean, it is.
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:06.240]  That's more than three miles down, you see.
[2:14:06.240 --> 2:14:09.040]  They got a 12 inch pipe on it.
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:15.040]  Well, of course, if we do have global warming, then they can just pull those, those icebergs
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:18.480]  over to the coast and there's trillions of barrels of water.
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:22.520]  Of course, there's, we don't, we, we, we have the resources.
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:24.640]  People need to understand that we have the food.
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:28.680]  When I was a young man, people were starving in India.
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:34.440]  Would you believe that with new agricultural methods and technology, India now feeds itself
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:38.560]  and even, you know, exports, which really makes the globalist man.
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:39.560]  Of course.
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:45.120]  So we have incredible amounts of desert land that's being turned into, uh, through, you
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:50.240]  know, arable, uh, water, uh, driven form land.
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:53.120]  There will always be enough food in the world.
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:56.440]  By the way, I've seen a bunch of studies, um, they go, those are oil company studies.
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:00.360]  No, no, these are, these are studies separate, you know, just studying plants.
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:04.320]  Plants will like as much as 14 times higher carbon dioxide.
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:07.000]  They use less water, live longer or healthier.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:11.880]  And they're now doing studies showing desification is in periods with low carbon dioxide.
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:14.640]  And they're reporting from ice cores going back millions of years.
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:16.660]  But the really reliable was 200,000.
[2:15:16.660 --> 2:15:20.040]  This is the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever.
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:25.080]  And they're saying it is massively associated with desertification and that, and then sure
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.400]  enough, because it did spike the last few decades, now it's going to start going back
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:29.400]  down.
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:33.280]  Suddenly there was more of a greening, the plants need it.
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:37.680]  And then they create more oxygen, which they've now shown that mammals like higher levels.
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:39.760]  We're in a starved level right now.
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:45.200]  Well, of course, nature will take care of that on its own without man made, uh, uh,
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:46.200]  solutions.
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:49.080]  Let's go back to this old, uh, situation.
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:54.040]  I mentioned the, the Bakken oil formation in North and South Dakota, but there's a bigger
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:16:02.440]  one out in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004, uh, BP oil, Exxon, a mobile, uh, and another one
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:11.040]  of the larger multinational conglomerates found the largest reservoir store of oil ever found
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:12.040]  in the United States.
[2:16:12.040 --> 2:16:14.000]  This dwarfs everything.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:18.800]  It means that America will have enough oil for thousands and thousands of years in the
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:20.480]  Gulf of Mexico.
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:25.320]  Now when they discovered this in 2004, they said that, that the, the oil could become,
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:29.840]  begin coming out of that area, uh, within a decade, within a decade.
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:31.440]  That means six years from now.
[2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:35.120]  So you would think the oil futures would already be taking that into account.
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:38.880]  Imagine, now they say that this is so much, they've laid off, uh, they've laid most of
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:39.880]  it off limits.
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:44.120]  Uh, they found a 600 square mile one off the coast of Louisiana, I know in the seventies
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:46.320]  and then they just said it was a refuge.
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:49.160]  Well the same thing down in Mexico.
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:52.560]  Now I think what we're going to see some lies, there's going to be reasons why they can't
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:53.560]  get that oil.
[2:16:53.560 --> 2:16:59.040]  For example, Mexico, you know, P mix, the oil company down there, they have been keeping
[2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:00.960]  that oil in the ground.
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:04.400]  The, uh, Mexico is a very poor nation.
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:05.840]  Three times the resources we have though.
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:10.680]  We have, they want the tens of millions of illegal aliens to, to attack and come into
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:11.680]  it.
[2:17:11.680 --> 2:17:13.120]  They don't want them to have money down there.
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:14.120]  Right.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:16.520]  So they have bottled up their own oil, P mix.
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:18.680]  Everybody has been confused, frustrated.
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:20.400]  Why is it that they don't drill more?
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:22.920]  Why don't they bring more out of the P mix?
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:24.640]  Why don't we bring a lot of Alaska?
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:25.640]  Same deal.
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:26.640]  We're, we're out of time.
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:28.760]  It is such an honor to have you here.
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:34.840]  Please plug how people get a copy of days of hunger, days of pain, uh, days of, uh, chaos.

[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:13.560]  and how we can overcome the lies of the elite.
[2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:14.560]  That's right.
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:15.800]  You have a free newsletter that's just amazing.
[2:18:15.800 --> 2:18:19.640]  Also you have a radio show once a week that airs, what, three or four times on WWCR?
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:24.840]  And of course we have it audio streaming, you know, 24 seven there on power of prophecy.com.
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:31.000]  But I want to encourage people to call 1-800 toll free 234-9673.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.040]  And all they have to do is say, Hey, send me that free newsletter.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:34.040]  Give it out.
[2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:37.640]  A lot of hardcore issues, all, I mean, neurotically, well researched.
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.760]  You're very, just like me, you really try to get to all the facts.
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  Give them the number again.
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:42.760]  Okay.
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:47.560]  That's toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:53.520]  And they'll know the truth about this hoax called the age of scarcity, this new reality,
[2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:57.280]  this new psychological alchemy that they're pushing down on us.
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:18:59.160]  Do not accept it folks.
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:00.240]  Say no.
[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:01.240]  Just say no.
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:04.760]  And just like 9-11, we're not going to accept the official version.
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:07.160]  This is a planet of plenty.
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:09.360]  It is not a planet of scarcity.
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.760]  Again, power of prophecy.com, texamars.com, the book, days of hunger, days of chaos,
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:19.480]  the GMO foods, the control of food, all of it, the coming great food shortages in America.
[2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:22.080]  We're at 9 years ago, more important now than ever.
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:23.080]  The number again, tex.
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:24.080]  Okay.
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:25.080]  Toe free 1-800-234-9673.
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:32.880]  Of course, we have a lot of free things there and my newest book, by the way, it's codexmagic.
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:33.880]  And I know it's available.
[2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:35.880]  But we hope they get it from you guys.
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:39.840]  Well, I don't care where they get it from at all because it's not a matter of money.
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:41.800]  This is a matter of life and truth.
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:42.800]  You are the best, my friend.
[2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:43.800]  Thank you.
[2:19:43.800 --> 2:19:44.800]  All right.
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:45.800]  We'll love for about one minute here.
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:46.800]  Say bye to everybody.
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:47.800]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:48.800]  A new world order.
[2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:49.800]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:50.800]  It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:51.800]  But their objective being world domination.
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:20:05.800]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:05.800 --> 2:20:11.720]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:20:11.720 --> 2:20:16.160]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:21.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:21.600 --> 2:20:25.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:28.160]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  Most people have no idea.
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:30.160]  They're not after money.
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:31.160]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:32.160]  They're after power.
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:33.160]  That's their after-easy.

[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:47.080]  You have been warned.
[2:20:47.080 --> 2:20:48.640]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:52.360]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:56.620]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one
[2:20:56.620 --> 2:20:58.360]  huge political voting block.
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:02.400]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:06.200]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:07.200]  of conscience.
[2:21:07.200 --> 2:21:10.840]  The history and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be
[2:21:10.840 --> 2:21:11.840]  kept separate.
[2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:15.960]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.520]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:23.000]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  resulted.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:27.720]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:30.520]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:31.520]  Protestant America?
[2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:32.960]  Awake before it is too late.
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:34.760]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:36.580]  Jesus is coming soon.

[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:10.760]  crime are brought to justice.

[2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:22.040]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:32.640]  I'm with us for the next two hours.
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:34.760]  He's been gracious enough to move back 20 minutes.
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:35.760]  Here's the Paul Free Murder.
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:38.880]  He'll be with us 20 minutes into overdrive.
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:43.400]  I want to take our time here today and attempt to not throw in my points and added things
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  and back up what he's saying, but really riveting important information, understand the world
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:53.160]  we live in and how the nature of reality has been hidden from us in false images and false
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:56.360]  maps have been downloaded into our minds.
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:01.320]  He is an alternative historian, award-winning, a former AP writer based in New York.
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:05.320]  He's written some books that have been best-sellers, very well-received, and we're going to break
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:07.880]  down a whole host of issues, the cornucopia.
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:12.280]  I want to start at the beginning today and go back to the roots of this, go through it
[2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:14.840]  all with our guest today.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:17.120]  Thank you for coming on with us, Mr. Hoffman.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:18.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:22.360]  We are, this is a short segment, we'll come back in a long one, but just begin wherever
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:24.240]  you like, whatever you think's most important.
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:28.240]  If you were talking to a new audience, which most of my listeners are for you, and trying
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:36.200]  to explain it to an informed population, but also people that may not have a full understanding.
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.920]  Well, I think I'd like to go back to what we discussed last time.
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:44.400]  You raised an issue, and then I heard a commercial on the program that set off something in my
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:48.040]  mind, and you mentioned, you said, where is it?
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:49.720]  Who's responsible?
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:55.280]  Where do we trace this cryptocracy, this conspiracy up to the top?
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:57.640]  You said, is it a German conspiracy?
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:03.320]  And then there was an add-on saying that we were headed to a papal America, that whenever
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:06.320]  church and state are united, that brings about tyranny.
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:07.320]  Is it a Zionist?
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:08.320]  Is it a Yom?
[2:26:08.320 --> 2:26:09.320]  Yeah.
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:14.840]  When I hear that, I realize that there's more confusion out there than I even realized,
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:19.200]  because I think we have to follow a trail in the West, and what my remarks today will
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:23.400]  be about Western civilization, the cryptocracy, as it operates in the West.
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:25.400]  Now, I want to be clear.
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  I want to stop you, though.
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:29.520]  I don't have confusion about this.
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:34.760]  We're all broken, though, into subgroups, fighting over which group runs it with most
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:37.560]  of our collective energies and the movement spent on that.
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:38.560]  I don't do that.
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:39.560]  You don't do that.
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:43.720]  I understand it's a methodology that infects all the major groups, but with some core groups
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:46.400]  operating, I just want to be clear for the audience.
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:54.520]  Well, you know, I see that when we're trying to find a way of ameliorating the cancer plague,
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:58.520]  and one of the ways that the system keeps us from doing that is they plant the idea
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:01.640]  that everything causes cancer, so why bother?
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:04.960]  When we're dealing with the assassination of President Kennedy, and we're trying to
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:09.800]  bring the criminal masterminds who were behind that to justice, one of the ways they obstruct
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:13.520]  us is they plant the idea that everybody killed Kennedy.
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  It was the communists.
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:15.520]  It was the anti-communists.
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:16.520]  It was the CIA.
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:17.520]  It was the KGB.
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:23.600]  So, when we have these agents of confusion sowing this, some of it is honest confusion,
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:24.600]  of course.
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:29.240]  Not everyone is an agent, but when the agents of disinformation or confusion are out there,
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:32.440]  we can't begin to proceed from first principles.
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:36.640]  And I find so many people are in difficulty because they're not proceeding from first
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:37.640]  principles.
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:39.680]  So, for me, the first principle is...
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:43.080]  Or, let me just add before we go into this, or there are people deliberately putting
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:46.320]  out this info, like some of the Catholics run it all crowd.
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:50.880]  They demand that I have on their grandpa, but I've researched what he says.
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:51.880]  It's just made up.
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:56.080]  He believes that Rosicrucians use magic to drop A-bombs.
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:27:59.680]  He believes the earth is on a string and the universe orbits it.
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:04.560]  I mean, these people, some of them are so kooky, but they demand that you agree with
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  them.
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:08.960]  And so, I just want to be clear that I don't agree with a lot of the groups that are out
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:11.440]  there saying this group or that group runs it all.
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:12.440]  That's my point.
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:13.440]  I see.
[2:28:13.440 --> 2:28:19.000]  Well, and by the way, who are you referring to when you say the grand poobah of the Catholics?
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.920]  Well, no, no, no, of the Catholics run it all crowd.
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:23.440]  I don't even want to say his name.
[2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:27.000]  It's just I don't even think most of his minions know that he believes all this insanity.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  Right.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Because one of the things I noticed in the ad, as they said, they associated, they created
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.080]  a proprietary relationship between church and state and the papacy.
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  And actually, the United States of America was formed and revolted against an Anglican
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:47.320]  church in the state, which had united in Great Britain.
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:48.520]  Well, let's be clear.
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:49.520]  Let's be clear.
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:52.440]  I don't endorse the ads on this network unless you hear my voice endorsing it.
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:54.320]  I have no control over that.
[2:28:54.320 --> 2:28:55.320]  But go ahead.
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:01.400]  Well, and so, I mean, just very briefly, the Anglicans were operating a union between
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:02.920]  church and state.
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.400]  And one of the reasons I know that is when I was researching the biography of the first
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:12.040]  Roman Catholic Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger B. Tawny.
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:16.040]  And he talked about when he was a child, he was banned from going to Catholic school.
[2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:20.680]  He was born just slightly before the onset of the American Revolution.
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:26.120]  And once the American Revolution was a success, almost immediately, his parents were allowed
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:28.720]  to send him to the school of his choice.
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:33.680]  So it's just one example of the anomalies of history and either we're going to talk
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:37.760]  during the break and we're going to continue on the other side, stay with me.
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:48.040]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:53.080]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:56.920]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:29:56.920 --> 2:30:01.800]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:05.400]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:09.920]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:10.920]  across America.
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:14.880]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:30:14.880 --> 2:30:18.560]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:19.560]  healthier I feel.
[2:30:19.560 --> 2:30:22.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:27.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:30:27.440 --> 2:30:29.960]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:30:47.560 --> 2:30:51.840]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:56.600]  alkaline environment, but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[2:30:56.600 --> 2:30:58.520]  diet and lack of exercise.
[2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:02.920]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:04.080]  of disease.
[2:31:04.080 --> 2:31:08.720]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:09.800]  loss of weight.
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:14.160]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life
[2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:16.020]  most people are overly acidic.
[2:31:16.020 --> 2:31:19.920]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:31:19.920 --> 2:31:24.240]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:25.240]  it.

[2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:17.400]  Trying to question the box within a box that we all live in.
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:18.920]  Michael Hoffman is our guest.
[2:33:18.920 --> 2:33:23.040]  Michael, before we go any further, tell us in a nutshell a little bit about yourself.
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:26.600]  You're awakening for a minute or two, your website, your books, and then we're going
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:29.960]  to go for two hours pretty much straight here with only a few breaks.
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:30.960]  Go ahead.
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:40.360]  The website is www.revisionisthistory.org and we're located in North Idaho, P.O. Box 849,
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:43.600]  Cortilane, Idaho, 83816.
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:48.720]  I was fortunate enough to have been born to a revisionist historian grandfather.
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:50.840]  He was a lay historian.
[2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:57.160]  He wasn't a professional, but he had a great deal of skepticism about the mainline story
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:58.160]  of history.
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:03.720]  So I was basically sitting on his knee from a young age hearing him talking about things
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:10.320]  like, for example, that Joseph P. Kennedy had stolen the election in 1960 for his son
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:15.040]  through the Chicago mafia, and I was hearing this practically as a toddler.
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:21.320]  So I suppose I've been predestined for this line of inquiry for being a skeptic, for always
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:28.520]  questioning and doubting, and as John Milton said in the 17th century, give me the right
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:33.960]  to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience above all other liberties, and
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:36.960]  that's what I've tried to live and what I've tried to extend to others, Alex.
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:38.960]  Now let me just throw out something here.
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:46.280]  It's become a thought crime to say that CO2 isn't deadly poison, to say that sodium chloride
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:52.240]  isn't deadly poison, it has become a thought crime to even question official stories, official
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:59.800]  history, but questioning Debra Jean Palfrey's clear murder, when we now have another eerie
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:04.000]  flashback DC Madame said, I'll never want my life to end in suicide.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.760]  She not only said that here on this show, in May 2007 for an interview for Carol Joyt,
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:14.520]  host of Q&A Cafe TV show, Palfrey faced criminal indictment for prostitution, but for Palfrey,
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:19.160]  one thing was crystal clear during the interview, she would not end her life by hanging herself.
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:22.280]  As Brandy Britton, one of her employers had clearly murdered as well.
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:25.360]  I don't want to be like her, I don't want to end up like that.
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:30.560]  So another source, we're questioning history, within one hour of her being found, official
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:36.320]  story open and shut, she committed suicide in the garage, hanging herself, absolute bull.
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:40.720]  So that's questioning history, and that now is a thought crime they want to arrest you
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:41.720]  for.
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:46.520]  We have to stand up against this now, no matter how painful or how demonized we get, because
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:50.080]  even if you disagree with ideas you hear here, you need to fight for the right for people
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:51.080]  to say them and have them.
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:53.520]  Okay, Mr. Hoffman, go ahead.
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:58.320]  Well, and this particular questionable death that you're referring to reminds me as far
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:03.480]  back as Secretary of Defense James Forrest Dahl, who a lot of us believe was tossed
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:06.200]  out of a window and they claim that that was suicide.
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:10.800]  And of course the secrets and the knowledge that he was sitting on were absolutely cataclysmic
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:13.700]  in terms of what he might have or could have revealed.
[2:36:13.700 --> 2:36:18.600]  So they certainly have a long history of doing this, but I'm not privy to the details of
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:20.640]  this particular case.
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:29.600]  But lately, since the year 2000, I have been consumed with my research on Judaism and Zionism
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:35.320]  and the Talmudic religion, because I feel that it's a key to understanding the cryptocracy
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:36.880]  as a whole.
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:40.560]  And during the break, you had mentioned to me that you also feel there are some aspects
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:44.440]  of anti-Judaism which are problematic, and I would agree with that.
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:52.240]  And so far as I believe that the cryptocracy plants their own Ajahn's provocateur inside
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:58.160]  various groups, and then they take extreme positions which actually benefit Judaism.
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:03.840]  One of the prime ways that they benefit Judaism is whenever you have race, hate injected into
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:04.840]  this discussion.
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:11.320]  And that brings, and the Zionist documents going back 200 years say that it compacts
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:15.360]  their group, and then they feed on the lower Jews beneath them, and the Jews think that
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:19.280]  their leaders are taking care of them, when Israel admittedly has been caught doing bombings
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:25.160]  in Baghdad 60-something years ago, bombings in southern Spain, all of these things to
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:28.200]  drive Jews back to their homeland.
[2:37:28.200 --> 2:37:34.920]  Well, Judaics are the first victims of Judaism, and that's something that has to be understood
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:41.480]  is that the freedom movement that I'm leading here with regard to Judaism is first an attempt
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:44.560]  to liberate individual Judaics from Judaism.
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:50.880]  And so you disagree with the main line of the crazies that say Jews are really Neanderthals
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:54.840]  and crazies that go around stirring up trouble and making people look stupid that talk about
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:59.360]  this, you disagree, you're saying you don't believe they're inherently devil seed.
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:05.320]  Yeah, this reptilian idea and all of that, what it really means is it means that Jesus
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:09.040]  Christ was wrong and that people can't be converted.
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:14.280]  If someone is inherently the seed of the devil, all you can do is exterminate them, you cannot
[2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:15.280]  convert them.
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:20.080]  So you can see the occult root to that, and you can see the black evil that's behind that.
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:24.760]  Well, that's my point is that, you know, 15 years studying this, every time I met somebody
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:30.520]  who said it was the Jews, the Jews, they were lying, backstabbing, crazy, lying scum who
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:35.880]  would always attack me, and then I'm like, my God, people that believe this must be bad
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:42.120]  because everybody I meet is, but I guess they're provocateurs or crazies or losers who want
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:46.240]  to blame a group, but just because they're doing that doesn't mean this isn't a predatory
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:47.560]  group out of control.
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:52.520]  Well, it's a predatory ideology which is out of control, but there's another factor
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:54.880]  here and that is, who is a Jew?
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:39:01.640]  I mean, people run around calling themselves Jews, and in John, chapter 8, Jesus said that
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:05.640]  they had as their father the father of lies, so why do we believe them?
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:11.320]  All of the genealogical records were destroyed when the Romans conquered Jerusalem in AD 70,
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:18.200]  so we only have the word of these rabbinic liars to say that they're descended from King
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:19.560]  David or Abraham.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:24.360]  You and I may have more Abrahamic blood in our veins than they do, but my question and
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:26.680]  my challenge to them is prove it.
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:28.160]  Prove that you're descended from Judah.
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:32.760]  Well, they've done the DNA test and they know that about 82% of people claiming to be Jews
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:38.080]  are actually Central, Eastern, European, Mccasars, and people call me all the time like they
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:39.080]  found some new secret.
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:42.160]  I remember reading that when I was 10 years old in mainline history.
[2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:43.160]  Right.
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:48.520]  So what that also does though, it's interesting because it absolves these interlopers from
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:51.400]  actually being the biblical Jews.
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:55.760]  They don't have any kind of a curse on them, although I believe even when we are talking
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:00.120]  about actual Israel, and certainly there is a remnant of Israel on the earth, as Scripture
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:04.120]  says, but that curse was only on the few generations.
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:08.240]  They're the early generations that would have been implicated in the death of Christ.
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:13.840]  It certainly wouldn't correspond to any actual biological Jew who was alive today.
[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:18.800]  But this racial issue, Alex, one of the things that we have to understand here is, is that
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:24.640]  the rabbis are very keen on keeping Judaics inside the ranks.
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:30.560]  So they have to use the Hitlers, the Nazis, and the haters to scare the Judaic people
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:34.760]  back into the fold of Judaism because one of the things that Judaism teaches in the
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:40.600]  Talmud is, is that no matter how nice, how good, how benevolent, a Gentile is towards
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:44.480]  you, he's only doing it for ulterior, cynical motives.
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:48.080]  He can never really love you for yourself.
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:55.880]  And a corollary from that, if, if I may expand on this, is the idea that if, if someone attacks
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.560]  the Israeli government, if they say they're genocidal, they're instituting a holocaust
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:02.440]  against the Palestinians.
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:07.240]  If they say like Walt and Mersheimer do in their book on the Israeli lobby that there's
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:11.680]  an ordinate power and control of the United States government on the part of the Israeli
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:18.720]  lobby, the reaction of the main hardcore of Orthodox Judaism and Zionism is to say, you
[2:41:18.720 --> 2:41:21.320]  know, that's inherently anti-Semitic.
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:23.960]  You don't really have a valid point.
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:28.720]  What you're motivated by is, is hatred and bias towards us.
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:29.720]  And of course-
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:30.720]  Exactly.
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:34.960]  I mean, if you, and people always say, well, I don't, I don't hate Jews.
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:40.200]  I just hate Zionists, but now those guys have all flipped and are saying, I do hate Jews.
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  It is the Jews.
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:42.200]  And-
[2:41:42.200 --> 2:41:45.160]  Well, then if they're saying that, Alex, they're falling right into the rabbi's trap
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:46.160]  because-
[2:41:46.160 --> 2:41:47.160]  Well, no, no, I know.
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:50.080]  I've read the official documents they wrote where they said, isn't it wonderful?
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:53.700]  You know, we get, we'll get people to persecute us, we'll even commit horrible crimes and
[2:41:53.700 --> 2:41:57.520]  let the Gentiles find out so they'll persecute us so we can then have our little slaves
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:41:58.520]  under us.
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:02.680]  And you know, not letting Hitler kick the Jews out saying, no, they have to come to
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:06.760]  Palestine, they've got to pay us money, one cow in Palestine is worth more than all the
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:07.760]  Jews in Germany.
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:14.000]  I mean, you know, these sickening evil statements, you know, these types of things, all I'm saying
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.160]  is it's, it's a lot more sophisticated.
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:18.560]  Let me digress and then we'll get back into this.
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  Why is there such an obsession with Germanicness by the modern Zionist?
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:31.400]  Why do we see the Rothschilds funding, you know, different German institutes of eugenics?
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:33.000]  Why do we see them funding it now?
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:36.800]  Why are they intermarried with European Germanics?
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:42.000]  Why are, why, why are they supporting Schwarzenegger wearing his Nazi belt buckle in public?
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:48.640]  I mean, I mean, certainly you see that there's a weird satanic wedding going on behind the
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:50.040]  scenes where you disagree with that.
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:54.760]  Well, I would say that there's some of that going on, but it's a complex issue because
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:59.440]  it's more behind the scenes, overtly in public.
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.800]  They have impressed upon the German people the mark of Cain, a hereditary stigma, which
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:07.200]  is a form of mental colonization.
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:08.640]  The Germans internalized this.
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:11.400]  They have one of the lowest birth rates and highest suicide rate.
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:14.040]  And they did that to blacks too with the transatlantic slave trade.
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:15.520]  Well, they did that with the idea.
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:18.400]  No, they had them internalized that they weren't humans or they were bad.
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:21.160]  They were, they were, they were Cain or Ham, right?
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:22.160]  Yeah.
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:26.280]  As we talked about in the last program, they gave them this notion that they were hereditary
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:31.480]  slaves and that that was a part of a Cain there.
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:33.880]  I'm getting an echo on the line here all of a sudden.
[2:43:33.880 --> 2:43:36.480]  I don't know if that's just at my end or you're everywhere.
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:38.000]  We're not getting it on the network network.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:39.920]  You getting that home?
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:40.920]  I'm not hearing anything.
[2:43:40.920 --> 2:43:41.920]  Sure.
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:42.920]  Okay.
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:43.920]  Great.
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:44.920]  I'll just proceed then.
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:45.920]  All right.
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:49.160]  And, and so what I would say is, is that I see a cleavage between this idea that there
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:55.160]  is sort of a secret linkage between the Germanic elite and the elite of the cryptocracy.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:56.920]  Well, I mean, let me stop you right there.
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:00.840]  I mean, 80 plus billion dollars in the last four years from the Bill and Melinda Gates
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:05.360]  Foundation with Warren Buffett and they're in Africa injecting them with HIV.
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:06.360]  They're poisoning them.
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:07.360]  They've been caught.
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:08.360]  It's in the documents.
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:09.680]  They've been caught carrying out eugenics.
[2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:15.000]  I mean, that, that I would call Hitler-esque and, but if the, but if the Judaics run it,
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:18.040]  I guess they want all the blacks and Asians dead too or what?
[2:44:18.040 --> 2:44:22.480]  Well, that's a little bit outside my competence in terms of discussing this.
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:27.600]  But I mean, that's what I'm saying though, is that, is that the, the Darwinistic view,
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:32.760]  the Francis Galton view, I mean, when, when I get to the bet, I mean, the, the head of
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:36.600]  the human genome project, Dr. Watson saying blacks basically weren't human.
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:41.160]  You know, he's a white guy and he's running the human genome project, running around saying
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:42.160]  blacks aren't human.
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:44.800]  I'm saying, you know, I understand in the media and everywhere else who can see the
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:48.720]  Zionist, but I'm saying when I get into science and I get into foundations and I get into
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.760]  this, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's Hitlerian, it's, it's eugenics.
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:56.440]  I'm saying I've really found that and I've really found Zionist everywhere too.
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:44:57.440]  So what I'm saying is-
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.440]  Right, but it's, it's, it's Hitler, it's Hitlerian, but Hitler is an anomaly in terms
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:02.440]  of German civilization.
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:07.440]  It would be like saying that George Bush is a typical product of our American civilization.
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:10.000]  No, when I say Germanic, I don't mean even the German people.
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.560]  I'm talking about Germanic occultism and I'm not attacking Germans.
[2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:19.960]  I'm saying that there is a relish, the eugenicists, the British eugenicists, Rothschild-funded
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:24.080]  eugenics institutions worship the Germanic form.
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:26.600]  Well, I would say that the Germans-
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:30.040]  There's something else here, there's something more here is what I'm saying.
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:35.200]  I don't see any larger role in the occult for the Germans than for any other of the
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:36.200]  European peoples-
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:38.200]  But you know, Germanic means wider.
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:43.360]  I mean, Germanic is the, is the main fulcrum in that entire region, even into Northern
[2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:44.720]  France.
[2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:49.520]  Well they've certainly always wanted to control the Germans, but prior to the rise of Hitler,
[2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:56.480]  Germany and German civilization was a paragon of the music of Bach and Beethoven and the
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:02.680]  great philosophy and the advances in, in religion and science to which we, we owe so much to
[2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:03.680]  the Germans.
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:04.680]  Pharmacological is everything.
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:05.680]  I mean, everything.
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:11.800]  I mean, there is a, there is a role in the early Ordo-Templi orientus of the OTO.
[2:46:11.800 --> 2:46:15.960]  There is a German connection there and there's a German connection to skull and bones.
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:19.040]  But if we were to talk about the British, and again, that wouldn't be an indictment
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:20.040]  of the English people-
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:21.440]  Oh no, I'm saying the British are the absolute heart.
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:27.320]  I'm just saying, why do they as a fetish, you know, get into the gutter-dama wrong and
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:28.320]  all of that?
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:29.320]  Look, it doesn't matter.
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:30.320]  The point is-
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:34.040]  Well, you know, it's interesting though, Alex, because they say that people who are
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:40.160]  in the know tell me that when you go to these collection catalogs for Nazi memorabilia and
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:44.880]  Nazi relics, that the number of Judaic customers on there is astonishing.
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:45.880]  No, no, that's-
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:48.380]  And perhaps you use the appropriate word.
[2:46:48.380 --> 2:46:49.880]  Perhaps it's a fetish.
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:53.040]  Yeah, no, I'm just, I mean, I'm really studying this stuff.
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:54.680]  I really want the truth.
[2:46:54.680 --> 2:46:56.920]  And I'm just saying, I've knocked down the hidden doors.
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:59.600]  I've gone, burrowed into the deepest pits.
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:05.120]  And I mean, I find a bunch of weird, druidic, don't even call it Germanic.
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:11.480]  I see all of Northern Europe and, you know, Britannia as Germanic, Visigothi and whatever
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:12.480]  you want to call it.
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:17.040]  So, I think when I use the term German, I'm not talking about the last, you know, Bismarckian-Imperial
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:18.040]  Germany.
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:19.040]  But look, I digress.
[2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:20.040]  Just, you know what?
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:23.040]  I may even have to even go out of the room because this stuff gets me thinking so much
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:24.160]  to just let you finish.
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:25.160]  Just go ahead.
[2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:31.120]  Well, Hitler used a good luck symbol, the swastika, which prior to the rise of his regime was
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:34.160]  always universally associated with good luck.
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:36.920]  All it is, is the symbol of the sun in motion.
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:41.320]  You put a cross inside of a wheel, you knock four segments of it out, and it looks like
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:49.400]  a running man or an intimation of the sun, an early pagan symbol always associated generically
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:50.400]  with good luck.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:53.400]  And he twisted it into this horrible thing.
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:48:00.640]  I think in general, there is a magnetic archetype associated with the Northern European model,
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:05.840]  both racially and in terms of some of the things that we see in our movies and culture,
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:10.800]  as far as these associations with the polar regions and with the sword and sorcery epics.
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:16.760]  So, it wouldn't surprise me if at some level in the occult or heavy metal music, or even
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:23.880]  at the higher levels that you're infiniuating our operant here, that they are mining that,
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:24.960]  so to speak.
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:29.360]  But what I can tell you from my own research, what my opinion is, is that far above that
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:35.720]  and far beyond that, is the Kabbalah, the Talmud, and the veritable worship not of the
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:41.120]  German or the Aryan or any archetype along those lines, but the worship of the Judaic
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:44.520]  male as personified by the rabbi.
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:49.440]  Because Judaism does teach that there is no doubt that Madonna and all of it, I mean,
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  it's everywhere.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:51.440]  The symbolism.
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:52.440]  No, it's dominant.
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:53.440]  I agree.
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:58.920]  Well, Madonna is a, I hesitate to use the word witch because of all of the inquisitorial
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:03.640]  connotations of that word, so I would call her a magician, and I would say that her recent
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:10.640]  30-minute show in New York City had all the hallmarks of a Kabbalistic open-air ritual
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:15.640]  that was both broadcast on the Internet and also much to do with made of it in New York
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:16.640]  City.
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:17.640]  Well, she says it is.
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:18.640]  She says she's doing this.
[2:49:18.640 --> 2:49:21.200]  She's a chicken-necked coward is what she is.
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:23.760]  These people just radiate weakness, but go ahead.
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:28.440]  And she's also a kind of a mirror image of a biblical figure because she calls herself
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:30.520]  Madonna, and I guess that's her birth name.
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:31.520]  Jezebel.
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:35.240]  But, well, that's her actual identity would be Jezebel.
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:41.160]  But what we find is, for example, in Judaism, they say, well, you Gentiles can be saved
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:44.840]  and you can be part of the covenant if you become a Noahide.
[2:49:44.840 --> 2:49:49.080]  But actually, they're not talking about the biblical Noah anymore than Madonna is the
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:51.880]  representative of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:53.720]  She's the exact opposite.
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:58.560]  And the Talmudic Noah is the exact opposite of the biblical Noah.
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:03.960]  So all these poor dupes and suckers who are joining Judaism, there's two ways to be a
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:06.160]  Gentile and join Judaism.
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:12.040]  One is through Holocaustianity and going down to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:16.800]  and believing everything that's there and believing that only one people on earth suffered
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  a Holocaust.
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:19.520]  That's one in rodent.
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:24.200]  And the other way is through the Noahide, but you're not following the biblical Noah,
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:26.440]  you're following the Noah of the Talmud.
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:32.760]  But also, people, they quote, join it or only porch masons or porch, that's what goes back
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:33.760]  to Solomon.
[2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:34.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:40.400]  Actually, we're going to skip this break for infowars.com, stream listeners, go to that
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:43.920]  stream, you'll be able to hear this break, and then we'll come back for everybody else
[2:50:43.920 --> 2:50:47.760]  on the other side in three minutes.
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:51.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:56.560]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:56.560 --> 2:51:02.520]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:05.680]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:11.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:51:11.600 --> 2:51:16.040]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:21.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:21.520 --> 2:51:25.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:28.040]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:31.200]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[2:51:31.200 --> 2:51:32.200]  They're after power.
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:33.200]  That's their afternoon.

[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:53.560]  main polluted stream media.
[2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:58.400]  I'm here to expose a fraud and an all around un-American stinker.
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:00.000]  His name is Steve Schenk.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.480]  His radio show called Fearless Radio.
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:07.560]  He says solution to all the craziness in America is just get independent and healthy.
[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:12.000]  So you can be fearless of all of the scary stuff you're not supposed to know about.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:16.720]  Stay away from this stinker on website eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:25.240]  I warned you don't do eFoodsDirect.com don't dial 800-605-5868 for this dangerous program
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:32.280]  800-605-5868 you've heard what happens to a brain on drugs can you imagine what happens
[2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:34.400]  to a brain that has been shanked.
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:35.400]  This is Steve.
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:37.960]  We take your independence very seriously.
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:51.160]  Come and find me on Fearless Radio call 800-605-5868 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:59.280]  Okay be clear though about the separate groups like you have the Torah which is the Old Testament
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:04.360]  which is literally 180 degrees from what comes later I mean let's start at the beginning
[2:54:04.360 --> 2:54:05.360]  here.
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:11.080]  Yeah well you know we're dealing with master deceivers and so there's a counterfeit.
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:16.560]  We were talking about that while at the commercial break how there are that's a mirror world
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:21.680]  a mirror of the scripture and a mirror of biblical patriarchs and biblical figures and
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:27.080]  so we will hear Orthodox rabbis say well we're Torah true we have to follow the Torah we
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:32.720]  have the Torah and in fact the rabbis tell those who are part of Judaism you can't understand
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:37.720]  the Bible without the mediation of our interpretation of it.
[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:41.960]  Protestants don't seem to have a problem with that they have a huge problem with the idea
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:47.840]  that the Pope claims to be a mediator of scripture but when the rabbis make that claim
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:56.480]  they seem to be very epithetic about that and I don't understand that but anyhow let's
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:01.640]  be clear about the Torah when they say that they're Torah true they mean that they're
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:09.120]  Talmud true because there is the Torah Shibik Tav which is the written Torah and the Torah
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:16.280]  Shibil Pah which is the oral Torah the the oral and they say that is is is the real
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:18.280]  law not the old law.
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:23.360]  Well yeah what they say is there is a dual law that Moses was given two laws on Mount
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:28.480]  Sinai the oral law which became the province of the rabbis and which was only written down
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:33.880]  after Israel crucified its Messiah and then really became degenerate prior to that it
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:38.720]  had been a toss-up which way they were going to go and so they had never sufficiently lost
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:41.480]  the grace to commit this evil to writing.
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:45.520]  And Moses when he actually went after him throwing the tablets he was going after this
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:47.920]  group is what a lot of people say.
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:52.160]  Well I certainly think that it's it must have started around the time of the golden
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:55.920]  cast well they were thought they were bringing back the Egyptian secret knowledge they'd
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:56:00.360]  found and he was saying no no so it's that same group always running right next to the
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  other.
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:05.960]  Yes as we mentioned the last broadcast the Talmud says ten measures of sorcery were given
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:10.800]  to the earth nine were given to Egypt and one to the rest of humanity so they certainly
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:16.160]  see Egypt as a source of magic and sorcery of course officially they condemn Egypt but
[2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:22.480]  actually secretly they have capped into that power and they actually actually pay obeisance
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:23.480]  to it.
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:28.560]  And as you said last time you were on or as the late Arthur C. Clark said a Texas instruments
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:33.480]  calculator would be the highest order of magic to somebody just 200 years ago so at least
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:39.160]  use the term magic sorcery that's ways to manipulate populations lie spin things and
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:42.560]  then they just package it in a bunch of mumbo jumbo go ahead.
[2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:47.480]  Now because leftist intellectuals could accuse us of misdefying the discussion by bringing
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:51.800]  in magic but actually they're the ones who are misdefying when they refuse when they
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:59.040]  use this agnosticism to refuse to recognize how technology operates and the last program
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:05.720]  I mentioned that Arthur C. Clark had his famous statement was that any sufficiently advanced
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:09.600]  technology is indistinguishable from magic so that's what we're talking about we're
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:14.960]  talking about a science which even certain scientists have been able to cover up and
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:19.840]  mock and direct our attention away from by claiming oh that's just silly fairy tales
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:24.520]  but it isn't and Arthur C. Clark who was a pioneer and prophet of the satellites that
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:28.760]  we now have operating around our earth and a key agent of the cryptocracy.
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:31.760]  Yeah he's the inventor of it go ahead.
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:33.400]  So he's our source for that.
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:38.840]  So you see Alex we have this counterfeit we have the null hide covenant but actually
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:44.520]  it has nothing to do with the biblical Noah it's the Noah of the Talmud and of the post
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:50.440]  Talmudic text which is what the Torah tells us is that this group will always have counterfeits
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:53.000]  they're masters at doing that.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:58.480]  Sure Revelation 2 9 talks about I know them who say they are Jews and are not and are
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:03.880]  of the synagogue of Satan so right there we're being warned of a counterfeit Jesus in the
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:09.640]  key book of John in chapter 8 talking about the counterfeit and that's a key theme there
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:14.280]  in chapter 8 because it pertains directly to what we're dealing with now where they
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:19.840]  say we have Abraham's blood in our veins we are the children of Abraham and Jesus acknowledges
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:25.800]  their biological pedigree but at the same time he says you can't have Abraham as your
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:26.800]  father.
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:27.800]  Stay there.

[2:59:42.400 --> 3:00:07.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:13.880]  You want hardcore news cutting edge information truly sophisticated discussions and debates
[3:00:13.880 --> 3:00:19.040]  you get it here in this fourth hour we're going to go 20 minutes more with our guests
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:23.120]  in overdrive you can do it we're going to skip some of the network breaks I can talk
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:28.640]  behind the scenes for prisonplanet.tv viewers and people listening to the streams at info
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:33.080]  wars.com you got to go to those audio streams that will be able to tune into it or you can
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:34.920]  miss out on it if you'd like.
[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:40.280]  Mr. Hoffman go ahead well one of the things that I think is important to understand Alex
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:46.280]  is that we need counterintelligence and we need to recruit among the Judaics themselves
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:52.600]  and that's one of the reasons why I've been able to profit in my research has been that
[3:00:52.600 --> 3:00:58.800]  I have had Judaic informants inside the yeshivas and the coalesce who assist me with my research
[3:00:58.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  and I want to encourage that I wouldn't be able to benefit from the details they've
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:09.160]  given me if they thought that I was a racist hater and it's it feeds into the rabbi's
[3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:14.400]  image of the Gentile and of the Christian if we in any way reinforce that image now
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:19.400]  what I wanted to do was I wanted to give you the actual teaching that Talmudic children
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:25.600]  receive in Orthodox Judaism this is a phrase that's repeated to them throughout their childhood
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:32.400]  and I'll give it to you now Halakha hebeyadoa sheasav sonaylil yakov and translated that
[3:01:32.400 --> 3:01:39.920]  means it is a given law it is known that Esau hates Jacob now they see themselves as Esau
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:46.520]  and we are Jacob and what they're being told from the time their little children is is
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:54.000]  that they are irrationally hated just because they are Judaic not because they mistreat
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:01.640]  the Palestinians not because they have anordinate influence over Congress now if we in our information
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:08.000]  campaign fulfill that stereotype if so many people in the right wing in the neo-Nazi movement
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:13.920]  and even in the Arab world have done and are doing and are encouraged to do by Ajahn provocateurs
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:20.560]  we are then doing the work of the rabbis because we need to convert rabbis and we need to convert
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:26.520]  Judaics Judaics who are listening to me right now Jesus loves you he wants to free
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:32.040]  you from these burdens these terrible this terrible yoke that the Talmudists have put
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:36.320]  upon you well it's the same thing like our government and that's the same mindset you
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:40.680]  see the same paradigm the same signature the government's going to keep you safe from the
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:44.040]  terrorists really the government's behind it the government's going to take your rights
[3:02:44.040 --> 3:02:48.040]  to keep you safe no they're not keeping us safe they're hurting us and sucking off of
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:52.800]  us it's the same group with the leadership using their mind control system on their own
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:58.040]  people I mean I want to make I mean you already said that twice but I want to make that clear
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:04.280]  go ahead well because what they're saying is there is a racial war to the hilt and it's
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:09.360]  irremediable there's nothing that they can do to change their race and therefore since
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:15.880]  they describe all of us or the majority of us as being racial haters of them you then
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:21.760]  have this chasm that can't be bridged and so if we actually take that position as so
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:27.080]  many in the past have then we're shooting ourselves in the feet so it's very very important
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:33.440]  to understand that we're dealing here with an ideology and with a spiritual force and
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:37.680]  uh... for example the spiritual force as you know on your program and brought up many
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:43.920]  times operates within freemasonry and they're uh... the most blue-eyed blonde hair area
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:50.800]  and Gentiles they can be we have evil in every race and every nation but because of the nature
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:57.520]  of the Talmud and the Kabbalah that evil is centered on this notion of the racial supremacy
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:03.200]  of the Judaic as personified by the rabbi now how could we do it which is in the Talmud
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:07.880]  which is in the Zohar which is in all the books and then it's in encyclopedia Judaica
[3:04:07.880 --> 3:04:12.160]  but we're not supposed to talk about that and we're actually dealing with the source
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:17.800]  of racism in the world as a whole because it's not in the bible and it certainly is
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:23.640]  not in Islam Islam may have many problems and many errors and there's no question about
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:30.360]  that but Islam does not practice racism this the most searing and ferocious and savage
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:37.120]  racism on the earth today is the racism of the Talmud and then it's practiced and implemented
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:41.520]  in the Zionist Israeli state okay stay there stay there we're going to continue during
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:44.720]  the break if you're an info wars listener stay with us and I'll be right back it is
[3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:53.720]  a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world government

[3:08:04.280 --> 3:08:11.880]  jones our guest for the rest of this hour into the next we're going to overdrive today
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:15.400]  michael hoffman to give out his website some of his books tell you how to get him before
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:21.920]  he leaves us you can do it anytime he wishes if he wants we'll take calls later we'll see
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:27.360]  if he wants to do that but continuing we were having a discussion on the info war stream
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:34.360]  and for prison planet dot tv viewers and i asked you i said you know don't you mean
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:38.320]  you know jacob against these so you said yes you'd gotten that backwards earlier probably
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:47.240]  all my interrupting so just continue wherever you'd like you know the website is w w w dot
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:54.920]  revisionist history dot or g and yes when i was translating halaka hebiota he saw son
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:09:01.560]  alyakov i actually transposed it incorrectly uh... the judaics regard themselves of course
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:07.040]  as jacob and we are he saw and they see this as a racial divide that can never be breached
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:11.920]  and that's why they have the sense of immunity and entitlement that they're never wrong they
[3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:16.280]  never have to apologize they never commit war crimes and any accusations along those
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:22.560]  lines are being fielded by latter day he thought against themselves as jacob so that's kind
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:27.440]  of a car they had codifying a psychopathic outlook
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:33.640]  it is it's uh... it's a religion which has the symptoms of uh... psycho pathology because
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:39.360]  they have delusions of grandeur as being the superior master race on earth and they're
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:46.000]  also paranoid and that they have this incipient fear of opposition and those are two symptoms
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:51.280]  of course of uh... of insanity but it's a self revealing privacy because it's an intelligent
[3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:55.020]  you know group that that is uh... getting a lot of power and so there's going to be
[3:09:55.020 --> 3:09:59.360]  competition a and there is also going to be people fighting
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:04.760]  well it's constant warfare zionism i usually append the word zionism with war it's war
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:10.560]  zionism and it's war to the hilt and of course you see that on the west bank with these settlers
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:17.120]  and their telemute philosophy of uh... annihilating amalek which is what they refer to the palestinians
[3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:21.600]  as amalek and of course in the old testament amalek was a people who were supposed to be
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:26.360]  exterminated so they're actually calling for the extermination of the palestinians but
[3:10:26.360 --> 3:10:31.680]  once again that's not alex on an old testament basis because as you know in the old testament
[3:10:31.680 --> 3:10:36.560]  god says he did do away with amalek and he said i will blot out its memory and he said
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:41.560]  also he said also kill their animals yelp but see how do you deal with that as a christian
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:45.120]  because you've got the old testament which christians accept and saying yeah go ahead
[3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:48.880]  and kill everybody when you take over this land kill them and their animals but then
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:53.800]  modern oh it's talmudic it's evil it's bad when they want to wipe everybody out yeah
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.880]  well that's a good question i i do just want to say however that the modern use of amalek
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  shows the uh... talmudic nullification of scripture because god keeps his promises
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:09.040]  and he said i would blot out the memory of amalek true christians today don't go around
[3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:14.480]  calling anybody amalek but the talmudists do and so they're actually contradicting
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:19.480]  the old testament in terms of also god god ended amalek with an announcement
[3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:24.760]  yeah well he ended it through uh... through the uh... through his own power and uh...
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:29.640]  you you know you challenge me with the idea of uh... god taking out these nations in
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:34.760]  the old testament invariably when a nation was destroyed in the old testament it was
[3:11:34.760 --> 3:11:41.280]  a nation that was practicing sexual sin under a cult auspices and that will destroy us
[3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:46.120]  it will get amalek amalek amalek burning babies to him
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:49.040]  so that's what we're talking we're not talking about any innocent nation of
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:54.200]  people that god simply picked on because his chosen people were coming along
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:11:58.560]  because if you really read the old testament it's an indictment against
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:00.000]  the israelite
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:05.360]  and uh... the great profit to jesus said from able to zekariah were killed they
[3:12:05.360 --> 3:12:10.880]  were killed for criticizing israel and telling them that they were falling short
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:15.600]  just like today if we try to say the same things we become under attack
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:20.480]  and another indicator alex that the jute the religion of judy ism is not an
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:25.240]  old testament religion we're talking earlier about how they disparage noah
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:29.600]  they also disparage the profit i'd say it now how can you do that and be an old
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:32.360]  testament religion this comes out in my book
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:36.520]  uh... that i'll be finishing up soon called judy ism discovered the profit i
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:42.960]  say uh... as you know criticized israel and so the talmud says of i'd say uh...
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:48.120]  that he had unclean lips and they say that i'd say it was killed and he got
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:52.320]  what he deserved in fact the talmudic description of his death is is that he
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:52.600]  would
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:57.600]  thought with a thought that went right across his mouth to uh... punish him
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:02.560]  for saying these terrible things about the jews now no biblical religion would
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:07.280]  ever side with the killers of i'd say it but that's what jesus identified them
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:10.720]  as he said you've been the killers of the profit
[3:13:10.720 --> 3:13:14.800]  and you've been that the killers of the profit historically this ideology in
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:16.720]  the spirit that you embody
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:20.240]  and that's what we're confronting in the israeli state and we're confronting
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:23.960]  among orthodox judy ism today in the united states were george bush on
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:25.400]  april fifteenth
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:30.280]  as all of his predecessors since jimmy carter did an education day u s a
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:33.680]  met with the harbad lube obitures in the white house
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:35.880]  he got his marching orders from them
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:40.240]  he dedicated this nation to the phony talmudic no hide-laws
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:45.440]  under the rulership of their dead messiah uh... monaca mental schnearsen
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:50.120]  uh... that's been going out since jimmy carter the conservative ronald reagan
[3:13:50.120 --> 3:13:52.040]  uh... both bush is
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:54.960]  and uh... let me ask you what do you think what do you think carter's doing
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:59.400]  now uh... going over and saying it's a part of the genocide and wrong and
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:01.960]  being barred from entry to israel and things like that
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:05.760]  well i have to preface my remarks and jimmy carter by saying that i was very
[3:14:05.760 --> 3:14:10.600]  very angry at that man at one time particularly when he uh... instituted
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:15.080]  to the cooperation with castro for the disastrous mariel boat lift
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:19.320]  i don't know if he has ever uh... really done pennants for that because he
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:22.880]  unleashed from castros and pain asylum in prisons
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:27.040]  the dregs of that island nation they came over here they rate they murdered
[3:14:27.040 --> 3:14:28.240]  and they plundered
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:30.920]  and that is on jimmy carter's record now
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:35.440]  uh... all i can do is surmise alex that he has had a change of heart
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:39.840]  that he's one of the very rare people who have been at the top that knows he
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:42.760]  was implicated in sin and wrong and evil
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:47.000]  and in his own way he's trying to make up for that and i think he's doing that
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:50.720]  uh... in his trips to the middle east i think he's doing good work his book on
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:53.080]  the apartheid system over there
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:55.840]  uh... is wonderful i don't agree with all of it
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:01.440]  but this is a man that who is trying to fashion in his own sort of stumbling
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:06.120]  uh... way a type of christian witness in his old age and i'll tell you i'll take
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:06.860]  that
[3:15:06.860 --> 3:15:08.760]  rather than nothing and we see this
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:10.600]  something similar happening
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:14.520]  with mac na mera the secretary of defense under kennedy and johnson and
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:17.840]  he's got a lot of globalist a lot of times kill older globalist because they
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:19.080]  do some people
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:22.840]  turn back you know kind of on the cross there at the last minute next to christ
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:26.320]  but uh... expanding on that and and and i do think he he's doing it for good
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:27.360]  reasons just from
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:30.120]  you know what i pick up you know uh... his body language listening to it
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:31.360]  analyzing it
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:34.600]  uh... it's not a hateful thing he's doing he's doing in a peaceable way
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:36.280]  uh... it's just that
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:39.160]  again everything you describe about judy ism
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:42.680]  again i see those similar excuses those similar claims
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:46.360]  manifested in other cultures i just and i this is obviously a dominant culture
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:48.760]  i'm just wanting to add that again
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:53.160]  uh... humans rationalize come up with the same stuff across the board
[3:15:53.160 --> 3:15:56.440]  all y'all but they were all free to challenge all those people
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:15:57.920]  we're free to challenge
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:02.240]  we're free to challenge reverend right when he makes these uh... statement
[3:16:02.240 --> 3:16:05.800]  we're free to challenge the uh... the chinese on to bet
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:10.520]  but as soon as we do that we apply the same criterion to the israelis and want
[3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:15.160]  to treat them equally as all other human beings who have both shortcomings and
[3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:19.440]  a good side and a bad side suddenly we become he saw
[3:16:19.440 --> 3:16:24.240]  their jacob and it's a lot to keep the odyssey a soft on a little yacob and
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:29.400]  that's a special situation that we're dealing with whenever we enter into the
[3:16:29.400 --> 3:16:33.640]  territory why i think rabbi i think the source that now now are you saying
[3:16:33.640 --> 3:16:36.520]  you know i don't want all rabbinical sex you basically get the same thing
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:38.280]  or their particular i mean i know
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:43.520]  uh... you know in certain neighborhoods in in in in new york or or in uh...
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:46.320]  the middle east the new film about bin laden
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:47.520]  my spurlock
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:51.000]  he's just in israel and he's rather start beating him up calling him filth
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:53.480]  you know he's not allowed in the neighborhood but another rabbi run up
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:56.080]  and get him and say no no that's a crazy group of people
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:16:57.800]  you know i mean you know i can have the
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:00.400]  one group of rabbis saying israel shouldn't exist
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:03.000]  which is got hundreds of thousands of people that you're carding a few other
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:03.680]  groups
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:06.680]  and then you've got other community that i mean there's also
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:09.680]  from what i've seen a few different brands of zionism you have the big
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:10.640]  dominant one
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:13.960]  but there's also some other ones are what's your take on that
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:17.360]  yeah well that's a good question i'm talking mainly about orthodox judy
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:21.960]  ism because that of course was all the judy ism that existed on earth until
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:24.640]  the mass scala that's to say the enlightenment
[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:28.720]  which coincides with the liberal enlightenment in europe uh... at its
[3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:31.320]  height in the late eighteenth century
[3:17:31.320 --> 3:17:37.320]  and uh... prior to that from uh... the founding of judy ism after the uh...
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:40.760]  traditions of men the oral traditions of men were committed to writing in the
[3:17:40.760 --> 3:17:44.120]  mission uh... and then later in the gamara in the first second third
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:45.920]  for centuries a d
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:49.920]  all you had was orthodox judy ism and then two branches actually three
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:54.160]  reconstructionism which is extremely liberal and almost not a factor here
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:17:58.040]  but two main branches broke off and that's the reform branch
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:00.600]  based on the moscola or the enlightenment
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:04.920]  and the conservative branch which tried to uh... take a middle road between the
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:09.200]  two and what that really means is alexa majority of judics in america who are
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:10.480]  religious
[3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:14.520]  and who are following judy ism are reformed judy acts and a lot of them
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:17.880]  never seen the colman in their life but see that's what i'm saying every june i
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:21.880]  know is it's a friendly nice person and most of them don't even like the war and
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:25.240]  they just feel persecuted as the news tells them they are and for what their
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:28.480]  leaders do they are getting some persecution because they individually
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:31.800]  haven't done anything and then see that's my larger picture i mean in your
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:34.520]  massive study of this you're probably one of the former scholars
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:37.160]  who honestly looks at it not from a bigoted view but from a
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:40.240]  you know just a cold scientific perspective what's the power structure
[3:18:40.240 --> 3:18:41.760]  you know in the pyramidal structure
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:45.800]  i mean what percentage of the elite of the judaics really know what's going on
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.080]  and then you know what are the substratas what's the command structure
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:53.480]  well see one of the doors into judy ism for gentiles i mentioned was the uh...
[3:18:53.480 --> 3:18:57.600]  the null hide laws and holocaustianity i was about to say the fake christians
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:02.800]  iron is now seem to be the one of those dominant virulent vicious groups now
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:06.520]  yell much to the scandalization of the gospel could uh... a whole generation of
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:09.720]  young people are now turned off to the bible in jesus christ because they
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:12.520]  associated with these blood thirsty warmongers
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:14.520]  but to get back to your question
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:18.400]  the uh... access route for these reformed judaic
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:23.200]  who are sort of uh... just cultural uh... judaic and uh... they say what
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:25.920]  stay there we got a break we'll talk during the break about this

[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:19.160]  that people have to be more sophisticated in their approach to all of

[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:03.520]  mr. Hoppin now let's get into unless you have more you want to add about the
[3:26:03.520 --> 3:26:09.400]  new I just wanted to I just wanted to say www.revisionisthistory.org is our
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:16.240]  website and I just wanted to finish one tale thought there Alex that the roots
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:21.280]  of Zionist racism are in the Talmud so for people who claim that the secular
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:25.440]  Israelis and secular Zionism couldn't possibly have a religious motivation if
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.040]  you look around to Bolshevik Russia and you see these circumcised Judaics who
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:34.680]  are inflicting this holocaust on the Russian Orthodox Church and on
[3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:39.320]  Christians there they weren't doing it out of simply atheistic motives they were
[3:26:39.320 --> 3:26:43.560]  doing it out of a religious hate which had been inculcated in them in their
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:47.560]  youth so you can be a secularist as you grow up but if you always have this
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:52.360]  sort of cerebral nostalgia and you see so many times these hyphenated Judaics
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:56.440]  if you notice them or they'll say well I'm a Buddhist Jew or I'm an atheist you
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:01.680]  most of us if we're Christians or we're Italians or we're Irish and we we go on
[3:27:01.680 --> 3:27:08.040]  to a different world a different strata we don't continue to maintain our
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:12.200]  original identification but they do so here are a lot of them not all of them
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:17.080]  of course so what we have here is is we have a nationalistic connection which
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:25.800]  survives even a transmogrification into a new world of Buddha or Tibet or
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:31.240]  atheism they still cling to a racial national identification with the
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:35.600]  Israeli state and with their people now there's no doubt though that that that
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:42.880]  Western Europeans had what they believed was a providence what they believed
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:48.560]  was manifest destiny and that they did use the Torah as an excuse to
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:52.560]  exterminate the Native Americans so so there we see something similar to what
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:55.320]  the Zionists are doing or similar to what whites were doing with apartheid
[3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:59.160]  with that so I just want to make the point well I don't buy the idea what I
[3:27:59.160 --> 3:28:02.380]  don't buy the idea that there was an extermination the American Indians in
[3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:06.800]  New England I think we'd have to take it century by century certainly when these
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:10.160]  Union generals at the end of the war between the states went out there and
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:14.600]  tried to make the Midwest safe for the railroads and the corporations yes there
[3:28:14.600 --> 3:28:18.840]  was oppression of the Indians and a lot of lying and a lot of disgusting things
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:22.040]  well I like Andrew Jackson but I've also got some Native American in me
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:28.160]  Comanche Comanche and Cherokee so I you know I also like Native Americans and
[3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:32.240]  you know it was humans you could hire natives to kill natives and it was huge
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:35.840]  battles and people say look at the Indian killer the Native killer Andrew
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:38.960]  Jackson who I like fought the New World Order that was when it was two to one
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:41.920]  three to one four to one five to one ten to one fighting the natives it wasn't
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:47.040]  like they were shrinking violet wimps or something yeah also also the point is
[3:28:47.040 --> 3:28:51.320]  they did say it's our right to go and take over it's ours my point is that is
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:56.480]  a human trait I'm just being honed and focused and wicked and vicious through
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:00.520]  the Zionists but I'm just saying I want to again let us all recognize this in
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:05.160]  ourselves that tribes do this to each other well that's true but I think when
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:08.600]  we're associating Christianity with that and with the Torah and I want all
[3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:13.760]  respect paid to the Torah and to the religion of Jesus Christ then I don't
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:18.480]  I'm not attacking that I'm saying it was used in manifest destiny was it not
[3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:24.480]  well was it not cited yeah I'll manifest destiny being different from what the
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:27.680]  Christians who came to New England were practicing it was the Christians who
[3:29:27.680 --> 3:29:32.720]  freed the slaves I understand that I'm not saying Christians so that's a stay
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:37.000]  there we're gonna talk during the break we're on the March the Empire's on the
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:42.880]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[3:33:16.880 --> 3:33:19.400]  in idaho and uh...
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:22.360]  mister hopkins up there this is all come out in the news the average american
[3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:26.520]  doesn't understand again they need nazism they need hatred of jews
[3:33:26.520 --> 3:33:30.520]  show the controlling group can use the jews as their slaves
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:34.800]  uh... as a subgroup and then they could be very sophisticated but also very
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:36.120]  simple in a way
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:38.160]  elaborate on what you were just saying
[3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:41.920]  and also keeping alex i'd like to continue that uh... very good point
[3:33:41.920 --> 3:33:44.240]  you're making there also keeping
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:48.960]  uh... judaic people who are inside judaism and who could reveal so much
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:50.960]  like some of these uh... Muslims
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:54.960]  who get out of it long and they're going around on speaking tours we need to
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:56.840]  have uh... converted
[3:33:56.840 --> 3:34:00.880]  uh... former uh... rabbis who are converted to christ going around the
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:03.040]  country telling what they know
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:06.560]  and that happened before they get killed pretty fast
[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:10.440]  well you know i'm a positive thinker i believe that god is on our side and as
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:12.840]  long as he's on our side who can be against us
[3:34:12.840 --> 3:34:13.880]  absolutely
[3:34:13.880 --> 3:34:16.200]  if god be with us who can be against us
[3:34:16.200 --> 3:34:17.520]  you got that right
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:21.080]  so yeah we're talking about timothy mcvay being up here at the shadows uh...
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:23.440]  motel in spokane washington
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:27.040]  and he was meeting with the keyhole brothers who were implicated in knocking
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:30.880]  off some of the witnesses to the oklahoma city bombing conspiracy
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:34.360]  and when this information was presented to the federal judge
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:37.880]  uh... at the trial there uh... he ruled it out of evidence here
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:42.040]  irrelevant absolutely because they really didn't want to reveal the role of
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:45.520]  what would you and i are talking about how they use these pat these then they
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:48.160]  certainly have pat these on the left as well
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:52.200]  uh... the violent uh... animal rights crusaders and uh... well when you
[3:34:52.200 --> 3:34:55.000]  don't want to hear a notice that you have a focus or is your notice how the
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:57.480]  groups that claim their exposing zionism
[3:34:57.480 --> 3:35:01.240]  they just freak out attack everybody else cause fights claim people have been
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:02.520]  kidnapped that haven't
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:04.520]  just run around wildly
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:07.000]  uh... they've always got criminal backgrounds they're being handled
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:08.360]  they're being run
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:10.760]  where whereas i'm saying everybody come together
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:14.920]  everybody's human let's just not be tribal the others evil mafia's
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:18.440]  let's you know i'm trying to tell listeners empower yourselves take action
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:20.360]  we can win we can fight evil
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:23.960]  notice the other guys they never do that it's it's a key m o
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:27.600]  right and i think that the lesson of the new testament least for me anyway as a
[3:35:27.600 --> 3:35:30.160]  believer is is that you cannot
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:33.720]  be in contention with these things using carnal weapons
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:35.960]  the system love the violence
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:39.760]  they absolutely feed on it in any kind of a stage terror attacks i love these
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:40.360]  guys that
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:44.440]  call me right me you coward filled you're not calling for guns and shooting
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:47.880]  people you're a coward but they're posting on my
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:48.680]  on my
[3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:51.520]  uh... website then we catch them with the same i p
[3:35:51.520 --> 3:35:54.840]  posting look at this guy threatening i'm calling the government and the
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:35:56.480]  government shows up my office
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:35:58.480]  but we know from the i p it's them
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:00.080]  their fans
[3:36:00.080 --> 3:36:02.920]  yeah they need they absolutely need this violence they need it in the air of the
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:07.440]  muslim world unfortunately the muslims have a religion which is oriented
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:09.400]  towards using carnal weapons
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:13.480]  against their opponent so it's much easier to manipulate muslims than it is
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:17.440]  to manipulate christians although we have so few authentic christians these
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:18.240]  days
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:22.280]  that i suppose in some ways it's become just as easy in either culture
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:27.200]  well are you kidding a lot of these white uh... anglo uh... quote zionist
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:30.400]  i mean you'll hear him say new call the arabs murder everyone kill all their
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:31.160]  children
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:34.120]  killing one disagrees with the government our holy jihad
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:36.000]  uh... against the jihadis
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:39.440]  uh... and uh... i mean they've lost all their soul
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:42.480]  don't you idiots know that the government will nuke muslims they'll take
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:43.600]  your bank account
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:45.000]  don't you know they kill
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:49.320]  i mean the the videos hundreds of them are troops shooting iraqi children for
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:51.240]  fun and shooting dogs and
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:54.080]  and our citizens don't care about the iraqi kids they cry about the dogs
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:36:55.800]  showing how far we fall in
[3:36:55.800 --> 3:36:59.280]  doesn't the public know that the evil is allowed to be portrayed as somebody else
[3:36:59.280 --> 3:37:00.960]  it can happen to you
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:03.080]  i mean don't they understand how that works
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:07.400]  yeah there's definitely been a process of dehumanization and as you say if
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:10.800]  we're dehumanizing these other people than we're simply setting ourselves up
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:14.600]  to be dehumanized as well exactly think how big these hit teams there are that
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:15.400]  are here
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:17.320]  they have hundreds of thousands of troops
[3:37:17.320 --> 3:37:20.680]  and tens of thousands that have been involved in massacres and they just sit
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:24.240]  there on the side of the road in bagdad shooting cars full of women and children
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:26.520]  falling out dead laughing
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:28.520]  i mean it's not even a checkpoint
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:30.800]  they just say what they just say watch this
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:31.520]  playing
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:34.600]  elvis music and shoot families and laugh
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:37.680]  and black water as you know has been implicated in that the headline in our
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:42.000]  north idaho newspaper was yesterday was is that black water may open a chapter
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  in north idaho because we have a lot of retired
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:48.720]  policemen firemen and military up here and of course i take my head off to all
[3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:52.880]  genuine public servants who really have protected us from crime and
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:54.440]  and things like that but
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:58.400]  it when you have that kind of military mentality where the government is right
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:38:02.120]  and uh... they forget what george washington and thomas jepperson
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:06.160]  uh... argued for and shed their blood for and then uh... you have these
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:09.000]  mercenary groups coming in which is basically as you know what we're
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:13.400]  operating the middle east is it is a mercenary are well that's why day one a
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:15.600]  private gets thirty thousand a year
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:18.160]  a sergeant gets fifty sixty thousand a year
[3:38:18.160 --> 3:38:20.800]  a colonel gets a million a year it's unknown
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:24.840]  what the generals get but it they they fly in hundreds of billions on giant
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:25.600]  pallets
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:28.240]  per year and publicly handed out
[3:38:28.240 --> 3:38:32.080]  off record to the troops but that's meant to corrupt them that's meant to
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:33.280]  get them ready
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:34.640]  for clandestine
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:37.920]  black ops and now they're not professional hitman in some cases
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:40.000]  they're so bloodthirsty
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:43.040]  that i've seen the reports in major papers and i've seen video of it
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:46.320]  where they'll be a mother walking with the child of the fifty-cali
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:49.400]  you know five thousand and i'm not five thousand five hundred yards
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:52.440]  and those they'll they'll place bets on can i shoot her in the head
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:56.640]  and they'll her head will explode in the child mother falls over with the hand
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:59.480]  you know i and then just spring and shooting and taking puppies and
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:00.440]  murdering them
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:01.640]  i mean it's just like
[3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:02.760]  death you know
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:04.640]  that i mean that's my control
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:06.240]  and now i want to get into that
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:09.400]  because i want to take calls but we can't just go for ten hours here
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:11.800]  i mean you've done so many other studies in fact
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:13.440]  we punch your website
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:16.160]  up here in front of me i mean i mean there's so many
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:17.640]  i just had it up here
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:21.080]  uh... on my browser let me find it uh...
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:24.960]  and that's revisionist history dot org yeah i guess some reason it's not my
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:27.360]  browser punch it up here on the screen for me guys
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:30.640]  uh... because i want to go through some different subjects now
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:31.480]  quickly
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:33.640]  that you also cover not just uh...
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:35.400]  not just one of the big subjects
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:38.520]  uh... one of the things that you mentioned there alex with that violence
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:42.440]  and uh... the way that it does damage the jesus christ in the gospel because
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:46.360]  obviously satan does not want the gospel to spread doesn't want people to be
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:51.240]  saved is we have so many uh... ministers and uh... and even catholic
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:53.840]  priest for that matter who become neil cons
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:39:57.520]  who are preaching this war doctrine they're cheering on the massacres
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:00.480]  and the people of the world look on this and they and they figure well these
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:03.960]  are the public spokesman for jesus christ this must be what jesus christ
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:07.880]  represents and yet jesus christ said love your enemies do good to them that
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:09.200]  persecute you
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:13.320]  and the only violent that is allowed to a christian not actually violence but
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:15.000]  taking up of arms
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:18.480]  is the police power that uh... the apostle paul spoke about that the
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:21.800]  ruler bears not the sort in vain to protect our borders
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:25.120]  to protect our women from rape to punish kidnappers
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:28.040]  but we're not allowed as we've done throughout history
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:33.080]  as uh... these secret agents have talked us into where a one christian nation
[3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:34.920]  fights another christian nation
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:39.040]  and the minister gets up in one pulpit and says god on our side the other
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:42.680]  minister says he's on their side you had catholic priest holding masses for the
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:43.920]  french army
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:47.760]  opposed to uh... spanish priest holding masses for their army
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:51.720]  this is all a scandalization of the gospel and it diminishes diminishes the
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:54.000]  stature of jesus christ in the world
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:57.800]  and i think that's the most satanic aspect of all of these wars that we have
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:41:01.440]  christian ministers and priests and politicians implicated
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:05.240]  in their but again anything is going to be used throughout history always is
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:06.520]  okay now
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:08.720]  uh... i want to get into the
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:12.440]  regime of queen elizabeth the first ideological template for the masonic
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:15.320]  imperium and the intelligence agencies of the west
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:17.760]  and how that ties into twilight language
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:19.520]  the sub uh...
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:22.680]  a command and control our god of the cryptocracy
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:25.320]  the alchemical processing of humanity via
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:28.000]  psycho drama embedded in ritual crimes
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.840]  uh... which we just saw in a high satanic holy day with the murder of
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:32.160]  gene palphery yesterday
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:34.840]  let's go through that before i go to calls i want to
[3:41:34.840 --> 3:41:38.360]  i want to cover this giant area i hope you don't i hope you don't want me to do
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:42.840]  it all in ten minutes now but i mean let's let's let's let's get in there
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:46.560]  yeah well with queen elizabeth we briefly touched on her regime last time
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:49.720]  and whenever uh... rule of thumb is whenever you're looking for this a
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:51.320]  cult technology
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:41:54.600]  you want to begin with the intelligence agencies because that's typically
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:41:55.960]  where they're harvard
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:59.760]  and uh... last time i was on your program alex we talked about dr john d
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:04.120]  astrologer royal to queen elizabeth the first and with edward kelly he was
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:06.360]  involved in necromancy and
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:10.360]  and a call process called scrying it was also legitimate mathematician in his
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:11.480]  own right
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:15.480]  and uh... his code name and this will send everybody into orbit when they
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:19.880]  hear what it was his code name in the elizabeth and cryptocracy was double
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:21.520]  oh seven
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:26.760]  and this is the original paradigm of double oh seven in fact uh... people
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:31.000]  who are in the know on uh... historians of intelligence agencies in the west
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:34.960]  have remarked upon the fact that the best most efficient treacherous and deadly
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:36.840]  at stuff all the secret
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:39.600]  uh... police forces uh... in the west
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:43.320]  uh... have been the uh... british intelligence and i five and and i
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:44.320]  six
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:48.200]  and along with most out of course and all the rest of them from the c i a in the
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:52.200]  k g b downward are just pale limitations compared to that well
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:55.360]  why did they have this power and how did they get it
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:42:59.840]  uh... in this particular case john d was very much a cabellist he was
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:04.640]  fascinated with the cabala and last time we talked about how the renaissance
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:08.120]  uh... roman catholics and the renaissance anglican
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:12.400]  uh... began to import these uh... ferriscian ideas into christened and
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:13.840]  when uh...
[3:43:13.840 --> 3:43:17.480]  the christians had done such a good job throughout the middle ages of keeping
[3:43:17.480 --> 3:43:21.280]  these ideas out and then they entered in in the renaissance
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:24.960]  and uh... john d was obsessed with the cabala he felt it was the key to the
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:30.120]  very highest uh... forms of magic and control of populations and nations
[3:43:30.120 --> 3:43:34.560]  and so back in the sixteenth century he made the very difficult journey
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:39.280]  uh... it out to uh... prog where he thought rabbi judo low now i must say
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:43.480]  this is conjecture i cannot absolutely document that he
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:48.440]  per se met with judo low he was in a cult bohemia at that time would be very
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:50.280]  hard for me to believe
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:54.200]  that someone as well connected as he was going into prog
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:58.680]  and not meeting with uh... rabbi judo low but so far we have not gotten the
[3:43:58.680 --> 3:44:03.000]  smoking gun on the actual meeting itself so i can't produce
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:06.080]  all letters or diaries that attest to that however
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:09.080]  the key books which would have that information
[3:44:09.080 --> 3:44:12.760]  uh... they're not even extant in the british libraries one of them has been
[3:44:12.760 --> 3:44:16.200]  burned up you can see the copy and it's been heavily burned
[3:44:16.200 --> 3:44:20.520]  uh... the others have been lost but one thing we do know and and we need to go
[3:44:20.520 --> 3:44:23.960]  by what people practice that was jesus rule of thumb
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:27.280]  what are by their fruit you'll know them and so what are the fruits of john d
[3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:29.440]  after he returned from prog
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:33.160]  he was filled with this capitalistic noses so if he didn't actually meet with
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:37.120]  rabbi judo low who by the way is associated with the mystical golem
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:40.120]  the idea of getting a brain with the brainless going on
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:43.200]  and getting that which is what they call the other nations of the world and
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:45.320]  getting them to march to your tune
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:49.440]  that was actually a philosophical meme or virus of
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:50.840]  rabbi judo low
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:53.960]  so whether or not uh... d actually met with him
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:57.280]  he certainly picked up the virus and brought it back to great britain where
[3:44:57.280 --> 3:45:00.320]  he invented the concept of british israel
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:03.640]  which was a secret teaching that the people of europe were actually descended
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:05.280]  from the ten tribes
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:08.880]  now i have to actually tend to believe that there is something to that just
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:10.920]  because john d advocated it
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:15.400]  or the cabalus in the rabbis were trying to twist or distorted about the way
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:20.000]  that the energy energizes much of the modern nazism and
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.360]  by those groups they all believe that as well
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:26.200]  well i have found that most neo-nazis are very dismissive of british israel
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:30.440]  because they're dismissive of the old testament as at off hitler was at off
[3:45:30.440 --> 3:45:34.560]  hitler who was basically convinced by the cultists that he dealt with in the
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:37.840]  truly society in the roots of the truly society that
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:39.480]  there was this uh...
[3:45:39.480 --> 3:45:43.000]  manatee and split between the old testament the new testament the heresy
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:44.240]  of marcia owned
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:48.760]  where you believe that jesus was a new testament figure and that this terrible
[3:45:48.760 --> 3:45:52.840]  yaw way was this demonic figure of the old testament big problem with that is
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:54.200]  that jesus quotes
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:58.000]  uh... the old testament uh... numerous times as you heard he says i'm here to
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:01.480]  fulfill the whole law sure you have but i mean let's go back though that that's
[3:46:01.480 --> 3:46:02.760]  interesting to tell me about
[3:46:02.760 --> 3:46:04.440]  from your research when i've done my own
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:06.200]  the type of a cultism
[3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:08.080]  uh... that hitler was following
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:12.840]  well one of the key uh... aspects of seeing how hitler was controlled is when
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:18.120]  you see that when he had state power over uh... the publications of germany
[3:46:18.120 --> 3:46:20.760]  there's two indica to key indicators for me is
[3:46:20.760 --> 3:46:25.360]  one is the very best talmud that had ever been published in germany
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:28.160]  uh... the talmud of lazarus goldschmidt
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:32.600]  uh... was published uh... in nazi germany while hitler was the supreme
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:33.440]  leader
[3:46:33.440 --> 3:46:37.720]  uh... that it's a uh... twelve volume series the last book was published in
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:39.400]  nineteen thirty-six
[3:46:39.400 --> 3:46:43.080]  publication began in nineteen twenty nine and hitler did not it uh...
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:47.280]  interdict the publication of the talmud but even more telling than that is
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:51.400]  when hitler had uh... the focus of the dramatic people of the world on him and
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:53.440]  on his ideology and he had
[3:46:53.440 --> 3:46:56.960]  a uh... just a golden opportunity to teach people
[3:46:56.960 --> 3:47:00.880]  what do you hold up for them to learn in terms of advising them about what the
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:02.840]  inner nature of zionism
[3:47:02.840 --> 3:47:08.000]  uh... communism and judyism was the protocols of the learned elders of zion
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:11.480]  now i don't want to get into debating the provenance of it but alex at the very
[3:47:11.480 --> 3:47:12.880]  least we can say
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:16.920]  that it is at very much in dispute now whenever i say this i get mail from
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:21.000]  people and they're trying to prove to me that the protocol is real and i say
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:21.720]  look
[3:47:21.720 --> 3:47:25.240]  whether it's real or it's not and i personally do not believe that it is
[3:47:25.240 --> 3:47:30.120]  authentic but whether it is or it's not it's written in comic book fashion
[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:33.760]  exactly and there are a couple of key points because i believe the russian
[3:47:33.760 --> 3:47:36.200]  secret police had a good handle the russians
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:38.560]  were probably among the very best students
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:42.920]  of the rabbis and they understood uh... rabbinic knowledge to this day the
[3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:47.560]  russians are a very alert to uh... the talmud and well they have the oldest
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:51.920]  karan to and just ship the golden copy to saudi arabia so they're
[3:47:51.920 --> 3:47:54.360]  we have a lot of scholar ship going on
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:58.440]  and so uh... here hitler holds up the protocols has it reprinted
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:02.600]  when one of the greatest german scholars of all time uh... yohan andrea's
[3:48:02.600 --> 3:48:06.520]  eisenmanger in seventeen hundred had written a book and dectus you didn't
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:07.360]  whom
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:11.320]  and uh... it was about judyism it was a two-volume
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:14.680]  master key into judyism which uh...
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:18.520]  uh... samuel birthheimer and oppenheimer the financiers of the
[3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:21.880]  holy roman empire at that time had that book to press
[3:48:21.880 --> 3:48:26.760]  and uh... eisenmanger had studied with rabbis for twenty years before he wrote
[3:48:26.760 --> 3:48:27.640]  the book
[3:48:27.640 --> 3:48:31.320]  and uh... hitler could have commissioned a republication of the book
[3:48:31.320 --> 3:48:35.800]  and and if there's still more details in that most germans are not interested
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:39.000]  in i haven't been able to get germans very interested in our publishing
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:41.680]  company came out with an english version of it
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:46.360]  you can find it at amazon dot com under traditions of the jews by eisenmanger
[3:48:46.360 --> 3:48:50.520]  but it's a one-volume abridgment by uh... a uh... hugano minister named
[3:48:50.520 --> 3:48:53.720]  stellen in the eighteenth century it's not the complete book but it's the best
[3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:57.960]  that we could do but that's really the master key to judyism what is hitler do
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:02.840]  he reprints the protocols and ignores eisenmanger course eisenmanger
[3:49:02.840 --> 3:49:06.760]  was a uh... pious lutheran scholar there was nothing racist about them
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:08.760]  nothing that you are i would object to
[3:49:08.760 --> 3:49:10.280]  it would have been a
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:13.640]  benefaction to humanity of the reprint of that book
[3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:17.560]  and he didn't do it it's just one of the number of factors that you can see
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:19.240]  and hitler's outlook
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:24.560]  and his attitude uh... of uh... the extirpation and extrusion of uh... the
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:28.120]  judic from europe which has been it i mean he's really the original six
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:31.440]  million dollar man for the state of israel if it wasn't for him
[3:49:31.440 --> 3:49:35.400]  the israeli state would have never come into being it was it was as a result of
[3:49:35.400 --> 3:49:36.480]  sympathy
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:39.920]  uh... after all that massive persecution
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:41.080]  uh...
[3:49:41.080 --> 3:49:45.200]  but then i get people tell me hitler was in the occult he was a nice guy i mean
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:48.600]  i mean you can just look at the guy and but then all of that the speeches i've
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:50.600]  read i've listened to all audio recordings
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:49:53.400]  and translations i mean and and the things they did in the people they
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:54.920]  shook down in the
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:58.320]  how i mean just all of it to say that you know this is a good guy
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:01.040]  it just shows the sickening delusional nature
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:02.160]  of so many people
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:05.120]  now we've got the final segment of the main radio show we're about twenty
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:06.440]  minutes of overdrive
[3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:08.480]  i really want to get a twilight language
