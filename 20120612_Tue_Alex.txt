[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:35.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones here we are ladies and gentlemen
[00:35.880 --> 00:44.200]  busting out of the gates yet again like a cross between the Kool-Aid man and Schlitz malt liquor
[00:44.200 --> 00:50.600]  busting through the wall what a ridiculous analogy we're going to be here for the next three hours
[00:50.600 --> 00:56.200]  today Jesse Ventura who's been out of the United States the last five months will be joining us
[00:56.200 --> 01:02.200]  today talk about a host of issues election 2012 the future of his TV show conspiracy theory that's
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.520]  mysteriously not aired even though it's been done for three four months his lawsuit against the
[01:08.520 --> 01:14.840]  Navy SEAL he says lied that they ever met or that he ever punched him out or that Ventura ever said
[01:14.840 --> 01:24.040]  that he was glad that troops were dying that is all coming up the third hour today in the meantime
[01:24.040 --> 01:32.360]  I've really had time now to cogitate and to perm you'll go through the permutations in my mind of
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.440]  what I really think about the Ron Paul Rand Paul developments with Ron Paul conceding on the same
[01:38.440 --> 01:44.840]  day that his son came out and endorsement Romney and I understand both sides those that are outraged
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.440]  by it and and those are saying hey this is political but I can't help the fact that Ron Paul wouldn't
[01:50.440 --> 01:58.360]  do something like this they say well Rand isn't wrong but they advertised him as that and you
[01:58.360 --> 02:05.560]  know the the Iran sanctions and you know spun that it was really anti-war and then now the
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.040]  statements by the campaign that well you know politically this will make republicans like us
[02:12.040 --> 02:18.520]  if we endorse Mitt Romney this will make the party like us will support the patriot act then
[02:18.520 --> 02:25.320]  support domestic checkpoints support drones in the skies support letting the military operate
[02:25.320 --> 02:30.920]  domestically support torture and you'll be George W. Bush and you can get the mainline
[02:30.920 --> 02:37.560]  country club rhinos who wouldn't know freedom of it bit him in the hind end behind you I mean
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.280]  there you go so I don't think the hatred that I'm seeing of Rand Paul and Ron Paul right now and
[02:42.280 --> 02:48.760]  I'd say 70% of people I've seen the polls the numbers out there absolutely hate your guts now
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.240]  because they love you and so when they feel betrayed it gets nasty it's almost like a woman
[02:54.200 --> 03:00.200]  who's been scorned she's got you know hots for you politically and then you you slap her
[03:00.200 --> 03:06.120]  upside the head I mean she's going to hate your guts something fierce another 20% or so say that
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.600]  they get it and understand why it happened to a certain extent but still don't like it and 10%
[03:10.600 --> 03:17.400]  are just sad so I'm going to briefly later in the hour give you my take on that and some new
[03:17.400 --> 03:23.000]  developments some good news out of the poll camp lawyers for Ron Paul file civil rights lawsuit
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.520]  a navy drone has crashed in Maryland and they're announcing little bitty switchblade drones which
[03:30.520 --> 03:38.280]  I knew about 12 years ago they're basically model airplanes with a hand grenade or missiles
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.560]  they can either fly into you and blow up or fire little missiles at you shotguns you name it that's
[03:43.560 --> 03:47.720]  why when we did our drone shoot down thing a few weeks ago that went viral drone shot down over
[03:47.720 --> 03:53.400]  Texas if you haven't seen the video you know we point out a lot of the government drones are
[03:53.400 --> 04:00.840]  actually just consumer grade weaponized and the meme by the jealous trolls of our viral video

[09:18.680 --> 09:29.000]  in the meantime hillary clinton is calling for air strikes and ground forces and you've seen
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.400]  the secretary of defense calling for boots on the ground in syria and even mainstream news
[09:35.400 --> 09:42.760]  admits that it's actual al qaeda just type in al qaeda in syria al qaeda uniforms al qaeda flag
[09:42.760 --> 09:50.600]  in syria and it is real al qaeda wearing black al qaeda uniforms with the al qaeda flag engaging
[09:50.600 --> 09:57.240]  in massacres blaming it on a sod blowing up buildings bombing police stations and it it just
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.560]  shows the utter and total contempt that the globalist and the controlled collaborator media have for
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.040]  the people of america in the west that they're like oh my gosh give all your rights up al qaeda
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.560]  garden gnomes are hiding under every bed but al qaeda is being used to attack the serbs again
[10:14.120 --> 10:19.320]  it real al qaeda al qaeda is being used to run drugs out of albania al qaeda is being used against
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.840]  the iranians al qaeda is being used everywhere and there's an article in info wars dot com saying us
[10:24.840 --> 10:31.160]  israel attack on syria you know goes into overdrive israel actually doesn't like the
[10:31.160 --> 10:38.040]  air of spring at least on the surface israel actually there's some evidence is propping up a sod to
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.240]  a certain extent because they understand this is part of a larger order out of chaos situation
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.400]  that's why you've had the former head of massad and most their military come out and say don't
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.800]  attack iran this will create a global conflict conflagration so it's not it's not all just
[10:53.800 --> 11:01.000]  just just just one monolithic situation that's unfolding here this is all part of the order
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.360]  out of chaos strategy like putting al qaeda in nato funding them to go in and take over libya
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.480]  and run up the al qaeda flag i mean this is in the la times this is in reuters that they don't
[11:11.480 --> 11:18.440]  even deny it but they report it very calmly that oh yeah okay yeah al qaeda out of Saudi Arabia yeah
[11:18.440 --> 11:24.680]  yeah some of the folks have here's their names that fought us forces in iraq yeah and then they
[11:24.680 --> 11:35.160]  quote them going i kill americans in iraq now i kill qaddafi and it's like what what what and and
[11:35.160 --> 11:42.600]  again there's that disconnect here where we're told the police have to pull you over and take you
[11:42.600 --> 11:48.360]  to jail if you've got marijuana on you but our troops for a decade publicly grow the opium and
[11:48.360 --> 11:53.880]  load it on c 130's and fly it into the europe and the united states and they show the troops
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.120]  growing it and guarding it and they go well we have to do this for al qaeda will get it and make
[11:58.120 --> 12:04.200]  money what al qaeda was created by the globalist the real Taliban the one that said shows the proof
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.880]  of al qaeda doing this will will hand them over to you for 9 11 those are the guys that got arrested
[12:09.880 --> 12:15.480]  the uh the uh the establishment taliban they got flown out to safety that came out in the financial
[12:15.480 --> 12:19.080]  times of london newsweek magazine i cover it in my film road to tyranny
[12:21.720 --> 12:29.560]  opium production went from less than 10 to 93 percent in 2011 we haven't gotten new numbers
[12:29.560 --> 12:37.400]  for this year yet look it up 93 of world opium production from less than 10 under the taliban
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.640]  oh yes uh the uh the troops better help grow it or the taliban al qaeda will get the money
[12:44.680 --> 12:54.280]  nato uses al qaeda to control kosovo and albania to ship the goodies by ground as well all over europe
[12:55.240 --> 13:02.120]  this is not debated there have been countless whistleblowers in nato in the un about this nato
[13:02.120 --> 13:08.840]  is a narcotics and sex trafficking organization look it up just type in nato sex trafficking
[13:09.560 --> 13:15.800]  un sex trafficking nato drug trafficking un drug trafficking i mean we're talking about
[13:15.800 --> 13:22.600]  that's where the 500 billion a year in opium out of afghanistan opium heroin cocaine all of it here
[13:22.600 --> 13:30.520]  in the us alone 500 billion a year 500 billion just in what's consumed here and again you know
[13:30.520 --> 13:38.040]  the big banks are laundering that and they're constantly caught doing it we deposited money
[13:38.040 --> 13:42.600]  in a local bank i'm like you know we shouldn't use big national banks you know we have an account
[13:42.600 --> 13:48.840]  for the info wars operation payroll uh in a texas bank but it's still global is connected
[13:48.840 --> 13:54.600]  let's go to a really you know smaller bank so we start putting money in there that we pay for
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.200]  everything with uh and it's all coming directly from you know companies advertisers things like
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.640]  that and they call up my wife and they go what is what is this money you know we we have to prove
[14:05.640 --> 14:10.120]  this isn't laundered money and we're like you have to you know we have to investigate this
[14:10.120 --> 14:16.600]  we're like really well the big banks laundered drug money publicly uh and you can just type in
[14:16.600 --> 14:21.800]  alex shones and the name of the company it's a media operation this is advertising stuff
[14:22.360 --> 14:26.520]  and it's not even that much money and you got hundreds of billions being laundered a year
[14:26.520 --> 14:33.400]  by these big banks and then you start depositing you know 50 60 thousand dollars to pay for the rent
[14:33.400 --> 14:41.000]  and the and the and the employees uh payroll and the power bill and it's like oh what is this money
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.320]  what is this money with the business account what is it what is it i mean it's a joke the whole
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.120]  police state is focused on the law abiding absolutely in our face
[14:52.120 --> 14:58.440]  i've tried to go in before and said i want three thousand dollars cash well what do you want that
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.920]  for sorry we don't have it okay i'm leaving this bank oh we're gonna file a report on you
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.760]  we'll file one with the narcotics trafficking government shut up all right i'm gonna stop right
[15:08.760 --> 15:20.360]  there i've got all this news and i'm already digressing it's just so frustrating to have criminals
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.480]  running the government and the big mega corporations and they've got the total police state behind them
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.240]  and the regulators behind them and they do whatever they want and then you now even in texas you drive
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.880]  up to an illegal checkpoint been ruled illegal and the cops want to search your car and it's like
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.880]  this is a joke this is a this is not about my security this is about a police state a police
[15:41.880 --> 15:47.800]  state never brings you security and the founders spoke of this every major historian this is common
[15:47.800 --> 15:54.520]  sense we know the road we're going down leads to a very very bad place and if you think mint
[15:54.520 --> 16:00.280]  romney's gonna save you i got a bridge i'm gonna sell you and no obama won't save us either they're
[16:00.280 --> 16:07.320]  puppets they're puppets only addressing the puppet structure will ever reverse anything
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.560]  and you can't make a deal with puppet them to have the puppet system think you're nice and i'll
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.240]  cover this now then i'm done talking about it today then i'm gonna get into all the other news
[16:17.240 --> 16:29.320]  and boys there are a lot of it the ron paul ran paul bashing and anger has gotten out of him
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.200]  we cannot let the fact that ran paul is becoming a mainline republican
[16:36.760 --> 16:42.760]  make us all tear each other apart we're still gonna agree with him on the second amendment
[16:42.760 --> 16:49.560]  we're still gonna agree with him on national sovereignty the border on not arresting people
[16:49.560 --> 16:57.480]  that sell raw milk i mean uh marijuana decriminalization things like that he is becoming neoconish
[16:57.480 --> 17:04.760]  on sanctions and wars it's very sad and he has endorsement romney and the response by the campaign
[17:04.760 --> 17:11.000]  is hey i mean this is a quote i read yesterday by jack hunter the official response was hey republican
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.480]  mainline people are gonna won't like us if we don't endorsement romney well then i mean if you
[17:15.480 --> 17:21.240]  believe that ron paul should have endorsed all the wars not ought at the fed you know okay i mean
[17:21.240 --> 17:26.600]  we get it there's no reason to be angry at ran paul or hating i understand people get angry because
[17:26.600 --> 17:34.040]  they feel like it's a betrayal but they want to say hey ran is not ron okay fine and ron wants to
[17:34.040 --> 17:37.320]  coordinate things with him announcing that you know they're not gonna do anything with the delegates
[17:37.320 --> 17:42.520]  now and that that's all over when we knew it was over i didn't like the playing people the last few
[17:42.520 --> 17:46.600]  months as if they were still gonna win or something i'm you know ron paul supporters were calling me
[17:46.600 --> 17:50.120]  going hey the campaign says we're gonna do something big with the delegates and i said you watch they're
[17:50.120 --> 17:56.920]  not gonna do that and so i'm irritated by that i'm irritated by endorsing folks that are you
[17:56.920 --> 18:04.680]  know pro property tax and and cfr i mean there's been a lot of bad signs and it's not like we have
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.800]  to feel bad in the gains we've gotten the fact that ron paul being anti-globalist pro-constitution
[18:09.800 --> 18:14.680]  really won the first few states and created such a phenomenon against the republican establishment
[18:14.680 --> 18:20.520]  shows that the ideas of liberty can take over the republican and democratic parties but at the
[18:20.520 --> 18:26.200]  grassroots you're going to have to do it and don't think you're going to get because i've seen them
[18:26.200 --> 18:33.320]  campaign for liberty this is the real issue go over people that are ron paul types and and go for
[18:33.320 --> 18:39.320]  establishment people so campaign for liberty we hope we'll reverse what they're doing but from the
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.160]  responses we've seen it doesn't look like that's going to happen and so there's not going to be
[18:43.160 --> 18:48.360]  hatred or anger i'm not going to ever seek to get ron paul on this show again ron paul i'm done with
[18:48.360 --> 18:55.720]  them okay i don't dislike them uh i will remember them who they were fondly uh and i will time from

[25:11.800 --> 25:17.000]  as i've been telling you for over a decade really 14 years since i had economists uh
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.720]  your company on and others who said they're going to sell the world their fraudulent directives
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.800]  and their fraudulent derivatives people governments are going to sign on to those
[25:27.800 --> 25:35.160]  as too big to fail and then they're going to raise taxes across the board to bankrupt the middle
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.840]  class and working class to transfer the money offshore and it's now happening they have appointed
[25:40.840 --> 25:47.320]  leaders now in places like idly they are calling them technocrats and now they're saying you know
[25:47.320 --> 25:50.600]  what you're not going to get your money out of the country and you're not going to withdraw
[25:50.600 --> 25:57.240]  we're going to have bank holidays and then after that happens here i've talked to high level stock

[26:08.280 --> 26:13.960]  now exposing it may make them not do it but if the cops all get in line and the military all
[26:13.960 --> 26:18.760]  gets in line and if you get in line they're going there's a federal reserve report out today in the

[28:19.960 --> 28:25.560]  literally she's known for that this is a trader against her country and what does she say she
[28:25.560 --> 28:31.160]  says you need to shut up in Greece and pay more by the way it's she's exempt the eu bureaucrats
[28:31.160 --> 28:39.320]  looked us up are exempt from the taxes i mean you cannot imagine i cannot imagine the magnitude the

[33:18.120 --> 33:23.080]  a soul to steal he was in a bag because he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal when he
[33:23.080 --> 33:27.400]  came across this young man sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot and the devil jumped up on a
[33:27.400 --> 33:32.600]  hickory stump and said boy let me tell you why i guess you didn't know it but i'm a fiddle player
[33:32.600 --> 33:38.280]  too and if you'd care to take a dare i'll make a bet with you now you played pretty good fiddle

[33:49.240 --> 33:55.640]  the best is ever being the gentleman singing right now especially when i know the fiddle
[33:55.640 --> 34:01.800]  playing is coming up and by the way we are gonna get charlie daniel's back on the broadcast he is
[34:01.800 --> 34:12.920]  really waking up to the entire new world order program oh this is a good part right here the
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.280]  devil opened up his case and he said i'll start this show and fire flew from his fingertips as he
[34:18.280 --> 34:23.720]  rosened up his bow and he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss and a band
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.760]  of bureaucrats joined in it sounded something like this all right i'm gonna stop right now that's
[34:28.760 --> 34:36.120]  enough thank you so much for that devil went down to georgia okay let me just mention the news i've
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.280]  got here let's just start over here on the right on the border guns drugs and a betrayal of trust
[34:42.280 --> 34:49.080]  cnn why local towns caught selling guns to the mexican drug cartels so they want to muddy the
[34:49.080 --> 34:55.320]  waters talking about local corruption as well and the loss of trust what about a story cnn about
[34:55.320 --> 35:01.240]  the tens of thousands of us troops killed in secret chemical biological and radiological test
[35:01.240 --> 35:07.720]  that have been declassified right through the 1980s and are still ongoing you know uh private
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.240]  go in that room nerve gas them and then dissect their body and tell mama they died from the flu
[35:13.240 --> 35:19.160]  you think that might be newsworthy no no no no that's so off the chart evil cnn ain't gonna
[35:19.160 --> 35:23.400]  tell you about it even though it's a fact see when i see an article like that that's what i think of
[35:23.400 --> 35:29.800]  oh there was a loss of trust the mayor and police were selling guns to drug dealers really you thought
[35:29.800 --> 35:37.080]  you think so you think that might happen only naive morons don't know that's going on i'd say
[35:37.080 --> 35:44.440]  half the towns in this country have narcotics prostitute running police departments involved
[35:44.440 --> 35:48.120]  in every evil you can imagine then you've got the other half generally who aren't involved in any
[35:48.120 --> 35:53.720]  corruption at all it's like either or generally you either just got absolute corruption or you
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.200]  don't have hardly any because that's how things work in this world they want to tell you it's all
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.760]  a bunch of great stuff going on not in my experience it's either they're not corrupt because they're
[36:02.760 --> 36:08.920]  not corrupt it never gets started or they're just totally corrupt you know i've had frank serpico on
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.640]  the show let's get serpico back on that was a big brownie point for you getting him john bound
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.360]  he was a listener by the way once we got him on that was amazing i want frank serpico like how many
[36:18.360 --> 36:24.120]  of the other detectives were dealing drugs oh 100 other than me i was said i thought it'd be like
[36:24.120 --> 36:29.640]  75 because i had another detective on who was from new york before serpico's day forget his name
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.600]  was like in 2000 probably dead now but he was in there in the 50s and 60s and he said about 75 percent
[36:35.720 --> 36:40.600]  and that's who they had to fire was that many now they don't fire people for that they kill you
[36:40.600 --> 36:46.920]  if you expose it so what do you do you decriminalize it so the police can't be corrupted by it and then
[36:46.920 --> 36:51.800]  you regulate it like alcohol or something and the tax people are so greedy they'll make sure there's no
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.760]  black marketed it or not as big a one because they're greedy for their money you see but instead
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.800]  the banks get all the money by making it illegal and your house gets robbed so the druggy can get
[37:01.800 --> 37:09.000]  the overpriced drugs you knock down the price of the drugs say 500 all the money's out of it
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.280]  oh oh the little pimp drug dealers can't act tough all day and drive around in fancy cars
[37:14.280 --> 37:27.240]  what drug dealer wants drugs to be legalized the answer is zero zero zero zero all right
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.200]  i'm gonna shut up i just mentioned one article never got to the others here's the big article i
[37:32.200 --> 37:37.880]  was just mentioning globalist plan european union police state lockdown that's always been the plan
[37:37.880 --> 37:43.080]  we told you that was coming none of this is a brand new idea that the the breakup is into the
[37:43.080 --> 37:48.280]  authoritarian state holding everyone hostage getting more power each step every year give us
[37:48.280 --> 37:54.360]  trillions more give us total control this will fix it you'll still get your pensions police as long
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.840]  as you shoot protesters you'll still get your money as long as you don't let folks have their money
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.040]  and then of course you'll end up losing your money in the end as well european union apparatchinics
[38:04.040 --> 38:13.480]  are preparing to lock down europe following greece's exit from the euro and again it hasn't
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.800]  exited yet but these they're talking about it and they're openly saying that they will control
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.320]  atm withdrawals subjecting the citizens of member states to rigorous border checks imposing capital
[38:25.320 --> 38:31.160]  controls as a worst-case scenario should athens decide leave the euro reuters reports and again
[38:31.160 --> 38:35.000]  they'll they'll suck grease a lot more dry than other countries before they do that grease is two
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.480]  percent of the economy over there it's a total red herring but you you notice they left all the
[38:41.480 --> 38:46.760]  big border checkpoints in and set up internal ones within the countries they got rid of the
[38:46.760 --> 38:53.000]  borders being manned most the time to let all the foreigners pour in to take jobs and drive down
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  wages and be blocks that would vote against the regular citizens now though they're announcing
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.400]  and this was announced a few weeks ago uh but but but only because they were having some summits
[39:03.400 --> 39:09.320]  but now it's going to be permanent oh we're sorry the foreigners come in oh come on into the mousetrap
[39:09.960 --> 39:14.440]  come on into the roaches come in they don't get out but you're not leaving
[39:16.600 --> 39:23.800]  yeah yeah that's why they got border patrol all the way up in san Antonio now pulling families
[39:23.800 --> 39:28.840]  over they don't stop illegal aliens we're the feds and we're here to search your car why are you
[39:28.840 --> 39:36.520]  here because the tsa inspector said so you want to be slaves you're getting front row seats to it
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.800]  and here come the little switchblade drones the police departments are going to get with gas
[39:42.920 --> 39:50.520]  grenades 12 gauges here come the switch blades all your money to build a giant army against you
[39:50.520 --> 39:55.880]  because the pentagon's been told and nato announced earlier this week they now openly work for
[39:55.880 --> 40:03.240]  the new world order our military is no longer ours it has publicly without even an issue being
[40:03.240 --> 40:10.200]  raised the the joint chiefs the chairman the sec def obama said we get our orders from the united
[40:10.200 --> 40:16.200]  nations and nato and we don't come to you for a jack squad now sit there into your insider trading
[40:16.200 --> 40:23.240]  and have sex with your prostitutes and your pages congress shut up we have all the dirt on you felt
[40:23.240 --> 40:31.000]  shut up and they're like yes sir and that's the end of it the question now is is the military
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.960]  and police wake up the military sure they gave ron paul most of the contributions sure they're
[40:35.960 --> 40:44.040]  they're awake a lot of cops are awake they're not total criminal thugs and but i mean i don't know
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.240]  and i tell you everything's going to be destroyed this is the plan they've already cut 40 percent
[40:49.240 --> 40:55.560]  of our wealth in five years since uh 0708 and they plan another 40 percent they're going to take it
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.720]  all and people are going to be thankful for what they get the poorer they get the more they're
[40:59.720 --> 41:03.720]  going to beg to the government and and you're going to get used to the drone flying by and
[41:03.720 --> 41:09.960]  watching you right out of they live hello there my little friend mommy don't like tattletales
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.880]  well mommy does like tattletales and land of the coward home of the slaves
[41:13.880 --> 41:21.000]  so it is an amazing time to see all this happen you know i kind of went off on a rant yesterday
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.920]  or was it sunday about every time they have the republic of texas biker rally in austin over 100
[41:26.920 --> 41:31.960]  thousand bikers come to the town of a million people and they had what four deaths over the weekend
[41:32.760 --> 41:37.240]  and and some city people said ban the rot rally because of the deaths no you're bringing 100
[41:37.240 --> 41:41.000]  thousand people you know that's freedom they don't want to wear helmets they want to be idiots they
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.280]  want to do that that's their issue what i don't like is most of the motorcycle folks are nice people
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.720]  but a lot of them and they say it's like Sodom and Gomorrah down at the convention center you
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.520]  know sex in the open fights everything else and it's left alone because the cops are intimidated
[41:56.520 --> 42:01.640]  by a bigger gang and it's mob psychology that's why most militaries end up raping killing
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.400]  slaughtering women children for fun a lot our military didn't world war two george washington
[42:07.400 --> 42:12.920]  there was almost none of it because he would hang you hang you for the smallest infraction
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.560]  that was one reason we ended up winning the british were raping killing you know burning
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.240]  down churches washington understood he was also very moral that that that was a big no no and
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.760]  that's how you lose the hearts and minds so if you did anything like even grab on a woman
[42:28.760 --> 42:35.400]  he just had a on the spot court martial and they strung you up in fact in military historians will
[42:35.400 --> 42:40.040]  tell you even foreign ones that that was one of the only militaries and periods where there was
[42:40.040 --> 42:47.400]  almost no massacres or rapes or lootings because george washington would kill you if you did
[42:48.600 --> 42:53.560]  wasn't a debate about it they would hang you or shoot you right there on the spot
[42:55.480 --> 43:03.800]  and but but this is mob psychology and and so i've been at a motorcycle rally just because i was at
[43:03.800 --> 43:10.520]  the south podray island area when one was going on and i hadn't and and they were running around
[43:10.520 --> 43:14.600]  acting tough and bugging their eyes out and driving up with the motorcycles as like they were gonna
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.080]  run into my kids and i mean until i'm again i don't claim to be a tough guy but you menace my
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.240]  three-year-old i mean i'm ready to kill you i mean i'm gonna break your neck buddy i mean you're
[43:23.240 --> 43:28.520]  about to get assaulted and i mean viciously and i mean because i'm normal folks i'm like a dog you
[43:28.520 --> 43:32.520]  attack my puppy i'm going after you i mean there's there's not a i'm like a raccoon i mean i'm just
[43:32.520 --> 43:38.440]  normal i'm i'm still wired straight ahead and i watch the it's like police that's why the average cop
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.920]  is nice they've done studies but they get them in black uniforms they put mask on to take their
[43:42.920 --> 43:49.480]  anonymity i mean i mean to give them anonymity mexico has it russia has it they'll do horrible
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.280]  things when dressed up like darth vader and at night and the and let's go find somebody to beat up
[43:54.280 --> 43:59.960]  because we're all dressed up like this and people do horrible things that's why executioners wear
[43:59.960 --> 44:05.320]  black mask to hide their identity so you know these motorcyclists and their outfits and all the
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.440]  different gangs and groups and they're all there and i take my children
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.160]  my dad heard the story i was disturbed by it i mean i was being i mean i was just being honest
[44:17.160 --> 44:22.040]  about how i felt i was going into you know absolute assault mode and i'm walking with my three
[44:22.040 --> 44:25.160]  children to take them in to eat at a pizza place they they asked to go to the mall eat the pizza
[44:25.160 --> 44:31.960]  place and they go to the lego store and every few months i take them to do that and we're going in
[44:31.960 --> 44:36.040]  and i and i'm walking along the sidewalk along the side of the mall going into california pizza
[44:36.040 --> 44:40.200]  kitchen and a guy all the way on the other side at the big entrance has his bike parked illegally
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.360]  up on the sidewalk i was thinking that's a cool looking bike i like those style of the bars are
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.000]  straight more that old-fashioned look and he fires it up and he looks down the sidewalk and and
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.360]  there's there's you know there's ramps where people walk up right by him and he looks at me and he
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.600]  sees my kids and he revs it up and comes right at us and i started pushing him aside was thinking
[45:00.600 --> 45:05.640]  okay control yourself just push him up against the side of the wall and and i and i was just
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.880]  making the decision i can't help it though i'm gonna i'm gonna jump on him though and then the
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.640]  split second calculation is happening you can get hurt then your kids are left at the mall
[45:13.640 --> 45:19.960]  and so i'm right that point of of my of my computer my brain making the decision and he cuts off and
[45:19.960 --> 45:30.520]  runs down a you know an embankment 15 feet in front of me and i just thought of what type of person
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.880]  sees a man with children and thinks that's a weak person and thinks someone with children
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.520]  is weak and not tough because i wouldn't wear in black leather and strutting around you know all
[45:40.520 --> 45:46.200]  day and then wants to menace somebody i mean it was just like and it was very stressful because
[45:46.200 --> 45:51.240]  because i had to go through okay this guy's looking right at me he's rushing probably 50 miles an hour
[45:51.240 --> 45:57.720]  in a matter of seconds shoots past us and just roars down almost hitting cars coming around the
[45:57.720 --> 46:04.680]  corner i mean this guy and again four of them what is it four i heard today four people four of
[46:04.680 --> 46:10.440]  these people died one of them ran off an embankment down off a mix master and fell 40 feet to their
[46:10.440 --> 46:16.680]  death i mean these are just crazy people and my point is they'll risk their lives to run around
[46:16.680 --> 46:23.480]  acting tough in a big mob psychology gang but they would not risk their lives to fight tyranny
[46:26.120 --> 46:30.440]  and in a way i thought well at least they're out there risking their lives and being wild i mean
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.760]  at least they're not totally domesticated so i was having a love hate relationship in my
[46:34.760 --> 46:42.360]  thought process about these people and my dad sunday we went to dinner with the kids
[46:42.360 --> 46:48.360]  you know after the radio show and he's like you know i wish you wouldn't talk about killing
[46:48.360 --> 46:54.200]  people on air and i was just being honest that i was going into kill mode i mean and people say
[46:54.200 --> 46:59.400]  well that's radical that's that's that's bad i mean what these people shouldn't be menacing
[46:59.400 --> 47:05.560]  menacing children i mean i mean in the old days folks you would have gotten you know dealt with for
[47:05.560 --> 47:12.120]  that and as he drove off almost killed himself i was going to yell something and i just didn't
[47:12.120 --> 47:16.200]  because he was already gone i thought well that guy that idiot'll just kill himself and i'm always
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.680]  seeing these signs about look for bikes be nice to the motorcycles be nice to the you know the
[47:20.680 --> 47:24.920]  regular bike riders and then the bike riders are pulling out in front of you the motorcycle
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.240]  ride people are pulling out in front of you they drive through the middle of the lanes when you're
[47:29.240 --> 47:36.200]  in traffic almost killing themselves no motorcycle riders need to get their act together i mean i'm
[47:36.200 --> 47:41.800]  i'm tired of men bugging their eyes out at me i'm tired and the problem is somebody knows my life
[47:41.800 --> 47:45.400]  i'll go okay let's go ahead and have a fight then punk and then people back off it's like
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.120]  what did you want you wanted to go ahead and start a fight with somebody and then you and then if they
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.480]  respond back you back off because you weren't really looking for a fight you were looking to act tough
[47:55.480 --> 48:01.720]  and have a fake victory over some coward i just cannot believe how weak people are how pathetic
[48:01.720 --> 48:08.840]  they are i mean if i ever got off on menacing children i would i would never commit suicide but
[48:08.840 --> 48:14.040]  i mean i would i would go jump off a cliff i mean if i ever became someone who wanted to menace
[48:14.040 --> 48:21.320]  children and whoever wanted to have power over weak people and whoever wanted people at my mercy
[48:23.480 --> 48:31.640]  i just don't understand it i i i just cannot imagine people like that i cannot even begin to
[48:31.640 --> 48:38.600]  understand it but that's mob psychology that's getting in a crazed mode i mean built born in
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.320]  the builder bergs i got in a crazed mode a few times it felt really good but i was in control
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.720]  of it i knew that's what these instincts are for it was meant to let them know we're aware of them
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.880]  we're angry we're upset with them we're in his Rockefeller didn't go he's super ill a bunch of
[48:51.880 --> 48:57.720]  big names didn't go builder bergs almost dead politically show big victory on that front
[48:59.320 --> 49:05.320]  it's just that we're under such globalist assault how do i get all these men that think it's manly
[49:05.320 --> 49:12.600]  to wear sports team hats and outfits it's manly to ride a motorcycle it's manly to stick their
[49:12.600 --> 49:18.360]  chest out at the swim meet and walk around with their big muscles i mean those big muscles are
[49:18.360 --> 49:24.120]  for defending women and children they're not for shredding around acting tough like you're a rooster
[49:24.120 --> 49:30.600]  in a barnyard humans are supposed to be different
[49:34.200 --> 49:39.000]  and the globalists they are scientists they study us like they're another species they
[49:39.000 --> 49:46.040]  say that in their own words and sit there punching our buttons and absolutely gaming
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.600]  99% of people i'm even gamed i shouldn't be upset about rand paul and ron paul doing a political
[49:54.600 --> 50:00.520]  thing they've been overall useful to liberty you know the fact that they've gotten so big and didn't
[50:00.520 --> 50:04.600]  use that to try to really keep having an effect but kind of instead think they can take over the
[50:04.600 --> 50:10.120]  republican party it's a miscalculation but it doesn't matter compared to genetic engineering
[50:10.120 --> 50:15.720]  world government the drones the police state the checkpoints it isn't about them it shouldn't be
[50:15.720 --> 50:21.720]  about them they could be killed imprisoned set up destroyed it's about an idea that all of us
[50:21.720 --> 50:31.320]  share for liberty that isn't going anywhere so i handled the ron paul thing the way i handled it
[50:31.320 --> 50:38.440]  it's not a mistake it's not a it's not a victory it's just it's a process of working it out i never
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.640]  even got to this i'll get to it later if i have time where people are told grow up and realize
[50:43.640 --> 50:51.240]  we've got to be political we got to where we are because we compromise uh got big tsa news big drone

[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.400]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:12.760]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much

[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.160]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:28.680]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:49.160]  future where man is obsolete now to play highlights from the un uh conference here and stop it and
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:58.600]  start it and analyze it so that is coming up at the bottom of the hour a key report to understand
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.840]  how the globalists think and the world they think they're building see all the tech has backdoors
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:09.960]  in it designed to not empower humanity but absolutely dumb you down in enslave you
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.520]  so the big secrets of the transhumanist leadership does that mean that anyone that talks about
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:23.400]  augmenting humanity through technology is bad no it's not a judgment on that issue itself but you
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:28.440]  need to know all this huxley's brother julian huxley the head of unesco at the un said hitler
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:36.840]  made eugenics look bad and he founded the transhumanist in the late 1940s so it is an offshoot of
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.280]  the globalists trying to become godmen i'm not the one saying that when i broke that down in
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.720]  game uh big publications over and over again say jones believes all this stuff's going to happen
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:53.640]  no i'm not the one saying this my film reports on what they're saying and doing with the quotes
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:10:00.920]  with the articles with the video clips and they are madmen but our entire society is governed by
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.800]  this to to you can talk about a few countries in africa middle east that haven't adopted the
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.880]  globalist program the globalist program is so advanced in every case so far ahead it's a lie
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:20.120]  that the west is only thinking quarterly they get us in the false paradigm politically that we
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:26.360]  follow via the media template to live in a quarterly mindset so that we're not long term
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.400]  thinkers but when you hear the chinese or 25 year thinkers and the japanese folks the globalist
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:39.960]  and brzezinski's written about this are thinking in 100 year 50 year and 25 year plans okay that's
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.720]  why they created the internet that's why they discovered dna look it up everything biometrics
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:54.680]  150 years old eugenics uh genome eugenics all of them were eugenicists because the robber barons
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:01.960]  over 150 years ago in europe england and the united states funded only scientific research along
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:09.000]  those lines and would blackball target and even kill scientists that didn't play ball and it wasn't
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.120]  just with genetics it was with technologies like electricity they shut down tesla that's on record
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:21.160]  rated him and everybody adopted the other systems that we live in a society they built and i played
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.320]  you a clip from the precursor of charlie rosa's show uh with that hefner character on there with
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.840]  the authors of um the wise men back in the 80s admitting these were the guys that built our
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.040]  modern world carol quickly says that and and and so people say well go ahead and let them rule
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.760]  they built the world they built what we live in they want us dead they're getting down towards
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:49.480]  the final end game and they've made a lot of mistakes it's just that they were able to take
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.120]  over because they were ruthless all right i'm already getting into this news the point is okay
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.680]  let's say some of you elitists that follow these guys want to be elitists you say well
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.200]  they're in control why not you know let them have control obviously they they got control
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:10.920]  that's social Darwinistic garbage and again i'm not debating Darwinism one way or the other the
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:22.200]  social Darwinism this idea that if you can get away with something do it that is very very destructive
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.720]  and the point is the globalist are going to destroy themselves but that's coming up let me get into
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:35.480]  drones right now again i i told you more than 15 years ago that there was a plan to fully convert
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:44.200]  the entire pentagon system air force army marines navy to the entire helicopter fixed wing aircraft
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:54.440]  system 100 to drone with only some troop transports themselves that are computer flown on autopilot
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:02.040]  with humans basically is like toilet attendance the new order wants abject programming in humans
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.520]  that's what's shaving the head brainwashing the whole military training developed by the
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.960]  Prussians 300 years ago that that that that took over military training it's all about making you
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:18.840]  follow orders like a machine well the pentagon top futurist like mr marshall at the pentagon
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.520]  they've all said humans are done how did i know all this 14th in years ago because i was
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.160]  because i was
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:39.640]  reading their own documents on air but this was more academic at the time it was not widely
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.440]  publicized people said jones is crazy you can pull these up jones says we're going to face combat
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.120]  ground robots jones says the entire military force will be drones and they're going to be domestically
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.720]  jones says there's already giant blimps at 100 000 feet or more with ground penetrating radar
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.600]  looking through our walls it was it was a pentagon budget i mean it was in there just nobody wanted
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.640]  to talk about it uh jones says they can park these blimps up there in microwave you slowly in your
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.160]  house you don't know why you die cancer that's a pentagon admission jones says they're weaponizing
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.880]  dolphins jones oh jones is crazy what's he think this is buck rogers well yeah buck rogers came out
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:26.200]  in the 20s folks it's 2012 back then it was you know 2000 1998 everything you see in the matrix
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:32.840]  movie is in a pentagon plan they published in 2000 that was declassified from the 70s does
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.440]  that mean they're going to actually do that all i know is everything they wanted to do
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:41.240]  they're a little bit behind but they've gotten exactly what they would say and you see soon
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.680]  you're going to have total interfaces with computers you'll be able to have unlimited
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.800]  pleasure centers philip k dick called these wire heads
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.920]  and people will want and they're going to say it's for the environment they're
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  to be in these pots and they've got movies out i saw it i forget the one with bruce willis uh
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:08.440]  where you know he's like this old you know dirty unhealthy debilitated guy uh who's who's
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:15.320]  got atrophied muscles called surrogates and but then he's got his handsome young body out there
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.560]  walking around that's a pentagon plan and the un came out and announced all of that in this video
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.320]  that's coming up i'm already getting into it as you notice so i watch with horror as they build
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.360]  this thing and and ray Kurzweil doesn't tell you don't tell you at this un meeting where it's all
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:36.680]  happy and lovey it's going to be utopia like zeitgeist we're all in the plastic cities together
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.680]  that
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:49.000]  long before this is implemented they plan to release giant bio attacks to be blamed on private groups
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.840]  to then have giant police state crackdowns and the next bio attack will be an order of magnitude
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.800]  bigger and they plan to kill almost everyone and that's all stated too in hundreds and hundreds of
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.120]  documents but then that's why you see it movies and culture they're getting you ready and they
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.440]  have discovery and history channel shows about the end of humans and how wonderful will be and
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:14.120]  how the nature will come back and and because they're preparing you with a self-fulfilling
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:21.560]  prophecy to accept the end and all the globalists talk about is how they hate the malls and the
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.240]  water parks and ugly humanity and then they give you propaganda so you you act an ugly way to
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.040]  make you the losers they say you are and they plan to kill almost everyone listening to this show
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:40.200]  right now and and so I'm ashamed of myself caring about Ron Paul and and and and and Ron Paul
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.600]  beginning to waffle some you know what they're allies for basic liberty second amendment stuff
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.880]  like that but they're they're informed Ron Paul knew HIV was a weapon two decades ago has been
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:56.840]  criticized for it Ron Paul knows everything I know and more at many levels and he doesn't think the
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:03.800]  public's ready to hear that and he thinks he's going to work with the system he's wrong but
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:10.040]  Ron Paul is not our enemy Ron Paul is our friend and it doesn't even matter look everything is
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.280]  about getting people to realize that we're being inserted into an artificial habitat in the global
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.680]  of stone words and that more and more they're getting the global government they want and the
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.640]  total micromanic system and that and that we've got to shake people out of their trance
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:30.280]  and I've been thinking this for a long time I've thought about radical departures from what I do
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:37.320]  here on air and starting a foundation for the continuation of the human species the human
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:45.240]  preservation foundation you know something along those lines and really really getting
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:51.320]  coteries of people that understand this and creating cell groups public cell groups that are aware
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:57.240]  that educate and prepare people because it's going to be bad okay and it's really going to unseat
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.200]  the system that I've spent time studying their master plan that even most their top minions are
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.080]  deluded and are compartmentalized because they're lazy they could learn all this that if we can
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:15.800]  actually create a 3d model of this and put it in cyberspace of the master plan if we do it soon
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:22.040]  enough it will be so devastating as it all unfolds that people will see it as prophecy it
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:29.240]  isn't prophecy and then they will finally listen and so I've been spinning my wheels wasting my
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.880]  time and I've known this I've known this I mean look I can't even go on air and goof around and
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:39.480]  have fun anymore or cover this news item or that or or plant hooks for the radio audience and even
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:46.920]  I don't even plug sponsors hardly anymore to even fund our operation because it's just all window
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.320]  dressing I realize I I am fully beginning to break the matrix in my own mind and getting a
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.200]  clear image of all this and I'm it's we've got to show people it's a mass illusion
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.360]  I mean look I told you about all this not because I'm smart it's all an admitted plan
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:11.080]  again navy drone crashes off Maryland no injuries just get everybody ready for that find out how
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:17.880]  your local police agencies using drones including predators electronic frontier foundation us drone

[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.600]  power mad people at every level going wild and the coordinated implosion of economies
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:42.680]  deindustrialization all the admitted plans the admissions of gmo designed to reduce our fertility
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:48.680]  until we've got to go to the system to be reactivated they're not going to ask you they're just
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:58.760]  doing it all of this is already so deep into the plan that people walk over to me at swim meets and
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.920]  things i want to talk about sports and stuff and i just like look at them like they're a pygmy
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.560]  trying to tell me about the booga booga you know dragon or something that they say sneaks
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:14.200]  around in the woods i mean i it's it's like talking to mental midgets and i'm not on a power trip
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.600]  i've just learned that the elites think of everybody is absolute garbage they have fooled
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.360]  people through psychology and process they're experts i mean a great example of this is rand
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:31.160]  paul endorsing mit romney the system knows and the rand paul people understand that the public
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:36.920]  is buying into the delusion that well obama's been bad so let's go for mit romney and then romney
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:45.480]  will be bad so let's go for this guy and so they're like hey the public doesn't quite buy what we're
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:52.280]  saying uh they're not they're gonna get mad of us if we don't endorse romney we want to do this
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:01.640]  but it really is rearranging deck chairs on the titanic the real power that the pauls would have
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:08.200]  had was to really call out this system and be called kooks the pauls should know they really
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.840]  won early states that they really were getting the most grassroots donations that they were winning
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:19.880]  the info war and the direction they're taking is one that i'm sure will give them success within
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.320]  the political process but it's a political process that's fake it doesn't go above mit romney and
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:32.200]  barack obama there's a ceiling to this and you don't even break out into the real atmosphere
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.040]  of what's happening in real politic until you break out of that and i
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.400]  i'm not a spectator i know our listeners aren't spectators i mean human potential is about really
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.240]  learning how things work and this is like a giant truman show or the matrix or the analogy of the
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.880]  little man behind the curtain and the great wondrous us i've been behind the curtain and people
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:00.520]  want to keep saying no no it's real and i'm like no it's not no it's not you know ron paul was real
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:04.200]  because the whole system came out against him and lied about him and said he couldn't win
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:10.360]  because he was anti-patriot act anti-torture anti all these wars pro-constitution anti-globalist
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:17.640]  bankster he was exposing corporate welfare he was anathema and now yeah ran paul talked about
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.280]  about the nanny state and hey let the amish have their milk okay great that's little stuff where
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.360]  there's not that big of a lobby against him but where there's a big pro-war lobby
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.320]  he's starting to bend to it and don't you understand just like a third world country
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:38.200]  the pro-war lobby is eating american now the defense department says they're going to have
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.640]  trips on every street and they're going to have local reaction forces and let the police call in

[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.400]  are chem trailing our criminal governments chem trailing because it's it's the same type
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.760]  of psychopaths running things everywhere the russians are involved in the new world order so are the
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:22.280]  chikoms but they're they're they're different gangs using the same management system but

[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:34.440]  sent from russia to syria i mean this thing is escalating fast the us is using the so-called
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.280]  us to get the country back we've got to admit that it was taken they're sending in al-qaeda forces
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:48.280]  it's people are like well don't side with russia side with al-qaeda you know what i'm going to be
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:54.600]  against the initiation of force and starting a war so the globalists can wreck syria and make it even
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:03.000]  more backward than it already has been through sanctions and things once an industrialized
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.600]  society this is the globalist with our money and our name initiating guerrilla warfare attacks
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.800]  now wanting bombardments and i see emails and comments going oh alex imminent war in syria
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.440]  just like everywhere else yeah it is imminent using guerrilla forces and asymmetrical and now
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:24.120]  they're on the news wanting bombardment from the air calling them peace bombs libya was a war so
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.520]  don't ask me to buy into your delusional world where they don't call it a war so hey alex where's
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.880]  libya war thought it was coming and i'm like is that a joke it was a giant war fifty something
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.680]  thousand killed forty thousand of them ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands run out of the country
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.640]  arabel qaeda brought in to do it bombardment all over the country and you're sitting there
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:49.320]  seeing there wasn't a war i mean it's like this alternate dimension or delusional camp followers
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.880]  of the of the matrix system look at you like there's something wrong with you because you're
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.280]  informed it's like an idiocracy where he's before the judge and he's actually defending himself
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.960]  it can actually speak and the judge is like oh he's uh he's uh you know he's gay he's retarded
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:11.160]  he's uh oh look he can talk oh funny talk funny talk and actually add people before and i've been
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:16.200]  in public on vacation reading a book come on over going hey cowboy games on what you're doing reading
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:21.160]  a book and you just look at them and because they can't believe a man is outside by the pool
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:26.840]  you know at some hotel reading a book with his children swimming instead of watching a football
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.400]  game and it's because because listen i live in the real world not in the little world where the men
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:36.520]  swipe each other on the hind end and do all the little stuff and that's what's manly and guys walk
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.240]  out with their case of beer and act real tough to their car to go see a football game you you know
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.360]  yeah and sand dusky grabbing little kids and and the tsa and everything i'm and i'm not criticizing
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:52.600]  if you like football i can go to a football game and get into it it's like an anthropology experiment
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.720]  go yes here are the primitives little event programmed for them there's the defense department
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.360]  propaganda during all the breaks when they make a touchdown they'll cut to military clapping in a
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:08.280]  pavlovian way to associate uh you know victory in touchdowns with the u.s. military you know they
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.720]  make the dunk of the basketball cut to military they make the the the field goal cut to military
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.600]  and i just sit there watching everyone being bombarded with a pentagon set flicker rate to put
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:24.280]  them into a catatonic state near you know near dream state and i mean i and i'm just like oh it's
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:29.720]  real fun yeah yeah it's fun it's it's real fun to be under a psych warfare attack oh oh yeah so
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:36.600]  and some will say oh stop being so uppity i'm not uppity i'm just a regular guy who saw the other
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.680]  side of it and i'm like hey folks this is all a big illusion it's like playdose cave they're all
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:48.360]  down in the cave chained up watching a fire behind them with puppeteers doing a puppet show and they
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.720]  think what's projected on the cave wall just like television man playdough was smart also had to be a
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.960]  eugenicist that's kind of the problem he's their grand guru and they said oh yeah playdough we're
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.440]  gonna actually create a physical and later i saw this and looked it up knowing i would actually
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.680]  find articles about where the globalists did create it and i found some of their own literature
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.560]  where they alike on the television to playdose cave wall i mean these people know what they're
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.360]  doing and they're all looking at the cave wall well one of the guys who's chained up finally
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.520]  is able to break out and he looks up and sees sunlight up there and he goes out and sees deer
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.640]  and fish in the brook and the sun and the moon and it's so incredible and he goes back to him
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:31.080]  and they make fun of him and say look he's not trendy he's imagining stuff we're really good
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.800]  at interpreting the stuff we see on the cave wall dancing in front of us you know like putting your
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.520]  hand in front of a projector when you were a kid doing a duck or a dinosaur and you know they're
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:47.480]  all really good at the little controlled matrix paradigm and laughing at you and he says okay i
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.920]  just wanted to help you and show you there's something much bigger and they say we don't
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:59.080]  want your help pal we want to go back in the matrix i mean and and so i try to reach people in
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:04.120]  the matrix by even going along with the ron paul thing and i realize that doesn't help them you
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:10.040]  want to reach in and that's that's a sellout too that's a smaller thing than what the pauls did
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:17.800]  but even playing games with any of this i realize more and more is addressing and going okay i won't
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:24.040]  talk about the outside big world out there you're making a little duck on the wall there yes yes oh
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:30.680]  look at that a tiger just came out oh yes oh uh-huh there's this whole universe outside the cave and
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.520]  you're not gonna get them you're not gonna get them that way people say you've got to be easy
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:41.240]  with people you've got to be you know slow with it no no it's all a big stinking illusion well how
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.920]  do you know the government's evil look up chemical biological radiological testing on foster children
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.720]  black people us troops back to the 20s they were killing our troops in secret experiments to create
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:00.680]  cadres of scientists who were compromised and who would do anything most of them well meaning
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:05.160]  in a sick way believing it was in justifies the means kill a few hundred to save a few million
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.080]  but those running it were really doing it because they have disdain for everyone
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:15.720]  and want to kill the mass of society all right let's get into the big report and i've already
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.120]  been leading up to this year so this whole in the last 20 minutes really just integrates in with
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:26.920]  this information united nations envisions transhumanist future where man is obsolete
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:34.200]  and that's air index article info wars dot com the globalist future 2045 international congress
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:39.880]  led by a canik futurist ray Kurzweil who says he wants world government and held in moscow a few
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:46.120]  months back lays out stark vision of a future for neo-human where ai cybernetics nanotech and other
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.280]  emerging technologies replaced mankind and openly transhumanist visions now being steered by the
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:58.120]  elite that which emerge out of a Darwinistic circles directed by the likes of th hoxley and
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.560]  his grandchildren julian who coined the term transhumanum transhumanism as all this hoxley
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:10.120]  author of brave new world uh resistance to this rapid shift in society the 2045 conference argues
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:16.760]  there's nothing short of return to the middle ages now let's stop there they they frame the whole
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:23.800]  thing as if it's a foregone conclusion they're offering you this heaven like Valhalla
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.280]  that is a foregone conclusion that your brain will be transplanted in a machine
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.240]  and copies of it will be distributed out and death will be conquered and all of this is going to be
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.440]  wonderful led by ray Kurzweil who says he's going to reanimate his father with the technology
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.840]  because he has a bunch of his father's belongings ain't going to happen pal and that he's going to
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:51.080]  live forever and eat something like 200 pills a day vitamins that's very similar to the longevity
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:56.280]  program but you're not going to live forever on that pal uh but the point is is that Kurzweil
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.320]  and he's got all these elitist and hollywood stars bought into it on his program
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.160]  william shatner the list goes on and on and they go to this conference and it's all global
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:13.400]  government except nanotech except wirehead except interfaces everything's fine they don't tell you
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:20.920]  this is all department of defense 1950s 60s 70s 80s DARPA they don't know it's 1855 Sir Francis
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:27.400]  Galton envisioning biometric computer systems overlays i mean like he was you know almost like
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:33.000]  he was uh channeling you know an off-world engineer from Prometheus i mean these people
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.320]  they are smart come up with all this the entire science first computers hollerith machines
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:45.640]  race mixing study integrated systems all of our modern technologies created by eugenicist or farmed
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:51.560]  out by scientists owned by eugenicist robber barons the entire society the whole technotronic plan
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:57.800]  robotics future not needing us phasing out humanity all of this an hellish future while
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:03.960]  they've been poisoning us and dumbing us down so we can't resist their takeover and then saying we
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:09.080]  deserve it because all we want to do is watch dancing with the stars and tebow and all the
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:15.640]  rest of it i mean this is amazing and then i look at the mistakes they've made they've
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:21.880]  been able to dominate things through sheer cancerous will but that's like cancer taking over the
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:27.400]  body it's not a win and i think about how galton and five for their families the wedgewoods the
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:32.440]  huxleys the darwins others all married and after three generations almost all the children were
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.920]  stillborn totally mentally retarded to start raving man the few that did survive were super
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:43.400]  intelligent but uh extremely anti-human because they enter bread all of that anti-human you know
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:50.200]  garbage to this super breed of of egg-headed toddling crazy people like huxley who wrote in 32 the
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:55.800]  whole plan for world government shrinking humans down through carbon taxes genetic engineering
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.560]  wrecking humans genetics at first to then make them go to the medical tyranny who would then
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.360]  backdoor the genetics and control and create a sub void group of humans to serve them if the
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:08.920]  technocrats don't decide to just kill us all and have robot androids serve them now again
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:15.000]  this is 1932 you can see he then said in 62 before dying this was actually a plan to take over
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.080]  and told the uh berkeley students that they were so stupid they couldn't even understand it well i
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:27.480]  understood your speech buddy pal okay so you guys do not deserve to take over humanity and you say
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:32.040]  we're scum i say we're not i'm going to put out what you're doing and try to get the emergency
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.160]  transmission out i mean this is a worldwide global emergency transmission what you're hearing this is
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.440]  what's really going on not all the other window dressing meant to distract you and either we resist
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:47.080]  this and speak out against this or they're going to carry out the next phases of their plan the only
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.520]  way they'll talk to us is if we cut through all the garbage really address them confront them everywhere
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.600]  and say we're alive we're sentient we're human we're not unconscious we know what you're doing
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.920]  and here's the problems with it and we don't like it and we're going to make sure when you try to
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:07.560]  carry this plan out that we have already exposed it so you don't get away with it
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.480]  and it's the only hope we've got is the truth that you will know the truth the truth will set
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.680]  you free we're going to skip this network break because i've got to get to this video
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.520]  network break stations should not go over these okay again i not only don't do my own
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.120]  airplugs i don't even do the rads anymore this info is so important okay let's we're gonna skip this
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:33.800]  break coming up in a minute let's start going to this video this is what they put out to promoter
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.720]  it happened a few months ago erin pointed it out to me they're always having these conferences but
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.600]  this is with the russian government the un sponsored it and and they just say it's a foregone
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:48.040]  conclusion no more families no more what we were this is what we're gonna be well you know what and
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.400]  they say oh if the amish don't want to do it it won't matter they'll be assimilated one way or the
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.480]  other so in the final equation they'll let you live in little reservations if you don't want to be
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.520]  part of this but in the final equation they say that they're just going to make you be assimilated
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.720]  it's the board well let me explain something it isn't happening i've seen what you people make and
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:16.440]  it's ugly you're cancer just being able to take over is not the proof that you should rule everything
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:21.240]  so here is the sickening promo and we're going to be stopping this throughout when i give the
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.000]  hand signals i don't want to just be audibly cutting it off i'm going to be making quick
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.280]  comments throughout it this is what they say the future is and that this is the one the only good
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:35.000]  future is this future but all of it really has globalist backdoors in it and it's meant to enslave
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.520]  you and get you addicted to computers stimulating your pleasure centers so you'll be happily turned
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:49.240]  off that's the real plan here it is 2045 the world is on the verge of global change
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.600]  engineered by you data transmission has increased by multiples of millions the rate of globally
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.480]  significant events and that of discoveries and crises is growing you've suppressed most the
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:05.240]  real discoveries civilization is like an uncaptained ship sailing on rough seas no the globalist are
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:11.080]  captaining it all the while moving faster and faster the time we have to make the right decisions
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:17.480]  is shorter and shorter we are facing the choice to fall into a new dark age into affliction and
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:22.600]  degradation or to follow a new model hit pause back it up what do i call it the new dark age
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.080]  because they call it that they want a transhumanist new dark age for the rest of us turning off our
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:32.920]  resources in a post-industrial world while in high-tech reservations the new class system they have
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:38.760]  the advanced tech which people beg for like a slave med ipad like a slave created ipad
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.200]  made it slave factories with suicide nets then they give it to the so-called upper class and
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:51.000]  that itself is a weaponized system continue dark age into affliction and degradation or to find a
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:57.880]  new model for human development and create not simply a new civilization but a new mankind oh
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:04.280]  their modern crisis show that to break the deadlock we need technological revolution it is clear that
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:10.200]  today's revolution will also require the deepest social transformation oh yes the world's community
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:16.120]  and leaders should encourage me you win instead of wasting resources on solving momentary problems
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:25.240]  to focus on the technologies of the future nanotechnology biotechnology information technology
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:31.560]  cognitive technology genetics and robotics stop there doing so no need to back it up again
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.840]  and it's true we should focus on the big issues and not on the little petty fake ones but they
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:42.200]  always offer the solution oh their propaganda systems got distracted but here's our template
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:49.080]  go with our model accept the gmo all of it with gmo from day one with all sorts of poisons and
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:55.080]  sterilence engineered into it on purpose so see everything they're going to shovel is meant to destroy
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:02.440]  you then they test it on you and they use what's good for themselves here it is will allow us to
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:09.560]  find new sources of energy globally block those new architecture and transportation allow unprecedented
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:15.960]  developments of human cognitive abilities yeah refine artificial intelligences and brain computer
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:23.720]  interfaces simulate complex systems create humanoid robots and cyborgs and with the help of nano robots
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:31.560]  we may develop manageable matter find ways to transfer one's personality to an artificial carrier
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:38.680]  yet what we need is not just another technological revolution but a new civilizational paradigm
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:45.240]  we need new philosophy and ideology new ethics new culture and new psychology and even new
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:52.200]  metaphysics we must reset our limits go beyond ourselves beyond the earth and beyond the solar
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:58.040]  stop again this they were through the educational system wreck paradigms make them tiny and then
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:03.880]  give four-year-old level oh it's magic come to us and then they get into the religion that will
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:11.320]  guide it the global religion that's anti-human fake environmentalism this is pure liquid death
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:18.040]  continuum this is an adequate response to the challenges of our time thus new reality and future
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:26.760]  man will arise could it happen spontaneously by itself unlikely humanity does not have a master
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:33.320]  plan of it was a pause again it's humanity doesn't have a master plan humanity's dumb but they the
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:39.000]  globalist have a master plan yeah we've been on it for a long time oh the europe's falling apart
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  oh bankers will take over they engineered it we told you how they did it it's on record they did it
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:50.120]  now they're going to be your saviors again they're going to wreck our genetics for the gmo and the
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:56.280]  chemicals they already have now we have to go to them for the designer babies continue stability
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:01.000]  it lives in the present and does not plan it preserves the status quo and tries to escape
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.680]  development it does not tend to map future centuries and take a pause these transhumanists
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.920]  all say they're going to block our general development and only give us tech that controls us
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:17.880]  again they oppose themselves for full spectrum dominance continue pollution in consumer society's
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:27.640]  culture there is no evolutionary vocabulary and rhetoric to break the deadlock the russia 2045
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:33.160]  movement was founded it is a mega project intended to reach new heights and meanings
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:41.080]  we intend to create a new vector for civilization aimed at constant human development and evolution
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.280]  as happened with the mega projects of the last century the nuclear and the space programs
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:50.840]  we integrate the latest discoveries and develop all right let's stop there yeah the space program
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:55.000]  was a front for the secret program again that's what all this is it's about controlling
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.840]  technological development and and then implying that they're basically the gods and again the
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:07.160]  un sponsored this and that they have all the answers and that you should just give in to having your
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:14.120]  humanity ended and merged with machines they make they make remember that with their back doors
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:22.760]  continue energetics aeronautics bioengineering nanotechnology neurology cybernetics cognitive
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:30.040]  science may everlasting spiritual ideals and values help us avoid going astray our project
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:34.760]  will give new meanings to the millions of people on earth will become a result of their joint
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:41.720]  creativity and will lead us out of the impasse away from the murder of nature and physical death
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.880]  forward to the realm of freedom and creativity to the depths of the ocean and to the stars to the
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:57.240]  infinite universe of our inner world our forecast for the next 40 years february 2012 global future
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:03.480]  2045 congress is held in moscow it is a debate platform for discussion of our civilization's
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:12.920]  prospects for development 2012 to 2013 the global economic and social crises are exacerbated
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:19.800]  the debates on the global engineer by globalist densifies new transhumanist movements and parties
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.320]  emerge see russia 20 pause again transform and they get into the end of the family everything
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:31.320]  coming up but again the transhumanist they're going to fix all the problems they've got the
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:38.760]  implantable tech it'll fix all these crises that darpa and the globalist created oh google don't
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:44.360]  be able they're just some tech guys that drink beer and got pinball machines hey non-threatening
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:50.360]  oh warren buffet has an ice cream these are mass killers these are cold-blooded people
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:57.160]  i've been around them go back to the rest of it here it is into world 2045 simultaneously
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:03.560]  the 2045 dot com international social network for open innovation is expanding here anyone
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.680]  interested that's to take your ideas take part in working on it make sure you don't get it spy on
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:14.680]  you in the network there are scientists scholars researchers financiers and managers oh yeah there's
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:22.200]  george sorrow she bet 2013 to 2014 new centers working on cybernetic technologies for the development
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:32.440]  of radical life extension rise the race for immortality starts 2015 to 2020 the avatar is created
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:38.440]  a robotic human copy controlled by thought that's enough to interface i'm gonna get to more of this
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:47.240]  i'm an islandish you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:56.280]  you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:01.000]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.640]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:11.000]  on the body my name is mario safaldi and i'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:16.520]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions

[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:33.720]  all of it is coming up ran paul there's so many issues but let's get into your new book i think
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:38.760]  it's one of your best where did you come up with the name and for folks that uh you know are
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:44.440]  listening right now what is the book break down well uh the name i don't recall who it was it might
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:49.800]  have been senator dean barkley who i appointed to fill the wellstone seat after senator wellstone
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:55.800]  died it may have come from him or whatever but somebody at some point in my life within the
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:02.120]  last decade referred to the two parties as the democrats and the republicans and i thought
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:07.640]  it was so perfect because when you look okay let's go to the crypts and the bloods the two
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:15.080]  street gangs that that we use their names well the crypts colors are blue well what's a democratic
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:23.080]  state it's a blue state right the bloods naturally their color is red republicans what's a what's a
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:30.600]  republican state red state so they even use the same color code as the street gangs and i'd like
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:37.000]  to tell people these two parties are even more dangerous than the street gangs are because
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:43.720]  the crypts and the bloods only occupy small little areas of the us where they can be dangerous
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:50.280]  the gangs the republicans and the democrats affect each and every one of us every day every
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:57.160]  american is affected by these two gangs the democrats and the reblocks and uh so i wrote
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:04.920]  the book because i wanted to expose how horrible it is uh in light of the supreme court's decision
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:11.640]  that money is free speech and that corporations have the same rights as an individual it's now
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:18.360]  completely out of hand alex these corporations are funneling so many millions of dollars into
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:25.880]  these campaigns and these two parties have created a system that is based completely on bribery if you
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:31.640]  bribe them you will get what you want if you don't well you're just out of luck then now
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:38.520]  what troubles me a great deal is that if we commit a bribe offense in the private sector you go to
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:47.240]  jail and yet our whole political system is based upon bribery and you know and money is free speech
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:53.160]  well i i'd love to see the next bank robber when he goes to trial say well your honor i was simply
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:12:01.640]  exercising my right of free speech because after all our supreme court said that money is free speech
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:09.880]  and so clearly our courts are failing us the democrats and republicans the legislative branch
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:17.480]  is failing us the president and the executive branch is failing us and the fourth branch the
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:25.000]  unwritten branch of government the media is failing us why because the media i it was interesting
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:32.600]  i saw dan rather on the other day and if you'll recall he got fired because he reported on george
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:41.720]  bush's uh george bush the kid his service record well every benefit was true and dan rather got
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:48.040]  fired for telling the truth and the other thing the point rather made was back then there were
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:55.800]  probably 40 media outlets giving us information today you're down to about four corporations
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:04.040]  that control all the media in the united states and uh that's dangerous because their control the
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:10.440]  corporate and that's the definition of fascism the corporations are controlling our government
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:15.640]  they're controlling our media if you read the works of general smithley butler the two-time
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.760]  congressional medal of honor winner the most decorated marine in history all he died in the
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:27.000]  40s smithley butler said i didn't fight for the american people i fought for the united fruit
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.080]  corporation when they didn't get cooperation in south and central america they sent in the marines
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:39.480]  to get it and that's what your book breaks down and and uh you're right i mean the cribson bloods
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:44.840]  might kill 500 people or less a year i was looking up some of the crime statistics it was more than
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:50.840]  a thousand a year or so during the peak in the mid and late 1980s the gangs that run our country
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:57.560]  are militarizing the police federalizing and torturing people passing the ndaa saying they'll
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:03.480]  kill citizens when they want saying they'll kill us citizens with weaponized drones inside the us
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:09.400]  they're taxing the daylights out of us they're spying on us without warrants and just admitting it
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.120]  bill gates is coming out with bracelets for students that will determine emotional cognitive
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  response tracking their waves their their their their their brain waves i mean this is like a
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:27.080]  science fiction nightmare and the demo cribs and re blubberkins got caught inside her trading as you
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:33.320]  know governor and they said oh it's legal for us and then you've got legrand over in the imf saying
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:39.640]  she's exempt from taxes but griefs needs to pay more i mean we've got a criminal class running wild
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:44.680]  how do we reverse it i know the book addresses that what's your ideas to stop these people well the
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:50.280]  first thing we could do at the most important thing for anyone that wants to strike out as a
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:57.720]  patriot against where our government's going today stop voting for them that's the simple thing you
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:04.040]  can do quit voting for democrats republicans i am going to fully endorse my former colleague
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:11.080]  governor gary johnson of new mexico he's a terrific man he has the endorsement of the libertarian
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:18.120]  party and he will get my vote i will campaign relentlessly for him because ron paul apparently
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.920]  is going to end it at the end of the republican convention i don't hear any word at all that
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:29.000]  he's going to go independent at all the libertarians made their move already and so i will support
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.760]  governor johnson completely he's quit the republican party because they wouldn't even allow him to
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:40.840]  debate or even participate because he wasn't the chosen one and let me add for people so they
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:47.560]  realize something recall and go back to when the obama mccain election took place and of course
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:54.280]  president obama won immediately upon that we started seeing ads on television about the
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:16:02.440]  mormon religion member those yes all over tv we started getting influx of the giant millboards
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:09.080]  giant giant i'm also a mormon yeah giant millboards too oh yeah well that was to prepare us they
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:16.840]  already had romney picked out at that point the the the republican all this debate was baloney
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:24.120]  always remember this you don't pick your president the two gangs do you'll get a gang member from
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.080]  one side that gang member from the other side and then you're expected to choose which one of
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.040]  those gang members you want to be the president and they are a gang about change that vote for
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:39.960]  governor johnson to be our next president governor ventura i think this is an excellent idea that
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:46.840]  you have to really try to brand things as the republicans being the bloods and the democrats
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:52.760]  being the crepes it's really starting to get political traction out there and i think that's
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:58.040]  why you told me off air you're running into a lot of censorship you're having your interviews cut
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:04.520]  short or cancel we're going to talk about that but since we got into the 2012 race ron paul is
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:11.560]  not as hardcore in a lot of issues now rand came out and endorsed mit romney his father did not endorse
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:19.480]  in the presidential election of course mccain uh this is a big departure people are upset about
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:28.280]  that um what's your take on it well i how do you not endorse your own father i mean ron paul hasn't
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:35.320]  officially left the race they haven't even had their convention yet so my view is that you know
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:41.480]  the tea party's funny i cover that in this book you know it they've been taken over by the coke
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:47.160]  brothers what maybe started off as a good idea then you ended up with glenn beck sarah pale and
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:54.200]  then all them the same as the wall street movement is trying to be co-op by the democrats well these
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:18:01.400]  movements you can't allow that to happen and that is typical gang warfare the gangs will absorb any
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:07.400]  other gang that comes into their territory so these both of these parties act just like the
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:13.240]  street gangs do well that's that's what politics was in rome and they were literal street gangs
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:18.920]  yeah well that's what you have here now you know between these two and the american people i can't
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:25.800]  tell them enough don't vote for democrats or republicans don't vote for how i vote for the
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:30.760]  communists before i vote for them well they're they're banks to run as well uh jesse if you go
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.600]  to the ford foundation but i but exactly they're trying to control every angle of this what do you
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:43.560]  think ran paul was thinking uh endorsing mitt romney when mitt romney is financed by the very same
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:50.920]  people that obama is i mean that's the real gang are these big mega banks oh yeah absolutely and
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:58.520]  the thing is they're not responsible for anything we can't even know now who who the amounts of money
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:04.200]  and who they come from here's the thing i have alex and i know it sounds silly but it's very good
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:08.920]  i think that presidential candidate should be required to wear nascar racing suits
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:17.240]  and i say that because when you look at like jimmy johnson the great nascar racer you can see
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:22.440]  all his sponsors right in front of you because he has patches yeah that means wear it on your sleeve
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:29.640]  exactly he has patches that way we as voters can see who owns these politicians that's a great idea
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:35.640]  make them to wear nascar racing suits so that we know who owns them we know who is contributed to
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:41.800]  them and that way we can be informed voters when we go to the polls all right we got 40 more minutes
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.440]  with him he's not censored here we'll continue getting into his powerful new book available
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:52.280]  at info wars.com i should add demo cribs and reblobblicans no more gangs in government it's
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:57.240]  powerful and we're going to get into his lawsuit against the navy seal the book published by news
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:03.560]  core slandering him libeling him it's all coming up we all know there are secrets behind closed

[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.280]  author movie star tv host is our guest we're going to talk about the tv show where is it supposed to
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:20.040]  be out months ago third season got great ratings top ratings for a new show we're going to be talking
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:24.520]  to him about that i'm obviously in the series and the research amazing topics covered that's
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:30.520]  coming up but governor let's get into this right now you filed suit back in february against chris
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:37.560]  kyle the navy seal sniper who said that you came into the big famous navy seal bar and said i'm
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:41.800]  glad navy seals are dying of course you've talked about navy seals many times how you hate that the
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:46.920]  troops are dying period i've seen you talk to veterans and get tears in your eyes at the airport
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:52.840]  i knew that was a lie i confronted him on air he kind of backtracked when i was on opium anthony
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:58.120]  show i was trying to feel him out you've now sued him you can't tell that the listeners everything
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:03.960]  you've told me but i mean can you i mean you got this guy in your crosshairs big time you were in
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:08.680]  court with him last week tell us what's happening with your lawsuit against harper well against
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.720]  chris kyle i was saying it should be against harper collins that's news core that's fox news
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:17.480]  because they're the ones that got him on air and i'll bet they're the ones that got him to
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:22.200]  say this they're the ones that ghost wrote it that's admitted so that that would be my target
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:27.480]  governor but tell us where we are right now well they still may end up the target i mean we have
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:32.680]  the ability to add whoever we want to the lawsuit and the first thing i would like to say alex is
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:41.080]  quite simple if this had happened if this was reality i would not be suing him but because it
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:48.840]  did not happen it's a made-up story uh unfortunately now the only remedy i can get is to go into the
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:54.520]  federal court system and go to trial put it in front of a jury and i will let a jury decide who's
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:00.520]  telling the truth and what witnesses i mean i have my wife witnesses of the people who were with me
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:07.640]  all night long and they are all maybe seals they're my generation of seals they're not the young ones
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:14.360]  that this guy's a member of and we'll let a jury decide but uh you know i've i've been out to make
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.960]  peace sense when i came back from cat from mexico i made a purpose trip to go there to photograph
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:26.680]  the patio and everything like that for the trial and uh i had people there telling me that this
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:31.880]  never happened well you said the owner and well there's also terry moi who was one of the famous
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:37.240]  navy seal trainers uh you weren't going to sue you told me off air the other day and please
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:43.240]  repeat that if it's okay but i was going to sue but instructor moi gave me more and i've always
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.600]  obeyed his orders he's my first phase instructor when i went through buds basic underwater demolition
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:56.040]  shield training and moi told me he said take this guy to the root take him all the way well i don't
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:02.120]  i don't not obey my first phase instructor even today if he tells me something i'm probably going
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:08.520]  to do it so but he made me feel good telling me that none of the old timers believe this at all
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:15.320]  they all think it's a bunch of bs they know it's a bunch of bs i have never ever blamed the military
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:22.360]  i look at the military men and women as victims they're victims of political poor politicians
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:28.200]  but you've said that 20 times on my show before and other shows you always say that that's why
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:33.560]  when i knew that when i heard that i knew it was pure bull and also saying that you were
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.840]  others said you were drinking i know you haven't had alcohol in many years i've been years i have
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:46.840]  not had an alcohol for 10 years and this and get this here's the thing to look at alex i mean if
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:52.840]  something like this would have happened in oh six how would it be contained and we would only learn
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:28:01.560]  about it in 2012 or 2011 2012 i guess he revealed in january you mean to tell me this happened six
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:09.480]  five six years ago and not one word of it leaked out baloney it would have been in the newspaper
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:15.320]  the next day absolutely i mean i'm a former governor if i'd have been dept in the bar in
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.080]  coronado that the police and in his book even said the police were there but let's not forget
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:26.920]  what happened two weeks before and you called me about it and wanted to come on air to get it out
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:34.120]  news corps again came out and said you had been in road rage with the police in california going
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.840]  to the airport when everyone knows you hadn't flown for over a year at that point yeah i hadn't
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:45.880]  flown for a year and a half and the last time i was in california was last july for my birthday
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:52.120]  i celebrated my 60th birthday with actor harry dean stanton who has the his birthday's the day
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:29:00.280]  before mine i was there 85 and i drove i drove to california to do that i did not get on an
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:07.400]  airplane and so there's another lie that has come out you know and naturally i think that happened
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:13.480]  because i was rattling my sword about possibly joining ron pearl and if he if he became an
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:18.920]  independent that i would consider being his running mate so anytime i rabble my sword on
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:25.240]  national politics it seems there's a concerted effort to defame me yeah your road raging when
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:32.120]  you were on record in minnesota uh they say you're in california road raging uh when they know you're
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:36.360]  going into mexico and and and are off the phone for a few days they say that you were saying you're
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:42.280]  glad navy seals have died i mean they are really trying to swiftboat you stay there i want to
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:46.200]  see if you agree with that statement on the other side we'll get into all these other big issues

[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:11.240]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:16.920]  all right we're not going to dwell on this too much because governor ventura wants it all to
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:21.160]  come out in court that's what his lawyers have advised i agree with him it's going to come out
[02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:28.120]  depositions have begun um i don't know how much ventura can repeat here but do you feel that you've
[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:34.200]  been uh swift boated and when was the last time you were in a bar room fight governor well uh i
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:39.080]  absolutely feel that i've been swift boated there's no doubt about it and what was interesting when
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:46.600]  it happened to senator terry i learned later that his main accuser did not even arrive in vietnam
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:53.240]  until months after senator terry had already come home to the states so the guy wasn't even there
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:59.960]  to question whether senate the senator had earned his medals or not and besides you don't put yourself
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:06.920]  in for medals your commanding officer does so it was really so yeah i feel i've been swift boated
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:13.240]  there's no doubt about it but as i said i wouldn't be suing the guy if if if the story were true
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:20.200]  and the story is completely false and therefore my only alternative to clear my name and to attempt
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:25.080]  to get it cleared is to take him to court and i'll let a jury decide who they want to believe
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:30.680]  can we talk about uh your lawyers if they're confident uh you know absolutely they're confident
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:35.320]  i'll that's all i'll say they should yes they're they're very confident or i wouldn't be going to
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:38.600]  court no i know but you told me that off air but i want to make sure that that wasn't
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:43.320]  over there they feel very good about the case that they could win the case but yeah i never know
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.800]  for sure yeah just to be clear i'm not leading jesse ventura i'm trying to get him to repeat
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:55.240]  stuff he's told me without letting out what he's told me but i tell you uh the right thing to do is
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:35:01.880]  chris kyle needs to go ahead and go public now and admit the truth before this gets much deeper
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:08.920]  just go ahead and tell us what news core told you to do well i certainly i don't you know it would
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:16.600]  be my preference alex not to go to court because court gets very expensive but he leaves me no choice
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:24.120]  i mean he won't admit that the story is made up for whatever reason it was it's not true and uh
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:29.640]  so i'm left with no alternative but to go to court let a jury decide it but you know when i first
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:34.680]  met you seven years ago i i heard some propaganda on the web so i looked it up myself made some phone
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:38.200]  calls and found out you were telling the truth but just to bring this up here and we'll get back
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:42.600]  into all the other issues in the book it's so powerful again all the last three have been so
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:48.680]  good so informative i don't know which one's my favorite but lord montan he is a hereditary
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:54.440]  pier it's listed on the royal websites in england his dad was a famous lord and he's lord christopher
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.320]  montan an anti global warming guy you interviewed him for one of your tv shows they ran a big hoax
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:06.120]  saying he's not a lord and he made it up and counting on the public being ignorant so they say
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.120]  you're not navy seal well i was like wait a minute underwater demolition team the history
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.720]  channel says that's what started the seals he went through seals training he was you know in the
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:19.320]  vietnam era and i went and looked and found out that it was people that didn't like your anti
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:25.880]  war stance came out and said you were never in the seals next they may say that i'm not even who i
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:30.840]  say i am either we have to defend each other when they come out with these hoaxes if they come out
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:36.120]  folks and say i'm a drug dealer it's not true i mean i have a pretty boring life i mean it scares
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:41.080]  me to know what are they going to make up about us next governor yeah absolutely you know and in
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:46.840]  this country today uh you have to be prepared to defend yourself especially with the internet
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:52.680]  you know anything can be put on the internet the internet's a great thing don't get me wrong it's
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.960]  tremendous because it gives us a great deal of information that we don't get with the mainstream
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:04.920]  media but on the flip side just like anything there's an upside there's a downside on the downside
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:10.280]  you have to be very careful what you believe and choose to believe because anyone can lie on the
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:16.440]  internet there there is no nothing there no truth detection device that you can apply to the internet
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:20.360]  well sure you know absolutely if you're hearing the truth or not it's just like the mainstream
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:26.600]  media you've got to go to the original sources yep and and that brings us to the next issue
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:30.920]  again you've told me a lot of stuff and confidence which i appreciate because i've been part of the
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:36.360]  show three seasons we've got to be friends uh a lot of crazy stuff went on behind the scenes but
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.160]  i've been sworn to secrecy about the things that happened not just the congressman calling her
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:48.200]  homeland security threatening time warner the parent company of of true tv we know they pulled
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:54.040]  your homeland security piece on the FEMA camps since that happened the army governor has admitted
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:59.160]  they have reeducation camps we got a document two months ago the army responded said yes that's a
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:04.920]  classified document so now you've been validated but they had that pulled or raced off tivo never
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:10.840]  reared as the other episodes do dozens of times what is happening with the third installment
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:18.120]  of conspiracy theory well unfortunately we finished it all in november uh normally it would go on
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:25.720]  the air in january it's now sitting there being nipped with more uh you know i think it's a delay
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:33.160]  tactic i now believe i 50 50 that the eight shows we did this fall we'll never see the light of day
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:42.040]  because it's already tuned we had them done in november you know and they're they're they're
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:49.000]  supposedly still doing the fine tuning of editing well give me a break you can get that done in two
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.480]  to three weeks a month at the moment they made them totally reedited and then still didn't like it
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:39:00.200]  but both shows were big hits big hits well both seasons have been outstanding and this would have
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:05.800]  been the third season of eight more shows but i don't know if they're ever going to see the light
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:12.760]  of day or not you know it's a true tv has the right to not put them on certainly and i see no
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:18.360]  indication that they're going to be on uh they may you know i don't know maybe they'll wait till
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:24.520]  fall and put them on during the election time that'd be wonderful but uh i don't know i mean they've
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:29.960]  sure you know they've they've gone out of their normal mode because normally we finished them in
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:39.400]  november and they air right away in january and the major tv publications reported that both seasons
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:48.120]  got record viewers for new seasons 1.7 1.8 million viewers for that channel is as big as it basically
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:55.720]  gets for them huge hits and millions and millions spent to make them and now the question is do you
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:01.000]  think putting pressure on them people contacting them will have any effect or do you think outside
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.120]  pressure has been placed on them i i think that could work the opposite that could make them not
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:11.720]  put them on if the if the if the people who are deciding because they're too controversial or they
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:17.080]  have information that the public doesn't want to get and if maybe if the public starts demanding it
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:22.760]  that'll make them even lock them up more i don't know i don't know which way to go on that alexa
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:28.280]  certainly people are entitled to express their opinion if they would like to contact them i
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:33.400]  i'm not going to tell them not to you you can do what you want i'm a great believer in personal
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:38.760]  freedom and every one of your listeners should have the ability to have personal freedom if they
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:44.280]  want to write a letter asking what's happened to conspiracy theory why are you sitting on it why
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:50.760]  won't you air them the way jesse ventura and then edited them instead of re-editing them and you
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:55.080]  know dumbing them down which is really what they're trying to do i think they're trying to really dumb
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:41:00.680]  them down yeah it's i've been told them behind the scenes stuff i better just keep my mouth shut
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.760]  because i was told in confidence it's pretty it's pretty bad but that's a sign of success
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:09.880]  let's go back here on this subject because a lot of people don't know about this even though you've
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:16.440]  talked about it some tell folks what msnbc did with the golden handcuffs with the what
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:23.640]  you know how they gave you the contract basically okay i didn't catch it yeah no when i first came
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:29.080]  out of office i was the hottest commodity out there i didn't seek a second term i was the
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:35.080]  voice of the independent uh you know as as uh ellen or cliff called me the high priest of the
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:43.160]  third party movement and uh so they gotten a bidding war between fox msnbc and cnn who would
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:49.080]  give me a which would give me a show five days a week on television in the evening and msnbc
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:54.280]  won out well we went together we followed everything they wanted done they even said i
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:59.160]  wanted a shot in minneapolis because i thought it would be nice to get a midwest perspective
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.840]  for a change rather than the east or west coast where they do most of their stuff and they agreed
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:12.760]  to it so they even sent an msnbc guy out to work with us and create the whole show well we created
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:18.440]  did everything they wanted and erik sorenson who was in charge came out he didn't even watch the
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:25.080]  the show we did and told us that he wouldn't put us on the air well then let me back up a little
[02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:31.640]  when they first hired me erik took me to the super bowl in san diego and we were driving
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:38.440]  up to los angeles then and in the car he told me that after he hired me he got two phone calls
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:45.240]  from people very high up in washington he would never reveal to me who they were but he said that
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:51.480]  these people were very angry and wanted to know why they were giving me a national forum
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:59.560]  you know a show on national tv wow well lo and behold i never got it because they pulled the
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:05.560]  plug on the show basically they relegated us to a few saturday shows where we i think we had four
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:12.120]  or five shows on saturday at five o'clock it was still the second highest rated show they had
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:19.720]  right behind hardball with chris mafios with no promotion no nothing and then they simply cut me
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:25.640]  and because i was under contract with them for three years and i honor my contracts
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:32.440]  my contract stated that i could not do any new shows nor could i participate in anything
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:40.120]  on cable television at all so in essence they found and gagged me and they paid me the entire
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:47.880]  money and i will just say this i was paid like a professional athlete on that level so they paid
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:55.720]  me the entire three years my checks came even my assistant got paid for the entire three years but
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:02.840]  i had to bend as i said honor my contract and so for three years i could not speak out on anything
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:08.200]  yeah you were the hottest commodity out there i remember and they literally at the time i said
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:14.520]  on air he's off the air that's golden handcuffs they do that to executives and people they're
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:18.600]  scared of that will go start a new company you were given golden handcuffs governor
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:25.160]  yeah i'm sure i was and uh and then of course the contract ended and that three years later
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:30.360]  that's when you saw me re-emerge again when i wrote the book you know uh uh don't start the
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:37.480]  revolution without me the first book yeah and uh and uh i then started of course going on tv shows
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:42.440]  and all that because they no longer contract and that got high ratings that and you destroyed
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.560]  hanity you i mean you do really good in person when people get nasty because you're so calm and
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:51.720]  works so well on your feet now i'm noticing they don't put you on as much even though you're
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:57.320]  war assault after guests let's talk about what's happening now they're really scared of this idea
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:03.480]  of the republicans and democrats being gangs well they like i said fox news won't have me on at all
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:10.200]  that they're nighttime they're big people uh msnbc will not have me on they're now the liberal side
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:16.280]  they're the they're the democrat side the others the republican side those two the only team now
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:23.160]  fox news puts me on but i think they're a different department i am doing a couple on fox news
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:30.120]  but that's a different different bell wax i think and and cnn will have me on although this morning
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:36.040]  on cnn i was supposed to get three segments because they asked me for three songs to lead in
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:42.600]  in so i gave them uh a whole lot of love by led zeppelin hr by jimmy hendrickson sympathy for
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:48.440]  the devil by the stones well the only one played was a whole lot of love because they had me for
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:53.960]  one brief three minute segment this morning i believe i was caught there even at cnn although
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:46:00.600]  i did have a terrific interview last night with pierce Morgan and then you also got cut with uh
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.560]  it doesn't really matter he didn't have many listeners but don imus oh yeah don imus uh you
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:12.120]  know i they wanted me to have five songs so i chose five songs by rage against the machine
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:18.440]  and people who don't follow that era of rock they were banned by clear channel none of their music
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:25.400]  was allowed to be played prior to and during the iraq war so and i'm a huge fan now of tom morello

[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:04.840]  caught raping stealing molesting running child porn running prostitutes i mean who else would
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:11.160]  want to grab people's genitals uh all day what is your take on the tsa and now two years you haven't
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:16.280]  flown governor well you know i don't know about any of that stuff alex so i'm not going to comment
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:22.840]  on it i can only speak to my own experience and how i feel and that is this i'm outraged that i bring
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:29.400]  it cost me twenty thousand dollars to go to court in front of a federal judge to be told she didn't
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:35.880]  have jurisdiction over a constitutional question and that's what they do but with anyone the
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:41.320]  challenges in our court system the tsa and homeland security they don't have jurisdiction
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.840]  well people need to understand clearly when you go to any airport in the united states today
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:53.160]  you are not protected by the constitution or the bill of rights in other words they can do anything
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:58.840]  they want to you out there and there's nowhere you can seek redress because the courts will not
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:03.160]  hear it it's a lawless criminal zone but let me raise this to you because i understand you've been
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:09.400]  out of the country until a few weeks ago this is uh the congresswoman uh marcia blackburn she listed
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:15.080]  50 pedophile crimes of the ts i mean i mean this is in the news so i'm saying if that's true
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:19.160]  i mean you told me off air you're not surprised but no sir i mean it is true that they're finding
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:23.640]  a bunch of them that are being put in leadership positions are pervs what do you think of that
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:29.880]  well i wouldn't say i believe that that's why uh pedophiles become catholic priests i believe
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:35.480]  their pedophiles burst and they become priests because pedophiles are nothing but predators
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:42.040]  they're hunters yes they hunt children they can't be cured and so they need to put themselves in
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:48.200]  the position where the hunting is good and that's why i believe when you got pedophile priests
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:54.680]  they were pedophiles long before they became priests yes and uh this and so why wouldn't they
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:00.840]  join the tsa where they can group little children and where they have the government's blessing to
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:07.880]  do so you know uh that's one of the places where lou dobbs and i stand hand in hand lou dobbs said
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:13.480]  thank you governor when i brought the lawsuit and in fact i'll be doing lou show so it'll be
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:18.760]  interesting to see you know what he says to me about the dismissal of my lawsuit the way it was
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:24.520]  but again it doesn't surprise me because pedophiles are predators and they're going to go wherever
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:32.040]  the hunting is best to satisfy their sick demented minds when they should belong in jail they'll put
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:38.680]  pot smokers in jail but they'll turn pedophiles loose in the neighborhood well said governor
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.120]  you're absolutely right i just want to repeat what you said privately on the phone yesterday
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:47.320]  and yes that is the case folks it is a pedophile epidemic the congresswoman is exposing it
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:52.920]  this is really coming out and uh these are abusers and they're not all pedophiles some of them like

[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:19.560]  that's gotta be good uh how was that well it was uh very enjoyable really i call it flushing your
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:25.400]  brain out and uh i tell you alex more people ought to do it you know take a week off and go watch
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:31.000]  television for a week and learn what else goes on in the world besides what's on that magical
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:37.400]  tube because it controls our lives far too much it does uh going back during the break some of the
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:41.320]  best radios happening off air i said what do you want to cover in the last five-minute segment
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.680]  you said rand paul that's terrible so we'd already mentioned that but you wanted to say
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.880]  some more about that and i want to ask you about drones i mean what do you think it's
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:53.560]  going to do to rand paul and ron paul endorsing romning i don't know i mean the ron ron paul
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:58.520]  has endorsed romby has he now but he kind of announced oh now the campaign is lost the same
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:03.800]  day so it's coordinated well then you know it's going to be pretty sad because uh you know i
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.560]  thought that through you know the hope of an independent would show up and again that's why
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:14.040]  i urge everybody vote for governor gary johnson the former governor of new mexico we serve together
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:20.840]  i know him well he's a wonderful honest man he's the libertarian candidate and if people want to
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:27.960]  rebel in this country don't vote for the democrats or republicans vote for the libertarian gary johnson
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:34.040]  that'll send a shockwave through him you know even if he does well he doesn't even have to win
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:40.120]  if he gets you know say 10 million more votes or 20 million more votes than they would expect him to
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:45.320]  get it'll scare the hell out of them and people say well obama will win well they're all the same
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:52.200]  let it get worse it didn't let me be clear with the public they're paid off by both sides it does
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:58.280]  not matter with the democrats and republicans it makes no difference who you elect no no i know
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:03.720]  that but i that's the point i was making is that is it's a total illusion but specifically what did
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:09.880]  you say during the break though well i don't know refresh my memory well no you were just saying you
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:14.200]  didn't like what ran did i want your text i don't like that you know that that that he would not
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:20.840]  endorse his own father that's pretty strange to me i mean ron hasn't officially dropped out of the
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:27.640]  race until after the convention why would he throw his support to mit romney well that's why i'm upset
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.640]  is that ron the day that happened said well we won't win with the delegates so we kind of halfway
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:36.520]  conceded but they never fully do it because they want to keep the the troops all fired up and that's
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:40.520]  kind of like getting your dog excited you're taking it for a walk and then throwing it in the closet
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:44.840]  i don't like teasing people but again i i still care about them i just hope they get back on the
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:51.160]  straight and narrow no compromise drones governor 30 000 armed drones local police getting them
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:55.240]  they've got one called a switchblade that's got like a hand grenade in the nose a little
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:59.560]  bitty one they're gonna use on us they've announced the military will be on the streets of america
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:04.840]  what's your take on the whole police state all of this well it's hard you know i i i talked about
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:11.800]  it when that bill came forward uh the defense bill that turned the american military i think it was
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:19.240]  senate bill 1768 i don't know if my numbers are exact but sponsored by john mccain and carl levin
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:27.400]  from michigan the democrat outrageous that defies the constitution to me you know it's it spits on
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:33.320]  the constitution of the united states and it passed overwhelmingly so it shows you again
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:38.920]  the democrats grips and the republicans they use the constitution like toilet paper
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:44.920]  they are treasonous traitors they are gangs that have hijacked our country exactly and it's like
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:50.760]  using it as toilet paper the constitution means nothing to them and that's why we have to get
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:57.800]  we can we the people are going to have to take care of ourselves because uh they're not going to
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:03.960]  have these drones how dare of them have flying drones going around our country it's bad enough
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:10.520]  they got us under surveillance you know clearly they don't trust us for whatever reason well it's
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:16.200]  also very cowardly that they're gonna have armies of flying and rolling drones attack us i mean with
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:23.880]  our money yeah that's your tax dollars being spent to go against you you know i always laugh about
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:30.040]  what happened in iran imagine for a moment alex if say hugo chavez got an unmanned drone
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:36.520]  and flew it over the united states airspace and it crashed here we would declare war on him
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:43.240]  and yet we do it to iran we fly over well well said governor well said hypocrisy is ridiculous it is
