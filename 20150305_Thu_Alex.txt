[00:00.000 --> 00:06.820]  Broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Thursday, the fifth day of March
[00:06.820 --> 00:08.820]  2015 edition.
[00:08.820 --> 00:13.640]  Rob Dew reporting on the steps of the Texas State Capitol, where today we have the National
[00:13.640 --> 00:19.640]  Vaccine Information Centers on site actually doing some lobbying for specific bills that
[00:19.640 --> 00:21.120]  are being introduced in Texas.
[00:21.120 --> 00:25.760]  Right now, across the nation, there are 74 bills dealing with vaccines, only about eight
[00:25.760 --> 00:26.760]  are pro-freedom.
[00:26.760 --> 00:31.200]  Most of them are lacking in privacy and conscientious beliefs.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.560]  These are trying to be eviscerated across the country.
[00:33.560 --> 00:38.280]  Here in Texas, there's about 10 bills so far this year and only one of them is pro-freedom.
[00:38.280 --> 00:40.480]  I'm just going to go over the list of bills here.
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.280]  HB 1674 requires physician counseling for conscientious and religious belief exemption.
[00:46.280 --> 00:49.400]  That means they're going to bring a physician in to kind of brainwash you if you decide
[00:49.400 --> 00:52.160]  you don't want to get vaccines for you or your children.
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.760]  SB 547 requires posting of exemption numbers on the internet by schools and the Department
[00:57.760 --> 00:58.760]  of Health.
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.960]  HB 1593 requires all public schools to provide parents the number of students enrolled not
[01:03.960 --> 01:04.960]  fully vaccinated.
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.520]  And then we have SB 29 and HB 465, essentially the same thing, makes inclusion into the
[01:11.520 --> 01:16.800]  vaccine tracking system automatic and removes the current opt-in consent requirements.
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.960]  When I had my third child, I actually signed a form that said I did not want to be included
[01:21.960 --> 01:22.960]  in this system.
[01:22.960 --> 01:26.000]  They're not even going to let you do that anymore, they're going to automatically opt
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  you in.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  HB 212 allows minors 14 years of older in the Texas Juvenile Justice System to consent
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.200]  to be vaccinated.
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.640]  This is so they could implant young women and young men with the Gardasil vaccine.
[01:38.640 --> 01:41.760]  That's right, they've now created a Gardasil vaccine for men.
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.000]  HB 1185 adds advanced practice nurses to those that can sign a medical exemption form in
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Texas.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.640]  HB 2006, this is introduced by Jason Villaba up in Dallas.
[01:52.640 --> 01:55.280]  It eliminates conscientious exemptions to vaccinations.
[01:55.280 --> 02:01.320]  They're going to take that ability away from you with this bill 2006, HB 2006, be on the
[02:01.320 --> 02:02.480]  lookout for this.
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.520]  And then SB 298 adds a new meningitis vaccine mandate for public schools.
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.640]  So there we see more vaccinations being added to the schedule, less testing being done,
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.600]  and now it looks like the state of Texas, some representatives want to take away your
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.240]  ability to get rid of the conscientious exemption.
[02:19.240 --> 02:24.520]  The Texas State Capitol was enveloped in a cloud of mist, just as the safety and effectiveness
[02:24.520 --> 02:26.840]  of vaccines truly is.
[02:26.840 --> 02:31.640]  In addition to the draconian HB 2006, which will eliminate conscientious exemptions to
[02:31.640 --> 02:41.880]  vaccinations, four other bills, SB 547, HB 1593, SB 29, and HB 465 are all about eliminating
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.320]  privacy and broadcasting to the public who has been vaccinated and who hasn't.
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.720]  This will create an anti-vaxxer blacklist.
[02:48.720 --> 02:53.440]  That's why I came down here, just to remind these people, give them a little civics lesson
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.240]  that they seem to have forgotten.
[02:55.240 --> 02:59.400]  They're talking database, computer list, tracking, hello.
[02:59.400 --> 03:02.920]  You know, that's not the American way.
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.560]  What they're talking about is the communist manifesto here, and I'm not going to put up
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  with it.
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.160]  This granny is going to speak her mind as much as she can.
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.480]  And then there's HB 1674, which will require physicians to actually scare you into taking
[03:19.480 --> 03:22.720]  your vaccines, even though you've already said you don't want them.
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.040]  These are all examples of the tyranny coming down if you don't get active.
[03:27.040 --> 03:30.200]  We did go to the office of Representative Jason Villaba at a Dallas.
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.720]  He's a Republican, and he wrote House Bill 2006, which removes the conscientious exemption
[03:35.720 --> 03:38.160]  from the vaccination schedule.
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.360]  So that would not allow you, unless you had a reason, a medical reason, or religious exemption
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.160]  to opt out of vaccinations, the mandatory vaccination schedule, which is pretty horrendous
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.640]  in the state of Texas.
[03:49.640 --> 03:51.160]  So this would knock that out.
[03:51.160 --> 03:57.120]  He listed his press release that since 2003, the number of immunized, un-immunized students
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.040]  attending Texas public schools has grown from 2,000 to nearly 40,000.
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.680]  To me, that means a lot more parents are waking up to the dangers of forced vaccination, and
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.720]  they either want to delay the scheduling or opt out of some of the shots altogether, some
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.800]  of which aren't even like threatening like the rotovirus or the chickenpox virus.
[04:13.800 --> 04:18.240]  He also lists that he consulted physicians, parents, PTAs, immunologists, experts, and
[04:18.240 --> 04:21.760]  his own wife, and that he believes he must act to prevent the kind of outbreaks that
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.680]  we're seeing in California and Illinois.
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.120]  Incidentally enough, the measles outbreak in Disney was traced back to a vaccinated individual.
[04:29.120 --> 04:34.000]  So there we have vaccinated individuals getting the disease and then shedding it out through
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.560]  their own natural processes, getting other people sick.
[04:37.560 --> 04:39.960]  We've seen this happen in other areas.
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.280]  China has a 99% vaccination rate, yet they can't get rid of the measles and whooping
[04:43.280 --> 04:44.280]  cough.
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.040]  Maybe that's because they are spreading the measles and whooping cough with these vaccinations.
[04:49.040 --> 04:51.840]  Nobody knows for sure because the proper tests have not been done on this because you can't
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.080]  get the vaccination companies, big pharma, to do any kind of testing in this regard other
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.600]  than saying the vaccines are safe and effective.
[04:58.600 --> 05:01.800]  So reporting from the Texas State Capitol, this is Rob Dew for M4's Nightly News and
[05:01.800 --> 05:07.080]  for the day's of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.080]  health.
[05:08.080 --> 05:13.480]  Introducing the new infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation, a highly advanced
[05:13.480 --> 05:18.160]  nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations

[05:25.880 --> 05:31.280]  sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[05:31.280 --> 05:37.040]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no
[05:37.040 --> 05:40.920]  longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[05:40.920 --> 05:44.880]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most
[05:44.880 --> 05:47.400]  powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.480]  This winter season is more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.680]  Now available in our limited first run at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com or

[06:06.080 --> 06:11.600]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female
[06:11.600 --> 06:17.600]  vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance

[06:31.520 --> 06:35.200]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.560]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.560]  Can you put two and two together?
[06:41.560 --> 06:47.160]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.160]  priced and fully legal.
[06:49.160 --> 06:57.240]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[06:57.240 --> 07:01.520]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[07:01.520 --> 07:06.440]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[07:06.440 --> 07:11.120]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[07:11.120 --> 07:15.920]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through
[07:15.920 --> 07:21.080]  infowarslife, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[07:21.080 --> 07:26.320]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[07:26.320 --> 07:31.320]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[07:31.320 --> 07:36.040]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[07:36.040 --> 07:40.920]  Oxy powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[07:40.920 --> 07:47.280]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[07:47.280 --> 07:52.000]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology.
[07:52.000 --> 08:21.840]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[08:22.000 --> 08:33.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:33.200 --> 08:43.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:43.200 --> 08:45.720]  I'm honored to be your host here today.
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.120]  Here on the Alex Jones show, we call Infowars Live, the live, Monday through Friday, 11AM-2PM,
[08:52.120 --> 08:59.200]  Central Standard Time, Worldwide, Original, Teleprompter Free, Radio, Slash, News, Television,
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.200]  Transmission.
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.840]  And then, of course, we come back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, Infowars Nightly News.
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.640]  Find details at infowars.com.
[09:10.640 --> 09:11.640]  Everything is intensifying.
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.600]  It seems like every time I start the broadcast, that's what I open it with because it's true.
[09:16.600 --> 09:25.160]  We're going into a time of amazing, unprecedented change on a planetary scale.
[09:25.160 --> 09:30.400]  And the social engineers who are extremely anti-human and who have decided to try to
[09:30.400 --> 09:36.000]  keep humanity in the dark so they can seize total hegemonic power over the future direction
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.200]  of this species, those enemies are in overdrive attempting to suppress humanity and they are
[09:42.200 --> 09:44.320]  failing on many fronts.
[09:44.320 --> 09:55.200]  That, my friends, is the good news that I can unequivocally bring you here today.
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.400]  Where to start?
[09:56.400 --> 09:59.040]  Because there is a lot to cover, obviously.
[09:59.040 --> 10:00.560]  There's very good news.
[10:00.560 --> 10:06.560]  We need to up the rhetoric in the face of the solitarians if we have any hope of stopping
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.280]  them because when you're overwhelmed with giant tyrannical power grabs, like we're
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.960]  seeing happen through the IMF, the World Bank, the EU, and the so-called US government itself
[10:17.960 --> 10:23.640]  completely occupied by the globalist, when you see things of this magnitude, you tend
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.960]  to respond to them, I tend to respond to them, and the mainstream media has trained us to
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.920]  do this from birth with just kind of whitewashed headlines that make it seem like it's no big
[10:34.920 --> 10:36.400]  deal.
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.280]  When Obama is saying our military is under NATO UN control and his authority is the UN,
[10:42.280 --> 10:49.800]  that is total impeachment, arrestable offense, high treason, off the charts, clear cut.
[10:49.800 --> 10:55.920]  When he selectively shuts down hundreds of US power plants while engaging in federal
[10:55.920 --> 11:02.880]  incentives to move factories overseas, it's economic espionage and it's high treason.
[11:02.880 --> 11:10.600]  When he says he's going to ban bullets outside of law, extra judicially, extra legislatively,
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.640]  when he has no power to do so, it is dictatorship.
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.520]  When he selectively hands out waivers to his friends on the power plants, or on Obamacare,
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.360]  or on wetlands, and 100 plus other issues, it is the essence of oppression and a class
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.800]  system that is directed by crony capitalist and anti-free market and total discrimination
[11:31.800 --> 11:34.920]  against the general public, regardless of race, color, and creed.
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.000]  That's why they want us fighting over race, color, and creed all day, because that's
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.120]  a distractionary issue to the main discrimination of the private central banks globally, owned
[11:44.120 --> 11:49.640]  by a handful of families that issue currency and credit on a planetary scale and just so
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.840]  happen to be transhumanist exterminist.
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.760]  People running the planet or dominating the planet, they almost run it, and if they really
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.640]  get full control, which they're getting close to, Katie bar the door.
[12:05.640 --> 12:07.840]  And I say this all the time because it's true.
[12:07.840 --> 12:12.080]  It pretty much only happens when I'm on air, and I think about something, I come in here
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.200]  and I focus on all this, and I get a chill up my spine and get goosebumps.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.880]  I have goosebumps right now.
[12:18.880 --> 12:27.000]  I just got goosebumps, because when I, when my central nervous system comes face to face
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.320]  with the fact that this is real, just happened again, and how epic it is that murdering control
[12:34.320 --> 12:40.960]  freaks, sworn into humanity as we know it, to annihilate the family, their whole vicious,
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.560]  wicked worldview is one of dehumanization and pain and suffering and humiliation and
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.880]  starvation and failure.
[12:48.880 --> 12:56.320]  They are literally out of the night circle of Dante's Inferno.
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.320]  You have to address pure evil as pure evil.
[13:00.320 --> 13:03.880]  You have to address an enemy as an enemy.
[13:03.880 --> 13:07.720]  You have to address usurpers as usurpers.
[13:07.720 --> 13:12.840]  These globalists are not conquerors that come to conquer and give us aqueducts and written
[13:12.840 --> 13:13.840]  language.
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.320]  You could argue that the Romans, though they oppressed and enslaved many areas, ended up
[13:17.320 --> 13:24.560]  helping those areas in the long run with civilization, with longer life, with science, and the Romans
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.560]  were brutal oppressors in the general sense.
[13:28.560 --> 13:34.600]  The Romans were angels compared to the elite we have.
[13:34.600 --> 13:39.520]  The Romans wanted power and prosperity for their families and their family lines, and
[13:39.520 --> 13:48.240]  they wanted wealth for even their general conscripts and for even their slaves.
[13:48.240 --> 13:56.880]  They were fans of humanity and fans of strength and fans of honor before they declined.
[13:56.880 --> 14:03.160]  But even in their decline, that most evil of empires were told by many historians was
[14:03.160 --> 14:11.440]  angelic in comparison to what we see at the helm of the planet's directorate.
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.600]  Now that six, seven minute buildup there brings us to this good news.
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.880]  In our head, we have the clip, we're going to play it, Obama hates the Second Amendment
[14:19.880 --> 14:22.560]  acting like a dictator.
[14:22.560 --> 14:25.880]  He's quote grasping at straws.
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.880]  This is all I ever asked out of the UNRA and why we quite frankly didn't bully them but
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.000]  assailed them with gun owners of America and other groups and Ted Nugent's been on the
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.720]  show and said himself we need to get the UNRA in line because they're the only mega large
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.160]  lobby that isn't controlled by the globalists completely that could really represent the
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.760]  people and if you turn back the tide on the attack on self defense, you turn back the
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.640]  tide on the attack on sovereignty, the family, the right of free speech, property, everything
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.440]  else.
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.000]  Slaves are disarmed.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  It's that simple.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.480]  The UNRA was founded to train Northerners how to shoot better because they were so freaked
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.120]  out that two or three Southerners could kill 20 Northerners because they were just such
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.920]  good shots growing up with firearms and a secondary to armed blacks in the south with
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.120]  abolitionist funding.
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.840]  That's why the Democrats say it is a Ku Klux Klan organization on MSNBC, Fox Sports, everywhere
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.200]  else because they know the public dumbed down and mindless and now believe that the UNRA
[15:24.200 --> 15:26.600]  is the Klan.
[15:26.600 --> 15:33.800]  But by the NRA coming out and actually saying it like it is, they'll get more support.
[15:33.800 --> 15:37.240]  It'll raise the rhetoric to the level of reality.
[15:37.240 --> 15:39.720]  In fact, this isn't enough, but it's a step in the right direction.
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.720]  You got a whole bunch of different congressmen saying that Obama is acting like a dictator.
[15:44.720 --> 15:47.360]  Look, he isn't acting like a dictator.
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.440]  He is elected, but a lot of people get elected and then stay in.
[15:51.440 --> 15:54.360]  One of them's real famous, his name's Adolf Hitler.
[15:54.360 --> 15:57.640]  He was elected in 1933.
[15:57.640 --> 16:05.680]  Blew up their own capital to basically declare martial law, the Reichstag.
[16:05.680 --> 16:07.800]  Now we're looking at this.
[16:07.800 --> 16:08.800]  This is a big deal.
[16:08.800 --> 16:12.600]  I want to play this clip, the head of the National Renovation Association blasted President
[16:12.600 --> 16:17.680]  Obama last night in an appearance on Ludobs tonight calling him a dictator and declaring
[16:17.680 --> 16:22.520]  that the president hates the American people and hates the fact that they have a right
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.520]  to bear arms.
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.560]  Wayne LaPierre was responding to Obama's executive actions to ban ammo for the air 15 rifle.
[16:28.560 --> 16:29.560]  They move.
[16:29.560 --> 16:34.200]  Many have declared to be a gun control via the back door.
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.600]  Many have declared.
[16:35.600 --> 16:36.840]  I mean, that's what it is.
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.040]  It's what Obama promised to do.
[16:40.040 --> 16:41.280]  Now remember Ludobs?
[16:41.280 --> 16:49.840]  Ludobs had four to five million viewers a night on CNN at his peak and then they moved
[16:49.840 --> 16:53.640]  his time slot to hurt him and he still had two and a half million viewers.
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.880]  They wanted to quietly get him out the door.
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.760]  CNN's biggest shows now have a half million viewers.
[17:00.760 --> 17:01.760]  They're collapsing.
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.280]  But see, they don't care.
[17:04.280 --> 17:11.720]  They got rid of who gave them ratings and who promoted Liberty, Ludobs.
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.600]  Another illustration of how it isn't just about getting ratings and being popular.
[17:15.600 --> 17:20.600]  The system does everything it can to shut down true independent voices.
[17:20.600 --> 17:25.600]  So now he's over on Fox Business with about a half million million viewers, still bigger
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.800]  than CNN, preaching to elderly conservatives, God bless them, who actually think the Republican
[17:32.800 --> 17:34.520]  Party is going to save them.
[17:34.520 --> 17:36.480]  So Ludobs is now a voice in the wilderness.
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.480]  We are not.
[17:37.480 --> 17:39.200]  We are reaching the mainstream.
[17:39.200 --> 17:40.480]  And that's what this is all about.
[17:40.480 --> 17:43.800]  Let's go to this clip of Wayne LaPierre telling it like it is.
[17:43.800 --> 17:45.840]  This is really good news.
[17:45.840 --> 17:46.880]  Thanks, Luke.
[17:46.880 --> 17:57.880]  This in prospect, the ATF ban on AR-15 ammunition, why are we not hearing more of an outcry about
[17:57.880 --> 17:58.880]  this?
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.920]  Well, probably because the media doesn't want the American public to know what this president
[18:03.920 --> 18:04.920]  is trying to oppose on.
[18:04.920 --> 18:05.920]  Exactly.
[18:05.920 --> 18:08.600]  This is the president that he's grasping for straws.
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.080]  He hates the Second Amendment.
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.080]  He hates the fact Americans have a constitutional right to own firearms.
[18:14.080 --> 18:15.640]  He can't win at the ballot box.
[18:15.640 --> 18:17.560]  He can't win in the Congress.
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.200]  And now he's trying to act like a dictator and planning on forcing this ban, ammo ban,
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.520]  on the American public by executive regulation.
[18:26.520 --> 18:27.520]  Explain something to me.
[18:27.520 --> 18:34.560]  Why is the sudden interest in the 5-5-6, so-called green tip ammunition that would effectively
[18:34.560 --> 18:35.560]  then?
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.960]  Because if they can ban the most popular ammo in the country, Ludo, they can ban everything.
[18:38.960 --> 18:40.240]  And I know Lou knows that.
[18:40.240 --> 18:41.240]  He's begging the question.
[18:41.240 --> 18:44.600]  Well, I have a guest on if you're going to answer all the questions.
[18:44.600 --> 18:49.360]  But that's what Lopier basically goes on to talk about.
[18:49.360 --> 18:52.680]  But then they defend the fact that, oh, well, law enforcement groups have said don't ban
[18:52.680 --> 18:53.680]  it.
[18:53.680 --> 18:54.760]  It doesn't kill a lot of cops.
[18:54.760 --> 18:58.920]  Look out with this argument that if bullets can kill cops, we're going to ban them.
[18:58.920 --> 19:04.600]  A car, a baseball bat, anything can kill a human, a cop, whatever.
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.000]  And whereas I don't want a civil war with the police, the Second Amendment is there
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.600]  to fight off a powerful central government that's been taken over, i.e. Washington.
[19:15.600 --> 19:18.640]  I mean, it's there not for duck hunting.
[19:18.640 --> 19:23.880]  But they've tried to set up any future violent revolution with the idea of seeing this being
[19:23.880 --> 19:27.200]  programmed to the media, programmed by the Democrats, that you go out and just find a
[19:27.200 --> 19:28.400]  random cop and shoot them.
[19:28.400 --> 19:29.760]  That's why I've been saying forever.
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.920]  If they start trying to round folks up, take people's guns, start assassinating folks like
[19:34.920 --> 19:41.600]  myself, and we have to go to a defensive, offensive operation, they're going to try
[19:41.600 --> 19:45.160]  to brand it in the media as kill cops.
[19:45.160 --> 19:47.200]  That's not the answer.
[19:47.200 --> 19:53.120]  We need to have smart discussions about what legitimate targets are in the perspective
[19:53.120 --> 19:55.200]  of a violent revolution.
[19:55.200 --> 19:57.440]  And I think everybody understands it's not the local government.
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.880]  I'll be right back, stay with us.
[20:01.880 --> 20:02.880]  It's happening again.
[20:02.880 --> 20:06.640]  The feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[20:06.640 --> 20:12.360]  In January, a newly introduced bill, HR 378, will take away your right to buy level three
[20:12.360 --> 20:14.320]  in a higher body armor.
[20:14.320 --> 20:19.920]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level three body armor packages on the market today.

[21:00.880 --> 21:07.040]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.040]  of silver.

[21:13.440 --> 21:17.600]  colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.200]  You don't have to be a doctor to know.
[21:19.200 --> 21:24.160]  The fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes
[21:24.160 --> 21:25.960]  to you and your family's health.
[21:25.960 --> 21:31.760]  InfoWarsLife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal

[21:58.840 --> 22:00.840]  Silver bullet.
[22:00.840 --> 22:04.560]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less
[22:04.560 --> 22:07.640]  you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[22:07.640 --> 22:12.000]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.640]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[22:15.640 --> 22:16.640]  Not fun.
[22:16.640 --> 22:20.780]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be
[22:20.780 --> 22:25.040]  able to gain back some strength, muscle and speed of recovery.
[22:25.040 --> 22:29.400]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer
[22:29.400 --> 22:30.400]  for you.
[22:30.400 --> 22:31.400]  My name is Errol.
[22:31.400 --> 22:32.880]  I'm 74 years old.
[22:32.880 --> 22:35.280]  You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing.
[22:35.280 --> 22:39.680]  I played pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have
[22:39.680 --> 22:43.160]  more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[22:43.160 --> 22:47.920]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results
[22:47.920 --> 23:00.560]  using One World Way.
[23:00.560 --> 23:05.760]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're
[23:05.760 --> 23:10.120]  all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[23:10.120 --> 23:11.760]  The answer is clear.
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.280]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[23:14.280 --> 23:17.720]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[23:17.720 --> 23:20.080]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[23:30.320 --> 23:35.600]  Are you willing to rely on the government and FEMA in the event of an emergency?
[23:35.600 --> 23:43.480]  Call 800-274-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[23:43.480 --> 23:47.840]  You won't be able to find this deal online and there is a strict limit of 4 per caller,

[23:52.880 --> 23:57.520]  That's 800-274-3070.
[23:57.520 --> 24:15.960]  Call right now.
[24:15.960 --> 24:20.640]  Everybody knows that I'm not a fan of Rudolph Giuliani, the neocon, rhino, anti-gun, open
[24:20.640 --> 24:28.560]  border-promoting, so-called Republican, but he's come out and said Obama hates America
[24:28.560 --> 24:34.000]  and wants to destroy the country and is a tyrant, so I started liking him a little bit
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.440]  from absolutely disdaining him to him moving up a point or two in my personal weighing of
[24:41.440 --> 24:42.440]  Rudolph Giuliani.
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.560]  But when you get a Wayne LaPierre coming out and saying Obama is acting like a dictator,
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.360]  you start to hear that out of Congress and then Obama's a liar and Obama doesn't want
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.640]  to have the second amendment that he hates it, what you're hearing is truth.
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.080]  And so if someone is running around burning down houses in the neighborhood, they're not
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.040]  providing a neighborhood with central heating, they're trying to burn down houses and kill
[25:07.040 --> 25:16.640]  people and if you catch them trying to burn down a house, you need to shoot them or hold
[25:16.640 --> 25:22.240]  them till the police get there, whatever choice you make.
[25:22.240 --> 25:27.480]  And that's what this comes down to is that the globalist want to force a confrontation
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.240]  with Russia, they want to force one in the Middle East, they want to force one with the
[25:31.240 --> 25:35.880]  American people, they want to start a civil war and we've done everything we can to stop
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.920]  that and to make it an info war and to vote with our dollars and to vote with our decisions
[25:40.920 --> 25:47.000]  and we're winning the info war, every metric shows it libertarian paleo conservatism is
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.400]  beginning to take over.
[25:49.400 --> 25:53.280]  They're not going to be able to use fake Republican leadership to shut it down.
[25:53.280 --> 25:56.840]  The John Banners and others of this world are on their way out, might not be this year
[25:56.840 --> 25:58.200]  but it'll be next year.
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.080]  No amount of false flags are going to put this back together again.
[26:02.080 --> 26:07.760]  But still they might try it and we're coming to that point that when they stage terror
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.760]  attacks and blame it on us, if everybody cowers in fear and goes along with the official narrative
[26:12.760 --> 26:18.520]  and apologizes for the new Tim McVeigh type being a Republican and buys into the official
[26:18.520 --> 26:25.080]  narrative that we're guilty like Sandy Hook, we're sorry as gun owners that we caused the
[26:25.080 --> 26:26.680]  children to die.
[26:26.680 --> 26:27.680]  That was the narrative.
[26:27.680 --> 26:32.880]  How dare you gun owners cause more kids to die, not one more child, how many more kids
[26:32.880 --> 26:33.960]  have to die?
[26:33.960 --> 26:41.200]  I don't know, it's like 66 kids a year get killed in mass shootings and a tiny fraction
[26:41.200 --> 26:47.000]  I think it was like 11 of them end up getting killed by semi-autos and thousands die in
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  car wrecks and thousands drowned and thousands get electrocuted and thousands get beat to
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.800]  death by neighbors or their dad or their mom, thousands get tasered and killed by cops for
[26:58.800 --> 26:59.800]  whatever reason.
[26:59.800 --> 27:07.200]  Are we going to blame all the cops and ban cops, are we going to ban old swimming holes?
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.240]  Some camps in the US I saw last year are ending swimming in the lakes.
[27:12.240 --> 27:13.240]  Some are camps.
[27:13.240 --> 27:14.240]  You go swimming in the lake.
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.920]  Oh, kids sometimes drowned, where's this camps no longer going to have swimming?
[27:18.920 --> 27:23.480]  Next, no more rock climbing cause somebody got hurt in another state or kids got their
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.720]  feelings hurt cause they were playing dodge ball and they got hit with a dodge ball and
[27:27.720 --> 27:30.760]  another kid laughed, get used to it, it's part of life.
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.480]  You create basket case mental patients who are traumatized by everything not learning
[27:35.480 --> 27:42.120]  how to deal with a problem, but I digress further afield into psychology.
[27:42.120 --> 27:51.400]  What I'm getting at here is that we have to raise the rhetoric to the point of what we're
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.520]  actually facing.
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.880]  If you're facing an arsonist, call it an arsonist.
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.000]  If you're facing a rapist, call it a racist or a rapist.
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.560]  If you're facing a tyrannical scientific psych warfare takeover, address it as such.
[28:06.560 --> 28:10.820]  Washington has been compromised and taken over by foreign special interest.
[28:10.820 --> 28:15.800]  It wishes to secure its criminal takeover by having a destabilization program, a civil
[28:15.800 --> 28:21.440]  war with terror attacks to be blamed on domestic enemies that are actually patriots that want
[28:21.440 --> 28:22.800]  to save the country.
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.800]  We have to recognize that paradigm when the enemy makes the next move.
[28:28.800 --> 28:29.920]  It's like chess.
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.040]  You're a good chess player, you're in a particular area, the pieces are in a particular setting.
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.520]  You know as a good chess player the one or two moves they'll probably make and you're
[28:40.520 --> 28:42.120]  anticipating those.
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.320]  Well there are a couple moves we expect the enemy to make.
[28:46.320 --> 28:52.200]  Start wars, trigger economic crises to take over and stage domestic terror attacks to
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.000]  be blamed on domestic enemy grips.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.640]  And we told you this before, you could see all the public scripting.
[28:57.640 --> 29:04.440]  Now it's reached a crescendo, a cacophony of chirping and bleeding and squawking by
[29:04.440 --> 29:10.240]  the enemy press who knows they're losing legitimacy, who knows that their time has come, who know
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.360]  that they've been discredited, whose ratings are collapsing, who are going under and as
[29:14.360 --> 29:19.360]  the mainstream media begins its death rattle.
[29:19.360 --> 29:24.160]  You notice they're coming out with internet censorship and FCC power grabs and all the
[29:24.160 --> 29:32.000]  rest of it because the system knows they've got to move or we're going in to check.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.880]  Our next move will have them in check.
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.680]  We're moving in to check right now.
[29:36.680 --> 29:40.120]  If they don't do something quick we're going to have them in checkmate.
[29:40.120 --> 29:44.840]  We've basically got our gun pod heads up displayed directly on the enemy, we're ready to pull
[29:44.840 --> 29:46.320]  the trigger in the info war.
[29:46.320 --> 29:50.640]  So fire it will, they'll be back, stay with us.
[29:50.640 --> 29:54.400]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.

[33:54.680 --> 33:56.080]  inside the new world order.
[33:56.080 --> 33:58.080]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[33:58.080 --> 34:02.680]  I've been spending much of the last 30 minutes on the NRA head.
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.160]  Obama hates the Second Amendment acting like a dictator.
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.120]  They need to put out alerts to their four or five million members.
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.480]  They need to do fundraisers on this issue and they need to call for repeal of all the
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.520]  major gun laws that have only increased crime since their institution and we've got all
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.240]  the statistics to show that it's been concealed carry has driven down crime the last 25 years
[34:30.240 --> 34:31.240]  all over the United States.
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.160]  What you see in the 60s with the gun control act and other legislation brought in that
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.240]  it's only used and selectively enforced on law abiding citizens.
[34:41.240 --> 34:44.720]  I want to finish up with this clip then I'm going to get into China has announced plans
[34:44.720 --> 34:53.120]  for a world currency while Obama guts the U.S. military Russia prepares for war boots
[34:53.120 --> 34:59.720]  on the ground U.S. military instructors arrive in Ukraine Obama we now have video of it calls
[34:59.720 --> 35:10.560]  he legals Americans and waiting while threatening ice agents became troubled by Iranian help
[35:10.560 --> 35:21.240]  battling ISIS and that ties into this very important article that's up on info wars.com
[35:21.240 --> 35:27.680]  you guys print me a copy of it I had it but I just can't find it thank you Iraqis have
[35:27.680 --> 35:35.720]  evidence U.S. arms Islamic State terrorist now the Iraqi prime minister came out a month
[35:35.720 --> 35:39.000]  ago and said this will now his top generals have come out they're going to release the
[35:39.000 --> 35:48.880]  proof next week that they're doing air drops of artillery M16 weapons you name it using
[35:48.880 --> 35:55.160]  third party groups directly to ISIS yeah they just like our government funded the Iran Iraq
[35:55.160 --> 36:03.480]  war between the two different sides from 19 was it 81 to 87 and over a million people
[36:03.480 --> 36:11.200]  died on the Iranian side 304,000 the Iraqi side it was meant to debilitate both sides
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.000]  of the conflict even though Saddam was our big ally he was being set up and maneuvered
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.800]  for destruction because he was a secular leader and let women go to college and had rock and
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.240]  roll music on the radio and playboy was sold in stores and I'm not saying that that's the
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.200]  mark of a great free country I'm just saying he was the opposite of ISIS the opposite of
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.160]  Al Qaeda and that's why they were all the made for TV movies and shows demonizing the
[36:36.160 --> 36:48.160]  poor CIA officer who was trained at age 20 in 1949 through 1952 as a top assassin commando
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.280]  in Egypt and also he traveled to the United States you can look all this up it's mainstream
[36:53.280 --> 36:59.480]  historical news but back of the paper stuff and we sent to the United States and trained
[36:59.480 --> 37:07.200]  it Lain Lee was sent in to try to kick the communist out after that there in Iraq for
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.000]  about a decade as a covert operative he shot up the president's vehicle himself got wounded
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.640]  got taken back out of the country they then told the bathists let him be the head of
[37:16.640 --> 37:25.640]  your security force make a deal with the CIA this was in the early 60s late 60s by then
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.000]  and we won't we won't kill you or destabilize you so the bathists then stopped getting
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.840]  their support from Russia flip sides to the United States and then in 1979 the CIA with
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.040]  Saddam Hussein staged a coup put him into power he then followed orders and launched
[37:42.040 --> 37:48.520]  a war against Iran two years later and you see what it got Saddam Hussein blamed for
[37:48.520 --> 37:55.520]  9 11 which he had nothing to do with what you say and I'm not lionizing him the point
[37:55.520 --> 38:06.160]  is he was a absolute made in USA creation who followed orders and who quite frankly under
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.160]  an Eisenhower type system you know Eisenhower was out of power by the time Saddam got into
[38:12.160 --> 38:23.160]  power Saddam Hussein was an older program of stabilization by the 70s they wanted destabilization
[38:23.160 --> 38:31.120]  and so people like Saddam Hussein were put into start wars with Iran and I'm digressing
[38:31.120 --> 38:36.920]  into a basic gestalt history lesson you know look it up for yourself it's just very frustrating
[38:36.920 --> 38:40.280]  with Donald Rumsfeld but he was Secretary of Defense the first time went and met with
[38:40.280 --> 38:47.200]  Saddam many times there's video of it gave him the weapons the CIA directed with satellites
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.920]  and with the derogables tethered balloons with the radar guided cameras how to direct
[38:53.920 --> 39:01.160]  his artillery how to direct his helicopters the wind patterns of wind to spray nerve gas
[39:01.160 --> 39:07.120]  on the Kurds so it wouldn't blow back on his trips i.e. World War one mistakes and then
[39:07.120 --> 39:12.960]  they had the nerve to then say he gassed his own people I mean it's all these sick games
[39:12.960 --> 39:19.440]  that they play with us let me finish up with this NRA clip where they get into the bullets
[39:19.440 --> 39:26.080]  themselves and then I'll get into Iraqis have evidence U.S. arms Islamic State me a video
[39:26.080 --> 39:32.880]  of that as well let's go ahead and go to this clip and the sudden interest in the 556 so-called
[39:32.880 --> 39:39.420]  green tip ammunition that would effectively then you know wouldn't be available to gun
[39:39.420 --> 39:46.080]  owners rendering the gun not much use well he tried to ban ARs he couldn't ban ARs from
[39:46.080 --> 39:51.040]  the American public a popular sporting rifle so now he's trying to ban AR ammunition I
[39:51.040 --> 39:58.360]  mean I actually brought a graphic that kind of explains this where the one he's trying
[39:58.360 --> 40:07.000]  to ban is the 556 it's a small rifle cartridge the thing is if he can ban that because it
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.040]  pierces soft body armor he can also ban the 30 out six which is next to it a really popular
[40:14.040 --> 40:21.280]  hunting cartridge he can ban the other two hunting cartridge or the 300 win mag the 375
[40:21.280 --> 40:27.600]  he can ban every cartridge in between that in fact under this standard he can ban all
[40:27.600 --> 40:34.480]  rifle cartridges because all of them pierce soft body armor that's right I mean I earlier
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.920]  said that LaPierre basically agree with my statement so why not just actually play him
[40:37.920 --> 40:43.240]  saying it instead of just saying he said it there you go and you just see the NRA actually
[40:43.240 --> 40:49.760]  talking the talk and walking the walk and actually admitting reality just reality if
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.960]  we state the reality of what's going on if we state the reality of how serious this is
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.160]  the globalist will not be able to get away with it but if the reality of the dictatorial
[41:00.160 --> 41:05.080]  takeover is something that we're not willing to talk about because it sounds scary or sounds
[41:05.080 --> 41:11.040]  kooky we'll lose everything the truth is most countries in the world are run by kleptocrats
[41:11.040 --> 41:17.240]  plutocrats corrupt groups that never leave power the few countries that have some private
[41:17.240 --> 41:23.360]  property rights some do process like the U.S. Switzerland countries like that historically
[41:23.360 --> 41:31.000]  the Dutch in the Netherlands are swimming in money swimming in prowess swimming in prosperity
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.120]  swimming in security swimming in power swimming in innovation swimming in freedom it goes
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.680]  full circle you got freedom you got everything else including freedom because prosperity
[41:42.680 --> 41:48.440]  breeds freedom for a while if you're an upright culture if you're not and if you don't value
[41:48.440 --> 41:52.440]  freedom and if you're not territorial and if you don't stand up for freedom you will
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.920]  lose it and into that vacuum will come the nastiest crooks scumbags and criminal control
[41:57.920 --> 42:03.320]  freak kleptocrats that you could ever imagine and that's now what is being visited upon
[42:03.320 --> 42:14.040]  us hordes of locus like criminals using legislative government to create law to create monopoly
[42:14.040 --> 42:21.160]  and shut down their competition and imprison and bankrupt the general public so there you
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.040]  are you look all over the Middle East all over Latin America all over Asia all over
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.720]  Eastern Europe all over the world nine times out of ten or more a country is a tyranny
[42:31.720 --> 42:41.520]  and with it is stagnation and creepiness you go to a third world creepy country most of
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.760]  them are like that even if it's beautiful even if they have resources there's a creepiness
[42:45.760 --> 42:53.600]  to it and there's poverty and there's sewage running down the middle of the road and people
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.360]  have evil looks in their eyes and and and all the statistics show that and that's where
[42:58.360 --> 43:06.240]  we're going and I don't like it but the control freaks want full power and if that means they've
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.840]  got to take control shut off the engines of prosperity to make you more manageable they'll
[43:10.840 --> 43:21.520]  do it now let's get into this report Iraqis have evidence u.s. arms islamic state terrorist
[43:21.520 --> 43:32.880]  do we have that clip ready iraqi prime minister says he will release documents soon the head
[43:32.880 --> 43:38.760]  of the border organization iraq told parliament on thursday he was has evidence the u.s. is
[43:38.760 --> 43:46.960]  arming the islamic army according to a report carried by the arabic language newspaper and
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.960]  it goes on from there the organization was previously known as the batter brigades the
[43:51.960 --> 43:57.640]  military wing of the iran-based shia islamic party supreme council for islamic revolution
[43:57.640 --> 44:02.880]  in iraq and those are the folks in there now with their artillery defeating isis iranian
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.680]  media and other sources have claimed on at least two occasions u.s. military aircraft
[44:07.680 --> 44:13.040]  dropped weapons in areas held by islamic state the iraqi intelligence sources reiterated
[44:13.040 --> 44:19.480]  the u.s. military planes have airdropped several aid cargos for isle terrorists to help them
[44:19.480 --> 44:25.360]  resist the siege laid by the iraqi army security and popular forces iraqi intelligence claimed
[44:25.360 --> 44:31.400]  in december and then it goes into now the london-based organization conflict arrangement
[44:31.400 --> 44:35.760]  research previously reported that isis fighters are using significant quantities of arms
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.960]  including m16 rifles mark property of u.s. government in june erin kline writing for
[44:40.960 --> 44:47.280]  world that daily reported that members of isis were trained in 2012 by u.s. instructors
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.560]  working at a secret base in jordan according to information from jordanian officials kentucky
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.080]  senator ran paul said last year isis was able to capture large areas of iraq due to
[44:57.080 --> 45:03.440]  arms transfers from moderates so-called in syria fighting a proxy war against the government
[45:03.440 --> 45:10.600]  of basher al-asad now let's just remember here and again we have the clip of one info
[45:10.600 --> 45:15.120]  wars dot com with the president but it's in of iraq but it's in arabic so you can go watch
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.520]  it if you want to see that iraqi news report the point here is we know this is what's going
[45:21.520 --> 45:26.840]  on and the question is is the west creating a proxy war so shiites and sunnis kill each
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.520]  other and they're going to break iraq up in pieces well we know that's part of the plan
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.960]  is it a real war where they might push one group of the other out is saudi arabia at
[45:36.960 --> 45:40.320]  war with iran right now we know they said they want to join israel and a joint strike
[45:40.320 --> 45:48.440]  on iran is there really a split between obama and netanyahu overall this because we know
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.680]  obama and netanyahu and other western leaders are all in there aiding the al qaeda and wahhabi
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.560]  is forces the isis forces in the last four years to go into syria now have they really
[45:58.560 --> 46:02.440]  stopped working with them now and are they doubling back to try to defeat them because
[46:02.440 --> 46:10.560]  they're not following orders or is israel now backing isis isle isis and its islamic state
[46:10.560 --> 46:23.800]  or is israel now not backing either side this is the reality of what's going on is this
[46:23.800 --> 46:31.640]  a real power split all i know is this i don't like working with quote the iranians you know
[46:31.640 --> 46:41.240]  proxy war inside iraq but at the same time the iranians did not launch any of these attacks
[46:41.240 --> 46:45.600]  the iranians are not the ones that went into syria and started all this the iranians aren't
[46:45.600 --> 46:53.120]  the ones involved it was the saudi arabians and al qaeda and the west had been gauzy so
[46:53.120 --> 46:58.320]  you look at all these pieces it goes from bad to worse what do you think's really going
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.360]  on i'll ask our guest for the next hour we'll open the phones up on that subject to get your
[47:02.360 --> 47:09.280]  take on it but the good news is even though it's over the top wild sounding that our government
[47:09.280 --> 47:14.760]  other governments are funding both the iranians and al qaeda under the name isis and isle but
[47:14.760 --> 47:19.080]  people accept that now and know it's true it sounds wild to say the federal reserve
[47:19.080 --> 47:23.560]  really privately owned and has hijacked the country since 1913 now most americans and
[47:23.560 --> 47:29.960]  poles want audited abolished and know that it is a predatory group most gun owners now
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.880]  say obama is becoming a dictator and a criminal and is illegitimate and they won't turn in
[47:33.880 --> 47:40.040]  their guns if he tries outright gun bans this latest airmo band is a test that's good that

[55:09.880 --> 55:19.480]  right now by our governments is bone chilling and I just got chills again I'm so freaked
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.280]  out at this point I can barely do this radio show because just getting up here and having
[55:23.280 --> 55:31.160]  ads and talking and having guests on at a certain point it's almost like we're in the
[55:31.160 --> 55:36.560]  matrix just going along with it too my response isn't hardcore enough to this we've just been
[55:36.560 --> 55:44.080]  eased into this incrementally but now it's gotten so bad something's got to give I mean
[55:44.080 --> 55:49.920]  what is wrong with the people running things why would you fund al-qaeda to go kill every
[55:49.920 --> 55:58.280]  christian you find why would our government do that why would our government try to overthrow
[55:58.280 --> 56:10.240]  Egypt and try to overthrow Syria and overthrow Libya why is our government given billions
[56:10.240 --> 56:18.720]  of dollars to Hamas that's on record billions to Hamas that shoots rockets and suicide bombs
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.880]  Israel you're like oh whatever Israel hate Israel there you are loving Israel Jones hey
[56:22.880 --> 56:29.320]  listen to the question our government funds both sides to kill each other why I mean do
[56:29.320 --> 56:35.720]  you feel safe having people run our government that do stuff like that I feel guilty if I'm
[56:35.720 --> 56:43.200]  rude to a waiter these people love destabilization and evil we'll start the next hour and go
[56:43.200 --> 56:49.120]  to all these White House press briefing clips from yesterday where it is really come folks
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.560]  this Hillary thing it violates the open records act it's a felony they have the national security
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.480]  act of 47 and they passed a law saying if the CIA is going to be secret or other agencies
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.560]  are they've got to say why they are it's got to be approved by Congress everything else
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.200]  has to be have record caps including the CIA and it can be held back for 20 years but any
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.720]  other records have to be an official government records and it's a felony to have separate
[57:10.720 --> 57:17.400]  set of books it's just like having fake books for the IRS or for your boss it's like running
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.120]  the clock if you work for somebody it's like putting in fake you know time stamps or having
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.680]  your buddy punch you out when you left at noon and punch you out at 5 p.m. it's illegal
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.400]  Petraeus is might even go to jail for it he's facing you know a plea bargain and what he
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.480]  did was have stuff in a desk drawer which for a general quite frankly I don't think it was
[57:39.480 --> 57:43.880]  illegal I'm not even defending Petraeus I've studied the law Hillary was doing all this
[57:43.880 --> 57:48.280]  secret state department stuff she had she had it up the most important cabinet position
[57:48.280 --> 57:56.480]  and there's 50 plus thousand emails with aliases to other secret people I mean it's clear espionage
[57:56.480 --> 58:01.360]  with corporate and globalist interest you can bet money David Rockefeller is in there

[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.640]  article that's on info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson Lord Rothschild warns investors of
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:16.080]  the most dangerous geopolitical situation since world war two head of the 2.3 billion
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.000]  trust folks that's one tiny part of the Rothschild wealth that the Rothschilds admit their main
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.240]  mission is to hide their wealth at a lawsuit a few years ago in fact I was printing the
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:33.080]  article about Rothschild's loose suit on being puppetmaskers they sued newspapers in the
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.760]  UK for saying they were secret puppetmaskers with all these billionaires as their front
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:42.200]  people and then the judge said basically you sued them for libel which is pretty easy to
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.200]  prove in the UK and this case proves that it's true and you've been incredibly deceptive
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.440]  so we'll talk Rothschilds coming up we'll talk the pedophile scandal in the UK and

[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.080]  he's actually telling the truth right there and it's not just because of war economic
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:41.840]  problems but tyranny with headlines like this coming out every hour quibbeck resident charged

[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.360]  get the milk toast nr a and the republicans talking reality we can then have people wake
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.680]  up to the real problems we face but if the evil takeover is so brazen and so bad people
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.960]  go well it's a little extreme to say that's a dictatorship forming well if it is that
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:30.040]  it is that a duck is a duck arose as arose arose as arose by the other name a child molesters
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.680]  come back like jeffrey dommer is a child molesters come back by any other name a dictatorship
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.520]  a power grab we see go on historically for thousands of years and in every other country
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.000]  is happening here so you go to the doctor and they go you got lung cancer you know that
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.720]  just can't be possible most people are in denial for a couple days the doctor goes okay
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.160]  well we can remove that long or you get a second opinion or you got about three months
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:02.320]  to live and most of the time they're right but then it settles in and you get your life
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:08.800]  in order get ready to you know go get put in the box but see people can die we regenerate
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.680]  ourselves we're a renewable resource from a globalist perspective but we are we we are
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.240]  self renewing you kill a country you kill a society you kill ideas you kill freedoms
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.880]  you kill more than people and that's what they're doing is killing any form of independence
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:33.600]  any form of pro human prowess power strength macho machismo whatever word you want to
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.800]  use for it a zest for being manly a zest for being womanly a zest for being successful
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:47.400]  a zest for having fun a zest for being honorable a zest for being aggressive there is a systematic
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.000]  war against being real because they want a world of little cowards to be assimilated
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.800]  and taken over well I'm not going along with it also dovetail with what Lord Rothschild
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.040]  saying we're going to cover this with our guest China has announced plans for a new
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.000]  world currency we'll give you the tales and the latest on Russia it's huge as us forces
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.320]  build up in the region to fight toe to toe against the Russians and that ties in to our
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:19.800]  own government funding al-Qaeda McCain is upset that Iran is now working to try to defeat
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.640]  ISIS in Iraq and this is a dangerous situation because they won't want to leave now they've
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:31.400]  always wanted to take control of Iraq but if you expand on that it's ISIS that started
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.840]  the whole thing with our government's funding and John McCain in photos with basically jihad
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:45.120]  John and all the rest of them and now Noam Chomsky has come out and said that these were
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:50.440]  oppressed people echoing one of the White House officials that just couldn't get jobs
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.840]  that's why they go and rape and kill women and cut Catholic priest heads off that's right
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.800]  because when you lose your job that's what you're supposed to do right no that's not
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.360]  what you're supposed to do so that's just some of the news that we're going to be covering
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.040]  up on info wars.com we've moved to the top of the page Lord Rothschild warns investors
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.720]  the most dangerous geopolitical situation since World War two NBA launches feminist
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.120]  campaign to lecture men not doing enough housework get better women fighting with each other
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.880]  the NFL is doing the same thing with most of its ads and promos I mean this is just
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.080]  to get this all fighting with each other women need to be taught that the way they dominate
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.480]  the world is not being a good mother a good business person or a poet or a nurse or whatever
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.920]  or doctor but in pecking your man being being upset with them I mean the globalists are
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.720]  there stirring up fights at every turn while they screw the country over cops bust in the
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:56.840]  house shoot unarmed man in the face looking for marijuana and decriminalize now disband

[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.440]  for having me on the program and you're an absolute inspiration my friend and to hear
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  you talking about some of the issues there and putting facts on those stories and meet
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.600]  on the bones of those stories you are an absolute humiliation to the mainstream media I mean
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.840]  you really are you're talking about so I mean you are and you don't need to be I know you're
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.440]  a modest guy about me watching and listening to your broadcast for many many years I go
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.680]  back to watching you when you I suppose at the famous time when you you showed us what
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.920]  was going on at Bohemia Grove in California and you're to be absolutely congratulated
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.080]  for that and I think I said to you well brother you're to be correct you're you're to be congratulated
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.800]  launching your own cable station reaching millions on mainline cable and syndicated radio
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.440]  and you know succeeding failing succeeding I mean it's amazing so you're my hero that's
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.240]  why I don't want you saying I'm a hero because all of us who are fighting against tyranny
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.320]  are just trying to survive and build a better world so so so collectively those of us that
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:55.600]  love life and humanity and fair play and have good will we are basically God's sunshine
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.760]  in the world so I'm just one more little ray of light with you my brother well thanks very
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.320]  much Alex I mean we can start anywhere I love listen to your monologue there let's talk
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.400]  for a minute I suppose about the pedophile the historic pedophile sex abuse scandal
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.560]  historic sex abuse allegations that you and David and others exposed a long time ago and
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:20.240]  is now by the numbers what David said the exact people he claimed are being caught with
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.600]  the torture dungeons the dead little kids the the royal family I mean this is over the
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.000]  top let's and while he's talking let's show some of those headlines go ahead it's terrible
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.960]  Alex you're absolutely right David wrote a book in 1998 called the biggest secret again
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.360]  you were to be commended because you know back in the early days you had him on so many
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:44.520]  times talking about this David Cameron of course is not talking about VIP pedophiles
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:51.080]  and members of Parliament pedophiles and Ellen guest house and Dolphin Square he's not talking
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.360]  about that he's talking about Rochdale and Muslim pedophile rings and saying it's a
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:01.960]  national scandal and it's a national security it's a dangerous national security problem
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.840]  but of course what he's not talking about are the allegations that are with the police
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.720]  with Scotland Yard in London with police forces all over England the Dixon revelations the
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.760]  Dixon dossier which you've spoken about so many times on your program which you know dozens
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.320]  and dozens of former MPs even prime ministers Alex ministers have been named have been names
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.720]  have been given to police forces around this country for those who don't know I mean we're
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.280]  putting articles on screen everything you're saying has come out in major papers that they're
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.360]  saying upwards of a third of Parliament it looks like is involved I mean this is a cult
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.520]  is suspected Alex it's incredible and one of the most staggering revelations that's
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.520]  come out of course in the last few months is that about the young boy Vishal Marotra
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.720]  I'm just looking to the left of my notes I've not got anything written down just a couple
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.840]  of bullet points there so I don't want to get this wrong but Vishal's father was a magistrate
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.240]  so he was a judge and he alleged that his son by the way Alex he was eight years old
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.920]  and he disappeared on the day the Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer that's when the
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.000]  boy disappeared he was eight years old the father had a long and successful career as
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.320]  a magistrate now you know all this but maybe some of your listeners don't some of your
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.840]  viewers don't his father basically contends that his son was murdered quite possibly
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:22.200]  at Elm guest house which is the guest house in London which is frequented by VIPs members
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.600]  of Parliament again ministers were talking about the upper echelons of society for years
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.040]  and years and years that's a staggering thing and in the telegraph newspaper in the last
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.280]  couple of days you mentioned the telegraph earlier on they published another interview
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.880]  with the Vishamra yes Vishamra is a man's is the boy's father the eight year old boy
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.560]  and it's absolutely staggering Alex and as you've reported on to your credit the British
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.360]  Home Secretary Theresa May is absolutely complicit in the cover-up of all of this because she's
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:19:00.800]  put two chairs of this inquiry in what were the names again the two chairs and many but
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.960]  of course the first one put in there with ties to these people you know with ties to
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.920]  the people who might very well be investigated might very well be named in these documents
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.120]  and of course recently they've announced a woman from New Zealand a judge called Lowell
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:22.880]  Goddard all sorts of things coming out about her and her I suppose lack of credibility
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.440]  in taking on this this inquiry she's gone on the record to say it might take five years
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.040]  Alex how convenient that is that it might take five years before we get to the bottom
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.760]  of all of this well that's right and then we've also seen speaking of Australia but
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:43.080]  also in the UK and the US and Canada we've seen now liberal judges close quote saying
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:51.400]  hey pedophilia is just a choice and children can love to classic Nambla statements now
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:56.000]  trying to legitimize sex with children I mean they're actually starting to come out of their
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.680]  pedophile closet it's unbelievable Alex when you hear stuff like that I mean you know from
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.320]  talking to me over the years there's no hiding it I'm an Irishman I grew up with this in
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.520]  the Waterford City in the Republic of Ireland I grew up with it and a great friend of mine
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:15.560]  who won't mind being named Derek power Derek was destroyed as a young boy by a bishop in
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.360]  County Waterford a bishop by a guy called Smith who ended up dying in prison we know
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:25.960]  in Ireland Alex that the then Cardinal Ratzinger who went on to become Pope Benedict was ringing
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.440]  up and bear with me I know I might be going on a tangent but is there no get in the Vatican
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:36.000]  get in all of it I mean this is this is sick it's so it's sick stuff we know that Ratzinger
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.320]  was phoning bishops in Dublin in Cork in Limerick in Kerry all over Ireland to tell those bishops
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.640]  look we know in the Vatican we know that it's there's crazy stuff going on in Ireland that
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:53.000]  priests and Christian brothers are buggering and raping and destroying children but don't
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.800]  ever cooperate with the police we have this on the record that lousy I'm not gonna swear
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.680]  and use bad language on your program but before he became Pope he was complicit Alex he was
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.640]  an accessory after the fact because he was telling bishops move those priests to other
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:12.600]  parishes and that's why I reportedly helicoptered him off to that Italian castle because these
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.040]  documents were starting to come out absolutely right there's some on Alex who's going to
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:21.200]  be in hiding for the rest of his life will never leave the Vatican city because there's
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:26.000]  that much anger and outrage in Catholic communities around the world and we see it playing out
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.040]  here one of the things I loved you talking about over the years on your shows was the
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.000]  Franklin Credit Union scandal and Lawrence the King Alex is playing out here now in
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.080]  England in London in Manchester in Birmingham you know we know that I mean Scotland Yard
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.280]  of Admissions in fact I've interviewed Michael Shrimpton has been a guest on your program
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.520]  before a barrister and a guy who's been connected up to the up to the gills with the security
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.600]  services in Britain I mean he's gone on the record to say that you know Edward Heath former
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:59.240]  Prime Minister of this country molested children people will say it's a cheap thing for me
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:05.040]  to say now because he says dead and it's easy to say something about the dead but my former
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.080]  MI5 officer Scotland Yard detectives have been talking amongst themselves and I've been
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.920]  letting little bits of information slip out to journalists like you journalists like me
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.360]  to say that children were murdered not necessarily on the orders of people like Ted Heath but
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:27.200]  they were murdered by the security services in case they ever dared to tell a policeman
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.360]  or woman about what because again once the pedophiles do a big enough crime and they're
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.040]  government official the rest of government who isn't involved has to cover it up because
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.760]  the view is it would bring down the whole government but see long term it just lets
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.800]  this stuff breed and then it will end up bringing down everything 10 times worse because they
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800]  protected it.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.160]  That's absolutely right Alex it's absolutely right I've said before I loved hearing you
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.920]  at the beginning of the program saying it's a great time to be alive because I think you're
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.560]  absolutely right to say that I have this thing I'm an eternal optimist like you I have this
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:05.200]  thing in my in my gut where I believe that this is going to be one of the great catalysts
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:11.040]  in bringing down this evil horrible sickening cabal that you so eloquently described at
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.600]  the beginning of the broadcast because Alex when ordinary and I'm an ordinary man you're
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.040]  an ordinary man but so many of the people that we share our lives with so many of our
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.720]  neighbors and and you know you've got children in school some of the parents of the children
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.200]  that your kids go to school with they don't want to hear this Alex they don't want to
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.120]  hear you talk about it they don't want to hear me talk about it out of mind but children
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.960]  are being disappeared by the tens of thousands per country into sex slavery into snuff films
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.280]  it's being covered up we need to tell people that don't want to hear about it that they
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:49.240]  are now becoming complicit in aiding and abetting these shadowy rings from your deep research
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.520]  we've gone over some of the evidence some of the big stories with this happening from
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:59.560]  your research I mean Jimmy Savelle the top BBC host who had the highest level security
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.920]  clearance with the royal family can go and go at night best friends with Prince Charles
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.840]  found with tortured Dungeons dead little kids necrophilia everything the kids have said
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.160]  now coming out a bunch of his friends end up dying drivers end up dying butlers end
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.000]  up dying you know anybody blowing the whistle ends up dying you see this guy in his weird
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.200]  jumpsuits the art type of a pervert weirdo and then this is the confidant of the royal
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:30.960]  family they're constantly finding dead children's bodies buried on royal estates what is going
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:37.320]  on what is at the top in your gut how deep does this go and what's their end game in
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:44.960]  my gut I've never said this Alex well I have I said on my own program in my gut I believe
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.920]  not because he's a friend of mine but because I believe my credibility your integrity and
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.400]  my integrity is too important not because he's a mate of mine but I'll tell you I think
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.040]  David Ike is absolutely spot on it goes to the heart of royalty in this country it's
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.640]  prime ministers like we said earlier on justice ministers it's satanic Alex I absolutely believe
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.480]  that much of this is satanic and when I think about that I think back to that exposure that
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.880]  you brought out all those years ago of what was going on at Bohemia Grove it just all
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.800]  adds up you know David talks about dot connecting you connect the dots on your program I tell
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.880]  you what sickenes me Alex you know what you're doing here in India now your viewers I know
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.680]  you are producers and you will be aware of a woman called Melanie Shaw Melanie is from
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.520]  Nottingham you know what you're doing to Melanie all the time Alex they're locking her up on
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.720]  stupid charges because Melanie was abused at a children's home in Nottingham many many
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.920]  many years ago and in the last few years she gave evidence to the police in Nottingham
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:49.080]  and the police in Britain in wider Britain and nothing was done about the evidence that
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.000]  Melanie gave so what did she start doing then she's a very feisty woman she started screaming
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.800]  from the rooftops and shouting about the fact that and you know my evidence isn't being
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.000]  taken seriously why have people not been at least interviewed under caution even if not
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.880]  arrested well they've just banged her up for the second time recently Alex on the loaded
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.760]  trumped up charges with no evidence they've accused her of threatening her neighbors
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.960]  of harassing her neighbors of attempting to burn her garden her neighbor's garden shed
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.600]  Alex they're locking them up we live in this disgraceful world that you've been doing
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.480]  your utmost for years to shine a light on where the lousy bastards and I'm sorry for
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.920]  saying that word in your program who did this are walking around or driving Bentley's they're
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.560]  writing laws and legislations they're reading caviar tonight and the people that were abused
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.440]  by them Alex they're getting locked up for telling the truth they're locking them up
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.200]  on trumped up charges and your producers will know they can just you know they can Google
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.080]  Melanie Shaw and find out what's been happening to her and I so terrible Alex you know it's
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.960]  never happened to me thank God and I don't know anybody apart from my great friend Derrick
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.600]  Perry and water for but I don't know anybody in England whom it's happened to but to have
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.560]  that absolute reality that we have where the victims are being locked up and the people
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:10.280]  who did it are walking around and I just go back to say one final thing on it I believe
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.880]  and the reason why I mentioned you know the ordinary men and women who who think this
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:19.600]  is beyond the pale when this all comes out Alex those people are going to finally have
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.120]  to face up to what their leaders are doing and what's behind their leaders they in hand
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.000]  they're going to have to face up to it Alex and then many of the other issues that you've
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.960]  been revealing on your program for years whether it's about 9-11 whether it's about central
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.560]  banks and what they're doing and trade agreements and all of that people will start to realize
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.600]  that so I think this might be a watershed moment in Britain where people are finally
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.200]  going to see who these people are oh I agree and we're going to see more and more of these
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.160]  watershed moments across the board Richie Allen's our guest Alex Joneshough he just
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.440]  tuned in running the number out in a moment and take your calls coming up we cover some
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.800]  geopolitical issues but Richie that was my next question and he started covering it without
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.240]  me asking it just like the Vatican for 30 years denied that they had pedophile rings throughout
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.760]  the organization from the bottom of the top it turned out it was worse than what the victims
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:18.360]  were even saying in almost every case then expanding on that they were not able despite
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:23.720]  all the King's horses and all the King's men to cover it up the UK is not able the Germany
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:30.680]  is not able the Netherlands aren't able Brazil's not able but a bigger question is what happens
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:37.480]  as all these groups end up getting brought down a and then B why is it pedophile rings
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:45.480]  running things I mean I just have no perception no kinship with these people of how they would
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.640]  be attracted to children but but going beyond having sex with children which I have zero
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:56.680]  attraction to and have a repulsion to I really have a repulsion to hurting them I mean when
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.920]  I think about somebody hurting a child I'll be honest I want to kill people and I'm not
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.280]  saying I'm a tough guy but I'm like an average man I mean I can get superhuman strength with
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.360]  somebody's mess with my kids and I mean if I caught somebody hurt my kids the cops aren't
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.360]  coming I'm gonna come after you and I just I no wonder they won our guns Richie no wonder
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.440]  they want a police state total grid in place that they control to protect them from us
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.240]  because they're scared all this is gonna come out because they know everything hidden ends
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.400]  up coming out so we come back I want to ask you those questions a why is it pedophile
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:36.400]  rings what I mean what are these psychic vampires I mean what's going on why torture
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:42.240]  them why was it Satanism I mean it turns out all these cases that are confirmed a huge
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.520]  nest of pedophiles the BBC that it's Satanism so we're gonna talk about this when we come
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:58.240]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:39.320]  raping and torturing them like jimmy savelle has gone on to hell you got to google that
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.400]  guy's name and read all the news articles about the torture dunions the dead bodies the
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.600]  satanism and of course it was all done through child protective services they would get the
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:55.220]  at risk children just like penn state where jerry sandusky would rape young children in
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:34:02.920]  the locker room showers on saturday at high noon a major football field house is like
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:11.880]  a anthill on a saturday or sunday ladies and gentlemen just want to give you a news flash
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.640]  that's my problem is i've got too much evidence and too much proof of this it just makes my
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:21.080]  head swim and i know why people deny it and don't want to look at it because it's so alien
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:30.040]  to a normal person i mean i see maryland and roe and i get excited but not even so much
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:36.040]  sexually it's just she's so beautiful she's got so much life i just love women that's
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.080]  god made me that way that's normal it's not bad that i'm attracted to women i mean we
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:49.320]  have children that's how we procreate men and women go together like a horse and carriage
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:54.960]  but i just cannot and i see women of every race color and creed and see so much beauty
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:05.720]  in them but i see children and all i want to do is protect them and they're so sweet
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:13.240]  and so innocent i want to teach them well that's that's that's that's what god wants god gives
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:20.440]  us blessings and freedom and delivers us from our enemies but god needs us to stand up and
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:26.280]  be his messengers to be his emissaries to be his foot soldiers and to challenge these dragons
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.720]  and to deal with them and to take them down and just to say you know what i don't care
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:34.040]  of you demonize me i don't care if you attack me you know what i don't care if you kill me
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.920]  because somebody's got to stand up for these children and that's why i don't want people calling
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:45.720]  in saying i'm a hero or ritchie allen's a hero anybody else says listen it's a normal behavior
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.840]  when you know systematic evils going on to stand up against it and say it's wrong
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.200]  like i think the palestinians are treated wrong i think that they're abused i think that they are
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:06.280]  living in hell and a lot of innocent children get killed but i pull back and i go why does the left
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.280]  only focus on a few hundred palestinian kids killed a year which is terrible
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.880]  and not hundreds of thousands of christians many of them children killed by al qaeda forces that
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:23.480]  our government funded oh because they don't count see i look at when i'm told to get upset
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.480]  that
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:34.040]  when the bus gets blown up and jewish kids get killed i'm told not to care or when israel
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.320]  in the fifties and sixties irradiated 110 000 children a secretly classified program the ring
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:45.880]  worn children turned out that they killed about 10 000 you don't hear anybody that speaks up against
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:52.280]  the holocaust saying that's wrong well because oh it was a racist eugenicist jewish holocaust against
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:37:02.840]  jewish because within that ringworm child story that's aired on pbs you know public stations
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:09.720]  in israel i mean it's it's declassified as of 1987 you get a microcosm of oh this leadership aren't
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.160]  jews this leadership are eugenicists at least some of them are just like england just like
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:21.000]  germany just like russia it's the same group the same people i don't care if you're chinese eugenicist
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.960]  or a jewish eugenicist or a german eugenicist or a mexican eugenicist
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:34.920]  did you know eugenics was more popular in mexico than even in germany in 1938 look it up
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:45.400]  i just know too much is the problem i just know the enemy i know their game plan i know how bad
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:51.480]  they are even though my flesh repels from them and i can't believe they're that bad i do know
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:58.760]  they're that bad i've read a lot of crime reports and a lot of criminology books back when i had time
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.560]  to do so in high school and college and the descriptions of the police psychologists when
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:08.280]  they go down in these basements with the police they dig up 10 15 20 30 bodies and usually it's
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:13.240]  little kids or women skeletons or rotting bodies and they look at the photos and the videos that
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:18.280]  never get released to the public of these these psychos torture and these kids and stuff and i
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.560]  mean people get ptsd they vomit they have mental breakdowns the detectives have to watch this stuff
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.240]  because by law they've got to watch it all for the court and they just can't even look at it and i'm
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:35.560]  not saying i'm a victim but if anything if i do deserve your prayers and support for anything
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.200]  it's that i have to constantly think about these people and i have to constantly be aware of what
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.760]  they're doing and i have to constantly be aware of the enemy is on the march right now like battle
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:50.440]  the bolds to counter everybody that hates them and that and that and that if people would just grow
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:56.920]  up and admit how bad the globalist are we could roll back this tide of evil but the only reason
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.640]  there's an awakening happening right now is because evil is swinging from the land shades it's swinging
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:07.880]  from the chandeliers i mean it is growing so fast in my spirit i feel the evil growing in my gut i

[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:49.320]  we go to calls yeah you're the boss alex whatever i'm delighted i'm delighted to do this let's put
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.840]  bookends on the whole pedophile call because i asked that question earlier a why is this it
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:03.560]  seemed historically the dominant vampiric social Darwinist uh what's the word psychic vampire group
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.080]  all over the world and why can't we ever unseat them and how do we awaken humanity but as it seems
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:14.200]  humanity is starting to awaken how do you expect them to strike back so three questions there i'll
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.280]  tell you what alex one of the things you'll be aware of this because you've interviewed and
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:24.600]  chatted with david ike probably more than anybody david has always said that he believes that what
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:32.120]  these what what might be involved here is energies that are known as arcons or are known as the gene
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.960]  all these ancient uh demons demons now i used to laugh at this one time i used to think well this
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.760]  is kind of extraordinary it's a little bit beyond the pale for me i'm not going to buy into it and
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.320]  that was without disrespecting david i just found it was a little bit difficult to take but not
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.760]  anymore alex you know the more i think about it the more satanic in nature we find these things to
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:46:00.200]  be i didn't mention that harvey proctor is a former conservative mp he's been arrested in relation to
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.720]  alleged pedophile activities at dolphin square in london and for your viewers who don't know dolphin
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.560]  square was like a big not a frat house but a big apartment block where a lot of politicians would
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:16.840]  have stayed and lived in while they were working in london so if they've arrested a former conservative
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:22.440]  mp because we're learning about satanic nature of this stuff david has got to have a point and
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:28.920]  it's well worth exploring that what thereafter is the prepubescent energy of young children
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:35.880]  and you know what alex i'm going to say this i'm going to say that that's as logical a conclusion
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:42.280]  as anybody has drawn on that for me because well sure every ancient culture just to back you up
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:48.360]  sacrifice children for their energy and believe they were doing it for entities yes and and you
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.320]  mentioned earlier on that this is thousands we're not talking about a few hundred children
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.920]  over a 30 or 40 or 50 year period we're talking about maybe tens of thousands so we're talking about
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:04.920]  satanic forces on the earth harvesting the life force and the terror energy of children now do
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:09.560]  you know what alex when i say that and when you say that some of our viewers will be very
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:14.200]  disturbed and they will say that we're trying to give the pedophiles a pass because what we're trying
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:19.240]  to say is uh god love those pedophiles it's not their fault really it's the demons we're not saying
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.960]  that at all you know we're not saying that at all i mean you can invite these things but why do so
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.280]  many of the pedophiles believe they're doing it for demons that that just keeps happening and
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.920]  happening and happening so regardless it's an art type of a demon that's manifesting if you go with
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:38.040]  a carl yung psychology yeah and there's probably so many different levels to it alex you know
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.160]  there are people who are induced into it maybe and are compromised i mean there's so many different
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.840]  levels i mean there's having sex i hate to even say this i mean you're a dad i'm not a dad yet
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.640]  it must be turtle for you to talk about this sort of stuff but having sex with a seven or an eight
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:59.240]  year old boy or girl but then there's having sex with a 13 or 14 year old girl which is no less
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:04.920]  wrong it's completely not really wrong but quite often you know famous people politicians were induced
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.800]  into doing that so that they could be later compromised you know when when when they were
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.880]  needed to do something exactly you don't get in the club even if you're not demon possessed or
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.760]  whatever it is you don't get it unless you go out with a 16 year old girl so they then know
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.880]  your compromise in fact that's almost a gang ritual it's come out to get into these globalist groups
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:29.240]  is hey just 16 year old girl we'll know you're safe once we've compromised you and these politicians
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.200]  will even pose and take photos knowing they're being inducted like a gang ritual where they tell
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.240]  a gang member go shoot an old lady or go shoot a cop or go rob a liquor store to shoot the clerk
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:46.040]  that's what the you know different racial gangs do with this gang it's rape children but then when
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:52.520]  you get deeper into it you're literally cutting the hearts out of babies yeah yeah i mean we
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:59.240]  mentioned briefly earlier on lauren z king you know republican power broker big friend of and
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.600]  you know famous republicans back in the eighties and what he was getting up to and of course one
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.800]  of the things he was doing was deliberately compromising people who might become enemies you
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.200]  know people who might block certain things or might make things difficult and they were asked
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.240]  out taking the kids out of i think it was the was it boystown orphanage alex was that the absolutely
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:23.160]  and i remember having senator camp on who was of commando in vietnam and cia that exposed all this
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.400]  he started talking about boystown and then he started talking about penn state like 10 years ago
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:35.320]  and i actually delayed him uh and and said you know cut him off the air and said you can't talk
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.640]  about stuff that hasn't come out in the news and and the camp got mad at me i apologize to him later
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.960]  but i got to say i mean he knew what he was saying i mean that is verified right there just like
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.760]  david ikes said this prime minister rape kids and now that's coming out or jimmy savel the bbc and
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:53.320]  these people you know had secret rooms and satanic rituals and then everything ikes said came out
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:59.720]  and and so and you know and ike learns all this in a vision without drugs in in peru i mean it
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.760]  just gets weirder and weirder you know there's a there's a video we haven't mentioned and it's
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:09.720]  doing the rounds of the internet i've interviewed somebody connected with it but i made sure they
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.760]  didn't mention any names and it's a video that everybody's seeing of two young children in hamsted
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:21.880]  in london appearing to describe ritualistic child abuse and murder and as of yet alex i don't know
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.960]  whether the video is a hoax whether it's real i've spoken with a woman called sabina mcneill who
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:33.800]  believes that it's absolutely real uh the children are in care now they've been taken away by taken
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:39.320]  from their mother by the authorities in this country and i just don't know alex but what i do know
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:44.920]  is that that's gone on you know ritualistic child murder has gone on here on a huge absolutely and
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.240]  then they use things like the salem witch trials to discredit it and claim that it's always made
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.680]  up hysteria no it's not it's being proven and it's going on at the highest levels we'll be back with

[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:15.000]  once you get to the same point with your mommy uh you really feel that you can do anything you can
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.960]  get into whatever temptation you know you want to get into especially if you're saying they're so
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:24.360]  rich and so powerful they get into what's forbidden regardless yeah they get into what's
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.800]  forbidden about this so they want to see these people with their arms around them taking pictures
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:32.280]  with them they're just playing the game they understand listen these are what these sickos
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  are into but this guy's got an x amount of money and he's going to help me with you know
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:42.440]  corrupting iran to you know do whatever i believe that these are just sick people that
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.960]  been in power for too long it's usually with the like the uh the the the traditional money
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:53.640]  families like for instance like the royal child they're very into all these uh these demonic things
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.760]  and i believe these people they might have got scriptures that are you know you know god knows
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.040]  how old that might have told them oh you know the blood of children do this and so they get high off
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.520]  that and then that's just that's like their little that's like their next hobby you know what i mean
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  these people's hobbies they they're so they're so warped with their money that their hobbies just
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:20.360]  becomes something you know like as extreme as this as saying you know what let's try this whole
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.400]  you know blood sacrificing thing with children and and you know as soon as we can absorb energy
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.880]  from it so then they just go along with it unfortunately sure but yeah you wanted to get
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.960]  into Rothschilds and Hillary Clinton because you volunteered that i see it on screen i want to get
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.480]  into the Rothschilds too i'll get into it more in the next hour but what was your point about
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.000]  Lord Rothschild the head guy saying the most dangerous time geopolitical situations since
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:51.320]  world war two yeah i mean he i honestly i feel right there he's just he's giving us a heads up
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.800]  but even the people that are in this close to circle they already know they already know what's
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:01.800]  going on i this is kind of like a message to people that he can't really reach um you know
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:06.520]  directly so he'll he'll he'll give these little things that like oh listen there's gonna be financial
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.160]  class that's like a heads up to his other his other business buddies i'm like sure and we're
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.240]  getting more and more of those heads up it's like the head of the Federal Reserve you know 10 years
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:21.640]  ago Greenspan saying irrational exuberance will bring us down when they set up the whole system
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:25.480]  to collapse down the road i think that's a really great point what's your point on Hillary Clinton
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.800]  and my point on Hillary Clinton is obviously she's in you know collaboration with all these heads as
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:37.160]  obvious that looks i mean she has a secret email address i mean come on that's that's a dead giveaway
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.280]  that she's obviously doing some sort of you know the street um sure it violates federal law too
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:46.040]  and this woman's a monster she's being doubted uh we're going to break we're gonna come back with
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:50.280]  more calls ritchie alan your comment on what he just brought up with the Rothschilds oh well look
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:57.240]  i mean this guy stands to i mean fund both sides of every war in recent history um he knows the
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:02.040]  score of course much of what happens and what will happen in the coming months um he'll have
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.400]  his groovy paw prints and his fingerprints all over that exam there's very little icon on to
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:11.880]  anything that's been said about Rothschild and the Rothschild dynasty and their central banks
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:18.920]  other than it's pure evil in its purest form i think you know you're irish it's happened to

[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:45.800]  where ukraine's going right now with richie ellis go back to the calls matt in washington dc
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:52.200]  you're on the air go ahead hey uh first point i just wanted to say it was um i called into npr and
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:57.160]  it was really easy to get on air and make some good you know libertarian perspective points
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.000]  and they actually commented on it for a little while did you get into national npr or local
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:06.680]  yeah it was diane ream show it was our nationally syndicated well all of them have huge audiences
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:11.560]  because it's the only liberal media that actually has audiences and so that's one of the best things
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:17.320]  you can do and the key is just going oh when you call them with your voice that means you're part
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:23.880]  of the cult what were you able to say um i just made a the point that nobody knows what the net
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:28.440]  neutrality bill was and they were saying that the kids that the companies were against it and that
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.320]  was just challenging that perspective that we've never seen it and sounded like every other case
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.560]  where more bureaucrats get involved and then go and work for the companies they were supposed
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:42.280]  to oversee well it must be really bad that they wouldn't testify to congress and they won't release
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:49.720]  it i mean how obvious is that what's your take on the pedo rings well i just think that it goes
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.840]  along with a lot of the human rights issues that that's going on where it's a culture of turning
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:02.520]  away from domination of a minority or the people who don't have a voice you know and um i just think
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:08.680]  that it kind of it comes it comes from the fact that people when when they start turning away from
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:14.680]  these um animal domination the fact that the people eat and consume animals that that's it
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:21.320]  likes it makes it a lot easier to turn away from human domination and i just wanted to get your
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:29.400]  take on whether or not um you think that it's harder to uh it's easier to um turn away from
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.560]  things like that when you know i hear you i mean if we're like eating animals and doing all this then
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:38.600]  why is it okay you know to do that when we claim we care about life i mean i get your
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:43.960]  perspective let me talk to uh richie allen and get his take richie uh i love the way you dumped
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.760]  that one on me alex and i'm a red blood yeah but you're co-hosting with us that's how these long
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:53.720]  formalities go absolutely right you've you've um look um it's a really interesting point i'm not
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:03:00.360]  going to try and dodge the question um i am a meat eater um i do my absolute best to make
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.120]  sure that to meet i eat is ethically farmed that animals are properly taken care of um but it's
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:10.200]  an interesting point and it's been assured by people on programs i've presented before
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:15.480]  and i do respect that opinion um but i eat white meat and fish and i will continue to do so well
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:20.280]  let me break that down for people i'm addicted to it but i don't eat any processed garbage i eat
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:27.880]  open range eggs i eat the highest quality when i can and by when i can i don't eat crap chicken
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:31.880]  full antibiotics i get the open range stuff tastes better it's like three times more
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.840]  but as we buy more and more of it it's creating a market i'm seeing prices actually go down
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:43.160]  as we displace the antibiotic filled torture cages that these chickens are in mcdonald's has
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.120]  announced they're going to be trying to get healthier chicken with no antibiotics we see the
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:53.400]  pressure working but i don't look down on those that have decided to be vegan in fact i respect
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.680]  them i understand their perspective here's the issue a bunny rabbit or a deer or a cow is a prey
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:09.480]  animal and it has been eaten forever i don't want to eat elephants or seals or lions or tigers
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:17.560]  or cats or dogs they're not prey animals i don't want to eat people you don't see cows building
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:25.160]  starships you don't see cows creating Beethoven uh now that said i have trouble i've seen it
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:30.200]  ordered before suckling pig i don't like seeing a piglet come out to be eaten uh but as long as
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:35.320]  they're killed humanely and and and taking care of that is part of their existence it's what's
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:40.520]  done in the natural order humans are omnivores our guts are built to be omnivores we're meant to
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:46.040]  have maybe 10 percent meat we do eat too much meat it's full of crap uh it's got a lot of problems
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.320]  i'd be healthier if i cut way back i've tried to but i'm addicted and but here's another issue
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:57.560]  that major studies meat is associated with larger brain cc size higher iq and brain development
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:02.040]  we are omnivores that have gone meat heavy and it's increased our aggression the government's

[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:53.560]  nba launches feminist campaign to lecture men not doing enough housework as if men somehow are lazy
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:59.480]  and bad again the war on men accelerates it's really a war on humanity to divide and conquer a
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:05.000]  war on women is a war on men a war on men is a war on women and ultimately children richie allen's
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.360]  our guest geopolitically you wanted to briefly before we go to calls get into what's happening in
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:17.000]  ukraine what's the financial conquering of mario dragui where they install the leaders in places
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:24.040]  like italy now just unprecedented where the banks install a golden sacks europe had as the president
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:29.880]  no election needed unbelievable yeah i mean it's unbelievable so so you're in europe you're dealing
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.680]  with this you've seen ireland fight for independence all you're now go under e u domination to be
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:41.080]  signed on to all this death that's not yours what's your take on that well it's it's horrendous alex
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:49.720]  i've said time and time again over the years that every prime minister or every uh finance minister
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:56.920]  of a european country who back in the 1990s signed on to the single currency the the euro every one
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.720]  of them should be in jail for treason for the rest of their lives because what they effectively did
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.760]  was sold to sovereignty of all of those countries down the river and those countries were no longer
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:12.600]  responsible for their own money supply and were basically being supplied money by central banks
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.720]  which didn't have any money i won't waste your time you've spent so many episodes so many shows
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:23.320]  over the years explaining this to people what it actually means those countries were then given
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:29.560]  money which didn't exist the principal created the interest never created to get those countries up
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:35.240]  to their absolute next in debt that could never be paid and then they've come for the natural
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.840]  resources of our countries it's unbelievable alex and a recent guest on one of my programs
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:46.680]  an irish guy called ben gilroy terrific activist in irland ben he said richie when they talk about
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:51.800]  the troika and for your viewers who don't know what the troika is it's the european institutions
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:57.880]  it's the european union the european central bank and effectively the international monetary fund
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:04.440]  when they come to your country to demand assets in return for debts that you can't pay the troika
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:10.360]  isn't the european central bank to i am f in the european union it's actually bechtel and pepsi and
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:16.040]  mcdonalds and all those corporations and that we decry and we complain about on our programs
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:23.720]  and alex you are 100 right the ousting of yana kovic was basically a grab by the same people
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:31.800]  for ukraine that's all it was plain and simple i mean anybody arguing with that needs only know
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:37.320]  that ukraine currently has a finance minister you know who she is alex she's a chicago woman
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:43.480]  she's a woman from chicago being sent in there like varro facas has been in greece they think this
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:49.080]  guy in greece is the messiah no he ain't he went to college in texas he's got links to the very banks
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:54.920]  that we just mentioned and notice immediately notice immediately they sold out and and went along
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:02.680]  with the with the eu debt deal that's right and will agree to take billions in in aid from the european
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:08.200]  union again the same old story played out time and time again alex you've had john perkins on your
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:13.720]  shows over the years i mean come on he spelled it out john perkins in his book confessions of an
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:20.120]  economic hitman this has been their modus operandi for years swan in their promised loads of money
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:26.040]  gross jobs you know independence it's all going to work out well for you but you can never pay that
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:30.920]  money back because the interest has never been created plus they create the money out of nothing
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:37.000]  then there's hundreds of conditions you've got to give the globalist all the money back to their
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.520]  companies you're you're not allowed to spend it like you want correct worse again it's it doesn't
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:48.040]  get any more corrupt and then like what's happened you mentioned irland alex we've given up in recent
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:54.200]  years to these companies you know masquerading as the trike we've given up our forestry alex
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:59.800]  we've given up the little bit of natural fuel reserve we have we've given up our water it's
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:06.840]  unbelievable these are things that can never be taken back and it's just a grab and you mentioned
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:12.360]  again i you know often take my lead from you about you do you're talking about the t-tip free
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.240]  trade agreement and all these agreements are supposed to bring everything up you know a rising
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.680]  tide lifts all ships it's going to be great for all the poorer countries in the world it isn't alex
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:27.720]  it's just going to get those countries deeper and deeper into the pockets of the cabal and of those
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.960]  corporations it's theft in broad daylight is what it is and i mean how many times have you
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:41.160]  said it this week on info wars last week you know 500 people or 150 people in the world owning more
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:46.200]  than half of the world's assets alex come on you know how much longer are people going to take this
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:50.760]  exactly they're always saying it's the one percent it's actually a couple hundred people have the
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.880]  world's wealth and and it's those very ultra rich that want to get rid of the middle class i mean
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.880]  even two years ago rolling stone had the headline matt taibi everything is rigged the biggest price
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:07.400]  fixing scandal ever we now know the interest rates are rigged we now know the stock market's rigged
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:12.600]  this is all admitted that's what's so crazy since i first got on air 20 years ago and others did
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:19.080]  it back then they wouldn't admit all this now it's just all admitted is that a victory or are
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.120]  they just trying to normalize it all and say okay you're going to expose us how about we just put
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.920]  all the dirty laundry out good luck digging through the mountain that we just dumped on your head
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:35.400]  alex you know what must be very frustrating for guys like you and david ike and jim marz and you've
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:41.800]  always been the three that i've gone to over the years you've now i think succeeded in educating
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:47.160]  massive amounts of people about what's going on of course the next step is to get them to do something
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:52.440]  about it i think you're winning the information war you're winning the war but what but what are
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.080]  they going to do it's what people are going to do with that information that's the next big challenge
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.800]  well are they going to sit on their bombs and do nothing about it or are they going to do something
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:06.840]  about it which is get up which is march which is campaign that's what they got to do now you've won
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:11.080]  that war my friend we've won that war together we are starting to win that war and i agree
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.480]  it's about going and talking to your parliament going and talking to your congress going talking
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:21.320]  to your local legislature letting them know hey i know the score other people do and that gives them
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:25.960]  the moral courage to then step up and then when somebody steps up and doesn't even go all the way
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:31.240]  but does the right thing you've got to then back them because so many times we get politicians do
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:36.040]  the right thing and then when they get trouble we turn on them no we've got to then back people
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:41.160]  once we've made them our champions let's go to some more calls mama in oregon thanks for holding
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:50.760]  you're on the air yes thank god for richie ellen and alex jones oh your sweetheart what's your
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:58.040]  calling what's your point ma'am yes the all the reports now that are coming out about the pit
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:07.880]  of philia yes we have we also have to think about the unreported okay just like you said you had
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:15.000]  trouble believing all of this in the beginning but there's so much that's going unreported
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:24.600]  and then if it is it's destroyed you know they're destroying the family and our future the pit of philia
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:34.440]  is ancient evil on earth and it's attacking our spirits it's destroying our future by destroying
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:43.320]  our children and we've got to start informing the children who the enemy is what the evil is
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:49.880]  and we've got to warn them arm them and support them well that's a good point that's a good point
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:54.040]  is that they tell parents don't tell your children about evil don't tell them about corruption tell
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:59.480]  them the government's good kids when they're little are ready to learn the basic archetypes of good
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:04.120]  and evil we need to be warning our children even though it's scary and teaching them about the
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:08.840]  new world order teaching them about oppressors teaching them about abusers that's the fact
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.440]  top psychologists have come out and said the tsa groping of children is pedophile training
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:21.720]  god bless you caller from oregon mama uh comments on that richie ellen uh i'm guessing that mama like
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:29.080]  you alex is a parent i'm not a parent yet i hope um caroline that's my fiance and and and i hope we
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:35.160]  have children sometime it's especially horrible and hurtful thing for parents i can only imagine it
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:40.520]  i've worked with children over the years as a soccer coach i've got young child relatives
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.440]  and children are beautiful you know and she's right to get upset there it's very difficult for me not
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:49.560]  to become upset um when when you think about it it makes me well once you become a parent
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:55.160]  you you you you you have violent thoughts when you even think about it and i'm not a violent person
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:59.080]  but it's just i think about people hurting kids it's just my instinct is to bash their brains out
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:04.680]  yeah i can only imagine alex all i can say to mama is look things are coming out now you know
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:10.200]  because of programs like this because of programs like mine because of david god loved david like
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:17.000]  writing that book in 1998 you know and taking all the abuse he did for doing that this it's in people's
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.120]  faces now mama and that's the start that you know and i like to think that because even the mainstream
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:27.000]  have no choice now but to report on it that might make children who might have been in danger next

[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:56.440]  or i was saying something about uh grease there and how um that that's pretty much been uh predicted
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:01.560]  yeah i mean you don't elect leftist governments that then actually default on imf world bank stuff
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:08.120]  so uh that was their big mistake they're really scared of lapin who's actually nationalist
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:13.080]  and then she knows what she's doing in in in in france lapin is for real that's why they're
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:20.200]  trying to basically ban it gotcha okay um yeah i have a comment about these uh pedophiles that are
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.200]  going crazy and go ahead brother okay well i have a bit of an experience with that you
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:34.680]  know i i was unfortunate to get one that was uh abused as a as a child uh i had 10 girlfriends
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:40.520]  previous to that i think before i actually was going to be engaged to her and uh so i saw all
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:44.840]  the symptoms of what that so if you can't figure out what that's going on in their head you can
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:50.360]  at least discover what the symptoms uh the effect of all that is let me understand what you're
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.600]  saying you were abused so that when you had a girlfriend who'd been abused you know how to
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:01.240]  recognize it no girlfriend was abused i had to deal with it when i was uh engaged to mario
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:05.880]  okay i'll tell you i can tell you it wasn't it wasn't pleasant
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:14.120]  yeah it causes a lot of scars and a lot of mental problems yeah you get abused as a child um
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:22.680]  you're you're i i i got no trust from her whatsoever i've got i got um right before
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:28.520]  she was born she didn't want me in the hospital um you mean before you had a child the bonding the
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:34.120]  bonding is absolutely not there like it doesn't happen yeah destroys love and trust people that
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:38.520]  have been abused and that's the globalist plan is to create people that uh don't have any bonds
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:41.560]  it's why they want to short the family it's why they want to get men and women fighting with
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:46.840]  each other it is so wicked thanks for the call cranky canadian uh steven in florida still on the
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:54.200]  subject of the pedophiles being exposed worldwide go ahead yeah good afternoon alex uh this is one
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:28:00.280]  of my hot button issues i'm glad you're talking about this again uh alex i've mentioned this
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:06.520]  to david night before when i called in uh when he was posting in your place uh there's a guy
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:14.200]  that single-handedly undermined the moral fabric of this country and uh of course was funded by the
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:22.920]  rockefellers that get through the 30s through the 50s and they were more nice no alfred kinsey oh yeah
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:29.320]  oh yeah and yeah there's a woman named dr judith reissman if you go to dr judith reissman it's
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:39.960]  r e i s m a n dot com and there's another uh website kinsey syndrome dot com that three-hour
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:47.000]  documentary really blows wide open this guy kinsey was involved with the nazis i know he was
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:54.200]  funded by the rockefellers he had a soundproof lab at indiana university this guy got the laws on
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:59.000]  the books the whole penal system of the united states against sex crimes changed through harvard
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.080]  law school and this is tied in with the porn industry and i'm telling you if you could get
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:10.760]  that because you know they've made movies about him celebrating him on the left and they have no idea
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.840]  that they realized that once they created this fake sexual liberation they can get anything done
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:21.160]  and if you expand on that uh into some of the other top psychologists and psychiatrists and
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:26.280]  the things that they've pushed it's all towards basically legalizing pedophilia uh down the road

[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:03.000]  show sound good maybe hillary clinton is god and we should just let her run everything you will see
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.480]  the next president i want to go to phone calls but i've got to hit news first or i'll never get to
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:13.560]  at all least part of the news let's uh go ahead and go into these clips that we have here of
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:19.720]  hillary this is white house press briefing uh ed henry questions why can't you just once say
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:26.120]  secretary clinton didn't follow those guidelines well look they're not guidelines there's federal
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:33.960]  law that's the open records act it's very old that major cabinet positions especially
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:40.280]  have to do everything on record it gets into the whole situation with bilderberg
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:45.720]  and different laws that are violated when policy is being discussed and decided in secret
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.920]  but we now live in a country where global treaties are secret and FCC power grabs of
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:58.760]  telecommunications are secret we're now a weekend of the telecommunications takeover was a week ago
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:05.480]  and they won't release it still it's just epic what they're getting away with but it's part of the
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:11.080]  course so let's go ahead and go to some of these clips here's the first one so josh they were held
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:17.160]  to the same standard after dozens of questions over two days why can't you just once say secretary
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:23.400]  clinton did not follow that guys because the guidance that has been given to these individual
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:28.520]  agencies is to ensure that they are in compliance with the federal records act which actually indicates
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:34.360]  that when personal email is used for official government business it's required for that
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:40.520]  personal email to be stored properly maintained and it was the agency and that according to
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:47.640]  president's clinton clinton's team is exactly what they did which would yeah at her home not not
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:54.200]  preserved by the state department no again those records right now she had emails using fake names
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.920]  communicating with people through their fake emails in an organized criminal operation it's called
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:05.320]  racketeering and this is a known criminal this is hillary clinton we're talking about a known
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:11.400]  brian williams level liar as well let's continue and finish the clip reside at the department of
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.240]  state so that they can be properly preserved and maintain the last few months so that they could be
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:19.960]  used in response to legitimate inquiries from the public and from congress but after you asked for it
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:23.320]  years later well to be clear it's the department of state that asked for it and they asked it not
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.240]  just the secretary clinton you've seen his politics and you protect your i mean why can't you have
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.240]  all these rules and laws why can't you just say she exercised poor judgment even if you don't know
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:39.000]  if she broke the law this is your guidance it was not followed yeah well at the the the the
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.800]  question this guy's like i'm trying to wipe wash it please help me whether or not she was in uh
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:47.960]  compliance with the federal records act and again it requires that all right that's enough
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:53.880]  get that little snot nose he is the ultimate snot nose i have a quote here by carl rove where he
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:59.320]  told the new york times i don't care what you do i control reality haha quote we're an empire now
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:05.640]  front page from four wars dot com we're an empire now and when we act we create our own reality
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.880]  and while you're studying that reality judiciously as you will
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:16.760]  we'll act again creating other new realities and you all of you will be left to just study that
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:24.520]  what we do carl rove the arrogance of we exist we live you sleep you follow us we control reality
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:31.560]  because you go along with us you when we say two plus two equals five you believe it when we say
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:35.960]  obama care cuts prices when it doesn't you believe it when we tell you we're not coming after your
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:41.080]  guns you believe it when we tell you open borders is a great thing you go along with it and it's
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:46.760]  all because we comply with these people here's another clip white house press briefing and
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:52.200]  henry questions specifically did the white house know that secretary clinton had her own server
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:57.160]  over now remember this notice the press briefing room used to have like five times as many people
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:02.040]  they've moved it to a smaller room you've got to be specifically vetted by the white house now
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.840]  to be in there and you have to pre provide your questions so this is probably staged
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:12.520]  you've got to ask why are they staging it but here's the clip okay and specifically did the
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:19.480]  white house know that secretary clinton had her own server i don't know the answer to that i as
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.000]  i mentioned earlier i think the extent of knowledge about secretary clinton's um did the white house
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:30.360]  know that your any household want to be uh and she used that email address that as we all now know
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:38.120]  was not uh at state dot gov but that she was in but that she was emailing a white house officials
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.480]  that's something that i acknowledged from the beginning yeah they're all involved in a particular
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:45.080]  surprise that the secretary of state is emailing senior white oh what a big surprise the secret
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:51.880]  email at the white house as uh as was the case for every other cabinet agency uh is that she
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:56.920]  and her team are in compliance with the federal records act so you're acknowledging for four years
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:02.200]  she did not use the state department account and to hide his question every senior official here
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:08.440]  at the white house just deferred and said that's okay uh every yeah well let's stop right there
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:15.400]  because you find in the emails that have been released she's communicating with other hidden
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:21.560]  accounts that's the big issue is they had a network headline white house ran network of fake
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:28.280]  accounts to hide data from public impress that's your real scandal let's go to the next uh clip
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:32.920]  here here's another one it's been known and confirmed on capitol hill that former epa chief
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:38.120]  lisa jackson noticed we pointed this out days ago now it's being pointed out had a whole other
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:44.600]  account that she was using using the name richard winsor was lisa jackson ever held accountable
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:49.160]  well yeah she had to step down let's go to the club not just secretary clean it's throughout the
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:54.840]  government uh it's been known and confirmed by capitol hill that former epa chief lisa jackson
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:01.000]  had a whole nother account that she was using used the name richard winsor to talk to officials
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.360]  and talk to outside groups did anyone here at the white house ever challenged that it was
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:10.840]  lisa jackson ever held accountable admonished in any way but that has nothing to do with the
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:14.760]  federal records act because they have to do with maintaining a different yes a conspiracy to get
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.960]  around your different name for official business but the official business is properly maintained
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:25.400]  with the epa at that agency as it's supposed to be richard winsor it was properly maintained ed it
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:31.000]  was preserved at the department of uh under another name of the epa under another so that
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.560]  individuals like individuals in congress could have access to that information based on legitimate
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:40.120]  increase that is entirely consistent with the federal records act okay last on this uh
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:45.480]  in cooperating with congress uh the bengazi terror attacks were in 2012 and shortly thereafter as we
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:51.000]  all know republicans started asking for documents now we learn that seven different committees seven
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.160]  different in fact yes she didn't know which found not a single instance of wrongdoing but let's stop
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:01.720]  right there that lawyer tactic of of uh seven committees it's like is it you know you hacked
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:07.560]  your wife open with an axe uh in front of your neighbors it was videotaped by the way that axe
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:15.880]  was purchased at uh sears and roba like like yes these committees asked for these documents he's
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:21.480]  about to say and you didn't bring them out you kept him secret absconding but stages goes seven
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:26.840]  committees to look smart because all he's up there to do is to look pinheaded for a bunch of
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:31.880]  trendies who think some guy like this is really cool because he looks like an actor from that from
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:37.800]  from horrible bosses or something i mean it's all about how they look it's all about snow
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:44.120]  jobbing the public and i know people know this but the issue here is this is the secretary of state
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:48.840]  with fake email accounts and he's up here acting like nothing's happened it is disgusting
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:55.800]  i want to go back to your calls but i said i'd get into this so i'm going to get into it right now
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:02.440]  i already pretty much covered this but it's on info wars.com
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:08.200]  a paul watson article nba that's the national basketball
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:19.560]  dumb dumb association launches a feminist campaign to lecture men on not doing enough housework
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:25.240]  close quote men not doing their fair share of daily chores there's no metric there's no study
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.720]  actually there are studies showing that men work more hours and actually you're bigger
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:34.520]  breadwinners and it actually shows i just i just remembered these guys google it there's so many
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:42.440]  studies showing that men actually do a disproportionate amount of repair work auto work carrying the
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:50.200]  trash out cooking dinner i mean my dad and mom weren't pinheads they knew family stuck together
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:55.160]  they knew that siblings stuck together they knew that that was what it was all about but
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:00.360]  my mom would do the laundry and clean up and stuff and maybe have a maid come on so we
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:04.840]  hear something to help with deep cleaning but my dad was the one that fixed the roof and fixed
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:09.160]  the faucets and it wasn't like oh who's going to cook dinner tonight my dad would excitedly run
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.720]  in at six at night coming home early from work that was early for him and go i went and bought
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:23.080]  baked potatoes and steaks and and and you know salad and brussel sprouts i'm going to make dinner
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:27.800]  tonight he'd do that maybe once or twice a week you know he probably cooked dinner on saturday
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:31.960]  night he cooked dinner on wednesday night and it was just never oh you're not doing your first
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:36.680]  share listen if my dad sat on his butt and watched football which he did sometimes my mom would bring
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:43.480]  him food because she got the fact he was out there dominating in business taking her on vacations
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:49.080]  making her money taking care of of her family when she needed help taking because she was in
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:55.960]  that family she took the name of jones she was in the club in the gang she got it he was her she
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:01.960]  was his and anyone that tried to get her in between her man was an idiot now that's a woman that knows
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:07.960]  what she's doing and successful today and happy and and and doing well the world's full of women
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.800]  that mess with their men and screw with them all day and you get to sit around with a bunch of
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:17.240]  unhappy divorced women talking crap about men all day and that's just what the globalists want you
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:22.120]  absolutely alone so nobody's there to stop them from euthanizing you the first time you fall down
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:28.360]  and hit your head when you're 69 years old and i mean the super bowl had not one not two not three
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:34.600]  but four ads and then super bowl announcements about men be nice to your daughters be nice to your
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:45.320]  women to create some guilt as if men collectively being men because we got wavos have done something
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:53.160]  to women this is the biggest load of fake guilt malarkey it's like i've got white privilege i'm
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.800]  white i owe somebody something i don't know anybody anything but the truth

[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.520]  but i reject the idea that i'm going to follow a lecturing agenda
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:18.920]  because i'm being lectured but this is all about you sit down to watch television in between the
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:24.360]  anti-gun announcements ad after ad after ad that dads don't love their daughters that dads aren't
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:28.920]  working hard enough let me give you a little newsflash it's men that go and die in wars it's men
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.840]  that die on average six years younger than women i saw some statistics were like 75 percent of the
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:40.840]  wealth in texas is in women's hands women are 62 percent of college graduates in the u.s women are
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:49.960]  taking over the dominant executive jobs and the decline of men men are declining is a signpost
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:57.400]  on the end of humanity because of the warrior section of this species is under attack what does
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:06.280]  that tell you the cia and top globalist and i'm going back to your calls steven they openly
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:11.240]  edward brunais wrote not one not two but three books bragging how they created modern feminism
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:16.840]  to enslave women to the state to break up families into tax women and direct them so they could be
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:23.880]  used up like men so women wed yourself to the state tune into all these feminist shows about
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:28.920]  how the problem in the world's men the problem is globalist controllers the problem is the new
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:35.080]  world order the problem is superprevotor men manipulating you with a script but now when

[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.440]  women out to have men in the house and the illegitimacy went up from like 11 to 90 percent or so
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:28.200]  and totally enslaved women and broke them down and and destroyed men um is that the same feminism

[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:05.640]  talk to him like that but they don't tell you about the real evils of what they've done to
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.960]  inner city communities and turning people and basically into automatons i don't know now they
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:15.720]  roll with the next phase so everybody's sitting around watching mba basketball well lebron says

[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:34.040]  while i was babbling in my incoherent babblings uh but in in amongst the inane babbled there was
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:40.200]  some key words that could be heard in there uh but uh go ahead to quote lord of the rings uh
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:45.080]  what was your other point about the pettifall scandal yeah i just wanted to come back to
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:51.400]  ask you know when people have studied american history this guy out for kenzie they've termed it
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:59.720]  in terms of pre-kindian and post-kindian history that they say sexual revolution sexual revolution
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:03.480]  had more sexual partners was what they meant to look popular at the end of the day it was all
[03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:10.280]  about pedophilia go ahead well see the thing is that kenzie he got his philosophy from and this
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:16.920]  is not coincidence edward renais uncle figment Freud who proposed that children were sexual from
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:22.680]  birth and so kenzie took that and what this guy did this as far as i'm concerned kenzie was the
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:28.680]  most evil man of the 20th century because he had ties to alistair crowley to the nazis
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:35.880]  and what he did was so he taught men around the united states in the world and he had
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:41.240]  him his cohorts himself to this at indian university in the soundproof lab they built
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:46.680]  there which is now the kenzie institute take a stopwatch have children molested for up to
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:53.480]  24 for the time as young as two months old time the reaction and called it orgasm now that that
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:59.160]  is so sickening discussing but it is satanic and that's what you know they rape children officially
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:04.440]  and this is the ultimate sacrament of the liberal and and i mean that's it you know
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:08.120]  you're right the most evil man in the 20th century we need to have that headline with
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:12.920]  his name you're absolutely in fact we should do reports on that and we should do a report too
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:19.320]  and show a good psa about family and how great it is versus these psa is being put out by google
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:25.960]  these are sickos who hate us i appreciate your call great points shawna in kentucky you're on
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:32.120]  the year go ahead hi alex i just want to let you know i really miss your babblings and you're out
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:37.320]  with some really quick points um we're in a 200 year mark since we signed a peace treaty of gint
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:43.800]  and that was on february 18 to uh 1815 so we're in a dangerous year this year this year so i want
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:49.720]  everybody to just be on guard and then just a reminder that on 9 11 1814 the battle prafburg
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:55.000]  was of course they got us on 9 11 and then of course 12 14 1814 battle sorry that was a battle
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:00.120]  like uh we're going to mention that the globalists are obsessed with ancient battles and ancient
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:04.280]  treaties they always see it as they're repeating an ancient battle one of their ancestors was
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:11.320]  involved in because they understand ancestral memories i didn't know that always was looking
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:15.480]  at the dates um the 12 14 was a date they came and killed our kids to see any hook and then just
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:22.200]  the last comment um these are demons these demons after our kids they hate us they hate americans
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.920]  and i would just suggest and i have a background in psychology i also was a pastor for many years
[03:04:26.920 --> 03:04:32.040]  that aren't women our men need to go get some olive oil and just put it over your doors put
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:37.400]  over your windows and pray you don't need to go to priest or you know a pastor pray over it
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.720]  and don't let those things come in your home well you're being a little racist towards demons right
[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:47.640]  now in fact the extremists have called in the day we may be shut down by the fcc for criticizing
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:52.520]  pedophilia but i'm being sarcastic but not really they're trying to legalize it in australian
[03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:58.440]  places uh it's amazing i'm sorry the other callers ad jack mainline if you want to call me back
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:24.360]  tomorrow we'll take your calls god bless you all
