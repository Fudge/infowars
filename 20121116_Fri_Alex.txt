[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.320 --> 00:48.400]  Ladies and gentlemen it is the 16th day of November 2012. I am your host Alex
[00:48.400 --> 00:57.160]  Jones we're going to be live here for the next three hours. Obviously yesterday I
[00:57.160 --> 01:03.640]  talked about the fact that there is only one remedy that is in the bill of
[01:03.640 --> 01:07.320]  rights Constitution and the Declaration of Independence that can fix the
[01:07.320 --> 01:19.040]  problem that we're facing outside of a armed assault against the globalist
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.080]  occupation forces that have hijacked the federal government and most the states.
[01:23.080 --> 01:32.360]  It is lawful redress it is in the Declaration of Independence and we are
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.000]  going to go over the Declaration of Independence when we come back out of
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.280]  this break and I left my copy in there and earlier I needed another one printed
[01:40.280 --> 01:50.640]  please. Now since I called for this yesterday and it's like calling the sun
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.120]  coming up in the morning it's not anything you know credit to myself it's
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.960]  just that it's self-evident so I'm pointing it out. It has gone extremely
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.840]  viral thanks to all of you the listeners and thanks to Evan Vieira
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.040]  advisor Ron Paul and of course constitutional lawyer and his former
[02:09.040 --> 02:13.800]  chief of staff and founder of the Von Mies Institute Lou Rockwell concurring
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.280]  with my analysis and battle plan yesterday it has gone extremely viral and
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.120]  of course thanks to Matt Drudge of drudgerport.com still linking to it
[02:23.120 --> 02:26.760]  right in the middle of the main column right in the center third story down
[02:26.760 --> 02:30.280]  underneath Ron Paul's farewell address that's now been up there for two days
[02:30.280 --> 02:35.260]  obviously Drudge knows that's important as we all do most powerful speech Ron
[02:35.260 --> 02:38.320]  Paul's ever given one of the greatest speeches I've ever seen as it just lays
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.280]  out the compendium and the absolute tyranny that we as a society are facing.
[02:45.280 --> 02:52.600]  Again ladies and gentlemen yesterday because I had that epiphany Wednesday
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.000]  night I was pretty wound up the first hour I'm even more focused today and I'm
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.160]  going to go to break I'm going to come back and I am going to calmly lay out
[03:05.160 --> 03:10.200]  exactly what I'm saying we need to do and direct you to the red-linked article
[03:10.200 --> 03:17.520]  that is a synopsis basic boil down of a general framework of how we can defeat
[03:17.520 --> 03:23.600]  the globalist and if you believe in yourself and if you take these powerful
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.240]  tools up in your hands and if you prosecute the globalist by exposing them
[03:29.240 --> 03:33.520]  speaking out against them resisting them demonizing them which is easy to do
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.520]  you just point out what they've done and give the example of the Republic versus
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.880]  being the corrupt Empire we become conquered by foreign interest then we
[03:43.880 --> 03:47.960]  can restore the Republic and this is not something that's going to happen
[03:47.960 --> 03:54.440]  overnight as Dr. Vieira said yesterday he said if we really prosecute this it
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.400]  would take three years and things will be very bad indeed within three years we
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.080]  are being imploded by design this is a worldwide program this has been done in
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.280]  countries over and over and over again so we know exactly what the globalists
[04:08.280 --> 04:22.440]  are going to do we know exactly what they are going to engage in and it is so
[04:22.440 --> 04:29.960]  frustrating to see the mind game they have another word for it it's a profane
[04:29.960 --> 04:36.240]  term the mind you know what that people are under where they value their
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.640]  servitude and tyranny and giggle at you when you try to explain to them what's
[04:40.640 --> 04:46.000]  happening okay but but this is a scientific programmer under and there's
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.880]  only one way out short of violence and don't worry when we start having
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.320]  success fighting these guys peacefully they're gonna get violent but we have
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.440]  to let them get violent first we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay

[08:29.640 --> 08:38.680]  ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 16th day of November 2012 I am coming to
[08:38.680 --> 08:44.880]  you live from Austin Texas the globalist are in my city right now I
[08:44.880 --> 08:49.400]  literally saw 50 helicopters this morning ferrying globalist into the
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.880]  formula one race and event that's all taxpayer paid for with the Eccleston
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.000]  I'm going to be breaking that down a little bit later because it integrates
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.360]  as a case point example of what big government and corporate fascism using
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.120]  socialism at the grassroots level is really all about and the real political
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.840]  paradigm we're in not the false left-right system they try to keep us in
[09:13.840 --> 09:17.440]  and there's real debates between the left and right but it's only on limited
[09:17.440 --> 09:23.080]  issues and then the controllers are so close to each other in who finances them
[09:23.080 --> 09:27.920]  that you never get any change for the better in fact you see the rapid planned
[09:27.920 --> 09:37.000]  orchestrated premeditated move towards authoritarian psychopathic control
[09:37.000 --> 09:51.240]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen today we are going to break down in part
[09:51.240 --> 10:03.640]  two of what I began yesterday this is historic what's happening and we are at
[10:03.640 --> 10:14.480]  a historic crossroads it is just that simple and we are not going to get out
[10:14.480 --> 10:25.920]  of the premeditated move towards total authoritarian control unless we face the
[10:25.920 --> 10:36.320]  fact that we have been conquered to a great extent by six global private
[10:36.320 --> 10:44.680]  megabank Ponzi scheme derivative selling crime organizations and we must learn
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.040]  that enemies philosophy we must learn that enemies goals I have learned their
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.880]  goals and let me tell you it isn't pretty and we must educate the sheep out
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.560]  there and warn them and say hey I know you're been preconditioned to laugh at
[10:59.560 --> 11:03.880]  us and I know that you've been under high-tech mind control high-tech
[11:03.880 --> 11:08.480]  conditioning but listen stuff's gonna get worse and worse and this is why it's
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.360]  going to get worse and worse because let me tell you a lot of the sheeple aren't
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.600]  laughing now because their ox is getting gored but this isn't a game it isn't oh
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.680]  I'm a constitutionalist I'm a libertarian I listen to Alex Jones I go to
[11:24.680 --> 11:32.760]  drudgereport.com I I like Ron Paul this is you better make this your full time
[11:32.760 --> 11:40.160]  job to get the word out however you see fit to people that we've got a real
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.000]  authoritarian group that runs the federal government and intimidates the few
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.480]  senators and House members that aren't on the globalist payroll that is putting
[11:51.480 --> 11:55.720]  in total election fraud that is bankrupting the country by design to
[11:55.720 --> 12:02.880]  consolidate it all of the really rich people I know have left the United
[12:02.880 --> 12:08.400]  States or are leaving the elites are leaving the corrupt globalist are
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.160]  leaving the government is digging in for war against the American people and
[12:14.160 --> 12:17.160]  you're like well the American people never stood up why is the government
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.400]  gearing up for a fight because they know they've done the psychological testing
[12:21.400 --> 12:25.480]  they've done the focus groups they've got the Google NSA spying systems they
[12:25.480 --> 12:34.120]  know where the people really stand and they know that when they try to start
[12:34.120 --> 12:37.840]  taking your guns when they start taking the farms and when they bankrupt things
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.040]  fully and try to have national conscription for domestic work regaids
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.240]  which Rahm Emanuel and others have announced and I've played the clips
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.640]  here it's in the Obama deception that when they implode things and then poses
[12:49.640 --> 12:54.080]  the saviors and put 100 million people on food stamps it was 25 million three
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.320]  and a half years ago it's 50 million today right at 49 million plus when they
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.040]  got a hundred million and then a hundred and fifty million that hundred and
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.200]  fifty million is going to say not only do we take all the middle classes money
[13:07.200 --> 13:12.880]  and wealth put them in a labor camp while these lazy blobs sit around with
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.720]  their with their Obama phones folks this has been done in country after country
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.240]  and the globalists have said this is their plan while they sit offshore and
[13:22.240 --> 13:27.440]  fly around above us in $50 million private jets with their prostitutes and
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.080]  their bodyguards in tow and fly around above us in luxury helicopters when
[13:32.080 --> 13:39.840]  they're in our cities they have a will a criminal will to break us and impoverish
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.160]  us that's their rearguard action after they fully fully imploded the economy
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.640]  and consolidated it they then move into armored private cities and rural
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.840]  redoubts and they travel by helicopters into high security zones for public
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.440]  events and things to grandstand because these peacocks do enjoy
[13:58.440 --> 14:07.200]  grandstanding I've studied these people down to every minute level okay I live
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.440]  this and I know them and they're arrogant they operate like you don't
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.240]  even exist in your animals and for all intents and purposes the general public
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.760]  are arrested development childlike individuals who have no idea even what's
[14:20.760 --> 14:25.480]  going on I've got a message to establishment liberals today as well
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.880]  I'm gonna get past all the coke Pepsi Ford Chevy Pittsburgh Steelers Cowboys
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.320]  you know versus this versus that and really try to talk to you and I'm gonna
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.760]  talk to conservatives as well mainline conservatives listen if you don't grow up
[14:41.760 --> 14:48.000]  now folks we are going down all the way okay just remember this later okay
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.840]  because I know a lot of you aren't gonna wake up now I know a lot of you are
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.920]  gonna sit there and laugh about this and it's all funny because you've been
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.120]  taught that as a defense mechanism listen you're going to weep and wail and
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.560]  grind your teeth nash your teeth wishing later you would have done something if
[15:06.560 --> 15:11.400]  this thing comes in and let me tell you it's coming in the gates open and hell
[15:11.400 --> 15:17.040]  is pouring in the dam is broken already God's shields are being lifted off this
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.520]  country any time we can repent and I don't mean in these fake churches I mean
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.240]  just getting on your knees to even if you don't believe in God or spirituality
[15:27.240 --> 15:34.080]  really getting real and and getting past all this crud because absolute evil is
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.080]  being released once there's no checks and balances once you let the most
[15:38.080 --> 15:44.360]  powerful and corrupt get into positions of total total domination the very
[15:44.360 --> 15:54.120]  worst will go to the top and hell is released now yesterday I pointed out the
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.600]  remedy to restore the republic and to have the United States go back to being
[15:58.600 --> 16:05.240]  a light to the world not a black sunshine projecting the model of torture
[16:05.240 --> 16:13.200]  secret arrest propaganda immorality degeneracy and real degeneracy is this
[16:13.200 --> 16:24.880]  lazy-eyed giggling snickering enjoyment of tyranny that so many of these
[16:24.880 --> 16:34.560]  minions to the system revel in it's a spirit of giving up of laughing of
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.040]  saying good let it all collapse or good let the government arrest people that
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.720]  are political good let the UN take control the internet and have this
[16:42.720 --> 16:46.040]  kill switch that's now being announced today yeah as soon as the president
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.920]  announces I don't care if Congress doesn't give me the cybersecurity internet
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.600]  kills which take over it's already in place I now shine a secret order giving
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.960]  control to and the UN has to brag to them see none of this stuff's ever
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.120]  secret even though they say it's secret because then they can't help but brag
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.040]  and announce okay now the UN's been given the internet that was announced
[17:08.040 --> 17:14.960]  this morning do you understand what's happening do you understand that the
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.400]  DNS addresses and the and the routing systems and the kill switches and the
[17:20.400 --> 17:25.080]  NSA codes have all been transferred to the United Nations in NATO our
[17:25.080 --> 17:29.920]  military is now commanded by NATO America has been conquered and if you
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.280]  get anything I've said to you and I'm gonna lay out the plan to defeat these
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.240]  people and it's gonna be a hard road they're arrogant they're accustomed to
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.960]  victory and they they they will drop the hammer but that's their strength and
[17:42.960 --> 17:54.120]  their weakness if you take anything away from what I say to you here it's this
[17:54.120 --> 18:11.840]  we must we absolutely must come to the understanding and the recognizing that
[18:11.840 --> 18:30.640]  we have been conquered by a foreign power we must come to that realization
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.840]  just like if you're an alcoholic and the doctor tells you you're going into
[18:34.840 --> 18:38.680]  liver failure you're gonna die in a year if you keep drinking you've got to come
[18:38.680 --> 18:48.760]  to grips with it or you're gonna die and a lot of people won't come to groups
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.560]  with it and they will die of liver failure and it's the same thing
[18:53.560 --> 19:00.200]  politically this is not a question it's not a debate we have linked up at
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.760]  info wars comm in prison planet comm in the article that I put together with
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.400]  whole Watson why the states must succeed to save America Declaration of
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.440]  Independence 2.0 restoring the Republic we have a link in that article to our
[19:15.440 --> 19:18.960]  article from the first issue of the magazine we have an online version of

[34:13.400 --> 34:17.320]  city Benghazi was the command base to bring an al-Qaeda to start the
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.040]  revolution a year and a half ago to overthrow Gaddafi gee you see it was al-Qaeda
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.160]  NATO brought them in but see they could only do this type of stuff because the
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.440]  general public does not know how to find their rear end with both hands oh they

[34:55.760 --> 35:02.520]  like children and so they can just sit here and go oh al-Qaeda is not connected
[35:02.520 --> 35:06.640]  really al-Qaeda you run that's the rest of the story so that's coming up will
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.720]  open the phones up as well this is turning into a big scandal for all

[35:37.320 --> 35:42.120]  special interest because the even operatives in media don't like what's
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.600]  happening and if you just tell the truth people resonate with it if we just
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.400]  admit how evil we've gotten we can turn this around going back to it here we'll
[35:51.400 --> 35:56.520]  put it up on screen for prison planet TV viewers radio host calls for second

[37:44.040 --> 37:48.120]  the second American Revolution because here's what's happening we have to
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.960]  define what that really means we have to define why we're doing that like the
[37:51.960 --> 37:56.960]  Declaration of Independence did we have to define the enemy and its goals and
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.120]  and put the choice out to people because we know who the enemy is they're
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.400]  arrogant and their battle plans are public they have put out public notice
[38:05.400 --> 38:08.880]  they've conquered us well you may have seized the federal government Jack but
[38:08.880 --> 38:12.080]  you hadn't seized my heart in my mind you hadn't seized all the states all the
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.560]  counties all the cities and all the police and military out there I'll assure
[38:15.560 --> 38:20.080]  you you guys own propaganda is backfired on you for 20 years saying there's no
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.760]  world government there's no private fellow reserve there's no new world order
[38:23.760 --> 38:27.200]  they're not gonna bankrupt things and bring in a new world order and then now
[38:27.200 --> 38:32.800]  the police all see exactly what I told them for 17 years Ron Paul for 30 years
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.280]  G. Edward Griffin for 45 years Bob Chapman for 50 years red Beckman for 50
[38:38.280 --> 38:45.200]  years Bill Benson for 50 years Cleon Skelson for 60 years okay you starting
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.640]  to get it we knew this was coming we watch the incremental takeover we were
[38:50.640 --> 38:54.760]  the Republic they took their time making money taking over different sectors
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.520]  getting it ready when they got this country they're gonna gut it down to the
[38:58.520 --> 39:04.040]  bone okay and they've laid their plans we've laid ours and if you're not getting
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.560]  chills you don't have an intellect you don't have discernment and you don't
[39:07.560 --> 39:14.400]  have connection to the creator of this universe anyone with any connection to
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.800]  spirituality knows and can feel not just manifestly intellectually see the evil
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.240]  all around us intensifying you can feel it you can feel it you can see it but
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.920]  here's how the universe works justice justice my friends
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.600]  bends towards those the universe bends towards those that are seeking justice
[39:35.600 --> 39:40.720]  and I forget the exact Martin Luther King quote but you know in the there's a
[39:40.720 --> 39:44.600]  long arc in the universe but the universe bends towards justice we guys
[39:44.600 --> 39:47.640]  pull up the Martin Luther King quote he was paraphrasing someone else about the
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.280]  the universe bends towards justice I want to get that exactly right the point
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.880]  is I've seen this in my life there are powerful forces of evil but for every
[39:55.880 --> 40:00.400]  action there is an equal and opposite reaction and the globalist are master
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.480]  magicians that's what they are they are high priest of manipulation they are
[40:05.480 --> 40:11.120]  Luciferians they are adept they are in tune with their God they have been given
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.920]  knowledge of how the world works but to a point they've not been given the
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.160]  greater deeper knowledge because there is a deception within the system they
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.680]  weave and the reason not knowing history makes you do them to repeat it but
[40:24.680 --> 40:31.240]  knowing history empowers you is because humans live on average there it is the
[40:31.240 --> 40:34.920]  arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice Martin Luther
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.200]  King jr. so the point here that I'm trying to get at is we only live on
[40:40.200 --> 40:47.840]  average 75 years that was the average you know in the Bible and that's what the
[40:47.840 --> 40:51.000]  Bible says you know a man is given this long to live a woman is given this long
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.280]  to live and if you follow these commandments you may live longer but
[40:56.280 --> 41:03.680]  the point is that humans go through the same patterns over and over again it's
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.960]  like certain types of spiders weave a certain type of web and and a scientist
[41:08.960 --> 41:15.520]  that studies insects that studies arachnids they can look and tell you
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.120]  what type of spider it is even though the spider may have been eaten by a
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.800]  bird and isn't there or eaten you know killed by a wasp or a scorpion whatever
[41:23.800 --> 41:28.760]  the case is you can still tell and and and these evil people through history
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.360]  they weave a certain web I mean we know exactly what it is and they've they've
[41:32.360 --> 41:37.400]  now woven the web and I'm going hey guys we don't want to fly into that we
[41:37.400 --> 41:43.560]  want to dismantle that web right now and and then I see all the dependent people
[41:43.560 --> 41:46.640]  go well that's that web is my friend that you know that you know that web and
[41:46.640 --> 41:50.200]  there's some spiders actually weave their web by areas that they know certain
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.160]  bugs are gonna try to go certain plants certain bugs like to eat and then that's
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.240]  kind of what it's like it's like or or or the lantern fish the angler fish with
[41:58.240 --> 42:01.920]  the big lamp in front of its head so the little fish come up to see what that
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.520]  lamp is and then it eats them I mean this is a trap it's not my opinion it's
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.320]  not it's not my view the globalists have written about this they brag about it
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.320]  and and to see people not knowing what's happening and to know we've been
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.160]  deindustrialized and shut down and stripped with corporate welfare offshore
[42:18.160 --> 42:22.200]  to make you in the position where it's hard to live without being on the dole
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.720]  they make it easy I'm not judging you you're a victim to a great extent but if
[42:27.720 --> 42:33.080]  you don't understand folks that it's designed to fully collapse and that
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.800]  your standard of living is getting ready to go way way down and all of you
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.600]  people that have been put on welfare to get us in this position that you're
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.960]  gonna be totally cut off in the final equation I mean Obamacare is there so
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.040]  you don't get treatment and eugenics bioethicist boards on record literally
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.600]  don't give you treatment are you ready for this you people have no idea what
[42:56.600 --> 43:02.880]  you're entering into now let me break it down here here are the articles that
[43:02.880 --> 43:07.840]  are up at info wars.com it is imperative to go get these articles and get them
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.560]  out to everyone you know Ron Paul the founders believed in secession and it's
[43:12.560 --> 43:17.320]  got Ron Paul saying it's as American as George Washington and that's what we
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.080]  were born out of and then at the bottom of it it's got our breakdown talk show
[43:22.080 --> 43:30.280]  host calls for second American revolution that article is cloned at
[43:30.280 --> 43:35.800]  info wars.com why the states must succeed to save America just a just an
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.160]  article with that basic info not having the Ron Paul info in it so it's all
[43:40.160 --> 43:46.160]  focused on a basic boil down of what I'm saying historically has worked is
[43:46.160 --> 43:51.960]  constitutional is based in common law and nature's God and can be executed
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.920]  and let me say this listen to me carefully let me say this to you and
[43:55.920 --> 44:00.040]  listen to me carefully not only must we admit we've been conquered by foreign
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.840]  corrupt corporate crime syndicates calling themselves the new world order
[44:03.840 --> 44:07.880]  and technocrats which means technological dictator they call
[44:07.880 --> 44:11.240]  themselves technological dictators Ron Paul calls them authoritarian
[44:11.240 --> 44:16.320]  psychopaths so do I premeditated that's on Alex Jones and I've said that a
[44:16.320 --> 44:24.200]  thousand times that's Ron Paul this is premeditated takeover those of you that
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.720]  want collectivism must understand it is a collectivism planned economy to
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.960]  carry out eugenics and nightmares just like the Nazis but with a different
[44:33.960 --> 44:40.080]  liberal I think okay much more sophisticated this is what we're
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.240]  facing so first we've been conquered the federal government's illegitimate
[44:45.240 --> 44:48.240]  violating the Bill of Rights Constitution up one side and down the
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.720]  other fast and furious saying our military's under NATO UN control now
[44:52.720 --> 44:57.560]  announcing today that the UN is going to be over the kill switch yeah that's
[44:57.560 --> 45:01.280]  what I've said the federal government's been taken over by the executive and the
[45:01.280 --> 45:06.280]  bureaucracy itself put in power by mega banks and the litmus test to get into the
[45:06.280 --> 45:10.520]  executive in the bureaucracy is to be a globalist they're now signing it over to
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.920]  the North American Union SPP security prosperity partnership which Bush this
[45:15.920 --> 45:20.480]  is in my film in game 2007 Rose Garden said we're merging the North American
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.840]  Union with the European Union did you know that treaty was signed in 2007 the
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.200]  film was done and he gave that press conference and the document was secret
[45:31.200 --> 45:34.640]  but they gave yeah it's secret just like the North American Union agreement
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.280]  signed at Baylor in Waco Texas north of me is secret but later got leaked and
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.960]  says it's a world government folks this is what's so incredible the film was done
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.240]  and I rushed and added that clip in there right as it was coming out even
[45:45.240 --> 45:50.960]  stopped it going to the manufacturer the printer they print them just like paper
[45:50.960 --> 45:58.400]  under those discs stopped it and added that this is incredible proof this is in
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.920]  your face and all you've got to do is go look at it all you've got to do is care
[46:03.920 --> 46:09.040]  enough to research it all you've got to do is get smart about this and informed
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.560]  about this like you are about baseball like you are about acting Christian at
[46:14.560 --> 46:18.600]  your local church and standing around pontificating like a Pharisee how good
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.840]  you are because you don't listen to rock and roll music do you understand what
[46:22.840 --> 46:28.760]  I'm saying here get your mind right get your heart right let me just lay it out
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.080]  here go get these articles they break down how to do it get it out to your
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.400]  state houses get it out to your house members in the federal government the
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.360]  Senate get it to talk show host get it to everybody and we should all have a
[46:42.360 --> 46:50.680]  national debate about what the founders of America July 4th 1776 declaration of
[46:50.680 --> 46:56.360]  independence and then later bill of rights Constitution what they said you
[46:56.360 --> 47:02.360]  were supposed to do because they were geniuses I mean the historians of all
[47:02.360 --> 47:08.440]  marveled at the incredible understanding of these people I mean just all of them
[47:08.440 --> 47:13.360]  towers of intellectual and historical prowess and philosophers and scientists
[47:13.360 --> 47:17.720]  and inventors and true warriors like George Washington who put it all on the
[47:17.720 --> 47:21.200]  line against the greatest empire the world had ever seen and hadn't been
[47:21.200 --> 47:26.160]  defeated what did they say you do it is the right it is the duty when the
[47:26.160 --> 47:29.600]  government becomes destructive and enslave and they list what the government
[47:29.600 --> 47:33.120]  is doing exactly what it's doing now but now it's literally five ten times worse
[47:33.120 --> 47:36.840]  depending on how you look at it conservatively they said the states
[47:36.840 --> 47:44.120]  pull back out and then form a new system well we just have them withdraw point
[47:44.120 --> 47:47.240]  out the federal government's been hijacked on record the globalist brag
[47:47.240 --> 47:50.960]  grand juries can indict people right now who said they've sold us out to
[47:50.960 --> 47:54.440]  globalist they could impeach Obama right now for saying we're under UN control
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.240]  and he's gonna give the kill switch now to the UN that's in the news today I'm
[47:58.240 --> 48:03.160]  gonna get to it I mean the crimes just go on and on foreign assets came in got
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.680]  all their people into both major parties but the Democrats of the vanguard and
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.760]  now they're going to bring in carbon taxes in VAT to completely bankrupt us
[48:12.760 --> 48:16.240]  they know that'll totally put nails in the coffin they'll selectively enforce
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.800]  it to shut down their competition what do we do we go to the state houses and
[48:20.800 --> 48:26.000]  we say start secession not to you know found the new you know the new country
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.280]  born again Texas or born again you know New Hampshire no we pull out as what's
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.760]  all that's left of America and let me tell you get the bully pulpit this is
[48:36.760 --> 48:40.680]  key of the states pointing out we've been hijacked by foreign powers and give
[48:40.680 --> 48:44.080]  us exhibits and state house meetings globalist bragging they've conquered us
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.960]  and show how the EU conquered Europe through fraud the very same group of
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.760]  banks is bragging they've got them into the derivatives signed them on and then
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.680]  you start getting the state leaders together with Congress members Senate
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.840]  members House members governors for the Republican governors are coming out
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.000]  saying oh we're against this because they're globalist who are there to sell
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.920]  us out see well that's fine we get the movement going to elect governors and
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.320]  others where this is the issue and over the next two to three years we move this
[49:13.320 --> 49:17.840]  into place saying we know foreign powers have conquered us that's how they're
[49:17.840 --> 49:21.640]  fighting off the euro in England eighty some percent of their laws get made by
[49:21.640 --> 49:25.600]  the euro now even though they never entered it we've now been signed on to
[49:25.600 --> 49:30.400]  this by treaty so all of this is going on and we have to say this is illegitimate
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.800]  we're not going along with it I mean it's so simple instead they're going oh
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.040]  succession means you know the racist people in Texas don't want to be under
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.880]  this because he's black so they want us to see no we don't want to be under
[49:42.880 --> 49:46.360]  socialist health care we don't want to be under globalism we don't want VAT we
[49:46.360 --> 49:51.920]  don't want carbon taxes we don't want to be shut down so we know what we're
[49:51.920 --> 49:55.760]  going to secede because that's what the Declaration of Independence says
[49:55.760 --> 50:01.240]  secede from whenever the big central power is secede from it and recreate it
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.040]  or do something different if you want oh well we want our republic we're not
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.360]  going to get into this debate about ending America we we're not getting in
[50:08.360 --> 50:11.640]  this debate of its north versus south and the federal government that killed
[50:11.640 --> 50:16.760]  600 something thousand people in that war no no no we're not going to a civil
[50:16.760 --> 50:20.320]  war sure the globalists will probably start one we're saying the states are
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.000]  pulling out to then point out from a position of power because it's the states
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.040]  that created the federal government and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.560]  and the Declaration of Independence that's their first act of the states
[50:32.560 --> 50:39.840]  forming the United States of America 1776 July 4th July 4th July 4th and we
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.720]  get Ron Paul and we get all the other patriot leaders together to lead this
[50:43.720 --> 50:47.680]  charge people will see we're taking action they will see energies being put
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.080]  into this it will give people a focal point to to discredit the federal
[50:52.080 --> 50:57.320]  mafia that's been hijacked and sold out if we don't we're going under bondage
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.720]  not just of a foreign power I'll break it down we have witnessed two terrible
[51:02.720 --> 51:06.880]  storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm the most

[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.280]  it that way I'm not going to go not be and I'm not bragging I'm not going
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.560]  because I'm special they're injecting children with cancer viruses everywhere

[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.440]  business whatever it's a sport it's fun my point is folks we've got to get our
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:32.080]  our priorities straight ladies and gentlemen that's what I'm saying to you
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.760]  I mean if you aren't upset about what's going on if you aren't passionately
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.760]  engaging the globalist there's something wrong with you now if you just joined
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.960]  us I've known this for a long time I knew the way to get away from the
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.160]  globalist with states rights movement not to secede to form new countries but
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.560]  to secede so the state so we can use government institutions because it's in
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.400]  the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution and there's
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.440]  precedent across the world to have the states pull out into the real Republic
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:06.760]  to form the second Republic to restore so there's no debate what do we reupload
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.840]  Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights unaltered but a plan of
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:19.080]  action and the governor says hey military army you're under us boom we are
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.400]  starting and oh Congress you say you want us to back off you'll have hearings
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.440]  about the Federal Reserve running our country and the 47 trillion you've
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.800]  given them to offshore banks last four years oh you're saying you'll back off
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.880]  the minute we start reaching for their throats the minute we again folks you
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.000]  have to believe in yourselves I see people saying oh we could never do this
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.080]  we could never get people to actually do this we could never it's because you
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:52.440]  don't believe in yourself less than 1% of the population actually organize the
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.640]  beginnings of the rebellion against the British Empire the biggest most
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:03.480]  powerful Empire that had wait for it never been defeated and you know why
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.160]  they've never been defeated because there were continuous wars for a thousand
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:15.240]  years before Britain was formed and it was a Viking culture Celtic overall but
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:22.080]  a Viking a Viking war zone for over a thousand years so those people got
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:28.240]  organized into a big empire it was over plus they had incredible states craft
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:37.040]  and manipulation from all the other wars and our forebears said we're taking you
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.520]  on because we're not going to be your slaves you know why because only
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.720]  insiders could operate businesses who were connected to the crown and all
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.760]  these men who have great much greater status and stature in their innate
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.840]  power we're not gonna sit there and be treated as third-class slaves you
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.840]  understand and it's the same thing today it when someone makes money out of an
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.280]  invention out of a book out of literature out of construction on a work I
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:12.560]  admire them I want to be around them you know when somebody is good at sports
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.720]  you admire them just because of the human prowess when somebody's a great
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.280]  rodeo rider you know you admire them because they're an example of humanity
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.440]  I admire that I like strong good people I like being around it okay I've been
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.880]  around New World War people these are hunchback little demons I mean look at
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.200]  look at they had a formula one who's taken over Austin Bernie Eccleston who
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.600]  gave three billion dollars to his two daughters as a gift they own the most
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:43.640]  expensive houses in the U.S. literally paid for by taxpayers money worldwide
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:49.760]  everyone pays for the tracks and then he's tax exempt that makes me so angry I
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.800]  want to throw up and now they've got the army out there running checkpoints on
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.440]  the highway right outside my office
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.840]  and that makes me want to throw up and if you read the letters of George
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.800]  Washington about his businesses and about how he was treated and how he
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.080]  wasn't allowed to operate by a bunch of scum you know that's what this comes
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.160]  down to ladies and gentlemen and I don't like the New World Order I don't like
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.800]  parasites I don't like people that want to break my will and have perverts take
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.680]  my kids to a private room and stick their hands down their pants I recognize
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.520]  how far we've fallen under authoritarian psychopaths who are engaged in a
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:40.000]  premeditated scientific takeover of our country now I'm gonna lay out a battle
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.600]  plan here briefly then I'm gonna give the number out and take your calls on
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:52.240]  this issue but they're gonna try to phrase my call for the second American
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.920]  Revolution a restoration a reboot a kick the New World Order out recognize
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.520]  we've been hijacked literally that's powerful information that they've been
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.840]  arrogant enough to brag in hundreds of publications and on television and at
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.720]  the EU Parliament and at the British Parliament and in our Congress in the
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.280]  article bankers declare US Europe conquered world government now an open
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.680]  secret that you can bring that to state houses you can bring this to grand
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.760]  juries you can bring this to every we just reckoned folks they could kill me
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.680]  for what I'm doing right now I hope you realize that okay and you know what
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.240]  that's a good price to pay I'm not worried about it they probably won't
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.120]  because it'll make me a martyr and energize everything I've done and
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.080]  selfishly I hope it doesn't happen but if it did the point is ladies and
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:45.760]  gentlemen my body doesn't want to die my spirit whatever it takes that gets
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.400]  beyond that because I know these people are hurting innocence I take it
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.320]  personally when leukemia explodes in kids and pediatric cancer is up over 10
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.880]  thousand percent and I know they're doing it with the GMO and the vaccines
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.040]  and I've got the documents where they talked about how they do it I get
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.080]  really upset I have nightmares about that I have such unbelievable hatred of
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.520]  these people it could destroy me do you understand that so I've got to do it for
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:17.040]  love but that's even more painful you got to take it personal and you got to

[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.880]  scientific technocratic control system who all write white papers and books that
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  we've scorched here how they're enslaving us how they're poisoning us
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.640]  how they're gonna get us in compact cities and then start using bio weapons
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.920]  on us so the elite can merge with computers and become gods I'm not
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.280]  saying that's really gonna happen but that's their plan I'm gonna be honest
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.960]  if we just had corrupt groups running things I would be on air criticizing
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.080]  them but I would not be up here you know calling for what they will build as
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.240]  revolution because it is it's time for the second American Revolution
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.280]  America is still here we're just occupied by the globalist and that's a big
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:11.720]  deal to come out with authority to start trying to organize serious people like
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.760]  Lou Rockwell Evan Vieira Bruce Fine Ron Paul many others I mean I'm moving forward
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.960]  with us you know spurring them to getting you to spur them I mean that that's a
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.800]  serious thing to do because ladies and gentlemen the people directing this
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.120]  compartmentalized empire want you and your family dead to the police and
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.440]  military and bureaucrats and code enforcers and all of you get that I
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.280]  think some of you were getting it I understand this sounds crazy tyrants
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:48.760]  are crazy read a history book and I'm begging you I'm begging you for your
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.440]  family's sake if you're a new listener you better go look up eco science by the
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.880]  White House science are saying they're poisoning your water and then go look at
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.480]  how we are being poisoned to sterilize you I mean that's just one exhibit of
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:09.560]  thousands it's so it's like a wall of evil and it's trying to normalize us to
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.120]  torture and evil and pedophilia all over TV now with all these you know
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.960]  toddlers in tiara's and HBO shows were four-year-olds are doing simulated sex
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.600]  acts and wearing shirts saying you know four-year-olds or whores I mean I was
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.920]  gonna do that report last week but couldn't even bring myself to do it and
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.920]  show these images that are on television I mean they are bombarding us to screw
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.880]  us up this is being done cold-bloodedly as Ron Paul said all right I said I'd go
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.440]  to your calls this is short segment long segment coming up as you hear callers
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.520]  hang up you'll be able to call in love to hear from you 800-25-99231 Chris in
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.200]  Florida what's your take on what I've said I'm only stating what the founder
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.280]  said was our proper redress and what made sense do you think I'm getting the
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.240]  word across or do you think that we should all just roll over to the
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.720]  globalist well certainly not we need to keep it as an option on the table but
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.600]  we do have a state no jury nullification and state nullification and
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.040]  counting often city nullification we should strike on every front I came up
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.880]  with a plan to have states and cities nullify the Patriot Act it got
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.760]  codified by folks 800 cities was it 10 states by the end of it yes yes and
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.400]  people say well they didn't have any power no it repudiated it just like the
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.440]  cities have given illegals amnesty oh what that didn't work even though that's
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.880]  unconstitutional we need to do the same thing with constitutional stuff sorry
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.160]  go ahead that's true and we need to have you say inform every one of our options
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.200]  and we have so many viable options to prevent a tyranny from taking over that
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.000]  we haven't exhausted our remedies I would like to invite everybody just
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.360]  quickly to try to fight the water fluoridation effort here in Pinellas
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.800]  County Florida this upcoming I hear you I hear you I'm gonna let you go listening
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.080]  on 1340 when I gave the number out I said five times we're taking calls on
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.480]  the Constitution the Bill of Rights and and what I'm saying about secession to
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.680]  reboot the Republic secession to say the federal government's alien and is it
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.760]  the even the old federal government it's a rogue criminal group to restore it and
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:15.440]  I said please do that for us because we don't screen calls but when it's on a
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.680]  topic it's got to be on that topic sir and yes I know that they're now trying
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.000]  to bring fluoridation back after you kicked it out we covered that this week
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.320]  it's important to fight that but I'm gonna tell you all these other remedies
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.200]  are great we should fight those as well but the big bold stroke of the state
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.920]  standing up and saying usually the UN runs our military we're under UN world
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.320]  government the UN runs the kill switch now they're announcing we've got to say

[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.480]  by keeping it on top is in the 80s there was I mean we talked about social
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:13.400]  engineering and we've been talking about the mind well in course I think could
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:19.000]  be taken from in the 80s that by the government and the military it was
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.680]  called mind wars and what it was is is a social engineering project I don't know
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:30.320]  how to explain it clearly I would no I understand it the Nazis called it mind
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.000]  wars it was adopted under that name they called it info wars for about 20
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.960]  years and that's why you know the name was available so I said there's an
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.160]  info war there's a war on for your mind so yes I get it thank you for the call

[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.800]  continued military cyber offensive Obama signed secret cybersecurity directive
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.680]  national journal Obama signed secret directive to fight cyber attacks it is
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.600]  the cyber security takeover he's heading to an executive order he just made it
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.120]  secret it's Kafka ask we're executing you we're not letting you know why we've

[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.200]  Sunstein call for that at the White House and when I talk you can go look it
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:18.120]  up I'm not making this up it just goes on and on it says you know here the army
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.600]  is now gonna have access to everything they already have access the FBI was
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.160]  already watching Petraeus over a girlfriend without a warrant and then
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.920]  went and got one once they wanted to use the material retroactively I mean
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.280]  folks this is not freedom the government runs Al Qaeda people like how dare Alex
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.040]  said they run Al Qaeda they publicly run them in Libyan Syria but because that's
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.520]  such a no-no Hillary gets up there and says we've got to invade Syria because
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.800]  Al Qaeda is there and I actually hear talk show host attacked me going yeah Alex
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:54.440]  says says the government runs Al Qaeda how dare him we've got to go into Syria
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.080]  because Al Qaeda I mean they won't call Hillary on the fact that it's mainstream
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.280]  news they put Al Qaeda in there I mean it's just it's absurdist it's it's like
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.520]  talking to people that have had lobotomies or something you're not that
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.800]  stupid because those because these guys can sit there and rattle off sports
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.240]  statistics all day and they know how to write a contract they know how to sell
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.560]  stuff I mean I know a lot of people that I know are smart who are willfully
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.680]  minimally lobotomized when it comes to just
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:27.760]  hypocrisy paradoxes you know open fraud it'd be like if it was a pit a thousand
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.360]  foot pit that you'd kill yourself if you fell in it and you're I'm like hey don't
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.440]  go on that pit like it's thousand feet in the right the television told me
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.600]  that's not a pit because it'd be a TV above the pit like that it's not a pit
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.720]  that is on a pit and you drop a rock and don't ever hear at the bottom you go
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.040]  well I don't care because that television is telling me it's not a pit I'm like
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.880]  listen it is a pit I promise you do not like I'm not gonna listen to you
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:56.040]  conspiracy theorist and you just step into it and they fall oh yeah there's
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:04.000]  the headline what new source is that the Western Center for Journalism yeah
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.320]  that's Joseph Farah a surreal Clinton pledges 45 million in aid to Al Qaeda in
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.680]  Syria you can actually go find like times of London saying it in LA times
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.320]  too you can find my Washington Post going well well the CFR two months ago
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.240]  said why we need Al Qaeda that's a quote and how great they are okay I'm done
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.320]  I'll go to your calls it's just I get attacked for saying the globalist front
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:31.400]  Al Qaeda I mean it was in the BBC and AP that the hijackers were trained at US
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.280]  military bases and had top security clearances and the head of one of the
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.080]  bases Colonel Butler went public and said all I know is Muhammad Atta and others
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.880]  trained in my class that's him and they said we're court-martialing you for
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:52.280]  national security issues and he shut up it was in the Sacramento be it was in
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.320]  the Senate Jose Mercury be I mean I just can't live like this anymore I'm not a
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.200]  traitor when it's in the Sunday times of London that they flew tens of thousands
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.160]  of Al Qaeda commanders out and paid them in gold after they staged the Afghan war
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.680]  in 2000 it was all staged our troops weren't fighting anybody they put 12-year-old
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:17.040]  conscripts and foxholes in front of the cities the planes flew over and blew up
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.720]  the kids arrested some of them put them in prison camps ten years later they're
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.760]  used as Al Qaeda double agents now I mean I just can't live like this anymore I
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.320]  can't live in this fantasy land anymore
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.440]  man it drives me crazy let's go ahead and talk to Ken in South Carolina sir

[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.280]  and many others out there and our friends in in the real media the the true
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.720]  media not the state-run media like drudge drudgerport.com I mean what
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.120]  is what is your take on what I've been saying sir well Alex all I want to talk
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.320]  about is the session good talking about it for years and people didn't want to
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.080]  listen but I'm from South Carolina and we got blamed for the last double war
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.200]  which we didn't start but I'd like to give a little background and issue a
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.440]  challenge because I want to do what you did and sign the Declaration of
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:16.640]  Independence on your show thank you sir go ahead the enemy knows who we are we
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.200]  got a lot of Christians and and a lot of patriots in South Carolina from the
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.960]  Tea Party movement that we work with hunkering down but the Antichrist the
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.640]  New World Order the enemies of America they already know who you are so my name
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.200]  is Ken Moran I'm in Georgetown County South Carolina come and get me New World
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:39.640]  Order come and get me enemies of America I don't care well you know you know you
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:43.280]  know they try to spin the Texas Revolution when about 37 percent according
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.440]  to the dollars Republic of Texas and history were Hispanics Guatemala which
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:51.880]  was Mexico revolted against Santa Ana he was such a dictator Texas revolted my
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:56.080]  ancestors revolted he had Mexican land grants on my mother and father's side
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.480]  some in Central Texas others in East Texas but the heirs family and others
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.240]  and the Greshams the Hammons all of them over right here in Texas and the
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:12.160]  Joneses the Johnson's the Browns and others in East Texas but the point is
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.280]  is that they cut the media says it's racist that's why Texas seceded and
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.720]  they say the same thing well no 1776 the British government came to take
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.800]  lawful guns from the citizens and and they and they didn't turn them in so the
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:28.520]  Brits started shooting their their fellow citizens so the war started
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.600]  Gonzales Texas they said we were coming to confiscate your guns and Gonzales
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.720]  that's the come-and-take-it flag and people don't know you see it all over
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.440]  the country that's that's that's just outside Austin's Gonzales where my
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.080]  mother's family's from and right out there with the Hispanic they were called
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.440]  to Hanos and they said hey I like the idea to be able to have guns if Santa
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.280]  Ana wants to take them and they stood right there with the white settlers a
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.840]  lot of them all intermarried so you get to Hano music and the rest of it
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:57.840]  everybody was getting along until later when the government started up but the
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.440]  point is you're absolutely right and then they and they came and they had a
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.440]  big shootout with the Mexican trips there was a gun confiscation in North
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:11.160]  Texas with the Colonel Travis before he was even made Colonel he got in a big
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.720]  gun battle with folks trying to confiscate guns Mexican trips and a and a
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.520]  Texian trader Colonel who was working for Santa Ana so at first Santa Ana had a
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.200]  bunch of other Texans it wasn't just all the Texans got up all the Hispanic and
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.000]  all the Anglo Texans got up and said oh we're gonna we're gonna fight Santa Ana
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.640]  there was mainly whites fighting whites but that was it was it was in fact there
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.560]  were no Hispanics with that particular Colonel you look up the history they
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.600]  came in against a group of whites and Hispanics and said we're we're taking
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.920]  your guns and there was a big shootout and they beat them and they said okay
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.200]  Travis you're a Colonel Travis said I'm okay where do I go you go to the Alamo
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.800]  and he went and left his son with my family and the rest is history but the
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.120]  point is looking at all of this is that that's what it's about it's like hey
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.040]  come and take it I am here my name is Alex Jones and and and I'm gonna let you
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.080]  finish up and put him on hold I want to show people a document cam shot right

[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.240]  Declaration of Independence is our God-given authority as it states there
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.640]  to say our government's become destructive it's been hijacked they
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:56.680]  brag it's been hijacked I want our Republic back and I'm demanding our
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:01.080]  Republic back and the best venue is the states to pull out and say we're

[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.280]  this is a revolutionary idea and I have top scholars on they go yes you're right
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.080]  this is a great plan you understand because it's how it's presented they're
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.960]  gonna present it as it's a civil war no it's not we're kicking the global
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.400]  astound and then these cowards see because they can't see someone do
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:21.320]  something real they can't see someone because then they might have to do
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.760]  something real it's better to just sit back as an armchair I love people that
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.320]  call me up because we ought to get violent you need to lead it really if

[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.840]  and trying to discourage them it's unbelievable I signed it it was symbolic
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.720]  and I told listeners you should sign it symbolically it means something it's a
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.960]  pledge to resist this the globalist collectivist takeover is a eugenics
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.640]  kill grid even if you're for socialism this collective is globalist model is a
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:24.640]  eugenics based extermination grid that's in their own words man don't you

[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.360]  in this state and other states hunkering down but what they don't
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:55.960]  understand with this the sessionist movement this is the breach in the wall
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.680]  we've been waiting for I've been teaching notification and succession
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.200]  threats in my spirit not just in my intellect I know this is it if the

[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.160]  colors are in the breach of that wall and all we need is the army to come in

[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.520]  need to get out there on the internet now and I want to issue a challenge
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.440]  forget the divisive lines I was in a tea party when they tried to divide and
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.400]  conquer Occupy Wall Street and they told us there were different sides and I
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.720]  kept telling them it's bull we all want the same thing we want to end of
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.600]  corruption and we want freedom in America tea party quit buying the lies
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:52.160]  ghetto out of the GOP shield group business of getting people elected and
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.040]  get there with Occupy Wall Street and every other American that is sick and

[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.640]  day their entire battle plan behind the scenes we reverse engineered it is to
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.480]  stop state secession and restoring the Republic because they know that's the
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.320]  rightful most powerful course their entire defense is set around it because
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.680]  that's the weak point and that's why they're telling people they've told Lou

[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:36.920]  information he was able to derail an agenda 21 takeover in the mid-90s and
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:41.520]  we're watching on C-SPAN and just because he got their own documents got the
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:49.760]  maps to Congress and that information beat it now it's openly being announced
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:52.760]  but they've got Republicans running around saying agenda 21 doesn't exist
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:57.400]  Aaron Dice is going to pop in later with this trying to hoax us into standing
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:04.040]  down they are weak agenda 21 is their global treaty for total eugenics Dr.
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.960]  Kauffman's coming up will continue with your calls as well he's in my film in
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:12.400]  game blueprint for global enslavement almost seven years old hard to believe
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:19.280]  that we see let me see 2006 2007 it's five six years old the point is it's
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.840]  evergreen it's more important today than ever or behind the green mask Rosa
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.360]  Corey the book on agenda 21 to get out to your friends and family and neighbors
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.480]  and people in government it's happening we're beginning to win let's just go
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:35.680]  ahead and go back to the calls right now John in Texas what's your take on all
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:42.000]  this sir Alex yes sir can you hear me okay buddy I can hear you it was
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:50.120]  wonderfully okay great I love what you're doing it it it I think it's great
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:58.240]  for damage control but I see a better solution for an ultimate solution it's
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.400]  like you know about Plato's cave a lot of you don't realize there are more
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.960]  levels of in Plato's cave and many people find out there's a fox garden a
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:11.520]  hen house and they think the solution as well let's get rid of the fox and
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.800]  that's the damage control I agree we do have to look the session movement is
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.440]  something people can get it's in the Declaration of Independence to restore
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:25.760]  the Republic non-violently we will scare the globalist any believe me it's
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:31.120]  it's the way to go this is how I look at it you asked earlier about who the
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.480]  enemy is and what most people don't realize is that we are the enemy and
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:39.160]  that the globalist our reflection of us no that's right Ron Paul said we have
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:42.520]  become immoral and decadent and that's why the worst the worst is running
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:46.240]  things exactly so the solution to get rid of the worst of the worst of us is
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:49.200]  for all of us to become better than what we are and most of us aren't even
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:53.440]  coming close and this ties into the research that dr. Fritz Albert pop has
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.960]  done in Germany in 1976 he identified the nutrient that ties into our spidey
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:03.600]  sense he called it a bio photon and he said we humans are born at 43,000 bio
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.800]  photons but most of us around 1,000 to 23,000 bio photons and we should be
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.320]  around 83,000 bio photons so the ultimate solution the way to destroy the
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.320]  globalist is for all of us to bump up our bio photon levels bump up our
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.360]  spidey sense up to the 83,000 bio photon level we got to stop making mistakes
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.280]  so yes we have to do damage control yes we got to see is this the professional
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:31.320]  athlete sports medicine guy you met me down in Houston but that was my buddy
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.920]  you confuse me with with with my friend now the point is yeah he's like to the
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.360]  bed that guy's well-known yeah I know he did this is what the professional
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.480]  athletes are doing well you know I don't take it because I don't need to I've
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:48.760]  got plenty of this the spiritual mojo juice but they put people up when
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.280]  they're on DMT and it's definitely a spiritual experience and they're
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.680]  finding people all cultures are basically having the Christian experience
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:00.120]  they even done it with villagers I don't even know about Christianity of the
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.360]  pearly gates you know the all that stuff and and and that's why that's why the
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.160]  system doesn't want people trying natural hallucinogens because it's
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:13.240]  definitely opening people up and realizing whoa there's something else
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:18.440]  out there it opens up the sixth sense but you know we've naturally got those
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.000]  chemicals in us and the sodium fluoride all of that but I mean when you
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.200]  about bio photons what type of nutrients you're talking about to naturally
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.360]  boost those without taking a very hardcore hallucinogen
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.240]  Dr. Popps said and this has opened to a state of hallucinogens Dr. Popps said that
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.320]  organic produce has five times the bio photons as those conventional
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.800]  sure well that's why they feed his trash yeah we're back the same thing now
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:45.600]  pure water pure food opens you up to God the universe your discernment they
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:50.960]  poison you it creates a fog overlay but I'll tell you folks God believes in free
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:57.120]  will Jesus Christ believes in free will but I'm at the church is Jesus Christ the
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.240]  real one ask God and God will come in millions of people are going to get

[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.800]  out saying look at this state rep look at this congressman or woman they say
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:16.000]  there's a UN takeover agenda 21 why that's crazy that doesn't exist while I
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.200]  can go to any town around Austin to any city council meeting and you've seen me
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:26.080]  send reporters to four towns and they've got UN representatives there having the
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.160]  town sign over their liberties in exchange for in some cases 30 million
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.600]  dollars for a small town from the HUD in the federal government and I mean it's
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:40.520]  it and it's to put in laws were two years in jail if you wash your car six
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:45.160]  years in San Diego you got hay dust $2,000 a
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.680]  fines I mean we're not talking about just federal we're talking about
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.240]  internationalists coming in and getting you to adopt their stuff I mean I don't
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:57.720]  have to go to Europe to see this I don't have to go to Russia I can go to the
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:03.280]  Austin Texas where I live or any town around me any night of the week at city
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.960]  meetings and its UN Rockefeller Foundation operatives folks I made the
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:14.920]  first agenda 21 film out there in 1997 it's called America destroyed by design
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.360]  the UN plan to take over and bankrupt America and create a neo feudalistic
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:24.320]  state read the back cover and guess whose information is in the film
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.440]  Dr. Michael Kaufman guess who went to Congress was it 94 they were about to
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.960]  sign on right as Bush had left office he had he had endorsed it the Rio summit
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.120]  agenda 21 and a lot of times they can blindside you and they would have got
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:44.600]  it all in right then boom Congress saw the maps checked with the UN half the
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.800]  country off limits they said no way Jose put us under a UN treaty so they went
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.400]  ahead and unionized went after county cities and states as an in-run now
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:00.680]  Obama can't get Congress to pass shut down half the coal plants well yeah and
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:03.400]  guys kind of center that little bit if we're gonna put articles up it's
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.000]  absolutely essential that that we somehow center them when we put them up
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.280]  that's like my one pet peeve that just drives me up and down the wall that that
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:17.240]  we're gonna put stuff on TV I just never I just don't even want to have
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:22.520]  something on TV just take it down okay nobody's bad just just we're not gonna
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.880]  show it if we can't put it on there I'm directing live here on the air thank you
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:29.760]  not a big deal just can't but cut the thing cut off we're just not putting it
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:35.880]  up that's like 87,000 times I want to stop that the point here is that we're
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.680]  not calling for secession from America the states have to pull out because the
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:45.600]  federal government's totally run by globalist and we have to get in there
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:53.000]  and we have to point out what's happened and they're freaking out they are
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.120]  freaking out right now at every level and Aaron's gonna come in here and pop
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.680]  in well Dr. Copman's on with us and show these articles saying oh my gosh
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.400]  citizens are going and giving books and videos to their state reps and they're
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:09.640]  waking up and the states are saying no yeah they're giving them in-game they're
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:14.840]  giving them Rosa Corey's book that we sell it info wars.com the film I made the
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.360]  book I carry and it's freaking them out because as soon as the state reps or
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:23.600]  county commissioners or mayors read this they go yeah this is exactly what
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.080]  they are oh yeah that group that is here is you in what that's what this is
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:32.960]  wow I'm not gonna go along with this they're pulling their hair out so Dr.
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.040]  Michael Kaufman joins us because talk about a voice in the wilderness sir great

[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:16.080]  back in the 19 early 1990s I was leading a multi-million dollar research effort on
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:21.040]  global warming contacting and working with scientists all over the world and
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:27.360]  it became pretty obvious to me that by 1992 that actually in the early 1990s
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.600]  that man probably wasn't causing global warming we have now overwhelming
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.200]  evidence that man is not causing global warming and that's why I
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.760]  think they're ramping up this hype and scare story that we you know hurricane
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:46.040]  Sandy was caused by global warming and so forth but nonetheless at that
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.080]  particular point in time I was also following what was going on in an
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:53.480]  organization called the IUC and the International Union for the Conservation
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.040]  of Nature now some of you probably know this because you've heard me before
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:01.600]  but most of our international treaties are written by the IUC and the
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.920]  International Union for the Conservation of Nature the Convention on
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.760]  Biological Diversity is one of those and at the same time there was another
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.760]  project called the Wildlands Project which was basically also coming out of
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.720]  the United Nations the Wildlands Project called for setting aside 50% of
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:25.320]  the United States into wilderness as you suggested just a few minutes ago and
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.440]  the same people that were writing this this particular project the Wildlands
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:34.640]  Project were also writing the Convention on Biological Diversity and it
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:37.560]  didn't take a rocket scientist for me to realize that they're one of the same
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.720]  things and when the treaty finally came out all the language was there it was
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:45.920]  really sanitized you couldn't really see it it sounded like motherhood and
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:50.600]  apple pie but when the Global Biodiversity Assessment was published
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:55.040]  I was actually written by the IUCN and the World Resources Institute when that
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.560]  was published by the UN it was basically referred back to the Wildlands
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.320]  Project and named the authors and so forth and doing that I had been in
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:10.640]  August of 1994 down to the Senate trying to convince them that this was the
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:15.120]  Wildlands Project wasn't the heart of the convention or the treaty they
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.920]  ignored me because it didn't say anything in the treaty about it when the
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:23.640]  Global Biodiversity Assessment came out a month or two later it was still in
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:26.920]  draft form we didn't have the actual copy that wasn't going to be published
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:32.920]  until the end of 1994 but we had the draft copy in it specifically said the
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:38.280]  Wildlands Project it was a smoking gun I had been doing actually drawing maps
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.960]  for two years I don't know why I was drawing them I just really felt compelled
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:46.880]  by God to do it I didn't have any idea why it was a lot of work but nonetheless
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.560]  I did and when that treaty when the draft of the GPA came out I sent it down
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.520]  FedEx to down to the US Senate along with a map there was actually a couple of
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:02.120]  us working on it at the time and that map was blown up into a four by six foot
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.760]  poster taken out of the Senate floor at three o'clock in the afternoon the the
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:11.320]  closure vote was scheduled for four o'clock on September 29th and it just
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.720]  literally died on the fine Mitchell Senator Mitchell the majority leader at
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:18.360]  the time just took it right off the exited calendar was never voted on but
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:23.480]  that's how close we came to having this actually passed and ratified by the
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:29.840]  Senate and as you said very accurately this now the marching orders of the US
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:33.680]  government and every federal agency through a document called Sustainable
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:37.920]  America which if you look it up on the internet was written by Bill Clinton
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:43.200]  during his presidency and his whole purpose is to implement agenda 21 and
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:49.920]  every federal contract and grants and aid and all the rest is targeted towards
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:56.000]  Sustainable America and agenda 21 is being implemented as we speak and by the
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.240]  way we've taken these to agenda 21 meetings and smart road conferences we've
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.840]  taken to professors and they've said yeah this is you can now look at this map
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:08.760]  16 17 years later because that's what you have a degree in as you know putting
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:11.840]  these together I've done even for the Forest Service I know previously and they
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:16.040]  go yeah no that's what we're doing yeah that's the corridors yes this is how
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:20.000]  did you get this and we were at UT and they had similar maps we were trying to
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.240]  videotape at the professor to let them in but then somebody else came out and
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:27.640]  said no you can't tape that but what's incredible is this we now see where
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.440]  they're grabbing land it's everywhere where you predicted how did you put
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.800]  together I guess that's what you you're a that that's what you got all your
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:38.600]  training in but how did you do it so accurately well they actually came out
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.720]  with a set of instructions to how to do it with a wildland project and I took
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.600]  those instructions and I had actually done research and actually worked in
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:51.920]  most ecosystems in the United States by that time and I was able to with my
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:55.920]  background and so forth and understanding of ecosystems pretty much
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:59.920]  anticipate where they would put these reserves these wilderness reserves and
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.600]  wilderness corridors and it turns out that I'm about 80 85 percent accurate
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.800]  there's a little difference when you actually get down to what they're
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:13.000]  actually doing today but not a whole lot yeah you can look at the smart growth
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.800]  corridors they've set up and it's they're also putting triangles and boxes
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:20.600]  around city groups and trying to grab the property there so now they're even
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:23.600]  targeting the green areas that originally they weren't gonna try to take
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:27.680]  that's correct it's really a astonishing thing they're doing it
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:32.680]  incrementally if they had the treaty actually ratified back in 1994 they
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:37.120]  would have all the legal reasons necessary to condemn by imminent domain
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:41.400]  all of your property when it's in the way or where it's one of those chosen areas
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.360]  be put in the wilderness yank you off destroy your home and convert it back
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:48.240]  to wilderness that would have allowed that treaty would have allowed that to
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.520]  happen now they're having to do it incrementally and they're still trying
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:55.120]  to do it you know the second case up and up northern Idaho I think you probably
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.880]  all have heard of that one yeah taking people's property because there's a
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:02.600]  puddle in the yard we'll be right back with Dr. Goblin I don't mean to be nosy
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:07.160]  but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming disaster and
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:11.840]  may not survive without as you already know something big is about to hit the
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:16.200]  US and you have got to be prepared did you know that your local grocery store
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:20.320]  only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand so if there's any interruption in
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:24.360]  our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis then the three-day
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.000]  supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in minutes and
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.160]  you and your family could be in serious trouble that's why my friend just

[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:29.160]  declaration of war against private property and against liberty for the
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:36.280]  general public by the mega rich in 1992 it's dr. Michael Kaufman PhD
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:41.200]  environmental scientist and there have been a lot of others that have fought it
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:44.920]  as well Lord Monkton and many others myself I've been fighting since 1996
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:50.320]  against this what's amazing and I've got Aaron popping in here in about 15
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:53.760]  minutes is we're finding reports all over the country where they go there's
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:59.560]  crazy people that think the UN is trying to run us I mean for 17 years most
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:03.720]  our national parks and monuments have been under UN control with huge buffer
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.560]  zones around them where people can't use their own property under UN treaty in
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:13.520]  ESCO I mean we're the Obama isn't assigned a secret order but the UN's
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:17.480]  bragging it's giving them the codes for the internet kill switch and the IP
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:24.000]  addresses that's in mainstream news today we've been told our military is
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.560]  under NATO in the UN Ron Paul and his speech said we're under global
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:31.480]  government but they still try this game where the Southern Prairie Law Center and
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.320]  others say they stuck at the training manuals cops get because they laugh and
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:39.320]  send them to me and we know we're laughing but it's not funny that they
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:42.520]  go there's no such thing as the New World Order the Federal Reserve is not
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:46.680]  private there is no plan to implode the economy there is no plan for you know
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:50.840]  this and that when it's all happening on the news how long can they get away
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:54.080]  with this or are they just trying to con those they know are ignorant dr.
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:58.120]  Kaufman I think in many respects they're conning those who are ignorant and it's
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:03.000]  in some ways I think the election that we just had a couple weeks ago really
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.320]  clearly shows how ignorant this society truly is it's not that people are dumb
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.680]  or stupid they're not but when you only get one side of the story with was
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:17.960]  whole terribly biased media I mean it's no longer the media as the media as the
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.760]  ministry of propaganda for Obama there's no other way you can describe it when
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:28.000]  you have a media that deliberately distorts the news and not tells you
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.160]  both sides of a story you get an ignorant society that cannot ever act
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:37.640]  intelligently because they don't have the proper information and what we're
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.680]  seeing right now is that in spades that's what really decided this election
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:45.400]  probably more than anything else is almost a hundred years of brainwashing
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:50.920]  in our public schools to produce a society basically that believes the
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:55.280]  government is a good thing and it can be if it's got the right constraints on it
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:59.520]  or and the fact that socialism is something to be desired rather than
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:04.080]  then avoided all of the things that you and I and others have talked about on
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:09.960]  your show over the years that has really degraded their ability for critical
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.840]  thinking and and therefore ability to make right decisions under Cobbin you've
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.480]  hit the heart of it here I don't when I watch MSNBC to monitor what they're up
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:21.320]  to they're trying to create racial division all the rest of it they
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:25.960]  giggle and snicker most the time in a self admiration society about how smart
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.840]  they are but how dumb all of us are but I understand now that's because they're
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:34.080]  preying on people I've run into these folks these are predators I mean they
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.040]  don't believe anything they're saying they know it's a fraud but for those of
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:43.520]  us that are informed who aren't evil it's horrifying people are so dumb down
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:50.680]  but but but the system revels in the fact that that it's it's like two
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:54.360]  different species people that are informed versus dumb down idiots who
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.320]  aren't even so much done that you know that they don't even know how to think
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:01.880]  they have no gauge on even what's happening how do you deal with something
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:06.680]  like that when you've got people that literally you know couldn't work at
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:12.280]  McDonald's now voting to to try to take our guns you know so it's a really good
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:15.120]  question and that's something I've been hitting my wall head against the wall
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:19.880]  for quite a few years and I know you have to how do you come across to these
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.640]  people who don't have the basic understanding to even begin to understand
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:29.680]  what you're talking about it takes many many hours to even make a
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:33.960]  presentation of what a constitutional republic should be and why it's so
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:38.920]  critically important and they just they have no clue they have no clue to even
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:42.760]  begin to understand what you're talking about and I don't know how to come up
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:48.960]  how to really change that unless you really show how this is destroying us
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:53.400]  and this is what I've been trying to do with my new book plunder how the
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.920]  progressive ideology is destroying America it basically goes into the
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:04.040]  progressive ideology back a hundred and over a hundred years 125 years and shows
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:08.880]  you how nothing has changed in that period of time how psychiatrists of the
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:13.760]  early days and 1800s were calling these progressives nuts because they cannot
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:19.000]  connect to reality and they're still the same exactly the same of really what
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.680]  they are is their social failures that get together in gangs I've been read
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.080]  your book I know what's gonna be about cuz I know we're on the same page I'm
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:28.960]  gonna carry it by the way I want to read it first but people should get at your
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.800]  site but but let's talk about their psychology because they're gangs of like
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.840]  wimps but I don't mean physically wimping I mean these are mentally ill
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:43.360]  people but they form like these swarms of locusts that are smart enough to be
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:47.280]  able to blacken the earth and eat the flesh off our economy's bones we'll be

[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:04.760]  by the way we broke this news story thanks to David Knight one of our
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:08.680]  reporters the Environmental Protection Agency a court has ruled that they're
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:12.280]  above the law and that they must investigate themselves but the office
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:17.200]  of Inspector General has begun an investigation of the EPA pumping deadly
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.560]  gases in on people without them knowing it just another ongoing potentially
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:28.600]  lethal experiment government's doing on you this is a group of insane inbred
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:33.960]  eugenicist there was a breeding program by the Darwin family the Huxley's the
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:39.320]  Wedgewood's and two other families that we cover it in game that produced near
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.840]  90 percent retardation or stillborn there was about five six percent that
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:48.520]  were highly intelligent even above their genius families but also generally
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:54.240]  raving psychotics Aldous Huxley was one of the few survivors his brother Julian
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:58.360]  Huxley started the UN UNESCO program that runs all this today they were
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.720]  talking about the planned society back in 1932 when he wrote brave new world
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:05.800]  what you said was their real theorized plan that was adopted by the British
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:09.080]  royalty the Dutch royalty you know about the Nazis in the Kaiser Wilhelm
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.240]  Institute so you got a bunch of really smart scientists who were control
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:18.600]  freaks who enter breed they create this monster plan it gets adopted because the
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:22.120]  robber barons in the US liked it to Rockefeller's Rothschild they all
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.560]  funded it go look it up they funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute the Rothschild
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.240]  the Rockefellers did and it created this nightmare and Dr. Cobb in his deep
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.960]  research getting to different angles of this but he covers in the in-game extras
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.480]  you know university plans he shows the documents where they said in the 60s we'll
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:40.880]  put drugs on the street and get everybody on drugs we'll use entertainment
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:46.320]  just to get people in this mind-numbed area and then once you're mind-numbed then
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:51.280]  they can start the soft kill culling so see everybody needs to understand just
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.040]  all this decadence and welfare is not going to keep going on they're just
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:58.680]  breaking you and making you a bunch of pathetic jellyfish why is there number
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.560]  one enemy the returning veterans in the homeland security training documents if
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:05.640]  your new listener just type in homeland security says number one terror threat
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:11.440]  veterans you'll get AP Reuters you know Washington Times we we broke that when a
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:15.160]  federal marshal and state police gave me a separate document out of Missouri but
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:22.760]  the point is that that that they say that they that the veterans are who they're
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:26.840]  going to round up so while you're out there saluted veterans parades remember
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.160]  our government's now run by globalist dr. Cobin finish up with the mindset of
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:35.320]  these people from your research and then I want to talk about the fact that I
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:39.480]  know in the Declaration of Independence we have the power to secede but not to
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:44.920]  we could create a new union or a new country but I say secede from the
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:48.520]  occupied federal government to get their attention and then kick them out
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.280]  you know the globalist the Federal Reserve and reconstituted just that
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.520]  process of the state's beginning this will create the moral high ground and
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:01.920]  will create a fulcrum or focus bases to then launch out because we're under an
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.000]  attack we would know more half measures we either go all the way whole hog and
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.360]  call this out like Ron Paul did two days ago and it's very well or it's over
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.880]  because they are bum rushing us we we are under a Tet offensive right now they
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:18.720]  are overrunning us and and and we've got a zombified public a lot of us are
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:23.360]  awake but it's 20 30 percent of us are awake then you got the zombies and then
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:26.840]  of the 20 30 percent we've got they're going oh I'm glad Ron Paul or Dr.
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.240]  Kaufman's there no we need you to get involved but but finish up with their
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:35.920]  mindset and then ideas you've got to try to just beat these people well you
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.960]  know it's one of the things that I really was into a state of shock over
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.600]  when I got a hold of some of these early reports and books and so forth of
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:49.400]  psychiatrists now psychiatry is just a beginning to take hold back in the
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.680]  1800 that's their priesthood yeah well it is but these psychiatrists were real
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:59.160]  psychiatrists there's still some today although most of them were out in the
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:04.440]  in the twilight zone they wanted what they found was basically he described it
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:09.240]  to a T describe the modern-day progressing that's in Congress it's in
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:13.800]  our our court systems that are in our educational systems all of these things
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:20.720]  are described to a T in the 1800s how they literally cannot connect to reality
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:27.360]  they're excuse me quite a few cards short of a full deck and because of that
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:33.840]  they have these utopian concepts that will never ever work and I've read
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:37.520]  some of that they just are obsessed control freaks and the reason those
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.160]  psychiatrists wrote books about it was because they were working next to the
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:47.360]  communist or the proto-communist psychiatrist yes well they could see it I
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.120]  mean it was very definitely very obvious as what led to the socialism
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.400]  socialist Europe that we have today communism all of these things derived
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:02.240]  from that particular phenomenon back in the 1800s really goes back to Jean-Jacques
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:07.080]  Rousseau but nonetheless by the time the French Revolution was over and so forth
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:12.240]  it was pretty well in the in the in died in contact and the concrete it's
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.840]  government by psychopathic authoritarians as Ron Hall has dubbed them yet it
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:21.720]  really is and as you're not being over exaggeration when you say that either
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:25.800]  because they really now a lot of these people know exactly what they're doing
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:31.920]  Obama for instance knows exactly what he's doing he's lying basically he has
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:36.960]  no problem at all he's a sociopath he's a he basically is a pathological
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:41.080]  liar and they just rolls right off his tongue I mean we saw time after time
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.880]  after time in the debates where he would be stand up there and absolute truth
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:51.200]  and defy anyone to deny him when we know for absolute fact that he was totally
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:57.280]  wrong and that he was actually the for instance energy energy he has tried
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:02.160]  everything he can to stop said I will bankrupt Cole and then it's up in there
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:05.840]  and says I never said that and we can play the video clip right now I know he
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:10.480]  says just astonishing how he can do that time after time Benghazi another
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:15.640]  classic example his interview or his press conference he said I he said I
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:19.680]  said it was terrorism day one and when he didn't I mean it's all now come out
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:23.480]  that Patras was given talking points by the White House and said do not say it's
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:27.320]  terrorism but we saw his ambassador all over the news saying that no that's what
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.840]  I'm saying it's like but the thing is they know they're trying to give the
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:35.760]  general public the amassment illness because once you get the public to
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.280]  accept lies it fouls the brain electrochemical computer as you know
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:45.280]  we're then people just lose track of everything they do and everything is
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:49.160]  based on emotion this is the critical thing I think more than anything else
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:54.920]  is that they base all their decisions on emotion and emotion if you continue to
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.320]  follow your motions you're gonna fall off a cliff and we are falling off a
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:04.360]  cliff now because we are no neverland we cannot continue to sustain the the
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.560]  types of deficits I mean we're being maneuvered into bankruptcy as the
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:12.920]  globalist said but but but expanding on that I run into this all the time people
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.480]  call in and they go you don't like Obama you're a racist and I and I talked to
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:19.960]  him these are real people and I'm like I'm not saying Romney's good either but
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:25.280]  Obama is going to accelerate the program collectivism's horrible socialism
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:29.120]  doesn't work communism doesn't work and he's taking our liberties and they just
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.480]  go no you're a racist and it's like and then they giggle like they know
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:37.200]  political correctness is a weapon it doesn't matter even if they know it's
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:42.600]  not true it makes them feel like they have social status yes it makes them
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:47.640]  fun and they notice this back in the 1800 it makes them feel powerful and they're
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:52.080]  they're sick they just they should not be in any elected position they should
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:58.160]  not be in any educational position in a judicial place and yet they dominate
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:03.280]  those particular pillars of our society and we are in a heap of trouble and what
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:08.360]  I don't understand and just get my boggles my mind Europe is collapsing now
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.080]  not much is shown on the evening news I go into the great detail in the book
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.800]  plundered but not much is shown on the evening news but Europe is doomed there
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:21.240]  is really I think they had something like 50 fires yesterday and rioting
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:27.040]  everywhere just all over Europe just bedlam yes it is horrible and that's
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.520]  the result it's always the result there is no case in history now this is
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:36.600]  Jacobin French Revolution Illuminati crap it is it really is and as soon as you
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:42.000]  understand that you understand why I got a read plundered because I've read your
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.120]  other books so send us a copy you probably did I'm gonna get welded to
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:48.680]  carry it in the store because because it's so amazing that I've even read your
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:51.680]  book but I know it's gonna be in it because it's history but but but I
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.000]  always learn something new and refresh my memory but when you discover that
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.440]  communism is Jacobin devil worship yes I mean and it's in mainline history books
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:07.000]  it's French devil worshipers German devil worshipers that have that that
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.520]  wanted to go to a nine-day week no family they were gonna destroy language
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.360]  they were gonna go back to the wilds and it just turned out they were a bunch
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.280]  of psychopaths they really were the Jacobin's and during the French
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:25.280]  Revolution the horror I mean we think the World War I and World War II were
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.800]  horrible and they were I don't know diminished that but the French
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:34.960]  Revolution was inhuman literally inhuman not as many people were killed
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:39.840]  but how they were killed was inhuman pulling them apart with horses anybody
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:44.640]  that disagreed with you I mean it was absolutely giant hordes of of
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.840]  Illuminati that that's mainline history folks running around raping killing
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:53.460]  burning cities just foaming it and then the more and more evil to get in
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:58.320]  control and it just ran rampant until Napoleon came in until the point and
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.600]  then you had a totalitarian dictator which was the plan along yeah I think it
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:06.440]  really was and I think that's what we're seeing now with Obama I don't I don't
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:09.960]  house you can explain it because he is going to take us right over the cliff
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:16.760]  and basically create chaos and out of chaos will come into our time let me

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:58.480]  news we can stop this I want to bring Aaron Dykes in and then get your take
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:02.360]  on it Aaron one of our researchers literally hundreds of articles newscast
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.320]  where they're saying now there is no such thing as Gen 21 even though they're
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:09.680]  officially have their operatives and they're demonizing people and they're
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:16.600]  panicking as you saw in the New York Times Dr. Kaufman Aaron break down these
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.880]  articles for folks we'll show people a document cam shot yeah at first I just
[02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:23.120]  want to thank Dr. Kaufman and all the people who've been behind this issue
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.080]  for decades people like Merkula who brought prop 37 to the forefront
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:31.000]  everybody who's out there working and now it's all these activists approaching
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.880]  their state representatives their state governments and actually getting them to
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:39.320]  have meetings and the system's freaking out there's this whole flame war in
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:43.400]  Georgia and it's the exact stuff you're talking about with the secession
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.720]  movement with the state's rights movement the agenda 21 stuff just
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.640]  overlays with that and they're all upset because a Tea Party activist who got
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:56.000]  kicked out of his Tea Party group for spreading Alex Jones and Info Wars
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.480]  information got a meeting with the Senate majority leader Chip Rogers and
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:04.000]  now they're saying the video from that is exposed where he's talking about
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.280]  agenda 21 being a big problem and they're trying to hoax it that ooh look
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:15.000]  we we found a video of the of the congressmen or the state rep being bad
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:19.400]  like he talked about poo poo I mean I hate to talk like that but that's what
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:23.800]  it's like oh my gosh racism oh no it's exactly what you're talking about
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:27.360]  obviously your comments yesterday about secession we're not in a vacuum it's oh
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:31.560]  it's Georgia so it's the Deep South it's racist it's conspiracy coops it's
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:35.400]  Alex Jones talk and they're mad because they invited the whole Republican
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:40.160]  caucus and a lot of them actually went and this is no no no because because
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.600]  they've got their UN paid operatives we can go in and show them the article with
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:47.640]  all the video links in a 20-minute meeting with one of these guys here's
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:51.000]  Herman von Roopee head of the EU here's the head of the ECB they say they've
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.400]  conquered us here they are on CNBC here's the documents here's the plan and
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.720]  you win because it's over it's over when we expose them show they've ruined
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:02.600]  themselves they're doing that media matters plan where they say oh it's
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.200]  associated with Alex Jones it's kooky it's conspiracy it ain't gonna work
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:10.320]  people are finding out about this issue it's in the Marietta Daily Journal that's
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:14.800]  a local Georgia paper it's in the Atlanta TV station 11 this is why we're
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:18.840]  gonna beat them because they still think they control reality with their fraud
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:23.240]  like Carl Rove said not anymore everyone hates them so much at the minute
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:26.640]  they demonize us they all come right to us yeah it's not gonna work you've got
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:30.400]  the Atlanta news station saying global control theorists meet with Georgia
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.160]  GOP leaders and global control theorists you notice these insiders were telling
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:38.560]  Ron Paul don't talk about the world order he just kicked all them out and now
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:41.600]  he goes and gives a speech and says world governments conquered us he said
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:46.760]  world government has taken over America that is the end that is cyanide to these
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.440]  people they show in the news piece they show world government control and then
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:53.640]  they say if you like environmentalism you might be part of the problem that's
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:58.120]  according to these Tea Party activists and the GOP in Georgia and they make a
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.280]  big like make it fun of them conspiracy let's get Cotman's quick take on this
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.600]  and then we'll continue with a stack of articles but doc it isn't working anymore
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.360]  I mean I mean real environmentalists know that this is just taking control of
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.680]  their movement for eugenics and trying to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:18.440]  instead of doing real environmentalism I think the majority of people maybe a
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.600]  small majority at this point are beginning to start to see through it and
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:27.200]  basically it goes back and again to the 1800s the only way they can win is by
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:31.600]  demonizing their opposition this is in time the decade after decade after
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:36.040]  decade and now because of the internet and because of programs like yours and
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:39.400]  soulforth is being exposed and people are saying wait a minute you know I think
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.200]  Benghazi is a classic example anybody watches Fox News and I'm not real strong
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:48.680]  supporter of Fox News but at least they're trying to cover the issue realizes
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.320]  that the whole thing was a was a cover-up right from the beginning Obama stood
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:57.560]  down while that guy got killed over seven hours and they had a CIA base down
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.960]  the street full of troops why didn't they kill him look they were running that
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:05.720]  al-qaeda group that was they had a security it's clear Obama and I've
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.760]  talked to top military off record I've talked to Colonel Schaefer on air and
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.280]  he can go off air he's like no that's what's going on well I'm not gonna get
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:19.200]  into it the point is it's an Obama hit on that guy yeah it is it's really the
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:23.840]  same with Petraeus and soulforth now Petraeus did what he did and deserves it
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:27.760]  what he got but nonetheless no he was mad about the stand down and that's why
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:33.040]  they were lead five generals now right I totally agree it's all political it's
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:36.560]  all vindictive there hasn't been a single decision by this administration
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:41.920]  that wasn't political in this nature not a single one not any that would help or
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.880]  finish up with that in a moment finish up with your articles and we're gonna go
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:47.480]  to break but but show folks some of the other articles you've got here yeah I
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:50.720]  mean it's just interesting they've got stuff we talked about in our info wars
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:54.960]  reports on agenda 21 on the Delphi technique how they use that to sell you
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:59.360]  on your own enslavement and it is all about control and Mother Jones and others
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:03.080]  are admitting they're using it to brainwash us headline it says top
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:07.720]  Georgia GOP lawmakers host briefing on secret Obama mind control plot and
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:11.560]  they've got the mind control graphic and yet it all but we've been to the meetings
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:15.240]  they admit they're using it oh yeah and when we went to the meetings the little
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:18.040]  minders let us know they've been watching our videos and they've been
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:21.920]  reading up on our points to they've got secession and conspiracy theories about
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:26.240]  mind control and domestic watch list and they're trying to tie together Florida
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:31.040]  and Georgia secession with the agenda 21 thing acting again like no no no if you
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:35.000]  don't want the UN coming in and taking over you're a secessionist now they're
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.600]  acting like it's a civil war thing when all 50 states are saying let's get out
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.000]  of this federal you know oh no that's how they sell liberals you don't want to
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.920]  be a stupid toothless white person for from the south a scum I mean I love how
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:51.840]  on TV they attack people from the south I mean I mean it's absolutely bigoted and

[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:10.960]  launched this whole move to try to get the states to really stand up against
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:15.320]  the feds the article is up at infowars.com why the states must secede to
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:19.880]  save America and I lay out my reasons for it there I have a video there I have
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.080]  Ron Paul agreeing that a secession is as American as George Washington and
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:29.560]  Apple Pie and I've had his advisors on the last day Bruce Fine is top
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.840]  advisor from the campaign on policy is on Monday had Evan Vieira on but they
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:39.400]  agree this is the move as the bully pulpit and that the key to this is what
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  you've exposed it's a globalist corporate takeover through the UN the
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.760]  megabanks created the Rockefellers created on record and this is how
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:52.720]  they're taking us over and they're now saying we're treasonous if we don't want
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.560]  to go under UN I mean here it is you end to seek internet kills which next
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:01.480]  month document show and that's what Obama's secret order is doing is handing
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:07.720]  them the codes to the to the DNS registry I mean we're going under this
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:12.760]  and we've got to say no they hope to just push this in because we're designed
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:17.640]  to face a military attack not a corporate sabotage takeover what are you
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:21.440]  saying closing on that sir absolutely I totally agree with you I don't you're
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:24.840]  cutting in and out and I hope I'm not doing that on your end but it's
[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:29.280]  absolutely essential that we begin to say no six the secessionist movement has
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.840]  gone on the last few days I think it's absolutely astounding and really
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.040]  exciting however remember that we really need to get our economy at the state
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.960]  level in shape before we can succeed because a lot of states and I'm in Maine
[02:57:42.960 --> 02:57:46.920]  and we're one of them I had the chance to talk to the government governor he
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:51.000]  says we cannot survive without federal head right now we're trying to get out
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.680]  from underneath that but if we were to succeed right now we would go under
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:59.680]  financially and and I know a lot of states are like that so it's it's got to
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:05.000]  be a dual effort we've got I'm saying use the states beginning the meetings and
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.920]  the legislatures pointing out that the UN's taken over that's what they're
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:14.080]  afraid of see I don't just know this historically their entire battle plan is
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:18.760]  based around stopping us exposing it's a foreign takeover and demonizing
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:23.920]  secession that's because they know that's their Achilles heel absolutely I
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:27.360]  agree and let me tell you folks I've been working on this it's a like mate
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:32.800]  1980s agenda 21 is real sustainable America is real you can find it on the

[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:21.480]  founders believe in secession I just had it here and then this somehow hit reload
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:25.920]  he said I'm sick of those who say secession is illegal if our founding
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:29.680]  fathers thought like that we'd be calling Elizabeth the second our queen
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:33.880]  right now ever heard of NDAA a June 21 or our country is becoming a communist

[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:51.240]  my vote to count absolutely that person is on target listen listen they they're
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:55.240]  arresting people that mildly criticize the government in England now I mean say
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:58.360]  stuff like I think the government's corrupt the cops come in arrest you and
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:03.160]  put it on the news to scare everybody they're under the exact same thing about
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:08.280]  five years ahead of us I mean these people are evil okay and they're trying
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:11.400]  to hire a bunch of criminal cops to enforce it the good news is most
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:14.880]  police forces won't be part of this but they're having warrantless checkpoints
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:18.760]  I've got reporters out on the highway and there's so much cell phone traffic or
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:22.440]  it's being jammed they can't get a Skype connection to us but Jacari Jackson and
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:28.040]  Marcos Morales they've got all the footage of the US Army running
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:32.760]  checkpoints and and and traffic control on the highway that is literally 300
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:35.520]  yards from where I'm sitting it's a couple miles on the road where it's
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:40.080]  happening there's black helicopters army helicopters this morning I mean I'm
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:44.920]  living in an insane asylum I mean that's all I can say let's go ahead and
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:47.760]  jam in some calls here thanks for holding Stephen New York what's your
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:58.800]  take on all this hi Alex I hope you you go on your bullhorns and blast truth
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:04.360]  out and in the walls of the new order best deal come from me down turn to dust
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:07.560]  alright thank you sir I appreciate your call we got to move quicker with these
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:12.360]  callers James and Florida God bless you caller James you're on the air go ahead
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:16.920]  Alex I believe that the brush fires of liberty are burning hotter than ever I
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:22.000]  believe that your call for a state nullification powers is the right one
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:28.160]  and I would also like to state that I think the terms to session or seceding
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:32.600]  might be the wrong one to use I think we might want to use another word for
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:35.120]  this movement yeah I've been trying to think of the word I mean what do you call
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:39.840]  it when the states recognize that we've been hijacked and then reconvene the
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:44.880]  Republic we need to call it the second you know the second second birth of the
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:49.320]  Republic rebirth I mean but I mean the mechanism is secession they have to
[03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:54.120]  exercise and begin the secession legislative vote and that's what it is
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:59.000]  we've elected them we need to I mean we need to we need to engage it I mean we
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.680]  need to you know say I'm leaving this bad relationship because it's like you
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:05.760]  wake up and it's not your wife in the bed next to you you're not not your
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:09.400]  husband and you're like oh yes I am your I am your wife or I am your husband
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:13.080]  you're like no you're not get out of the bed so you got to get out of the bed
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:18.040]  first to say I told you get out of the bed or I'm gonna stomp your head in
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:23.080]  politically you understand what I'm saying I do and the thing is the mainstream
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:26.560]  media is going to use secession as a racist term because of its you know
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.720]  connotations to the civil war they have secession all over the world great I
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:36.360]  agree but perhaps if we use the term like liberationist instead of you know
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:40.920]  I agree the states need to liberate themselves from the New World Order they
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:45.280]  need to they need to they need to reconvene the Republic and wreck it you
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:50.160]  understand if we if we start expanding we've been taken over by foreign banks I
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:56.320]  mean that's a big deal and and thank God Ron Paul is the man I know he is for
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:59.160]  coming out and saying we've been taken over did you hear his speech he said
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:04.080]  we're under global government all 48 minutes of those most powerful speech
[03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:07.240]  I've ever heard in my life I agree we're being taken over by the globalists
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:11.840]  using the states to fight the globalists is the way to go but calling its
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:16.400]  secession is feeding into the media calling us racist but sometimes you
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:19.960]  just got about you just got to go with it I mean you know what because oh I'm a
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:25.240]  racist I mean it's just good good but listen I hear you all I'm saying is use
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:30.400]  that name to say oh yeah this type of secession not the secession the liberal
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:35.000]  media told you about but the real ones because they're not liberals oh my gosh
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:39.640]  that's it so far we'll be back where I break down the whole battle plan to
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:45.040]  restore the Republic the states must reboot the Republic using their
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:49.120]  secession powers in the Declaration of Independence that points out the
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:53.360]  inherent rights this Sunday four to six central five to seven Easter I will
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.160]  hear the whole Ron Paul speech with my commentary Sunday four to six pray for
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:05.920]  us we need your prayers
