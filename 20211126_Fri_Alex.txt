[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, November 23rd, 2021.
[00:07.360 --> 00:14.560]  I know a lot of you are tuned in today thinking I'm going to be talking a lot about the January
[00:14.560 --> 00:21.280]  6th witch hunt committee subpoenaing myself and how they're drooling on national TV, hoping
[00:21.280 --> 00:22.720]  I get arrested for something.
[00:22.720 --> 00:27.280]  It's all part of their globalist communist purge, and I'm going to cover some of that
[00:27.280 --> 00:32.000]  with Roger Stone in hour number two, but that's not our top stories.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.240]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the fact the globalists are gearing up to launch new bio
[00:36.240 --> 00:41.800]  weapon attacks on us and are establishing UN-run martial law worldwide, as we told you they
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.160]  would 20-plus months ago when they launched this attack, and they've got all these other
[00:46.160 --> 00:50.960]  distractions and diversions going to cover up the Gisling Maxwell pedophile ring story
[00:50.960 --> 00:53.240]  we'll be breaking down next segment as well.
[00:53.240 --> 00:55.680]  Paul Watson also joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:55.680 --> 00:57.720]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:57.720 --> 01:06.880]  Here is a key Gregory's report.
[01:06.880 --> 01:12.600]  Before recent headlines, most of us haven't been thinking much about smallpox, but an
[01:12.600 --> 01:19.400]  important timeline of events published by Corey Diggs shows us how the same foundations,
[01:19.400 --> 01:27.400]  corporations, and NGOs responsible for COVID-19 have been very busy with smallpox since June
[01:27.400 --> 01:34.080]  of 2001, when the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Johns Hopkins, and
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.720]  Anser, who was awarded the majority of money for Operation Warp Speed, simulated a smallpox
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.360]  attack on U.S. citizens named Dark Winter.
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.840]  We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and begin preparing for a smallpox
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.440]  attack.
[01:52.440 --> 01:59.600]  In September of 2007, the FDA licensed a new modern smallpox vaccine made by Sanofi
[01:59.600 --> 02:00.600]  Pasteur.
[02:00.600 --> 02:08.600]  In 2014, six vials of smallpox are found in a cardboard box at the NIH and transferred
[02:08.600 --> 02:10.560]  to the CDC.
[02:10.560 --> 02:16.840]  Years later, the first antiviral drug used to treat smallpox was created, funded by
[02:16.840 --> 02:19.560]  Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust.
[02:19.560 --> 02:27.480]  On October 6, 2017, emergent biosolutions, responsible for a vaccine that injured over
[02:27.480 --> 02:34.840]  300,000 soldiers, acquired the smallpox vaccine contract from Sanofi Pasteur.
[02:34.840 --> 02:42.840]  In July of 2018, the FDA approves a drug to treat smallpox made by SEGA Technologies,
[02:42.840 --> 02:50.840]  who signs a contract to maintain a stockpile of 1.7 million doses of their antiviral drug.
[02:50.840 --> 02:58.680]  September 3, 2019, emergent biosolutions is awarded $2 billion to deliver their smallpox
[02:58.680 --> 03:02.320]  vaccine into the national stockpile.
[03:02.320 --> 03:07.720]  Weeks later, one of only two labs in the world known to store live samples of the variole
[03:07.720 --> 03:15.160]  virus that causes smallpox suffers an explosion, and the FDA approves a vaccine to prevent
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.000]  both smallpox and monkeypox.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.480]  In March of 2021, Merck secures over $300 million from the Biden administration and
[03:25.480 --> 03:31.280]  the Bill Gates Foundation to convert, upgrade, and equip their facilities.
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.440]  On June of 2021, the FDA approves the antiviral treatment for smallpox, which was funded by
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.600]  Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust in 2014.
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.000]  In July, Oxford University assists SEGA in expanding use of their monkeypox drugs into
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.680]  the Central African Republic.
[03:50.680 --> 03:56.200]  On Halloween, Joe Biden signs an executive order to exercise authority over the national
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.680]  defense stockpile.
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.960]  Weeks later, Bill Gates warns governments of a smallpox terror attack.
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.960]  Seven days after that, several vials of smallpox are incidentally discovered at the Merck
[04:10.960 --> 04:13.800]  facility in Pennsylvania.
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.200]  The very next day, a rare case of monkeypox is discovered in Maryland.
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.520]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[04:23.520 --> 04:31.480]  Well, the idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there
[04:31.480 --> 04:33.800]  a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[04:33.800 --> 04:39.560]  Now, the good news is, most of the work we're going to do to be ready for pandemic two,
[04:39.560 --> 04:43.040]  I call this pandemic one.
[04:43.040 --> 05:01.160]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[05:01.160 --> 05:06.720]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.600]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[05:10.600 --> 05:17.720]  So right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning and it's only going to run until
[05:17.720 --> 05:22.760]  the end of the month and that's now only six, seven days.
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.320]  Infowars store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[05:27.320 --> 05:28.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[05:28.800 --> 05:30.400]  It's our best seller.
[05:30.400 --> 05:35.640]  Vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the T-amino acids, everything
[05:35.640 --> 05:37.880]  you need for your immune system and your body.
[05:37.880 --> 05:41.040]  It tastes great and it funds the Infowar.
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.640]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points and so much more
[05:46.640 --> 05:48.640]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.520]  So only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.720]  Bet on freedom, bet on Infowars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[05:56.720 --> 06:25.320]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at Infowarsstore.
[06:25.320 --> 06:39.320]  It's Tuesday, November 23rd.
[06:39.320 --> 06:52.920]  Infowars, because there's a war on for your mind, well, I am being persecuted along with
[06:52.920 --> 07:05.000]  Owen Schreuer and James O'Keefe and so many other individuals because I'm a loyal American
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.400]  and because I stand against this globalist takeover.
[07:09.400 --> 07:10.680]  They will not be successful.
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.360]  They can't be.
[07:12.360 --> 07:19.480]  Too many children and others will die under the chemical biological attack we're now under.
[07:19.480 --> 07:26.200]  The European Union, led by Germany, is now saying the next move will be forced injection
[07:26.200 --> 07:32.160]  with the COVID-19 genetically engineered bio weapon masquerading as a vaccine at the hands
[07:32.160 --> 07:36.280]  of the military and police that will trigger a bloody civil war, which has been the plan
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.960]  they want an excuse to go around and start killing people in mass.
[07:39.960 --> 07:42.400]  They're triggering a civil war worldwide.
[07:42.400 --> 07:48.800]  How did I know 21 months ago and literally put out hundreds of reports and segments on
[07:48.800 --> 07:56.960]  these shows, hundreds, saying that by the winter of 2021, you'll have them going around
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.960]  starting to do mass arrest of unvaccinated and taking them to camps.
[08:01.960 --> 08:07.160]  Because it was in the United Nations documents and even the CDC documents because they follow
[08:07.160 --> 08:11.880]  the UN orders, they call it the shield project.
[08:11.880 --> 08:14.080]  Now it's happening in Europe.
[08:14.080 --> 08:16.840]  It's happening in Australia and it's happening in Canada.
[08:16.840 --> 08:20.240]  It's happening.
[08:20.240 --> 08:24.640]  That's a stack right here.
[08:24.640 --> 08:27.640]  German government says prepare for forced inoculations.
[08:27.640 --> 08:28.640]  No one will be allowed.
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.960]  It's not what we're going to lock you in your house if you don't take it.
[08:30.960 --> 08:33.800]  We're coming to give it to you.
[08:33.800 --> 08:36.880]  And the military started arresting and taking people out of their homes that haven't taken
[08:36.880 --> 08:38.120]  the injections.
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.760]  That's coming up.
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.080]  The Gisela and Maxwell trial confirming the Clintons went to the island when they said
[08:44.080 --> 08:47.760]  they didn't and were involved in the trafficking of children.
[08:47.760 --> 08:48.760]  It's all coming out.
[08:48.760 --> 08:51.760]  That's what they're trying to distract us with all the rest of the garbage.
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.240]  That's going to be broken down.
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.760]  Paul Watson is going to join us to cover a host of issues at the bottom of the hour.
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.480]  Then Roger Stone, that's down.
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.360]  Because he's also been subpoenaed by this witch hunt and what that really signifies.
[09:06.360 --> 09:12.000]  And they're hoping to try to claim that if we testify, we say something not true.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.840]  And so they can then indict us not for leading an insurrection, but for supposedly lying
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.840]  to Congress.
[09:19.840 --> 09:20.840]  That's their plan.
[09:20.840 --> 09:23.760]  Will I plead the Fifth Amendment?
[09:23.760 --> 09:26.720]  We'll talk about it next hour.
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.320]  It's all coming up today.
[09:29.320 --> 09:33.760]  And then in the third and fourth hour, we're going to take you into the matrix with the
[09:33.760 --> 09:36.160]  keys of how to defeat it with reset wars.
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.200]  The first big in depth look, you do not want to miss the third and fourth hour.
[09:41.200 --> 09:42.200]  It's powerful info ever.
[09:42.200 --> 09:49.640]  But here's something I shot this morning where I'm calling for a new January 6th investigation.
[09:49.640 --> 10:09.800]  It's time for the truth to come out.
[10:09.800 --> 10:17.000]  It's time for the American people to demand a real January 6th investigation.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.200]  Because if you look into what really happened that day, it was a deep state operation that
[10:22.200 --> 10:26.240]  almost triggered an extremely violent event at the Capitol.
[10:26.240 --> 10:31.240]  The terrible events of that day, as bad as they were, were microscopic compared to what
[10:31.240 --> 10:34.320]  the deep state was actually planning.
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.560]  And that's why they're fighting so hard to run this fake committee, this kangaroo court.
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.960]  That's why they are making so much noise about the general public being terrorist, the American
[10:46.960 --> 10:53.720]  people not being trustworthy, and moms at PTA meetings being the number one terror threat.
[10:53.720 --> 10:57.920]  It's because they know the truth about January 6th comes out, which is coming out thanks
[10:57.920 --> 10:59.680]  to Tucker Carlson and others.
[10:59.680 --> 11:02.240]  Their entire deep state is going down.
[11:02.240 --> 11:11.280]  Just like Russiagate, January 6th was their operation.
[11:11.280 --> 11:20.960]  The January 6th witch hunt committee makes Joe McCarthy blush from his grave.
[11:20.960 --> 11:28.760]  It is a complete and absolute fishing expedition trying to demonize populist Americans that
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.760]  want our country to be sovereign and want to put our nation first.
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.760]  It is 21st century mass persecution.
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.000]  Now as you've probably seen on the news, it was the top story yesterday, not the man that
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  ran over 40 plus people killing five because they were white in Wisconsin.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.840]  No ladies and gentlemen, the story was Alex Jones and Roger Stone subpoenaed by the January
[11:51.840 --> 11:52.840]  6th committee.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.800]  Here's the problem with that.
[11:54.800 --> 12:00.400]  They will claim I lie about something to the committee, which isn't even true.
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.400]  I wouldn't lie, and then they will have the FBI and the Justice Department indict me for
[12:06.400 --> 12:07.400]  lying to Congress.
[12:07.400 --> 12:08.400]  I'm not stupid.
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.960]  So, they've been asking why other people aren't declaring the 5th.
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.120]  I'm probably going to declare the 5th not because I've done anything wrong, but because
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.480]  these people are political criminals that have an axe to grind and have been bragging
[12:21.480 --> 12:23.080]  everywhere they want to put me in prison.
[12:23.080 --> 12:24.080]  Okay?
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.080]  I'm 47 years old.
[12:25.080 --> 12:27.880]  Don't have any felonies, any of those issues.
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.000]  I'm a good person, a family man, and I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  prison.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  No, sir.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.500]  Don't want to have that happen.
[12:35.500 --> 12:41.040]  And so, I don't want to testify before them because they will lie and say that I lie.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.440]  Here's the other problem though.
[12:42.440 --> 12:45.320]  I want a January 6th investigation.
[12:45.320 --> 12:50.080]  I want to know why the National Guard will refuse the President Trump when he asks for
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.080]  him on record.
[12:51.080 --> 12:54.320]  And then, later, the head of the National Guard in D.C. Lydon said that Trump had nassed
[12:54.320 --> 12:55.760]  or that he couldn't supply him.
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.080]  And just last week, admitted that Trump indeed did ask for him and was refused.
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.160]  I want to know why half the Capitol Police were sent, for quote, traffic control by D.C.
[13:05.160 --> 13:06.160]  that controls them that day.
[13:06.160 --> 13:08.160]  And the Capitol had half the police they had.
[13:08.160 --> 13:12.600]  I want to know who ordered the stand down of the police and let the people in the building.
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.600]  I want to know about the FBI infiltrating groups and the federal documents that have
[13:17.600 --> 13:20.760]  come out that indeed they did have informants inside.
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.440]  And they brought the same FBI agent from Michigan who set up the false flag against Governor
[13:25.440 --> 13:28.120]  Whitmer to run the operations on January 6th.
[13:28.120 --> 13:30.360]  I want a real investigation.
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.360]  But this isn't a real investigation.
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.440]  They have a few hand-picked Republicans like Liz Cheney and others that are horrible neocons.
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.640]  And they are basically setting up a show trial here.
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.160]  So, I'm on air weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at infowars.com.
[13:46.160 --> 13:49.600]  We're still on the air in many ways, bigger than ever, telling the truth, laying out the
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.080]  documents, covering what's really happening.
[13:52.080 --> 13:54.680]  And I really do want to testify to Congress.
[13:54.680 --> 14:01.120]  And so, if they let me testify live in front of the cameras or depose me on C-SPAN, I will
[14:01.120 --> 14:02.560]  probably do it.
[14:02.560 --> 14:05.040]  That way they can't twist what I said later.
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.200]  But I've seen what they've done to other people and there's no way I'm going to go behind
[14:08.200 --> 14:13.520]  closed doors with SHIF and all these other crazy people and swallow as well the Chinese
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.560]  agent and let them sit there and claim that I've done something wrong or claim that I
[14:18.560 --> 14:19.680]  lied to Congress.
[14:19.680 --> 14:21.920]  I want an investigation of them.
[14:21.920 --> 14:22.920]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.520]  The deep state that controls them and ran the fake Russiagate operation also provocateur
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.520]  January 6.
[14:28.520 --> 14:33.440]  I want to know why the groups I was working with, with Ali Alexander on record, had the
[14:33.440 --> 14:38.400]  permit on the edge of the Capitol by the Supreme Court where Trump thought he was going, where
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.240]  I told the crowds, don't go in the building, go over here, let's be peaceful.
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.000]  They know all this and they can't stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.320]  This country is in an emergency, they never want us to have a real election in 11 months.
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.000]  They want to set up this tyranny, they want to brand their opposition as terrorists, they
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.880]  want to have a political purge and it's wrong.
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.600]  So I want a real January 6 investigation that's bipartisan and I would be happy to testify
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.240]  before that under oath.
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.160]  But I'm not a fool, I'm not an idiot and I'm not about to be set up by the political,
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.080]  globalist criminals in Congress, the Democrats that have sold this nation out to China.
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.160]  This whole thing is about distracting from Biden, the stolen election, the gas prices
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.640]  that have doubled, the incredible inflation, the borders collapsing, the pedophile rings
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.480]  running around all over the country and this whole new order agenda is selling our country
[15:25.480 --> 15:26.480]  out.
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.080]  You people are traders, you signed on to the wrong team, America's awake to you, so good
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.160]  luck trying to put the patriot leadership in prison.

[19:57.360 --> 20:01.480]  and ask the Alex Jones special.
[20:01.480 --> 20:27.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.480 --> 20:43.600]  Well, I got really fired up yesterday when I learned that the witch hunt McCarthy 2.0
[20:43.600 --> 20:49.080]  was after me, I mean I knew that was coming and there's subpoenas coming in and all the
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.920]  rest of it because we'd already had the FBI and Justice Department, all of them subpoenaing
[20:53.920 --> 20:57.920]  us and sending us letters and just dealing with it with the lawyers and the amount of
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.480]  money it costs to have them just dig through everything so you certify we don't have what
[21:01.480 --> 21:06.080]  you're asking for and people say, oh, well just it's a bunch of BS, don't comply, well
[21:06.080 --> 21:08.120]  then they swat team you.
[21:08.120 --> 21:11.280]  So let it be known, we're not holding anything back, they don't have an excuse to come here
[21:11.280 --> 21:13.480]  with 40 dudes and guns, they know that.
[21:13.480 --> 21:17.280]  That's why they let Owen turn himself in because we're not looking for a fight with
[21:17.280 --> 21:21.560]  the FBI, if they want to destroy the country and destroy their children's future, we're
[21:21.560 --> 21:25.360]  going to try to politically stop them because we believe getting in a physical fight with
[21:25.360 --> 21:32.480]  them is what the globalists want because we're good Americans, we're understanding that discretion
[21:32.480 --> 21:37.200]  is the greater part of valor, but the deep state with the poison shots and the rest of
[21:37.200 --> 21:43.960]  it is really pushing towards the physical confrontation because they're losing the political war for
[21:43.960 --> 21:48.440]  hearts and minds, we're winning big time, this is a football game, we're in the fourth
[21:48.440 --> 21:53.240]  quarter and we're like 60 points ahead, okay?
[21:53.240 --> 21:58.080]  Only hope they've got is that our team starts biting and hitting and stabbing the other
[21:58.080 --> 22:06.360]  team so that our team gets disqualified, they've lost, they know that, their house of cards
[22:06.360 --> 22:11.560]  is coming down and I'm not the type of person that sits up here like some propagandist and
[22:11.560 --> 22:18.080]  tells you we're winning when we're not, I've been on there 28 years and the first 22 or
[22:18.080 --> 22:23.440]  so, I told you we were losing, the tide began to turn though about eight years ago and the
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.720]  hearts and minds, we're winning and I can tell you the average person that works in
[22:27.720 --> 22:32.080]  the federal government, whether they're the military or in the federal agencies, it's
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.840]  not a bad person, in fact, they're more awake on average I found than general public because
[22:35.840 --> 22:37.760]  they've seen the corruption, what do they do?
[22:37.760 --> 22:43.400]  Get out so the bad guys can be put in, it's a very small group at the top that is executing
[22:43.400 --> 22:48.880]  all this and a very large group of corrupt Justice Department lawyers, but the federal
[22:48.880 --> 22:52.680]  marshals and even the average FBI agent, they're not our enemy and I don't say that to kiss
[22:52.680 --> 22:58.960]  their ass, I say that because we don't want to be lured in to a civil war which is what
[22:58.960 --> 23:05.880]  China wants and I've got so many incredible articles here today, so much and I sit here
[23:05.880 --> 23:11.080]  before I go live on air, after hours and hours and hours and hours of research yesterday
[23:11.080 --> 23:15.960]  evening and today, I was up working at one AM last night because this is important stuff
[23:15.960 --> 23:21.680]  and I was up at 5.30 studying until my younger daughter got up at seven o'clock and I made
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.160]  her breakfast, had to take an hour out, hash browns, bacon, eggs, bagels with cream cheese,
[23:27.160 --> 23:30.720]  we just pig out every morning at a great time with my four-year-old daughter because that's
[23:30.720 --> 23:34.680]  where I just recharge, I spent an hour whether just eating and playing in the backyard, it
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.800]  was like an eon of just delight compared to all this evil, but that's what I fight for,
[23:39.800 --> 23:46.120]  that's who I fight for and if I need to die for her, if I need to get put in prison or
[23:46.120 --> 23:53.360]  killed, cards on the table, baby, chips on the board, everything in, everything in and
[23:53.360 --> 23:57.840]  it's not even a question when you get to that point of the fact that they're coming after
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.880]  our children, so all over the world they're announcing under globalist control that they're
[24:01.880 --> 24:06.040]  going to start injecting newborn babies with the deadly shots that erase their immunity
[24:06.040 --> 24:10.520]  and just destroy them for life, it's on record.
[24:10.520 --> 24:19.320]  So people ask, as a 47-year-old man that's been around the world and seen a lot of stuff
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.240]  and been through a lot of pain, which made me stronger by the way, all that pain in hindsight
[24:23.240 --> 24:28.200]  now is the best part of my life, didn't enjoy it at the time but it made me better, I would
[24:28.200 --> 24:33.840]  be the biggest cowered piece of crap ever if I didn't stand up for children who don't
[24:33.840 --> 24:36.640]  have anybody to stand up for them, so I'm going to tell you all, you're on the right
[24:36.640 --> 24:42.200]  side of history, everybody knows it, they can see it, they can feel it, they can analytically
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.840]  document it all for themselves and we know we're in a time of great evil trying to grab
[24:47.840 --> 24:50.920]  everything it can and take it down with it.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.440]  So let me just give you a gestalt of the news.
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.040]  There is a Breitbart article that I read this morning, I don't have the full article, we
[24:59.040 --> 25:05.560]  just print it for me because I didn't print all the pages for some reason, I've got a
[25:05.560 --> 25:10.800]  Breitbart article that is the most important article of the day and if you're a new listener
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.520]  that just tuned in this week or today, you're like, well wait, you said written house is
[25:13.520 --> 25:17.040]  a diversion, well he's important for the Second Amendment, he's important for self-defense,
[25:17.040 --> 25:20.960]  he's a great young man but compared to them coming after hundreds of millions of children
[25:20.960 --> 25:28.480]  with poisoned shots, his pain is a drop of blood compared to an ocean of blood.
[25:28.480 --> 25:34.040]  But how China and the Democrats have responded in lockstep together is a rosetta stone through
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.120]  which, a keyhole through which you can see their whole agenda.
[25:37.120 --> 25:40.880]  This is the most important article of the day because you understand this, you understand
[25:40.880 --> 25:43.800]  everything, so let me hit it right now.
[25:43.800 --> 25:50.280]  China in thousands of articles a week is saying America's done, America's over, America's
[25:50.280 --> 25:56.040]  so racially divided that we will burn up and be over and they're telling investors that
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.000]  and they're telling other governments that and they're screaming that from the rooftops
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.040]  and the mountain tops and the hill tops and the valleys.
[26:04.040 --> 26:05.040]  And who is China?
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.080]  There where the globalists have invested, there where Hollywood's invested, there where
[26:08.080 --> 26:11.360]  the New World Order has set up their new system.
[26:11.360 --> 26:15.560]  And China owns four of the six big production houses that if you go look at who owns the
[26:15.560 --> 26:21.560]  movie houses that fund all this black on white violence movies and whites are the devil shows
[26:21.560 --> 26:26.840]  and all these TV shows and programs, it's the communist Chinese regime which is the
[26:26.840 --> 26:28.920]  most homogenous group of people in the world.
[26:28.920 --> 26:32.160]  And I'm not against the Chinese that on average they just want to be with Chinese.
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.320]  Okay, that's what you're comfortable with, it's who your mama and daddy was, it's your
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.520]  culture, I get it.
[26:36.520 --> 26:40.920]  You're not bad because most of you decide you want to stay who you are.
[26:40.920 --> 26:44.120]  They don't like the Koreans, they don't like the Japanese, they don't like the Russians,
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.440]  they like Chinese, they're the oldest culture in the world.
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.280]  And they get that their strength is the fact that they are unified.
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.040]  So they're financing with the left and paying billions a week, billions a week.
[26:56.040 --> 27:01.000]  There's thousands of programs every year that whites of the devil kill them, get them.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.960]  And the weak minded buy into that to divide the country, that's all it is.
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.240]  And China brags, they say America's over, they will be destroyed in a race war within
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.760]  the next year because that's their plan.
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.080]  China can't launch nuclear missiles at us, we get in a war with them and destroy them.
[27:15.080 --> 27:20.480]  But they can release a bio weapon with the China files, Bill Gates and the globalist
[27:20.480 --> 27:22.680]  and the public president Biden they put in.
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.160]  So this is the takedown of America and the end of the country.
[27:27.160 --> 27:33.040]  So all the Justice Department lawyers and all the FBI and all you can pretend this and
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.880]  say if you get Trump and get Alex Jones and you know, get Owen Schreuer and get James
[27:37.880 --> 27:42.960]  O'Keefe and if you get us all, why you'll be a real boy finally, you'll be in charge
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.160]  of the new America.
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.640]  No, they always get rid of the traders that helped bring down the country.
[27:47.640 --> 27:49.560]  They never leave you in place.
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.840]  In fact, I know after you guys have brought the country down, I'll be approached one last
[27:53.840 --> 27:54.960]  time and join the globalist.
[27:54.960 --> 27:55.960]  I know that.
[27:55.960 --> 27:58.200]  I'm just going to say, no, I want to leave the country.
[27:58.200 --> 28:01.240]  If we lose it all, I'm just, and they'll probably just kill me on the spot.
[28:01.240 --> 28:02.240]  But I don't know how this works.
[28:02.240 --> 28:04.680]  I know how the real elite operate, okay?
[28:04.680 --> 28:05.840]  You guys don't.
[28:05.840 --> 28:09.480]  You kiss the ass of the group taking the country down in your fools.
[28:09.480 --> 28:13.040]  You're the idiots that lower the drawbridge for the Huns to come in at midnight and the
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.520]  first thing the Huns do after they capture the city is arrest you and slit your throat.
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.360]  You think the Huns, you think the globalist, you think the new world order respects people
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.840]  that lowered drawbridges on their own people.
[28:25.840 --> 28:28.040]  You are the curse.
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.120]  You are the plague, as Cicero said 2000 plus years ago.
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.360]  So this article, we'll cover it later.
[28:33.360 --> 28:35.680]  We got a bunch of big guests on, but this is everything.
[28:35.680 --> 28:42.280]  Our enemies bragging how they're financing all this race crap.
[28:42.280 --> 28:43.280]  And I'm not stupid.
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.120]  I'm not going to play into it, but it's getting rough, man.
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.520]  I'm telling you, white folks are getting beat up, stabbed and attacked everywhere.
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.080]  And the system is there trying to bring this country down.
[28:53.080 --> 28:54.080]  And it's so sad.
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.080]  We need to rally together against the globalists and restore the republic if we have any sense
[28:58.080 --> 28:59.080]  left in us.
[28:59.080 --> 29:05.560]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.480]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[30:35.720 --> 30:36.720]  We don't think so.

[31:57.120 --> 31:59.640]  great products.
[31:59.640 --> 32:06.840]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[32:06.840 --> 32:12.720]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides,
[32:12.720 --> 32:18.040]  horrible crashes, and again, so many toxins on them.
[32:18.040 --> 32:24.400]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarsstore.com are clean, are pure, are
[32:24.400 --> 32:30.120]  highest quality, and they're long lasting, and they help focus your mind.

[33:00.920 --> 33:20.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.600 --> 33:37.800]  It is a real honor to be in the crosshairs of the most evil people on earth.
[33:37.800 --> 33:43.680]  My flesh doesn't like it, but my spirit loves it.
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.280]  Because I intend to go into harm's way, I intend to take on the evil, I intend to challenge
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.040]  the corrupt power structure, because I don't want to be energetically, spiritually aligned
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.880]  with them in any way, and that means I need to be an absolute opposition to them, and
[33:59.880 --> 34:05.640]  I am in opposition to everything the globalist and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates stand for.
[34:05.640 --> 34:10.080]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us because he has been really doing an excellent job over at
[34:10.080 --> 34:20.360]  summit.news and also at infowars.com and newswars.com, laying out so much here, dealing with what
[34:20.360 --> 34:26.720]  happened in Wisconsin at this attack a few days ago that killed five people, injured
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.800]  more than 40, some of them in critical condition, including children as young as four and five
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.200]  years old, literally blood all over the streets, gallons and gallons of it everywhere.
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.240]  They said it looked like a slaughterhouse, they washed it away as quickly as possible,
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.280]  and the news said he was being chased by police, it was their fault, and that was totally made
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.880]  up and not true, says the Black Lives Matter, left his police sheet.
[34:47.880 --> 34:54.640]  He was let out of jail, obviously, by a Soros finance DA that is a leader in letting armed
[34:54.640 --> 34:58.800]  criminals and others out, and I don't want to read the whole rap sheet of this black
[34:58.800 --> 35:03.080]  supremacist terrorist, but it's long.
[35:03.080 --> 35:10.680]  No trafficking, sex assaults, choking, attacking, trying to run people over, I mean, he's a
[35:10.680 --> 35:16.280]  regular jihadi, and he believed he was going out now, the evidence has come out, to attack
[35:16.280 --> 35:22.960]  and kill evil whites that were having a horrible celebration parade they've been having for
[35:22.960 --> 35:23.960]  over 100 years.
[35:23.960 --> 35:30.360]  So Paul Watson joins us to talk about this and to expand on it, there's also a recent
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.720]  Liverpool bombing at a hospital by a Christian convert who was a jihadi.
[35:35.720 --> 35:40.120]  So Paul Joseph Watson joins us to talk about this incredible level of not just attempts
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.120]  at race war and social division, not just here but in Europe as well, the same global
[35:44.120 --> 35:49.880]  has run everything, but all the looting and attacks and massive crime exploding everywhere.
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.840]  Like Koshwab said, they're going to undermine civilization and collapse it, we're here now.
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.640]  So I just want to cover these topics, I want you to hit them Paul, I want to also do 35,000
[35:59.640 --> 36:01.800]  views before you leave us in about 30 minutes.
[36:01.800 --> 36:04.600]  Paul Joseph Watson, what's your view on all this?
[36:04.600 --> 36:10.760]  Well, with the attack in Wisconsin, Alex, you had the narrative being set in the immediate
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.520]  aftermath of the incident by the media, saying that this driver, this massacre driver was
[36:16.520 --> 36:21.520]  fleeing a crime scene, he'd been involved in some kind of knife fight, and he was fleeing
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.300]  the scene of a crime.
[36:23.300 --> 36:27.280]  If you're trying to evade police attention, Alex, because you've just been involved in
[36:27.280 --> 36:31.600]  a crime and you're trying to get away, what's the one thing you wouldn't do?
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.880]  You wouldn't drive directly into the main street in the town where the Christmas parade
[36:36.880 --> 36:38.000]  is happening.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.920]  The most public place possible, if you're trying to evade police attention and mow down
[36:43.920 --> 36:50.200]  50 people, including children, not a very good way of keeping out of the eye of the police
[36:50.200 --> 36:51.200]  is it?
[36:51.200 --> 36:52.200]  Paul, you're right.
[36:52.200 --> 36:55.080]  But now they confirm he ran over barricades, he had all the side streets, he was not being
[36:55.080 --> 36:58.360]  followed by police, it's all a lie.
[36:58.360 --> 37:01.680]  Yeah, but they're still reporting that he was fleeing a crime scene.
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.040]  They're not even asking what the motive was.
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.800]  You've got an arrest video of him today, which has been released by NBC.
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.000]  They cut out about two minutes of the video where the police go and arrest him.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.640]  We don't know what happened there.
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.720]  And then of course, we have his statements, we have his Facebook profile posts.
[37:17.720 --> 37:22.000]  We have his YouTube videos, which are all deleted within two hours of the incident,
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.240]  of course, hiding the evidence, which show, as he said, he was a black supremacist.
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.080]  He posted violent threats against white people.
[37:30.080 --> 37:35.400]  He told people to go out and randomly, physically, violently assault white people.
[37:35.400 --> 37:41.160]  He was doing rap songs on his SoundCloud account about George Floyd and Eric Garner.
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.240]  He was amplifying BLM rhetoric at every possible opportunity.
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.280]  He was posting about the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict and saying how angry he was about
[37:50.280 --> 37:51.280]  this.
[37:51.280 --> 37:57.520]  But just a coincidence, Alex, that someone mows down 50 people in Wisconsin, and he's
[37:57.520 --> 38:03.200]  a black supremacist, two days after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict, and you asked the question.
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.040]  Well, it's also a coincidence that in England and Europe and all over, they had to put up
[38:07.040 --> 38:12.200]  these freedom barricades everywhere because of all the jihadis running over folks with
[38:12.200 --> 38:13.200]  vehicles.
[38:13.200 --> 38:16.960]  But the news spends it and says it's actually the vehicles, you know, bus attack, truck
[38:16.960 --> 38:17.960]  attack.
[38:17.960 --> 38:24.240]  Yeah, they say dissolve the borders, well, now in London, we've got borders on our bridges
[38:24.240 --> 38:30.320]  because about three of them have been used as vectors for massacres by jihadists.
[38:30.320 --> 38:32.720]  And another one happened the other week, which we're going to talk about.
[38:32.720 --> 38:35.080]  There's the arrest video that you're watching, by the way.
[38:35.080 --> 38:39.320]  So yeah, imagine if you had a white supremacist, you go on his Facebook page, it's full of
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.440]  Confederate flags, it's full of violent threats against black people.
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.720]  Two days later, he's angry about the verdict of a trial.
[38:47.720 --> 38:51.520]  He goes out and mows down 50, mainly black people.
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.720]  Do you think the media would make the connection that maybe the motive is that he hates black
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.520]  people and that he's a race supremacist?
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.040]  They would be all over it.
[39:01.040 --> 39:04.080]  This would be the top story in America for a month.
[39:04.080 --> 39:06.280]  And they basically forgotten it already.
[39:06.280 --> 39:08.320]  They brushed it under the carpet.
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.320]  The police chief who went on a Black Lives Matter march in June, 2020, made his officers
[39:13.320 --> 39:15.400]  kneel to Black Lives Matter.
[39:15.400 --> 39:18.480]  He's brushed it under the carpet and basically that's it.
[39:18.480 --> 39:24.200]  And it's absolutely incredible that they get away with this by saying that he was fleeing
[39:24.200 --> 39:25.200]  the police.
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.200]  The police even said he wasn't fleeing them.
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.960]  Why would you go and mow down 50 people if you're trying to evade police attention?
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.880]  The narrative doesn't hold together.
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.080]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.480]  And we've now still, as you said, right before I went live, I was in the control room, we
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.400]  got TVs and you could see them still saying, oh, we don't know why it happened.
[39:46.400 --> 39:47.400]  It's a mystery.
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.160]  It's such a tragedy.
[39:49.160 --> 39:52.360]  For TV viewers, we roll the footage from up top of building.
[39:52.360 --> 39:58.360]  I mean, he clearly is like driving over person after person after person, like a Frogger
[39:58.360 --> 39:59.800]  video game.
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.120]  And then they're saying this is all an accident.
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.600]  Yeah, you had an eyewitness who said he'd been going down the middle of the road.
[40:07.600 --> 40:09.200]  He swerved and headed downtown.
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.760]  So they said he could have gone down the side of the road where there weren't people.
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.040]  There are numerous roads that he could have turned off that he could have gone down to
[40:16.040 --> 40:18.000]  avoid the public parade.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.080]  As he's apparently trying to evade police attention, he mows down 45 of them, including
[40:23.080 --> 40:26.360]  a dance troupe of grannies, a dance troupe of kids.
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.120]  You've still got 10 kids in the ICU, Alex.
[40:29.120 --> 40:35.600]  I agree, but let's compare that to there's a Black Lives Matter rally that just happened
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.000]  to like five people, 10 people, and then somebody's car barely bumps them.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  That's on the national news.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.920]  Oh, my God, a white person just attacked BLM with no proof.
[40:44.920 --> 40:45.920]  They may have even staged it.
[40:45.920 --> 40:46.920]  We don't even know.
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.040]  This could be Jesse Smollett, but this is now being put on the news as a huge racial
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.600]  attack when there's not even any proof.
[40:53.600 --> 40:56.120]  But the other ones that accident and no big deal.
[40:56.120 --> 41:01.960]  Precisely, and they said the Kyle Rittenhouse incident was a racial attack where he legally
[41:01.960 --> 41:02.960]  defended himself.
[41:02.960 --> 41:06.600]  Well, they said he shot three Black people on MSNBC.
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.440]  The Independent literally put on their front page that he killed three Black people.
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.840]  So they told you for 14 months that Rittenhouse had murdered BLM protesters, or even in some
[41:16.840 --> 41:18.880]  cases they said Black people.
[41:18.880 --> 41:26.160]  Meanwhile, this literal Black supremacist who hates white people runs over 45, 50 white
[41:26.160 --> 41:27.160]  people.
[41:27.160 --> 41:28.160]  He's angry about the Rittenhouse verdict.
[41:28.160 --> 41:31.840]  And it's, oh, no, he was just fleeing the scene of a crime.
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.600]  It makes absolutely no sense given his profile.
[41:35.600 --> 41:40.560]  And then you look at the New York Times, for example, Alex, the day after this happened,
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.760]  they put it on page 22 of the newspaper.
[41:44.760 --> 41:49.760]  Can you imagine if a white supremacist, again, had barreled through a Black Lives Matter parade
[41:49.760 --> 41:56.360]  in an SUV, killed five people, potentially more, injured 45 people, would that be on
[41:56.360 --> 41:57.760]  page 22 of the New York Times?
[41:57.760 --> 42:01.960]  Well, remember when the psycho went and shot poor innocent Black people in South Carolina
[42:01.960 --> 42:02.960]  at the church?
[42:02.960 --> 42:03.960]  That was horrible.
[42:03.960 --> 42:04.960]  We were against it.
[42:04.960 --> 42:05.960]  The media said all whites were guilty.
[42:05.960 --> 42:07.880]  No, that was one crazy person.
[42:07.880 --> 42:11.400]  The point is, admit it's a bad person, whether they're Black, white, whatever.
[42:11.400 --> 42:12.400]  This is crazy.
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.080]  Yeah, Dylan Roof, they had his entire motive laid out within 12 hours of the attack.
[42:18.080 --> 42:21.600]  This guy apparently is just saying nothing, and it's going to have disappeared by the
[42:21.600 --> 42:22.600]  end of the week.
[42:22.600 --> 42:27.360]  By the way, Wikipedia changed their description of the incident from the Waukesha Christmas
[42:27.360 --> 42:28.360]  parade attack.
[42:28.360 --> 42:32.720]  Now they're calling it the Waukesha Christmas parade car crash.
[42:32.720 --> 42:35.640]  It was just a car crash, Alex, maybe an accident.
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.360]  Oh, well, you saw Schumer say, oh, oh, we're going to build better roads.
[42:40.360 --> 42:41.920]  The racist roads caused this.
[42:41.920 --> 42:43.080]  I'm not joking.
[42:43.080 --> 42:44.080]  You saw that.
[42:44.080 --> 42:47.440]  We'll come right back and talk about a similar case in the UK of a hospital getting bombed
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.080]  by an admitted jihadi, and the news is saying he's a Christian.
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.360]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the media is the enemy.
[42:54.360 --> 42:57.560]  It's owned by mega banks that are destroying our countries that want to get rid of the
[42:57.560 --> 42:58.560]  middle class.
[42:58.560 --> 43:04.840]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[43:04.840 --> 43:08.720]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[43:51.640 --> 43:54.840]  Bet on freedom, bet on info wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[43:54.840 --> 43:59.440]  The only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.960]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[44:04.960 --> 44:10.680]  Both the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[44:10.680 --> 44:14.880]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.880]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[44:24.880 --> 44:29.320]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.200]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[44:34.200 --> 44:37.320]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[44:37.320 --> 44:40.680]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[44:40.680 --> 44:45.320]  But even when we win and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.720]  an end and so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[44:51.720 --> 44:59.200]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[44:59.200 --> 45:02.040]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[45:02.040 --> 45:06.480]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.320]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.000]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.960]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[45:20.960 --> 45:25.160]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[45:25.160 --> 45:29.360]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[45:29.360 --> 45:32.060]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[45:52.560 --> 45:53.560]  Check out the new line.
[45:53.560 --> 45:54.560]  It's amazing.
[45:54.560 --> 46:04.760]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was de-platformed.
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.600]  Info wars was right above the target and the globalists were a year out from launching
[46:09.600 --> 46:10.600]  their attack.
[46:10.600 --> 46:16.600]  Three years later, an info wars is still thriving thanks to the support of our audience, but
[46:16.600 --> 46:22.800]  we are now facing the fiercest battle yet and we need you to help save info wars.
[46:22.800 --> 46:27.120]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.200]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[46:30.200 --> 46:34.520]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial.
[46:34.520 --> 46:35.520]  We don't think so.
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.920]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new USA, but we won't let
[46:40.920 --> 46:41.920]  them.
[46:41.920 --> 46:46.000]  Alex Jones will have his day in court with your support.
[46:46.000 --> 46:53.000]  Go to saveinfowars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.200]  Saveinfowars.com and God bless America.
[47:01.200 --> 47:30.000]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.320]  We make jokes about it, but it's not funny.
[47:34.320 --> 47:42.560]  Now in America, CNN, MSNBC are calling in a car accident, a truck attack, an SUV attack.
[47:42.560 --> 47:43.560]  These are the headlines.
[47:43.560 --> 47:46.120]  You've seen them.
[47:46.120 --> 47:54.560]  And now we've got Democrats saying the attack at the Christmas parade is karma for written
[47:54.560 --> 47:55.560]  house acquittal.
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.320]  And of course, it's a weird, crazy white woman.
[48:00.320 --> 48:05.560]  I'm not trying to put white people down, I'm just saying, this is a bunch of leftist
[48:05.560 --> 48:08.600]  people engaged in black magic, basically, who want power.
[48:08.600 --> 48:12.360]  And most of them are white, trying to get power out of making us all kill each other.
[48:12.360 --> 48:13.840]  And I'm sick of it.
[48:13.840 --> 48:19.600]  I'm sick of the racist-ass black people and the weirdo white people pulling their strings.
[48:19.600 --> 48:22.080]  Because they're going to get everybody killed, basically.
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.880]  This is so, while the chai comms brag, covered this earlier, in their newspapers, how they're
[48:27.880 --> 48:31.920]  financing Hollywood to create racial division to bring America down.
[48:31.920 --> 48:32.920]  And then we're all screwed.
[48:32.920 --> 48:33.920]  The whole ship goes on.
[48:33.920 --> 48:34.920]  It's unbelievable.
[48:34.920 --> 48:36.920]  It's so obvious.
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.920]  Paul, going back to you here, you've been all over this.
[48:40.920 --> 48:44.960]  I mean, you produced so many reports on this, written so many articles on it.
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.960]  There's another example.
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.200]  This guy bomb in the hospital, and then the media calls him a Christian.
[48:49.200 --> 48:51.520]  I mean, this is, so they go further now.
[48:51.520 --> 48:53.720]  It's not just cover-up that it's Islamics.
[48:53.720 --> 48:58.000]  They then frame Christians who statistically are the most peaceful people in the world.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Paul Watson of Summit.net.
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.840]  Yeah, this was an incident that happened last Sunday on Remembrance Day during the parade,
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.080]  where this individual was going to a taxi with a suicide bomb.
[49:11.080 --> 49:12.880]  He planned to blow himself up.
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.320]  Thankfully, the taxi driver, who should get the highest honor, the highest medal available,
[49:17.320 --> 49:19.000]  I don't think he has yet.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.760]  He'll probably end up like the Millwall supporter during the London Bridge attacks, who challenged
[49:23.760 --> 49:27.160]  the terrorists and was later demonized as a domestic extreme.
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.680]  In fact, let's remind people of the Lion of London Bridge, what he fought like 10 dudes
[49:31.680 --> 49:35.360]  who stabbed him dozens of times and still kicked their ass and saved people.
[49:35.360 --> 49:36.360]  Yeah.
[49:36.360 --> 49:37.360]  I mean, tell people about that guy.
[49:37.360 --> 49:39.280]  We forget about the Lion of London Bridge.
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.040]  Well, yeah, they ran onto the London Bridge, started mowing people down, jumped out of
[49:44.040 --> 49:46.520]  the car, started stabbing people.
[49:46.520 --> 49:48.040]  This guy is challenging them.
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.840]  He's attacking them, and he's later put on a government watch list because he criticized
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.440]  Islam too much and was too vehement in his opinion.
[49:55.440 --> 49:57.080]  He was made to go take classes.
[49:57.080 --> 49:58.560]  He was made to go take classes.
[49:58.560 --> 50:02.120]  Yeah, he was made to take reeducation classes.
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.800]  The literal hero in stopping the jihadist attack was put on a government watch list.
[50:07.800 --> 50:13.320]  This case in Liverpool last Sunday, so he gets in taxi with a suicide bomb.
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.600]  The taxi driver knows something's up with him.
[50:15.600 --> 50:20.440]  He's fidgeting around with wires, there's smoke emanating from his backpack.
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.000]  The taxi driver drives him to where he wants to go, which is outside of Women's Hospital
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  in Liverpool.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.480]  Now, we don't know whether he planned to attack the hospital or a Remembrance Day
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.480]  parade that was taking place.
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.400]  Just a stone's throw away, by the way, the Remembrance Day parade started at a cathedral.
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.720]  So apparently this Christian convert wants to bomb a Christian cathedral because that
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.520]  makes perfect sense.
[50:44.520 --> 50:47.840]  So thankfully, he ends up just blowing himself up.
[50:47.840 --> 50:49.400]  No one else was seriously injured.
[50:49.400 --> 50:50.960]  The taxi driver survived.
[50:50.960 --> 50:55.040]  Then the media comes out and says he was a Christian convert.
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.640]  Well, we know that they lie because his asylum claim was rejected in 2014.
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.320]  They go to the cathedral and pretend to become Christian convert.
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.880]  So then their asylum application is more likely to be accepted.
[51:08.880 --> 51:13.840]  The fact is, while he was constructing this bomb, he was seen attending a mosque every
[51:13.840 --> 51:16.320]  single day during Ramadan.
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.800]  The week before the attack, he was seen praying in this mosque with fellow Muslims.
[51:21.800 --> 51:25.280]  And yet this lie that he was a Christian convert, he wasn't a Christian convert.
[51:25.280 --> 51:32.120]  He was a fake convert, was still being repeated by the BBC days after this attempted attack
[51:32.120 --> 51:33.120]  happened.
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.320]  So Paul, I mean, at this level, they might as well just say Daryl Brooks was a white
[51:37.320 --> 51:44.040]  supremacist in Wisconsin in Waukesha that ran over 50 black people.
[51:44.040 --> 51:47.480]  I mean, that's the level of this identity theft, this info.
[51:47.480 --> 51:49.320]  I'm not trying to even blame any group.
[51:49.320 --> 51:53.040]  I'm just saying they cover up when one group does it and then lie about written house and
[51:53.040 --> 51:54.560]  say he shot three black people.
[51:54.560 --> 51:55.560]  Not true.
[51:55.560 --> 51:56.560]  It's just next level.
[51:56.560 --> 51:57.560]  This is brainwashing.
[51:57.560 --> 51:59.840]  That's so insane, but they never get in trouble for it.
[51:59.840 --> 52:02.600]  There is the white supremacist that ran over 50 black people.
[52:02.600 --> 52:07.400]  No, their reaction today, the Daily Beast in particular, is they're now going after
[52:07.400 --> 52:13.360]  Tim Paul and Andy Noh saying that they're bad for posting screenshots of this guy's
[52:13.360 --> 52:18.440]  Facebook account where he's like, yes, let's go out and violently attack white people.
[52:18.440 --> 52:20.040]  This guy ran over another white...
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.320]  I'm glad you raised that point.
[52:21.320 --> 52:24.160]  They're now claiming that they're internet trolls who made it up.
[52:24.160 --> 52:26.520]  No, that's really his Facebook and Twitter.
[52:26.520 --> 52:28.200]  That's really his Instagram.
[52:28.200 --> 52:31.240]  That's really who he is, but they can't handle it.
[52:31.240 --> 52:37.400]  Again, if the tables were turned, if a white guy was posting Confederate flags, hatred
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.760]  of BLM and calling for people to go out and violently attack black people, that would
[52:41.760 --> 52:45.000]  be a pretty big part of the story on CNN, wouldn't it?
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  But it's not.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.080]  It's brushing the carpet.
[52:47.080 --> 52:51.520]  This Liverpool attacker, he entered the UK in 2014.
[52:51.520 --> 52:54.520]  His asylum claim was rejected in 2015.
[52:54.520 --> 53:00.560]  He was still in the country six years later, despite his asylum claim being rejected.
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.560]  No one knows who he was.
[53:01.560 --> 53:05.640]  He came from Iraq, whether he was radicalized, he obviously was radicalized.
[53:05.640 --> 53:08.640]  So he remained in the country for six years.
[53:08.640 --> 53:11.800]  They say he was a devout Muslim.
[53:11.800 --> 53:13.960]  You've got at least this in your articles on that news.
[53:13.960 --> 53:16.360]  He was at Mosque repeatedly every week.
[53:16.360 --> 53:20.120]  Yeah, and again, he's another refugee.
[53:20.120 --> 53:24.200]  How many times do we have to have refugees turn into terrorists before we have proper
[53:24.200 --> 53:26.000]  border controls, Alex?
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.200]  The Manchester Arena bomber blew himself up, killed a bunch of kids at the Ariana Grande
[53:31.200 --> 53:40.080]  concert in 2017, a refugee from Libya literally rescued by the Royal Navy by the UK government
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.720]  brought into the country.
[53:41.720 --> 53:45.040]  That's how he repays us by blowing up a bunch of kids.
[53:45.040 --> 53:51.800]  You had the Paris massacre terrorists exploited the refugee wave, pretended to be Syrian.
[53:51.800 --> 53:53.320]  That's how they got into Europe.
[53:53.320 --> 53:54.880]  That's how they killed dozens of people.
[53:54.880 --> 54:00.400]  Oh, I love how they always called 25, 30-year-old men children too, and in Germany and France
[54:00.400 --> 54:03.720]  even put them in middle schools with little kids they then raped.
[54:03.720 --> 54:06.240]  And this is all a sick, lexist joke.
[54:06.240 --> 54:13.600]  Yeah, they literally have 45-year-old men coming in on buses to the UK and say they're
[54:13.600 --> 54:14.600]  children.
[54:14.600 --> 54:19.360]  They did test their teeth even in Sweden and found that they were 40, 50 years old, but
[54:19.360 --> 54:22.640]  we were called racist for pointing out that they're not children.
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.240]  And you had it with the beheading of the schoolteacher in France, Samuel Patti.
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.840]  Again, a refugee brought in by the government ends up killing somebody in France.
[54:32.840 --> 54:36.920]  You had the beheading in Nice, same story, a Chechen refugee.
[54:36.920 --> 54:41.960]  There have been innumerable mass casualty terror attacks carried out across Europe by
[54:41.960 --> 54:47.440]  people either pretending to be refugees, getting into the country on the carpet of the refugee
[54:47.440 --> 54:48.440]  wave.
[54:48.440 --> 54:54.080]  And you have a situation in the UK, Alex, where we've had over 20,000 boat migrants
[54:54.080 --> 54:56.240]  come in this year alone.
[54:56.240 --> 55:02.800]  It turns out the government has only deported out of 20,000 just this year, five of them.
[55:02.800 --> 55:04.200]  And you've seen the videos.
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.280]  They got off the boats, whether it's in the UK, in Spain, wherever, and just run off into
[55:09.280 --> 55:11.080]  the nearest town.
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.120]  Nobody knows who the hell they are, and in many cases they've gone up to blow themselves
[55:15.120 --> 55:16.120]  up.
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.080]  I live, I live backed up to woods and houses and apartments.
[55:21.080 --> 55:26.400]  And my son wants us to be armed now, and we hike down there, because it's almost going
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.400]  around.
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.240]  There are Haitians living and running around the woods behind my house.
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.320]  And this is in West Austin, which is a nice area.
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.080]  This is all over the damn world now, all over the Western world, and it's only just begun.
[55:37.080 --> 55:38.400]  How crazy is this going to get?
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.440]  I know you live in London, you're planning to move out soon, you were telling me off
[55:41.440 --> 55:42.440]  air.
[55:42.440 --> 55:43.440]  It's like uninhabitable now.
[55:43.440 --> 55:44.440]  You can't even go out.
[55:44.440 --> 55:51.320]  It's getting worse, and this government promised to reduce immigration to drastically lower
[55:51.320 --> 55:52.320]  levels.
[55:52.320 --> 55:53.320]  It's completely failed to do so.
[55:53.320 --> 55:56.640]  The only good thing that's come out of this is that now Nigel Farage is saying he's going
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.000]  to get back into politics, and he is the only real opposition in this country, because we
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.680]  have a fake Labour Party opposition, which wants even more open borders.
[56:05.680 --> 56:08.080]  So that's the only good thing that's come out of it.
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.680]  But then again, you had the media reaction after the attempted Liverpool suicide bombing.
[56:12.680 --> 56:19.200]  In 48 hours, Sky News, one of the top broadcasters in the UK, 48 hours after Raji Haddis tried
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.280]  to blow up a hospital, their top headline on their website was about some Pakistani cricket
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.760]  players being called mean words by other cricket players 15 years ago.
[56:31.760 --> 56:35.320]  And that was seen as a more important controversy.
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.360]  Someone being called a mean word 15 years ago, that a literal suicide bomber trying to blow
[56:40.360 --> 56:45.720]  up a hospital or trying to blow up a World War II, World War I memorial, just a stone
[56:45.720 --> 56:47.600]  throw away from where his bomb went off.
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.320]  So again, it's about laying them into the country, and then it's about the media cover
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.720]  up that happens in the immediate aftermath, and that's precisely what you've seen again
[56:55.720 --> 57:01.000]  with this SUV attack, this black supremacist in Wisconsin, and it's only going to continue.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.800]  Exactly, which is all an exercise by the intelligence agencies in the ruling class
[57:05.800 --> 57:11.760]  over the media to see if they can successfully cover up vaccine damages, vaccine deaths,
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.280]  secret operations and crimes committed by the invaders.
[57:15.280 --> 57:16.640]  All of it is a plan.
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.840]  Paul, do five more minutes with us ahead of Roger Stone, joining us with exclusive information
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.120]  on the subpoenas he and I received from the January 6th Tangaroo Court coming up.

[59:50.960 --> 1:00:02.320]  Providing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:20.040]  The year is 2021, the date is Tuesday, November 23rd.
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:23.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, honored to be here.
[1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.200]  Paul Watson, big picture, obviously we've got the WikiLeaks, we've got the documents,
[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:31.680]  we've got Klaus Schwab's public statements, the powerful elites of the world are devaluing
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:34.600]  currencies to use the money to buy up all the infrastructure.
[1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:41.600]  The rearguard action is social conflict, divide and conquer, the empires have used for control.
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:43.000]  Seem like it's going well for them.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.440]  So it seems like we're going into a very dangerous, insane time.
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:50.720]  What would you call this time we're living in and what do you expect them to do in the
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:53.120]  next 11 months ahead of the midterms?
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.240]  Because they know they're about to be repudiated and the globalists are about to lose control
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:58.840]  of their main command base.
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:02.240]  How do you think they're going to strike back?
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.720]  I think they're going to intensify the complete demonization of the unvaccinated, Alex, to
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.680]  the point where you had the Australian minister the other day, and you probably played the
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:17.720]  clip already yesterday, where he's literally saying with like raging bug eyes, which is
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.760]  the common denominator, which all these people have, quote, if you give a green light, give
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:28.520]  comfort to support anybody who argues against the vaccine, you're an anti-vaxxer.
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:32.680]  That's the kind of rhetoric that George W. Bush said when he said, you're either with
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:33.960]  us or with the terrorists.
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:40.120]  The next stage is to literally dehumanize, demonize the unvaccinated as terrorists.
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.080]  And that's precisely what's happening.
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:46.040]  The left pretends to care about oppressed minorities.
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:51.080]  The preeminent oppressed minority today is the unvaccinated.
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.200]  They're dehumanized by the media.
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:55.160]  That's the guy I was talking about right there.
[1:01:55.160 --> 1:02:00.440]  They're dehumanized by the media and violently persecuted by the state.
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:04.920]  We told this lie that we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, Alex.
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:10.200]  The numbers you look out of the UK today, you look at the numbers of people in hospital,
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:17.720]  COVID hospitalizations in the UK, 67% of COVID hospitalizations in the UK are vaccinated
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:18.720]  people.
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:25.600]  When you look at adults, 71% of COVID hospitalizations are vaccinated.
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.800]  So it's not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:30.040]  It's a complete lie.
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:36.440]  And yet they continue to claim that because they need to dehumanize, denigrate the unvaccinated
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:42.400]  so that they can release the wrath of the state in terms of violent persecution against
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:43.960]  the unvaccinated.
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:49.800]  Use them as the scapegoat and abuse them, use them as the example as a warning to intimidate
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:50.800]  other people.
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:58.280]  But again, as you said, it's not really working because even in places like Poland, like Denmark,
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:03.640]  you have large numbers of the population that remain unvaccinated despite this massive
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:06.320]  tyranny and these threats against them.
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:09.320]  And Paul, I want to ask you what comes next in the two minutes we have left and do an
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:10.640]  hour later in the week or next week.
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:14.520]  Please, with respect to your view on this, you're dead on target.
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:17.920]  You've got German government putting out numbers in the UK government that people are twice
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:20.880]  as likely to die if they've had the shot.
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:22.680]  They say they don't know why.
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:25.240]  And then now you're more likely to get sick if you've had the vaccine.
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:27.800]  I mean, even Fauci's having to admit that now.
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:29.440]  So how the hell are they going to get away with this?
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:34.080]  This just seems like they've shot themselves in the foot here.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.200]  In the UK, they're actually trying to lobby the government to not release the statistics
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:41.800]  because they're being cited by the unvacced extremists.
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:46.920]  For example, Alex, this is reported today from official government data, the rates of
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.640]  COVID infection per 100,000 are now higher among the facts than the unvax.
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:55.440]  We have Gibraltar cancelling official Christmas events.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.120]  Their entire adult population is vaccinated.
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:04.440]  They've got a COVID spike, Ireland, 94% adult population vaccinated.
[1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:06.040]  They've got a COVID spike.
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:11.480]  So the entire case for this, the entire case for vaccine passports, which by the way now,
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:16.960]  banning people who can prove they don't have the virus, they're removing that option entirely.
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:19.920]  Their entire case for it has been demolished.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:24.440]  And the only way they can intensify it and step it up is by increasing the intimidation,
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:28.600]  increasing the threats, as we've seen in Austria, by now literally threatening to put people
[1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.680]  in prison for four years if they don't take the vaccine.
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:32.680]  And that's the way it's going.
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.760]  Paul, you do the best job breaking it out over to summit.news.
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:37.640]  And also in full wars, but you're absolutely right.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:41.880]  And now Germany is saying, oh, we may just force inoculate everybody, not just lock you
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:42.880]  in your house.
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:44.680]  I mean, this is here, tyranny's not coming.
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:45.680]  It's here.
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.840]  Watson, thank you so much and have a great Thanksgiving.
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:51.080]  I know you don't really celebrate in the UK, but I'm going to be here eating bugs like
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:52.080]  Bill Gates said.
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.080]  Okay.
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  Okay.
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:55.080]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:56.080]  Thank you.
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:04.760]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:08.800]  of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:15.920]  So right now the real Black Friday sale is beginning and it's only going to run until
[1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:17.320]  the end of the month.
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:25.520]  And that's now only six, seven days info or store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.

[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:36.440]  key amino acids, everything you need for your immune system and your body and it tastes
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:39.200]  great and it funds the info war.

[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:46.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:51.720]  So only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:54.920]  Bet on freedom, bet on info wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:06:06.480]  The only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:37.600]  You say that you wanna go to the land, that's far away, are we supposed to get there with
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:42.800]  the way they will live in today?
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:54.760]  You talk lots about God, freedom comes from the car, but that's not what this bitch wants.
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:07:04.760]  Not what I want at all, I want money, power, and glory.
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:15.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:25.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:41.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:51.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:08:01.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:26.760]  I want money and all your power, all your glory.
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:40.680]  Macartheism on steroids, the year 2021, every major populist nationalist leader has been
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:47.160]  subpoenaed or indicted or even convicted and then pardoned by President Trump.
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:53.280]  We have the global exclusive, Roger Stone, longtime political confidant of the 45th president
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:59.520]  and of course we know the real winner at evidence overwhelming now, joining us to discuss the
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:04.760]  subpoena by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6th attack, which
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:11.280]  again is the progeny of Joseph McCarthy and has gone even further.
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:16.920]  McCarthy didn't put hundreds of people in solitary confinement for nine, 10, 11 months
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:19.240]  without even being able to have a trial.
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  This is incredible.
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:26.120]  So, Roger Stone is here to give us his exclusive take on being subpoenaed along with myself.
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:29.640]  The top story of the United States, hell, in Japan and Germany, it was all over the
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.800]  world yesterday, wasn't a radical black supremacist who said on Twitter and Instagram he was
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:40.520]  going to attack whites or only cowards were standing down, whites need to be attacked
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:45.160]  because the written house verdict, no, no, it wasn't 40-something people run over, five
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:48.080]  of them killed, little kids run over, it wasn't that.
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:56.200]  It was Roger Stone and Alex Jones are evil and the January 6th committees on their tail
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.240]  and now we've gotten the subpoena.
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:01.320]  All these questions about who have we talked to, what have we done, did we ever talk to
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:05.000]  a 3% or did we ever, we want every document out of the sign and of course if you don't
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.440]  comply right, you go to jail unless you plead the 5th and then Mark Rendaza, my chief legal
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:15.400]  counsel on all the flotilla Democratic Party, civil suits is riding shotgun for the hour
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:22.680]  but let's first go to Roger Stone exclusively to give us his first video statement on where
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:24.160]  he stands and what's really going on.
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:27.760]  Roger, I'm actually proud to be here with you being targeted to these people because
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:32.200]  we're pro-America, we're not in trouble because we're bad, we're in trouble because we want
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.840]  back down to evil and we stand for freedom.
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:35.840]  Roger?
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:42.760]  Well Alex, you're absolutely right, this is my first national statement on any medium
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:50.280]  right here at InfoWars just as in the hours after I was framed and charged in the Mueller
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:55.720]  Witch Hunt, it was InfoWars where I did my very first interview to lay out the truth
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:11:00.080]  of that epic struggle and now Alex, whether you like it or not, you're connected to me
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:01.720]  at the hip for the rest of your life.
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:07.640]  We're kind of like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and here's the thing, neither one of us
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:09.760]  did anything wrong.
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:16.560]  This is a politically motivated witch hunt, let's call it Witch Hunt 2.0, I've been disparaged
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:23.080]  and smeared as the promoter of an attack on the American capital on January 6th, despite
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:25.720]  the fact that I wasn't there.
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:32.680]  Any assertion, claim, or implication to the contrary is categorically false.
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:39.280]  There is no evidence or any witness who can honestly come forward and say otherwise, Dustin
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:41.920]  Stockton, I don't know who that is.
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:44.360]  Jennifer Lawrence, don't know them.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.880]  Taylor Budovich, don't know who that is.
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:55.840]  So this is the same ongoing effort we've seen previously where you criminalize constitutionally
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:58.040]  protected political activity.
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:03.760]  You know, the reason I love America is because I love free speech and the Constitution and
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:09.800]  the Constitution guarantees us the right to freely assemble, to petition our government
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:14.120]  and to speak freely on the issues of the day.
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:20.700]  Any activity that I engaged in on January 5th or 6th for that matter was constitutionally
[1:12:20.700 --> 1:12:22.800]  protected free speech.
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:29.120]  I know nothing about unlawful activities at the capital, period, full stop.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:34.680]  There is nothing to turn over, there is nothing to testify against, it's a witch hunt.
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:40.520]  And let me finally add, the chairman of the committee has filed a civil suit against Donald
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:46.200]  Trump and therefore has proven that he is not an unbiased or honest arbiter.
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.320]  This is, this is, gives McCarthy a bad name.
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:53.520]  McCarthy was a good guy comparing to these smear artists.
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  I totally agree, Roger, and we need to focus on that again that this, the head of the committee
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:06.960]  has sued Trump and is going after him on a host of issues, including January 6th.
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:12.920]  How can he then be the judge over this, this whole political, we ask him, but let me ask
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:13.920]  you the big question.
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:19.600]  Obviously I'm not nailing you down here, but I intend to currently go with the fifth.
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:24.840]  Not that I have anything to hide, but I saw how they set you up in the whole Russiagate
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.040]  fraud and hoax, and how I was here when you were trying to get a son, Johnny, when you
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:32.360]  was the time of day, we were all bummed out about it, and they said, oh, you were secretly
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:35.160]  running a son, you know, this, I knew it was a lack as I was there.
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:37.800]  I saw them convict you in a kangaroo court.
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:39.280]  So that got my attention.
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:40.760]  I thought it was a joke back when it was happening.
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:42.720]  I said, don't worry, Roger, you've done nothing wrong.
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:43.720]  No, you were right.
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:44.840]  You said it was serious.
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:48.120]  And so I don't want to be Roger stoned right now in this.
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:51.800]  And that's why our forebears fought the British crown and defeated them for the Fifth Amendment.
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:55.240]  And I think that's why I'm going here, because these guys have no honor.
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:57.840]  No matter what I give them or what I say, they're going to say it's a lie.
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:13:59.360]  So why not just Fifth Amendment?
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:01.320]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.320]  Look, we know the House Democrats leak classified information with impunity.
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:13.840]  They illegally, in my case, consorted with a special prosecutor.
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:15.800]  There's no integrity in this process.
[1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:18.200]  It's not an honest, unbiased content.
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.040]  It's not that I've done anything wrong.
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:25.080]  I'm not going to decide what I'm going to do today, because there is a drop dead date
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:28.880]  on the subpoena of December 17, I believe.
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:33.800]  Other than to say, we have a member of the House Intelligence Committee who was sleeping
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.040]  with a Chinese spy.
[1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:41.040]  Now he has access to national security secrets as a member of the committee.
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:46.000]  His office was penetrated by an employee who was working for that Russian spy.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.600]  But they want to investigate Donald Trump and Roger Stone.
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:52.000]  This is an absurdity.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.960]  We have become clickbait.
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:56.080]  I mean, that's really what this is about.
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:57.600]  I have nothing to do with this.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:59.640]  I know nothing about it.
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:03.360]  I'm many things, Alex, but I'm not stupid.
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.760]  Whoever would think that trespassing at the Capitol or menacing lawmakers, even though
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:14.200]  nobody was armed, would benefit Donald Trump politically, is either an idiot or an amateur.
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:15.200]  Exactly.
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:17.000]  Why would we blow our feet off?
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.040]  It's a nice way of saying, why would we put our dicks in a garbage disposal?
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:24.160]  It's so ridiculous that we'd have a motive for this.
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:30.880]  Well, in my case, it would take a very large garbage disposal, but I'm putting that.
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.760]  With me, it would take a pencil sharpener.
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:35.760]  I'm not going there.
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.960]  It's actually gigantic.
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:38.960]  All right.
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:40.960]  That's going to be the headline.
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  Hold on.
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  That's all satire, folks.
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  That's going to be the headline.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:53.880]  We'll be right back with Mark Reddaza, my chief legal counsel here with us, Roger Stone.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:57.200]  You got to go to the jokes there, Dick Cheney stuff.
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:03.680]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:07.600]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:27.360]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:34.080]  The former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe, disgraced, we have the video, we'll play it
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:35.080]  next segment.
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:40.160]  I watched it this morning and I forgot about it and then I'm telling Roger, hey, what do
[1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:41.160]  you want to cover next?
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:46.080]  He goes, I want to talk about Andrew McCabe saying that Roger Stone is at the center along
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:50.240]  with Alex Jones of this whole giant plan to attack the capital.
[1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:55.040]  Now, this is even bigger hoax than the Russia game and so I've forgotten about that.
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:59.760]  That's a pretty big deal to have this guy out there claiming this fraud again, not that
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:05.120]  we're Russian agents but that we're at the center of the plan to attack the capital.
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:07.240]  So they're really telling us where they're going, Roger.
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:11.160]  Yeah, this is laughable bullshit is what it is.
[1:21:11.160 --> 1:21:13.560]  I mean, let's be very clear.
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:19.080]  I wasn't on the ellipse, I didn't march to the capital, I wasn't at the capital.
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:24.840]  I never left the grounds of my hotel on January 6th and I know nothing about any illegal
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:31.280]  activities on the capital, anywhere around the capital, or if you can see that day, period.
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:35.680]  Andrew McCabe, however, is at the White House center of the Russian collusion hoax.
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:43.480]  And in fact, on the day that I was convicted in a kangaroo style court, you know, a Soviet
[1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:50.360]  show trial in Washington DC, the prosecutor in my case announced that Andrew McCabe would
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:55.640]  not be prosecuted for lying to the FBI about the Russian collusion hoax.
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:56.960]  This is bizarro world.
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:59.560]  The world is upside down.
[1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:00.560]  What's the point?
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:06.920]  Alex, it's just more lawfare, grind you down with legal fees, drag your name through the
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:07.920]  mud.
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:12.160]  Oh, I gotta admit, a lot of these pictures of you and I together look pretty damn cool.
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:15.600]  Well, yeah, they're saying like, next thing we've got to do is kill Batman.
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:16.600]  Like we're villains.
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:18.880]  No, we're like Batman fighting the villains.
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:20.560]  Roger, we got Mark Rondazer.
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:22.080]  He's got a lot of points and questions to ask.
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:23.080]  He's rather subpoena.
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:24.080]  He says it's beyond McCarthy.
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:29.680]  I want to get his take on that, but is it this about distracting from the inflation,
[1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:33.720]  the record gas prices, the Federal Reserve saying eat tofu, not turkey.
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:35.720]  That's a real headline.
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:41.360]  And to the imploding borders and just all the crazy corruption of the Democratic Party.
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:43.240]  Well, that's part of it.
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:48.600]  But the other part of it, frankly, is just the bloodlust against me because I was pardoned
[1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:54.580]  and the bloodlust against you because you supported me in my epic fight for freedom.
[1:22:54.580 --> 1:23:01.840]  So these guys hate us because as Plato said, no one is as hated as the truth teller.
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:03.840]  They like to shut infowars down.
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:08.320]  They'd like to just close you down so you can stop broadcasting the truth.
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:12.600]  This is epically debilitating as you fight no financially.
[1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:19.960]  All of these civil suits and I still face six more baseless, unsubstantiated, groundless,
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:23.800]  but tremendously sensationalized civil suits.
[1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.840]  And now I have to defend myself legally in this proceeding.
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:29.360]  And we're going to talk about that before you leave.
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:35.480]  But this, we are seen as like go back to the Roman standards, like the standard of a legion.
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:38.240]  If they can capture that, that'll demoralize us.
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.000]  And I'm trying to brag, but it's true.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.920]  The left sees Donald Trump as the big standard, Rodgers don't now show his other big standards.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.640]  They're really trying to seize those Mark Rondaza.
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:50.200]  I mean, you said you got into legal stuff reading about McCarthy.
[1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:51.360]  Now you're here.
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:56.880]  You know, I'm an old school liberal and I haven't burst into flames as I've been here.
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:00.480]  You know, and what that means is I believe in freedom of expression for everybody.
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:05.360]  In fact, especially for people I disagree with, not just for people I agree with.
[1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:09.960]  And you know, when I started studying McCarthyism, when I was in journalism school back at U
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:15.720]  Mass, I remember looking at that and thinking, boy, you know, why weren't more people courageous
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:21.640]  enough to stand up and say, I hate communism, but I hate the deprivation of civil liberties
[1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:22.640]  more.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:25.680]  And I thought, boy, you know, it's a shame I wasn't alive back then.
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:30.200]  Well, I tell you, I shouldn't have wished that I would have the ability to be in a fight
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.880]  like that because here I am.
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:37.680]  You know, right now, I think that this is the closest thing to and in fact, it improves
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:42.480]  upon if you if you can use that word, it improves upon how McCarthy did things.
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:45.560]  We have the same exact thing going on.
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:48.720]  We have the press marshaled against people.
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:50.640]  We have the government marshaled against people.
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:51.640]  And why?
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:54.640]  Because you have the audacity to be political dissidents.
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:25:01.400]  Now the only thing different between the populist right right now and the communists back then
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:05.080]  is at least the populist right here has a lot of public support.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:10.560]  The communists at the time had, if anything, a tiny sliver of support because we knew better.
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.560]  We knew better as a country.
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:16.440]  We knew that that was going to lead us to Stalinism or lead us to Maoism, you know,
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:21.840]  but here actually had a populist movement that grew up in alternative media.
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:27.040]  When you had the mainstream corporate press, I tell you, I used to say it acts like Pravda
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:32.040]  for the left, but I think that's actually an inapt comparison.
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:37.440]  It's probably more of an obscure comparison to Radio Mill Colleen in Rwanda before the
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:38.440]  genocide.
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:43.680]  I mean, I see the way that these people talk about you, talk about Roger, talk about anybody
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.040]  who might agree with you, and it is a concerted effort to dehumanize you and to drag you down
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:51.960]  so that we have no dissent in this country.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:58.640]  And dammit, competition is what built America, competition in the capital systems, competition
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:04.760]  in industry, competition in creativity, competition in everything, including the marketplace of
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:05.760]  ideas.
[1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:08.320]  That is why we have a First Amendment.
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:11.520]  And when you want to go in there and shut down one of the carts in the marketplace of
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:17.360]  ideas, you are no longer acting in good faith as an American and shame on this committee
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.360]  for how it's acting.
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:20.080]  Well, amen to that.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.880]  And because multinational corporations are taking over, where do we go next, Roger?
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:28.240]  Because when we talk about the Fifth Amendment, not that we've done anything wrong, but why
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:31.560]  should we have to pay a bunch of lawyers to dig through everything and then just have
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:32.720]  them say we lie?
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:35.400]  The only answer is, hey, Fifth Amendment, I think.
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:39.240]  Well, look, I'm not going to have to decide what I'm going to do about this subpoena.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  I won't decide.
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:42.680]  It has a return date, I believe, in December 17th.
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:44.720]  I'll decide between now and then.
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:47.240]  But this is an effort in distraction.
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:52.160]  Congressman Adam Schiff told us that he had seen substantial evidence of Russian collusion.
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:53.680]  He's never produced a thing.
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:59.960]  Eric Swalwell's office was penetrated by a Chinese communist spy he was sleeping with.
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:06.520]  Jerry Nadler goes crazy about non-existent DOG interference in my case, but now he wants
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:11.160]  the DOJ to interfere in the verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case.
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:16.040]  These people are hypocrites, and this is an effort to distract from their own lies and
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:17.040]  their own crimes.
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:18.040]  You're absolutely right.
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:22.760]  In fact, next segment for TV viewers, radio listeners can imagine, and they're lucky
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:24.040]  they're having a look at it.
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:30.040]  I mean, you look at the Penguin Nadler, and you look at Pelosi, and you look at Swalwell.
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:32.040]  They're a legion of morons.
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:37.280]  These are ridiculous people, perched on top of America's back that have sold us out to
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:38.280]  China.
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.480]  They should be very easy to get rid of politically.
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:47.400]  Well, look, the real question is in 2022, will we have a fair, honest, transparent election?
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:49.600]  If we do, these people are toast.
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:53.800]  I mean, gas prices are heading to $8 a gallon before it's over.
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:58.320]  You're going to see far, far more deaths and injuries from the COVID-19 vaccination as
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:02.200]  they attempt to make it mandatory, compulsory.
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:08.200]  You have us being pushed around, around the world by the Chinese, by the North Koreans
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.200]  again.
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:11.720]  The Russians are masked on the borders of Crimea.
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:12.720]  Why?
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:18.680]  Because Joe Biden exudes weakness, and our adversaries can see that.
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:20.040]  You are around Alex.
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:24.040]  Do you remember any food shortages under President Donald J. Trump?
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:26.800]  Did we have high gas prices under Donald J. Trump?
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:30.360]  Were we having to beg gasoline from the Russians and the Saudis?
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:31.360]  No.
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:37.880]  So they want to distract from the horrific conditions in America under this incompetent
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:41.320]  and probably illegitimately elected president.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:42.800]  I totally agree with you.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:47.680]  This is a ruling class out of control collapsing, rotting, dying, and they're projecting their
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:51.920]  own death fears onto us trying to bring America with us into their death spiral.
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:55.360]  We're sorry they're all physically dying, but they all will be dead soon.
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:03.640]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:07.520]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:24.120]  Info War Store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:25.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:27.240]  It's our best seller.

[1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:45.440]  at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:50.320]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:53.560]  Bet on freedom, bet on Info Wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:58.000]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:04.320]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy
[1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:05.320]  pills.
[1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:11.360]  But almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides, horrible
[1:31:11.360 --> 1:31:16.320]  crashes and again so many toxins on them.
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:22.760]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at InfoWarStore.com are clean, are pure, are
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:29.040]  highest quality and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind and right now our
[1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:36.120]  strongest product of the three tropics we have, RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra and
[1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:41.080]  TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:44.560]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:47.400]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:55.320]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash and it's available right
[1:31:55.320 --> 1:31:58.520]  now and it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:06.320]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:11.520]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna
[1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:16.880]  and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies
[1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:22.000]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.720]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press it's not getting
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:30.080]  any circulation, it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:32.040]  like Instagram or Twitter, it's just crazy.
[1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:37.760]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:42.480]  hurt anybody, your conspiracy theorists if you say it, it's just crazy.
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:45.720]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:50.480]  are going to cause heart problems and they gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:54.280]  That's why InfoWars is on air because if we weren't on air they'd get away with even
[1:32:54.280 --> 1:32:55.440]  more of this crap.
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:56.440]  This is just insane.
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:32:59.120]  These people are killers.
[1:32:59.120 --> 1:33:09.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:27.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:39.000]  Alright, welcome back, Roger Stone, Rodin Schaget, one of this global exclusive.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.800]  And Mark Rendazza is a top First Amendment lawyer and more, but during the little short
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:46.200]  break, I said why do you think they're doing this?
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:51.360]  He just did this two minute rant to me that was absolutely on target and amazing.
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:56.400]  Can you repeat, I know it's hard to repeat, genius again on cue, but I mean repeat what
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:33:58.640]  you just said during the break.
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:06.120]  In 2008, I actually donated to and volunteered on the Obama campaign and we laughed at the
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:11.360]  fact that the Republicans didn't really understand the Internet at that point.
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:15.600]  And we just looked at the Internet as digital Massachusetts.
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:19.480]  There was no point in putting much effort into it because the Republicans weren't even
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:20.480]  going to show up.
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:24.960]  Well, in 2016, in those intervening eight years, a lot of people on the right learned
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:26.440]  how to use the Internet.
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:32.560]  And then all of a sudden, this alternative media is what came into play.
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:35.440]  People who weren't in the mainstream corporate press.
[1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:40.880]  That mainstream corporate press has acted hand in hand with the Democratic Party for decades.
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:47.140]  So Democrats watched their own newsfeed, their own pravda, and all that got regurgitated
[1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:51.720]  back to them was what a joke the Trump campaign was, what a joke people like you were, what
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:53.200]  a joke all it was.
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:55.680]  And they just weren't prepared for it.
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:00.280]  They were as shocked as anybody was the next morning when they woke up and they saw that
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:01.600]  Trump had won.
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:05.880]  And I think they looked at that and they swore they'd never be caught like that again.
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:10.420]  Now what a real American would do at that point is say, how did we lose in the marketplace
[1:35:10.420 --> 1:35:11.520]  of ideas?
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:13.440]  How do we retool our arguments?
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:17.720]  How do we get to connect with the American people, these people who are patriotic, who
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:20.720]  believe in America, who believe in the Constitution?
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:25.680]  But instead, they looked to the other direction and they decided that they were going to try
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:30.760]  to win the marketplace of ideas by shutting down the opposing store in that marketplace.
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:33.560]  They want the classic purge authoritarian model.
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:36.400]  Just come out, shut down opposing media.
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:40.960]  And you notice that first they started with people that it was easy to start with.
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:45.680]  They tested the waters with Milo and then they kept moving along and they kept hitting
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:46.680]  other people.
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:51.640]  Well, just say it, they demonized me particularly so that when Roger Stone and I got banned,
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:54.720]  people wouldn't stand for us and then every domino fell, so we'll talk about the way to
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:55.720]  counter that.
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  One by one.
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:35:59.400]  So I'm going to take on how we counter that in a moment, but Roger, responding to what
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:03.400]  Rondaza just said, you're right, what you said is so important before break, I cannot
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:04.600]  stress this enough.
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:07.840]  This is all a distraction from the Gisling Maxwell pedophile trial.
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.560]  This is all a distraction from the open borders.
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:14.640]  This is all a distraction from the dollar devaluation and Biden dumping the strategic
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.760]  oil reserve on the market and oil prices didn't really go down.
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:22.800]  I mean, so speak to that and where do they go when they're crashing and burning and
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:29.480]  national polls have 67% of people, even in fake polls, hating him, it's probably 80%.
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:33.720]  I've never seen such a cratering here as a long term political hand.
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:35.400]  What do you read the tea leaves?
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:41.280]  Well, first of all, let me say I have the highest possible regard for Mark Rondaza was
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:44.200]  a man of integrity and is a great lawyer.
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:49.440]  In fact, if you read M. Stanton's book, blacklisted by history, which and culture called the second
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:54.200]  greatest book after the Bible makes a pretty good case that there was communist subversion
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:56.600]  in America in the 1950s.
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:59.240]  Now it's McCarthy's tactics we don't like.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:04.200]  And in this case, these are the tactics of McCarthy, the tactics of smear, the tactics
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:07.760]  of vilification, and that's exactly the point.
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:10.000]  We have become clickbait.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.040]  We're being attacked because it just makes the left drool.
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:20.960]  The reason my wife was attacked outside our home last Christmas by some left-wing lunatic,
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:27.300]  the reason that there's so much hatred, I mean, literally a tsunami of hate on Twitter
[1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:33.840]  against me, against Alec Jones, against Owen Shroyer is because we are cutting through
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:37.320]  the BS to tell people the truth.
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:42.840]  There is a disproportionate amount of red Chinese influence in our government today.
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:48.480]  We have an authoritarian and politicized Department of Justice in which the FBI breaks
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:54.880]  into the home of journalists like James O'Keefe to try to determine who their sources are.
[1:37:54.880 --> 1:38:00.800]  This is to have a chilling effect on every other journalist in America.
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:04.960]  Those guys at the New York Times and the Washington Post who may be shortling, you better be
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:08.480]  very careful because they may be next.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:10.800]  Freedom of the press is out the window.
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:17.720]  In fact, their answer to being challenged on any intellectual basis is censorship, is
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:21.840]  deplatforming, is in fact outright cancellation.
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:24.960]  And then it's trying to put you in prison like they're doing to you and I over and over
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:25.960]  again.
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:26.960]  I mean, let's not forget you got pardoned.
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:28.520]  And again, I like Roger.
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:32.160]  Roger's a really smart, funny guy to hang out with, great insights, always very careful
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:33.160]  about being accurate.
[1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:35.080]  People always say he's this big villain liar.
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:37.800]  I remember saying, you want to job at him for us.
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.840]  Am I trying to act tough like, oh, he wanted a job, but he did obviously want to get paid.
[1:38:40.840 --> 1:38:41.840]  You know, he's a capitalist.
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:43.640]  And I'm like, listen, I love you as a show.
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.520]  I love you as a guest, but I want Julian Assange and I want this and that.
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:52.280]  And then if you can get big guests for the show, I will pay you the nice sum he want.
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:53.680]  And he goes, I'll get on it.
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:56.640]  I'm talking to this Randy Kredico and they tell me it's big.
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:59.760]  So I already knew that Roger told the truth to Congress.
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.560]  I knew he didn't have a contact with Assange.
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:03.680]  I was there.
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.840]  And then I watched him convict him of something he didn't do because I was laughing at Roger
[1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:09.840]  before.
[1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:11.160]  I thought it was a, I mean, he used to get mad at me.
[1:39:11.160 --> 1:39:12.160]  He said, listen, sir.
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:13.160]  You need to watch out.
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:14.160]  And he was right.
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:17.800]  So now I listen to Roger, but that's why I take this very serious this time, even though
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:21.080]  we're totally innocent because these people are crazy.
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:27.840]  Well, look, on November 3rd, 2020, only because Buzzfeed brought a lawsuit, Robert Mueller
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:33.160]  and the Department of Justice were forced to release the last remaining long hidden
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:37.800]  redactions in their secret report in which they admitted that there was quote, no factual
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:44.120]  evidence tying me to Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration, or the phishing and publication
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:47.180]  of John Podesta's highly embarrassing emails.
[1:39:47.180 --> 1:39:49.120]  So what then was my motive to lie?
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:50.840]  What was I lying about?
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:58.240]  Any misstatement I made before Congress was irrelevant, immaterial, hid no underlying crime.
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:04.560]  Now we see Dr. Anthony Fauci lies his ass off before Congress, Rand Paul does a spectacular
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:08.200]  job of nailing him, but when will he be charged?
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:14.400]  When will 29 FBI agents storm his home at six o'clock in the morning and march his wife
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.560]  out of the house, uh, in her nightgown?
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:20.840]  So let me ask you this question in Mark Rondaza.
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:24.640]  Why do intelligent people with high IQs and I'm not bragging, we're obviously not low
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:25.640]  IQ here.
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:26.640]  I think we're all above 100.
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.320]  I think it's fair to say.
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:32.240]  Why do we get chivalry like let's not break rules, let's have agreed upon, let's not do
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:37.040]  dirty things, not because we're just wimps, but because we know it'll be done to our family.
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:41.040]  Why are they breaking all the rules, doing all this, not knowing it's going to summon
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:42.040]  their own destruction?
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:47.520]  I just think they're, they don't think a few moves ahead, Roger, well, except I think
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:51.880]  you have to recognize the single greatest trait they have is arrogance.
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:58.240]  They're extraordinarily arrogant, uh, and that permeated the Mueller investigation.
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:01.880]  It permeated, uh, the special counsel's office.
[1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:05.560]  It permeates today, the Biden justice department.
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:09.360]  They are the law, uh, and that means that they cut corners.
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:13.280]  Look, I'm being sued by the Biden department, I mean, look at these guys in the video talking
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:14.280]  about us.
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:17.120]  I mean, they look like, look at the arrogance of both all of them.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:18.920]  I mean, look at these people.
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:20.280]  You wouldn't have these people over for dinner.
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:24.920]  You would, they all look like, they look like supervillains or just like, they're radiating
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:25.920]  evil.
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.680]  Well, you can always tell when they're lying, you see, their lips are moving.
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:31.680]  That's the kind of job.
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  I know that's McCabe right there.
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.320]  I know the bimbo in the middle, but who is the, who is the guy that looks like Dr.
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:36.320]  Evil over here?
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:37.320]  I don't know.
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.720]  He looks brain dead to me.
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:41.320]  Uh, he's like an arrogant son of a bitch to me.
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  Yeah.
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:43.520]  No, he attacked me a couple of weeks ago.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:47.400]  I can't even remember his name, but right now I don't want to boost his name ID and
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:48.880]  give him more followers.
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:52.440]  Uh, you know, this is, this whole thing is an absurdity.
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:54.000]  So yesterday I thought about it.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  You know what?
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.160]  The house, January 6th committee, been there, done that, I've gotten the t-shirt.
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:02.440]  It says Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.800]  Alex, the greatest single problem here, as you know, is the enormous expense.
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:09.680]  Look what you're going through in the Sandy Hook case.
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:11.880]  Look what I'm going through fighting this.
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:12.960]  My coffers are empty.
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.800]  My legal defense fund is bad.
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:15.800]  Hold on, hold on.
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:18.000]  We're going to both do a big plug to support us because you're right.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:19.600]  I want to explain this to listeners.
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:23.640]  I already sold my nice house that was an investment to fund this operation.
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:24.840]  I love my little house.
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:25.840]  I'm not complaining.
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:29.320]  I got my Dodge car and my F-150 on a happy gamble.
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:33.280]  They can't, I don't care about money, but money keeps us in the war.
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:36.080]  Like if you've got an army, you got to feed them, you got to keep them closed, you got
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:37.360]  to sharpen their swords.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:43.280]  And so, yes, infowarsstore.com, buy the great products, get them, save infowars.com.
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.160]  But Roger, when we come back, we're going to do a big, fat, juicy plug for you because,
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:51.520]  yes, you are such a prize to them that I get, like, when they're going to get you, I go,
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:52.520]  myself.
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:56.520]  So it's had the reverse psychology of me going from liking you to loving you because I get
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:42:57.520]  it.
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:03.560]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was the platform.
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:08.480]  Infowars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching
[1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:09.480]  their attack.
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:15.440]  Three years later, an infowars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:21.680]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save infowars.
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:26.000]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:29.080]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:33.400]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial.
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:34.400]  We don't think so.
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:39.640]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:40.640]  let them.
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:43.480]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:50.200]  With your support, go to saveinfowars.com now and give your donation to save the First
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:51.200]  Amendment.
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:44:04.480]  God created each and every one of us with free will, but we look at the world system
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:07.880]  now openly announcing the mark of the beast.
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:13.120]  Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:19.360]  us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics,
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:23.560]  our very future over to them.
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:25.320]  They want control of procreation.
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:28.280]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:34.040]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:39.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image, and given free will.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:44.320]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:50.200]  time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:45:00.240]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.240]  Your voice counts.
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:09.840]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:11.360]  They know you're angry.
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:15.640]  And now, to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:16.640]  we've got.

[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:28.480]  Trashing the lies and disinformation.
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:33.600]  You know, Rick Linklater is a nice guy and he called me up 20 something years ago, put
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:36.440]  me in the first movie I was in, put me in another, and then I got a bunch of movie offers
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:39.160]  after that and I had no thrill seeing myself on the big screen.
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.640]  I don't care about being on the national news, I don't care about meeting powerful rich people,
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:48.760]  but I love being on the zeitgeist fighting tyranny and knowing all of these listeners
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:54.000]  and all these great people and folks that stand against tyranny, that to me is exciting
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.720]  and you are the real rock stars in my life.
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:00.720]  I mean, I like, I love Ted Nugent's music, he's got some of the best music out there,
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:07.640]  but the fact that he's been fighting them since the 70s and is a trailblazer I admire.
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:14.040]  It's not about the great guitar he plays, it's about how he stands up for what's right.
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:16.720]  Now let's talk about Andrew McCabe.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.700]  He's won back full FBI pension after being fired under Trump, the Hill reports, and all
[1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:23.200]  his legal bills paid.
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:27.840]  Well, I never got my legal bills paid, the Democratic Party, the same folks that bankrupted
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.400]  Remington filed six Sandy Hook suits.
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:37.480]  We're down to four of them right now and we got two others we're dealing with, okay?
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:38.480]  That's the level.
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.640]  People say, well, you know, I'm like a baby bird begging for money here.
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:42.640]  Yeah.
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:43.640]  Folks, we're the tip of the spear.
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:49.800]  If you want us to keep fighting, if you want us to stand up, I mean, we are the champions
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:53.440]  of freedom and I'm not up here like some arrogant son of a bitch going, because that's bad luck.
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:54.600]  Oh man, I'm your champion.
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  I'm the big daddy.
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.560]  No, I'm not the big daddy.
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  I'm somebody that couldn't battle their evil and wouldn't go away and understood they were
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:03.200]  evil and that had to be resisted.
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:05.160]  So that's why I want you to spread the word about us.
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:06.160]  I want you to pray for us.
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:08.160]  I want you to support us at m4shore.com.
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:09.680]  I want you to support Roger Stone.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:12.760]  Everybody in America should be wearing a Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt.
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:16.040]  I always got new t-shirt designers that were always great, but I'm jealous the new one
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:20.760]  he's got from big daddy distributors, big daddy unlimited, big gun company in Florida.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:23.800]  I want those, but we're going to talk about those in a moment because we got to stay on
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:24.800]  air.
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:26.520]  You got to, you know, show your colors loud and proud.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:30.560]  And let me tell you, wearing an info or shirt or Roger Stone shirt, you can't be more avant
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:31.560]  garde.
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:32.800]  You can't be more Americana.
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:34.000]  You can't be more populous.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.240]  You can't be more rebel.
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:37.040]  You can't be more outlaw.
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:40.320]  I mean, they called Willie Nelson and Willem Jennings who I love outlaw country because
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.480]  they moved to Austin instead of Nashville and saying like they wanted to, we're taking
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:47.560]  on the new world order folks and we need your support.
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:52.400]  But here is what Roger Stone was talking about McCabe, the disgraced former deputy director
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:57.720]  that lied to Trump, lied to Congress, everything up there talking about us being his enemies.
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:03.080]  So the good news is if this big powerful man is up late at night wanting to put us in prison,
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:05.920]  that shows he's not as powerful as this criminal claims.
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:07.160]  And yeah, I call him a criminal.
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:08.160]  Here it is.
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:12.800]  I'll front now Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI in LA Honig, who was an
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:16.400]  assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District here in New York.
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.560]  Director McCabe, both Alex Jones and Roger Stone, of course, were in Washington on the
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.680]  day of the insurrection, the day before.
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:26.640]  They were both incredibly vocal proponents of pushing the big lie about the election
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:28.520]  rigged hoax, all of that.
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:32.600]  They have longstanding ties to Steve Bannon, who is the one who convinced Trump to come
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:35.760]  back to Washington for January 6th.
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:40.040]  So how central to this could they be?
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:45.920]  Well, Aaron, I think they could be right at the red-hot center of it.
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:53.680]  And I think the committee has kind of telegraphed what they're thinking with each round of subpoenas
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:54.960]  that we see coming out.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:51:02.840]  And for my money, what seems clear is they are focused intently not on specifically the
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:09.480]  mayhem of the insurrection on January 6th, but on the days leading up to January 6th.
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:14.800]  They are trying to get to who was at the center of planning this activity.
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:16.640]  How was it funded?
[1:51:16.640 --> 1:51:18.560]  Where were those communication networks?
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:19.560]  Who was involved?
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:20.800]  Who was talking to who?
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:23.040]  And how does this potentially get back to the White House?
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:28.000]  And of course, the ultimate question was the violence part of the plan.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.760]  And I think these subpoenas are a great way of closing down the loop on those questions
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:35.280]  and really getting to the center of it.
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:36.280]  Right, right.
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:37.280]  Yes.
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:38.280]  I can't listen anymore to this.
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:40.960]  Roger, only two folks can respond to this in the world.
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:44.200]  You and I, were we the big, hot, juicy, red center?
[1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:46.120]  That was a pink center, but...
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:52.000]  No, actually, Andrew McCabe is the White-hot center of the Russian collusion hoax.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.760]  He's the one who knows the steel dossiers of fraud, but allows it to be used, the rationale
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:59.160]  for an illegal investigation.
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:03.520]  Then she says, I'm a close associate of Steve Bannon's.
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:04.960]  What planet does she live on?
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:08.960]  Steve testified against me at my trial, falsely purged himself to help...
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:12.480]  Yeah, I've asked you, even though I know he did that, to just drop it.
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:14.960]  You attack him like a piranha on the show.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:15.960]  They all know that.
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:17.680]  I mean, your feud is famous.
[1:52:17.680 --> 1:52:20.680]  Well, it's not some minor political scuffle.
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:23.880]  They were trying to give me seven to nine, and he was trying to help them.
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:26.720]  So you can see how I might be somewhat upset about that.
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:27.920]  That's not the point here today.
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:30.960]  The point is, he's a damn liar and knows it.
[1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:33.280]  Well, that is exactly true.
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:37.460]  There's one other guy here that has to be mentioned, and that is Owen Schreuer.
[1:52:37.460 --> 1:52:40.720]  You can go to givesengo.com right now.
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:45.640]  We're only $2,000 short of raising a quarter of a million dollars for his legal defense.
[1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:47.880]  He's done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:51.280]  From what I can see, and I've read his indictment, it's a fraud.
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:55.720]  Owen Schreuer deserves your support, because he too is a truth teller.
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:53:00.720]  And he too is being smeared and disparaged and vilified when he did nothing illegal.
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:01.720]  Absolutely.
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:05.000]  And InfoWars will continue to solicit his support, and we appreciate that.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:09.080]  But Roger, let's talk about you, because your wife's got stage 4 cancer in a place
[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:10.080]  she gets better.
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:13.280]  They beat her up outside at your apartment where you live.
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:14.280]  They celebrate.
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:15.280]  They took your house away.
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:17.480]  And again, you're that standard they're trying to seize.
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:18.680]  I love the new t-shirt designs.
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:23.200]  Where people find all these new great Roger Stone t-shirts and support what you're doing?
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:28.360]  They can go to rogerstonestore.com, rogerstonestore.com.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:31.480]  They can go to stonecoachtruth.com in the store.
[1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:36.640]  But most importantly, I need people to go to stonedefencefund.com.
[1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:40.720]  By law, those funds can only be used for my legal defense.
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:46.320]  I need lawyers, new lawyers, because I'm not going to roll over to the deep state.
[1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:49.760]  And I will never plead to something that I didn't do.
[1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:53.320]  As you know, I was pressured to bear false witness against the president.
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:55.720]  I could have gotten off the hook by doing that.
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:59.400]  I refused, because Michael Cohen, I am not.
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:04.560]  And by the way, they want to make examples of us to destroy us, to intimidate anybody
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:05.560]  else that might stand up.
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:08.200]  That's why we don't just want to survive, we want to thrive.
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:11.360]  That's why if you want to save America, you should support Roger Stone.
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:12.720]  You support InfoWars.
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:14.120]  You should do it right now.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:18.400]  Mark Rundaza comments on what we're seeing with Andrew McKay, the disgraced former deputy
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:22.480]  director that lied to Congress up there trying to say that we're the hot red center of this.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:24.000]  Look, I just don't see it.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:27.080]  You know, it's it's more reds like communists to them.
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:32.880]  I mean, I look, I've seen you guys say things that were politically incendiary, say things
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:35.960]  that are on politically dissenting.
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:37.680]  And that's the point of America.
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:38.680]  Damn it.
[1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:41.680]  You know, I remember, I don't know how many people have seen this movie, but there was
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:46.360]  a movie that came out during the Bush administration that was supposed to be an oblique attack
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:47.600]  on its excesses.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:50.040]  And I think it had some excesses as well.
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:51.120]  Good night and good luck.
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.440]  It was about the McCarthy.
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:53.440]  Excellent movie.
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:54.440]  About Edward R. Murrow.
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:59.680]  But, you know, you can watch that and that is a parable that fits any political excess.
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:04.640]  And if you watch that, watch that now and watch it and look at what they're doing now.
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:06.160]  It's way worse than McCarthy.
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:07.800]  You know what I don't agree with it.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:09.720]  And, you know, I respectfully disagree with both of you.
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:12.240]  This isn't this is supposed to be a distraction.
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:13.240]  I don't think it is.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:14.760]  I think it's the main event.
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.200]  I think they want a civil war, but they want it in a very elegant way.
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:22.000]  They want it against unarmed opponents.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  They want it against the indefensible.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.840]  They want to limit the people who are willing to stand up to them to a tiny small group
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:30.480]  and then eliminate them.
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:34.960]  And then all the people who are sort of right in the middle or no, I agree with you that
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:36.760]  they want to scare them.
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:37.760]  It's a psychological.
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.520]  In June, Biden said the new terror threat isn't Islam or anything.
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:45.760]  It's American citizens that protest and soccer moms and so, yeah, you're right, don't you?
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:46.760]  You're right.
[1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  I actually agree with you.
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:50.200]  They're trying to kick off a war against the American people.
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:54.520]  An American president saying the greatest threat is other Americans.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:58.840]  If you've got other Americans that aren't in favor of the government, the government's
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.080]  not doing its job.
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:04.840]  Yeah, like it's a government of the people or the people and, you know, why the people?
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:08.680]  We have to do, you know, one thing I hear from a lot of people that agree with you.
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:11.800]  A lot of people come up to me and they say, hey, you know, don't tell anybody this, but
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:14.040]  you know, I think Alex is right.
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:16.560]  I'm like, why are you saying it that way?
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.560]  Say it loud.
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:20.640]  If you believe, if you agree with Alex, say it loud.
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:23.040]  If you don't agree with him, say it loud.
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:26.760]  Don't be cowed by, you know, I just don't want to get in any trouble because that kind
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:33.080]  of silence is what's causing this because at least half this country doesn't believe
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:35.000]  that this is how the country should be governed.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.720]  You know, I think that they are, they are acting in a way that they think that they
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:44.440]  might have the ability to make that final coup de grace, that final move and they're
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:45.440]  acting without honor.
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:46.440]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:47.800]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:48.800]  Great points, Mark Rondoso.
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:54.200]  And it's, and it's terrifying, you know, and, and frankly, look, I represent so many different
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:58.400]  people from so many different walks of life and so many places in that marketplace of
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:01.440]  ideas and I don't care what they have to say.
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:05.880]  In fact, the more I disagree with somebody, the more I'm happy to represent them.
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:09.680]  And, you know, I want to tell you just a tale of something happy.
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  Right.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  Stay there.
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:12.680]  We got to come back.
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:15.560]  15 more minutes with Mark Rondoso and of course, the great Roger Stone.
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:17.280]  And then we've got Jake Ducey coming in here.
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:21.160]  I got all the CIA, man control documents, stuff we've never covered, literal, the most powerful
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:26.160]  stuff we've ever covered on freeing your mind is coming up in the last hour and 45 minutes
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:29.800]  and it all ties into reset wars and reset wars.com.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:34.680]  But Roger Stone and Mark Rondoso are the top first went lawyers in the country straight
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:35.680]  ahead.
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:39.680]  We're going to put bookends on this thing and he'll tell us happy story.
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:40.680]  Stay with us.
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.680]  But Roger, again, where do they donate?
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:44.680]  Donedefensefund.com.
[1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:45.680]  All right.
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:52.640]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:56.560]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:03.680]  So right now the real Black Friday sale is beginning and it's only going to run until
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:10.440]  the end of the month and that's now only six, seven days info or store official Black Friday
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.280]  special has arrived.
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:14.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.

[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:42.640]  Bet on freedom, bet on info wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[1:58:42.640 --> 1:58:46.920]  The only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:46.920 --> 1:58:48.360]  I know you're humble.
[1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:54.320]  I know you're like me, but I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate.
[1:58:54.320 --> 1:59:01.240]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars over the years
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:09.240]  have changed the world in incredible ways and now as 2021 prepares to end at 2022 begins
[1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:10.240]  to dawn.
[1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:15.200]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are that you be more active
[1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:16.360]  than you've ever been.
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.600]  The tip of the sphere is band up.
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:23.800]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is info wars.com and we can't stay
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:25.000]  on air without your support.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.320]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:32.760]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air and save info wars.com and save info
[1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:35.800]  wars.com and continue to go to info wars store.com.
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:40.920]  But right now we've got turbo force sold out for months, 10 hours of energy back in stock
[1:59:40.920 --> 1:59:49.000]  with free shipping, 40% off and so many other great products.
[1:59:49.000 --> 2:00:00.520]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:00.520 --> 2:00:16.280]  So we have a corrupt out of control political system that's sold out American power in
[2:00:16.280 --> 2:00:20.680]  the last 40 years of China, one side of deals, I'll be all about doing trade deals, we build
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:21.680]  everybody up.
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:25.520]  That's not how it worked because they had an axe to grind politically wanting to deindustrialize
[2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:27.560]  the nation for political control.
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:28.560]  How do I know?
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:34.880]  It's in Zbigniew Brzezinski books the bastard wrote, burning hell, you and your daughter.
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:39.720]  But and people say, oh God, Alex is so mean that they literally destroyed the industrial
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:42.320]  base of the country so they could control us and put us on welfare.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:44.000]  I hate these people.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.880]  I don't want to kill them and I don't want to with violence against them, but I'm not
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:48.160]  putting up with them.
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.360]  So Mark Rundaz, a First Amendment lawyer here with us, you read the subpoena, you've
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:57.360]  gone over it, and we'll go back to Roger in a moment, but you said you had a happy story
[2:00:57.360 --> 2:00:58.360]  to tell.
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:00:59.360]  I do.
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:04.200]  I represent, like I was saying before the break, I represent people all across the political
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:05.200]  spectrum.
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:09.800]  I'll have one person that hates the other one that I'm representing at the same time and
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:14.040]  I represent a group of very conservative Christians called Church Militant.
[2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:19.560]  I also happen to represent the Satanic Temple and Church Militant was trying to have a rally
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:20.560]  in Baltimore.
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:25.480]  But Baltimore is currently under what I call woke rule and Baltimore tried to ban them
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:29.120]  from being there and we fought them, we fought them all the way to the Fourth Circuit Court
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.680]  of Appeals and I am proud to say that we won.
[2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:35.080]  But when we got up to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, you know who came in to file an
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:39.680]  amicus brief on the Christian side, the Satanic Temple.
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:43.720]  So when you got Satanists coming up saying, hey, we want to stand up for the principles
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:47.440]  of people that we hate, we disagree with them so fundamentally.
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:48.440]  Sure.
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:51.160]  I have listeners that didn't get mad at me because I've been honest and I brought up
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:52.160]  the fact that you've done that.
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:55.160]  If you don't support everybody's free speech, it doesn't exist.
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:56.280]  It's like the Second Amendment.
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:00.280]  I don't care whether you're a Christian or whether you are an agnostic or a devil or
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:01.280]  a spirit.
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:02.280]  You have a right to a gun.
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:04.440]  You have a right to use it on me unless I attack you.
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:05.440]  So I get that.
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:09.320]  I mean, either you agree to free will because God, God, God agrees with free will.
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:10.320]  I believe so.
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:14.560]  Look, when somebody asked me, you know, how can you represent these people?
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:16.840]  Where is the line at which you wouldn't?
[2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:18.040]  Because they are a group of losers.
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:19.040]  I've seen them on TV.
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:21.560]  Let me tell you where the line is for whose speech I would stand up to.
[2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:23.360]  I don't have one.
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.240]  There is no way because if you have one, then you don't believe in free speech.
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:31.080]  What you believe in is your tribe and you just use good point.
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  Roger Stone.
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:33.080]  Where is all this going?
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:35.400]  I mean, because I let me tell you some more of this story.
[2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:36.400]  What's great about it?
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:40.320]  Here's the Star Spangled Flying Sparks of it.
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:41.320]  They came in.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:44.600]  They helped those Christians win the right to have their rally.
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:50.160]  Then they had their rally and then the Satanist showed up to protest against that rally.
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:53.880]  Some of the Christians got a little upset and I said, hold on and I explained to them,
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:56.240]  these people fought for your right to be here, too.
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:02:58.520]  They said, well, why are they protesting against us?
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.880]  And I said, because that is what America is all about.
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:01.880]  Sure.
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:02.880]  They were all about the most.
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:06.640]  Really, libertarians trying to dress up and I called everybody was peaceful.
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:10.080]  Even Antifa showed up to protest against it and they did so peacefully.
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:11.080]  It was it was sure.
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:13.040]  We need to rediscover those American values.
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:15.040]  What do you make of that amazing story, Roger Stone?
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:21.160]  Well, what bothers me, Alex, is I cannot allow it to get into the specifics of the subpoena,
[2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:25.640]  but essentially what they're trying to do is take constitutionally protected political
[2:03:25.640 --> 2:03:28.320]  activities and somehow criminalize them.
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:32.920]  Yes, I did urge people to go to a rally to support President Donald Trump.
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:39.440]  Yes, I did question the extraordinary number of irregularities and anomalies in the 2020
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:40.440]  election results.
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:45.920]  I have an absolute constitutional right to do so, but they want to criminalize what
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:50.880]  here to for has been constitutionally protected political activity.
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:53.240]  And that's the slippery slope.
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:56.640]  One day it's it's James O'Keefe home that they are reading.
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:03:58.800]  The next day, who knows?
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:02.800]  Anybody who's a journalist should realize the chilling effect that this has.
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:04.800]  They're trying to suppress truth.
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:07.240]  They're trying to suppress the free press.
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:10.440]  They're trying to oppress free speech.
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:14.240]  Everything I did January 5th proves nothing about January 6th.
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:18.360]  Yeah, I spoke at a rally that was actually sponsored by Women for Trump.
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:20.480]  Oh, that was sponsored by the 3%ers.
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:21.480]  You know what, Alex?
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:23.480]  I never heard of the 3%ers before this.
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:29.320]  I was about to say they're asking me about all contacts or I mean, I've seen like patches
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:30.880]  that say 3%.
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:38.880]  I know that means like 3% fought the Revolutionary War want 3%ers or motorcycle gangs.
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:39.880]  That's it.
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:40.880]  Are you now?
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:41.880]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:43.280]  That's a point you rather subpoena you brought up.
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:46.040]  We'll be back in 60 seconds and look at these new headlines.
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:49.800]  The January 6th committee comes for Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:51.520]  They're coming for us.
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:54.680]  They're coming for America.
[2:04:54.680 --> 2:05:03.960]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:07.960]  of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:15.120]  So right now the real Black Friday sale is beginning and it's only going to run until
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:19.680]  the end of the month and that's now only six, seven days.
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:24.560]  Info War Store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:26.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:27.800]  It's our best seller.
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:33.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the T amino acids, everything
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:37.040]  you need for your immune system and your body and it tastes great and it funds the
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:38.400]  info war.
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:44.000]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double patriot points and so much more
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.880]  There's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:54.120]  Bet on freedom, bet on info wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:06:19.640]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:19.640 --> 2:06:25.040]  They put that in the subpoenas, they attack it obviously when I say you want to fight
[2:06:25.040 --> 2:06:32.280]  a political cultural fight or like a football game or two corporations or Ford versus Ferrari.
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:36.400]  I was going to say, come arm, take over the capital, that would have been the plan.
[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:37.400]  We would have done it.
[2:06:37.400 --> 2:06:40.600]  We would have taken it back from the communists, but we didn't do that.
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:44.280]  So the globalists are trying to say we're violent and have to be shut down.
[2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:49.560]  All right, this last 10 minutes with the legendary Roger Stone and Mark Rundaz, the First Amendment
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:54.600]  lawyer, prominent First Amendment lawyer, closing points the 10 minutes we have, Roger.
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:56.000]  What else is on your radar screen?
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:01.400]  You want to talk about Rittenhouse, this attack up in with the suicide killer.
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:05.240]  I mean, he didn't commit suicide, but he killed so many people.
[2:07:05.240 --> 2:07:07.520]  What else is on your radar screen?
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:14.440]  It's amazing now, so you have Black Lives Matter activists saying now they're furious
[2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:19.120]  because they have to worry about getting shot when they go out to kill somebody.
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:20.840]  This is an outrageous thing.
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:26.120]  What's great about the Rittenhouse verdict is it proves that the system can still work,
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:32.360]  that the fundamental judicial system set up by our founding fathers really can work.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:33.360]  God bless him.
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:39.800]  But that goes to the larger point, Alex, and that is I'm only here by the grace of God.
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:44.480]  I'm only here because I reaffirmed my commitment to Jesus Christ.
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:48.920]  I'm only here because I confessed that I was a sinner and I got right with Christ because
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:56.280]  they were going to frame me and hang me after gagging me in a Soviet style show trial.
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:07:58.080]  So God is good.
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:00.440]  God has the protection of this nation.
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:02.280]  We do know how this comes out.
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:03.280]  You know why?
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:05.160]  We read the Bible.
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:09.400]  That's why we know that good triumphs in the end.
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:12.160]  That's why we just don't know how it happens.
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:14.080]  You want to make God laugh?
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:15.600]  Tell him you have a plan.
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:18.800]  No, he has a plan for this nation.
[2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:20.680]  It's on our money.
[2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:22.080]  In God we trust.
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:24.400]  Of course, they want to take that off too.
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:28.960]  Oh yeah, General Flynn said, I don't care what religion you are, you've got to believe
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:29.960]  in God.
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:31.520]  We need to believe in God to save the country.
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:33.840]  And they spun it and said, we want a state-run religion.
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:35.400]  He didn't say that.
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.280]  No, General Flynn is one of the greatest men of this century.
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:41.040]  He's a man of destiny.
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:43.000]  He's a man of the Constitution.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.400]  He's a man of Bible.
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.160]  Then I pick up the media and they say, oh no, he belongs to a Satanic cult.
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.520]  He's a Roman Catholic, by the way.
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:54.040]  He's also pro-life.
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:59.160]  There's an ABC story that they keep recycling constantly where he says it's decided law.
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:00.640]  Well, guess what, folks?
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:03.040]  As of today, it is decided law.
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:04.760]  It doesn't mean we like it that way.
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:06.840]  It doesn't mean we aren't going to work to change that.
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:08.400]  They manipulate and lie about everything.
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:10.200]  Randall's got a point to make.
[2:09:10.200 --> 2:09:15.680]  Well, the reason that they are against that, the reason that they are against him expressing
[2:09:15.680 --> 2:09:20.560]  that, and the reason I think it's great for you to have strong families and even, you
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:24.000]  know, I'm not a very religious person, but I think it is a great thing when people are
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:28.160]  because you should always have another loyalty.
[2:09:28.160 --> 2:09:33.200]  What they want is you to have your only loyalty be to the state, dissolve your loyalty to
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:38.600]  your church, dissolve your loyalty to your family, and eliminate that so that all you
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:41.360]  are is a subject of a state.
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:46.280]  And then if they can erode the resistance in some other, you know, in the opposition
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:52.560]  party, and then what they wind up is a one-party state where you have but one loyalty.
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:55.960]  That was the whole point of Marx's, the religion is the opiate of the people.
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:59.520]  Yeah, sure, it distracts people from bad things, but isn't that a good thing?
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:04.720]  Isn't it good that you have faith in something larger than your government, larger than your
[2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:05.720]  community?
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:06.720]  Well, that's it.
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:07.720]  It makes the states not the top thing.
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:11.680]  You have to reach out, you have larger ideas, and then psychologically it shows people that
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:16.400]  pray and believe in God have had to live longer, get over illnesses, I mean, it's reaching
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:17.400]  out to the infinite.
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:20.800]  I mean, look, I don't care what you believe in, you know, I would fight for your right
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:25.760]  to believe in anything, but it should have something you can believe in, or even if you
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:30.960]  want to give that up voluntarily, give that up voluntarily, but you know, you have a right
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:31.960]  to that.
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:32.960]  Absolutely.
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:36.960]  I had a question when we came out, nobody answered, and I forget what it was, but Roger,
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:40.480]  what do you expect the authoritarians to do next as they're trying to intimidate everybody?
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:46.720]  They're trying to raid and ensue and indict and, you know, charge and just go after everybody
[2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:48.240]  that's a prominent American.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:52.200]  I see this wearing thin, but they don't seem to want to stop, they're in their own bubbles.
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:53.200]  What do they do next?
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:57.960]  You know, I think they're trying to engender violence, you see, we're opposed to violence.
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:00.200]  We believe in the democratic system.
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:05.040]  For 40 years I've worked in elections, that's how we bring change, but if our elections are
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:13.560]  not fair, free and transparent, if no judicial body or legislative body or regulatory body
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:17.960]  will examine the elections, it's like a pressure cooker.
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:20.480]  They would like us to fire the first shot.
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:24.320]  They'd like us to throw the first punch, but we're not going to do that because that's
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:25.680]  what they want.
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:31.400]  They use the January 6th routine, which I frankly think is a false flag operation.
[2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:36.960]  There's an enormous amount of evidence that this was engendered by the FBI, even the New
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:44.000]  York Times admits that there were FBI informants riddled throughout the protesters.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:48.400]  Whoever thought it was a good idea to trespass and amend its lawmakers doesn't understand
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:49.400]  America.
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:50.400]  And Roger, let me ask you this.
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:52.600]  I wrote this down, I forgot to ask you, I'm glad you raised this.
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.840]  I put out a video this morning that's going viral at Bandai Video where I said, listen,
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:11:59.880]  I don't know if I'm going to come to this committee because it's a kangaroo committee
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:04.120]  with a bunch of neocons and Democrats on it who've lied about me in the past and people
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:08.720]  connected to the Russiagate hoax, but if it was a real congressional committee with fair
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.000]  Republicans and Democrats on each side, I would come because I want a real investigation.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:14.720]  Trump asked for National Guard, didn't do it.
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:17.320]  They sent away half the Capitol Police that day to do traffic control.
[2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:18.600]  They ended up standing down.
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:19.600]  They waved people in.
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:23.680]  I want to know all that because clearly they were trying to set us up that day.
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:25.880]  I want an investigation of the Secret Service.
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:28.840]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but about who wanted me to be at the front.
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:30.240]  I'm not stupid now.
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:31.800]  In hindsight, they were trying to set us up.
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:36.880]  As you've said, I want a new January 6 investigation that's bipartisan and real.
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:38.960]  Does Roger Stone call for that?
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.200]  I totally agree with that.
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:45.400]  Alex, right after the president spoke, as I have said previously, in my hotel room
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:49.360]  at the Willard, and by the way, if there was a war room of some type at the Willard, I
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:50.360]  don't know about it.
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:51.360]  I wasn't in it.
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:54.640]  I was certainly not with Steve Bannon or with Mayor Giuliani.
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:56.760]  I know nothing whatsoever about it.
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:00.360]  But just because I was staying in that hotel, you get lumped in.
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:03.880]  This is the ABC News Technica, guilt by association.
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:09.160]  Oh, here's a picture of Roger Stone with one of the proud boys out in front of his hotel.
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:10.160]  Yeah?
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:11.160]  So what?
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:12.160]  What does that prove?
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:13.160]  Well, that's pure McCarthyism again to say.
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:16.960]  Well, there was one communist at the bank of a hundred employees, so you must be.
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:22.840]  Look, I've never joined, and I'm not a big joiner, but you know, just seeing them try
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:26.960]  to target you saying, well, are you now or have you ever been a member of?
[2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:29.320]  I want to join whatever that sentence is.
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:33.520]  I don't care what it is, because Roger was absolutely right.
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:35.280]  Earlier he said, I was inspired by what he said.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.600]  He said he had a right to do this, a right to say what he wanted to say about the election,
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.760]  a right to organize, a right to assemble, and that is what's under attack.
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.080]  And you know what?
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:49.280]  When you use that analogy, you talk about being under attack, I want both of you to
[2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:53.560]  realize something, and that is the saying that, you know, you always get the most flack
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:55.720]  when you're directly over the target.
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:13:58.160]  You two are over the target right now, gentlemen.
[2:13:58.160 --> 2:14:01.960]  Well, you said it, and we can't get into the deposition of things, but hey, we're going
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:04.760]  to win these Sandy Hook cases, and I said they're going to default.
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.880]  That's why, and that's why they can't give us a real jury trial, because what they're
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:08.880]  saying isn't true.
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:13.880]  Look, I'm not going to comment on any of your existing cases, except to say that I have
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:15.520]  faith things are going to work out.
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:16.520]  I really do.
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:17.520]  And it looks dark.
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:18.520]  But you know what?
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:24.120]  My ass looking at everything is most of what they say true, Alex, you are the most lied
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:26.720]  about person in America.
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:29.720]  I will say that Roger might be the silver medalist.
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:31.240]  You guys are competing for that.
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:36.800]  But you know, I just know about you, and I know that any time I'm talking to anybody
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:39.520]  who doesn't know you, it is lies.
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:44.120]  And you know, I just things that they say that you say, it didn't say when they say,
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:45.840]  well, you're just reading from bias news.
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:46.840]  Well, what about you?
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:48.040]  You know, I hear people.
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.040]  You're there.
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:50.040]  There's no pre-planning.
[2:14:50.040 --> 2:14:51.040]  We're just here covering our opinion.
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:54.440]  This is the most chaotic thing I've ever, you know, I talk more to Barbershop.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:59.040]  I come on set here and I'm like, I have had more planned conversations take place around
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:02.200]  a campfire with a bunch of people drinking beers and smashing bottles.
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:09.000]  So no, this is this is this is one more time out of folks support a real, a real warrior,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.400]  a real Trojan, a real 300 the fight against tyranny.
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:20.200]  Look, I need help at StoneDefenseFun.com to fight these subpoenas, to fight the various
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:25.800]  harassment, baseless, meritless lawsuits against us, the coffers are bare folks.

[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:29.840]  I will always fight, but I can't do it without your exactly.
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:33.120]  You'll never give up, but you could give out like an old horse and me too.
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:37.440]  And as we're both old horses in this fight and it's made us stronger, but folks, we need

[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:54.080]  We'll go ahead.

[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:10.440]  was right above the target and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:13.760]  Three years later and info wars is still thriving.
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:18.640]  Thanks to the support of our audience, but we are now facing the fiercest battle yet.

[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:29.680]  ever in their attack against Alice Jones.
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:34.000]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  We don't think so.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:40.440]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new USA, but we won't let
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:41.440]  them.

[2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:29.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:43.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this live November
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:51.840]  23rd, Tuesday transmission, this show, this broadcast, this transmission, this human expression
[2:20:51.840 --> 2:20:55.280]  of freedom was not supposed to be on air right now.
[2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:59.480]  We're supposed to already be off air, we're supposed to roll over like everybody else,
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:03.040]  the globalist enslaved and dumbed down and killed, but that's not been happening.
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:07.080]  Well, good friend of mine, Jake Ducey is here and he is a very well known bestselling author
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:10.760]  and also does so many other great works out there.
[2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:16.920]  But he's really helped me in my research and with everything we're doing with the launch
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:22.120]  of the next level of the info war, which is reset wars dot com because we were sympatico
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:28.600]  because I helped wake him up decades ago and his dad's a big fan and the rest of it.
[2:21:28.600 --> 2:21:33.960]  And so we're now here, but before we do the next hour and a half, because we cover so
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:38.840]  much incredible stuff, I mean, you get exclusives on every front, you get cutting edge, you get
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:42.400]  tomorrow's news today, because we want you to know what's going on.
[2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:45.280]  The enemy knows what's going on, they just want to keep you in the dark and enslave you.
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:49.720]  I'm not interested in farms of slaves that I can fly over and laugh at you because I
[2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:55.200]  feel big, you not being empowered makes me feel like crap, you understand how that works?
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:21:59.640]  So I want to see you fly like a birdie because I'm connected to you and you're connected
[2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:00.640]  to me.
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:03.800]  And I have children in this world that are going to live with your children and I have
[2:22:03.800 --> 2:22:06.360]  ancestors that lived with your ancestors.
[2:22:06.360 --> 2:22:07.360]  You got it?
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:08.360]  I'm an individual.
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:10.960]  I'm my own soul, but I'm connected to you.
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:14.760]  And when stuff happens to you, it hurts me, you understand?
[2:22:14.760 --> 2:22:15.760]  I'm not a Satanist.
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:16.760]  I'm the opposite.
[2:22:16.760 --> 2:22:17.760]  I'm not all about me.
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:20.960]  I'm not all about how I got power over people.
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:24.400]  I want you to have power.
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:25.520]  You understand that?
[2:22:25.520 --> 2:22:28.520]  That's what I want, unlimited consciousness.
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:31.480]  And the enemy knows we have that fire in our hands.
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:32.480]  And Jake Ducey's here.
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:33.480]  Let's talk about it.
[2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:38.920]  But to understand the good, you've got to understand the bad.
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:44.520]  And in reset wars, we cover the good, something I don't spend enough time on, and the keys
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:46.360]  to resisting this and decoding it.
[2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:52.360]  But to understand the good, you must understand the bad.
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:55.880]  And so today, we're going to look at the bad.
[2:22:55.880 --> 2:23:00.400]  This covered some in the six plus hour transmission that's coming out in early December.
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:05.200]  But I wanted to just get Jake here to talk about this so that you'd understand some of
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:06.600]  the research that went into this.
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:11.560]  I mean, most people don't sit around and read 800 pages as he classified MK Ultra files.
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:12.840]  I read them decades ago.
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:14.160]  He just recently read them again.
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:16.960]  He just recently, the last few days, went back over them.
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:20.320]  And I want you to understand that when you see reset wars, you think, well, this is just
[2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:23.720]  never heard this in church, never heard this on the Toot News, because they don't want
[2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:27.240]  you to know this, because then they can enslave you.
[2:23:27.240 --> 2:23:31.000]  But when you read the CIA documents and then you see what we're doing, you'll understand
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:32.480]  this is the opposite.
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:33.680]  This is how they did it.
[2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:39.120]  Now, there is one little evil shadow to this, but that's the problem with knowledge, because
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:40.120]  it's good and evil.
[2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:42.160]  It's pretty well.
[2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:44.640]  Did somebody take this knowledge and use it to enslave people?
[2:23:44.640 --> 2:23:46.120]  Yeah, they already have.
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:49.960]  So justice be done by the heavens fall, they want to talk about the knowledge of good
[2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:50.960]  and evil.
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:53.040]  Well, the good don't know about the evil.
[2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:56.320]  So now we're here exposing how they operate and what's going on.
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:00.200]  So spend five minutes before we go to break and come back to the main meat of this.
[2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:04.240]  Current admissions, what's going on, the actual documents, and then what's coming next with
[2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:06.280]  Jake Doocy from resetwars.com.
[2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:07.280]  Jake?
[2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:12.400]  Well, what I say is we're all a part of this massive MK ultra experiment that is society.
[2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:17.840]  And I've had the honor to actually go through six times and watch Alex's brand new course
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:19.600]  that's coming out here real soon.
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:23.560]  If you are a fan of Alex, if you're a fan of info wars, this is the next level because
[2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:29.280]  the way that the great reset officially is accomplished is by trapping us into subconscious
[2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:35.400]  patterns convincing us we're just these little bodies and using everyday mind control weapons
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:41.080]  that they have and Alex breaks down an 11 step process exactly how to break out of that.
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:48.040]  So everyone open up another browser, go to resetwars.com right now at resetwars.com right
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  now.
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.840]  Sign up for the early bird list because everyone knows Alex has always been at the head of
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:54.920]  their list of persecution.
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:59.200]  But here's the thing new just learning all the news isn't going to how we're going to
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:00.440]  be able to change it.
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:03.640]  How we're going to be able to change it is when we finally deep pattern ourselves.
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:05.860]  We learn how the mind control works.
[2:25:05.860 --> 2:25:10.560]  We erase it and then we tap in to that real spiritual power that they don't want us to
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:11.560]  know about.
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:16.120]  So it's resetwars.com and that's the real power right that's what they don't want us
[2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  to know.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:21.520]  And we address it from their perspective which is actually real that they understand there's
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:24.320]  the real us that we were born with that God gave us our soul.
[2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:28.680]  They create a facsimile and then erase the real us but the real us is still there.
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:32.000]  They erase the real us template for interfacing with the universe.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.280]  We're going to show the CIA documents coming up.
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:37.120]  So how do we rediscover that person inside of us?
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:40.640]  Well first we have to recognize that they already know all about this right and that's
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:45.360]  what they actually use the term D patterning in their CIA documents.
[2:25:45.360 --> 2:25:50.040]  They use that word in the MK ultra experiments D pattern they describe what that means we'll
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:54.640]  cover it next segment but it means erasing the real you erasing the real you and that's
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:57.320]  the way this whole control system works in resetwars.
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:00.480]  You talk about the emotional control grid.
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:04.840]  We exist on three planes we exist on the physical the mental emotional and the spiritual.
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:08.920]  The emotional control grid is all the craziness happening in the world lock us into fear lock
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:14.680]  us into anchor lock us into our lower consciousness our lower emotions and that's the simulation
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:19.520]  right Zuckerberg's creating the metaverse but we're already in a simulation and that's
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:24.440]  how the whole control system works and that's what fascinated me about your work is once
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:29.080]  I went into the declassified documents what struck me more than anything was wow we live
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:33.680]  in a simulation all of reality is controlled through subconscious patterning.
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.000]  They already know this and I thought to myself well what happens if I literally reprogram
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.640]  my entire mind if I literally program everything I erase all the viruses and resetwars you
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:49.680]  you taught you like in the mind to an operating system the programs the viruses it's the fake
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:53.920]  identity and that's why I'm so excited about it because then we get CIA documents and they
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:58.720]  admit that they know we have an innate from our ancestors or spirit who we are they try
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:01.920]  to create this facsimile and then they try to erase who we were but they didn't really
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.000]  erase it they create a false thing that we then follow this is what Christ talks about
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.200]  about being born again because we're already in Christ we're already real before we fell
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:15.160]  we got programmed now we're born again we come out of it and think about what's interesting
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:21.840]  in that quote in the Bible is to not be conformed by the pattern of the world they use the same
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:26.960]  word in the MK ultra documents don't be conformed by the pattern of the world what's the pattern
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:31.800]  of the world it's the entire mind control system that they use predictive programming
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:35.400]  and unconscious hypnosis to control us to be let me say that you're gonna have the floor
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:38.800]  when we come back but I want to explain to everybody something big leftist yesterday
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:42.920]  when I did a little piece on this put it clips it look at Jones a con man he says he knows
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:47.080]  God and has the secret obviously we all have the secret of the connection to God obviously
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:51.200]  in fours is the tip of the spear we're not playing games I listen leftist you're caught
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:56.440]  off from God you don't get it I am connected to God to me this is real they sit there and
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:00.320]  act like oh look Jones is telling his listeners he's got a connection to God the blah blah
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:04.920]  blah no it's real it's really will change the universe if people know it understand
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:08.680]  it and that's why your bosses are so scared because they're not like you some brainwash
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:12.560]  minion they're aware of this and using this against us and we're here to set the cap
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:17.880]  is free with Jesus Christ power and that's the entire way throughout history the control
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:21.680]  system has always operated that's why they hid certain books of the Bible that's why
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:26.760]  the Vatican has underground libraries the way tyranny always controls people is cutting
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:30.680]  them off from their higher spiritual faculties convinced them they're just a body even though
[2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:33.960]  your body is just a rental car that houses your soul I'm here in Austin right now I
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:38.240]  use a rental car it's not my car I'm just using it your body is just a rental car the

[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:16.640]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones i knew i knew crashing
[2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:25.120]  through the lives and disinformation it's alex jones going back four or five six months
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:30.640]  ago and going back two months ago we were working on this film project reset wars i told jake
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:38.160]  do see who's very successful in his own right best selling author and researcher motivational
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:43.840]  speaker that they're going to come address for this and now you see they are really worried
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:48.880]  about this because we're explaining what the enemy knows and that you don't see on any
[2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:55.160]  tv channels in any newspapers they were david i is the only other person that conceptualizes
[2:33:55.160 --> 2:34:02.000]  it but we go into the actual nuts and bolts and then show you in the cia zone admissions
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.880]  that they're aware of this and then the bible literally being quoted by the cia and how
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:11.880]  they control people so so jake i want to hit all these articles and documents everything
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:15.240]  we've got it over an hour 20 minutes coming up but i want you to have the floor here again
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:21.160]  to talk about how big this is and again no one raised this i always raise a converse
[2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:27.840]  side or the flip side or the parallax view in that yeah if you teach somebody how to
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:30.680]  use a gun they might kill somebody one day or you teach somebody how to drive a car they
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:36.040]  might run over somebody one day this is all done on a goodwill free will happiness to
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:39.600]  empower because good people don't know about this the evil people know about this they
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:43.960]  use it for control so we're showing you how your control we're showing you the magic trick
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:49.800]  right now but yes we leave it to the holy spirit to guide you because this is the real
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:55.320]  not technology but this is the real keys to how it all works so jake do see please continue
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:35:01.400]  yeah i mean that's what why did they hate jesus so much why do they hate all these individuals
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:06.400]  that truly break free so much and it's because they're teaching people how to actually break
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:12.320]  free of the entire control system that is perpetuated of off of us literally thinking
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:17.000]  we are just a body and when we think we're just a body they have all this advanced weaponry
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:21.920]  which we're going to talk about electromagnetic field manipulation on how to influence the
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:28.840]  brain and the emotions but the most fascinating part really pops in to mk ultra and there's
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:35.440]  a document in the declassified mk ultra that after i got to watch alex film his reset wars
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.640]  course i was reading back through these documents and i and i showed him this document and it's
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:45.920]  from dr cameron's notes and you and cameron and it's about a woman who's been asleep
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:51.400]  for 16 days because i have her on drugs they have her with subliminals all these control
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:57.600]  systems going on and part of the note says she is sleeping well she is disoriented as
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:06.200]  to time only and is probably in her second stage of depatterning and i was like wow you
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:10.480]  know you'll see a lot of people cover mk ultra even the mainstream new york times all these
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:16.440]  places but what do they say the headlines are horrific use government overreach scary
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:22.000]  stuff but the question is never asked why are they doing it and they're doing it because
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  they realize the mind is literally a computer operating system we live in a simulation that's
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:30.920]  controlled through unconscious consciousness and they figured out how to manipulate and
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:36.160]  control it and in the same way the only way that we're going to win is to depattern ourselves
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:39.640]  and i used to think i was awake when i would listen to you and then i realized well i'm
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:44.840]  an mk ultra patient i know what's happening i know about the new world order but i'm controlled
[2:36:44.840 --> 2:36:48.640]  in my business and my success and my finances and my happiness by the way you're not just
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:54.080]  saying that the globalist brag they're externalizing mind control that's what the media is we are
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:37:01.000]  under mk ultra attack absolutely and the entire system is perpetuated off of one simple phrase
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:06.760]  i love to say it it says brainwash yourself before the world brain washes you brainwash
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:11.200]  yourself before the world brain washes you and that's the entire depatterning system
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:16.960]  and in extreme examples dr cameron actually says in one of the documents they say that
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:23.520]  cameron believed that breaking down a patient's mind was akin to a childlike state that would
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:29.320]  allow him to work from a clean slate whereby he could then program the patients his term
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:35.760]  was psychic driving depatterning psychic driving depatterning which meant playing recorded messages
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:40.760]  to patients for up to 20 hours whether they were asleep or whether they were awake and
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:47.120]  in extreme examples this woman esther schreyer was so quote completely depatterned she was
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:54.480]  mute and had trouble swallowing literally they they erased her mind some background real quick
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:57.600]  back before they took over history channel 20 some years ago they would admit all this
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:01.280]  show the documents to three hour documentaries on it but i went looked at the national archives
[2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:07.320]  it's all there it wasn't made up he kidnapped over 10 000 children in the us and canada
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:12.320]  and other programs use cps to get them and would keep people asleep sometimes for months
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:18.920]  with lsd pcp they had video goggles you think that's new they had earphones programming
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:25.640]  them creating quote the ultimate assassin and so the stuff they released in 77 with the
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:31.560]  church committee the mks was only a small part of this and again this is just this
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:38.440]  is 40 50 60 70 years ago imagine what they're doing now imagine what they're doing now and
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:42.720]  i think that the most amazing part of the whole thing is we now know and this is why
[2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:49.440]  i'm so excited about reset wars and i say everybody literally go right now open a browser go
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:55.840]  to reset wars dot com because throughout history the way tyranny always wins is to stop us
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:01.080]  from spiritual awakening as long as they trap us in the third dimension they make us live
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:04.920]  in an animalistic state of consciousness believe we're just our physical bodies attached to
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:09.280]  this little tiny spectrum of visible light then they win but as soon as people start
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:15.360]  to actually wake up not just wake up to hey pharmaceutical corruption hey uh financial
[2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:20.640]  corruption but actually wake up to who they really are then the whole game's over because
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:24.280]  that's what bill gates that's what claus wab they all fear people spiritually awake
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:29.120]  and that's why they want to target children so young to screw up their normal trajectory
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:33.200]  towards reaching christ and and and the connection to the infinite and the point i was gonna make
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:39.280]  earlier and i always get one thought and jump to the next is doctor ewing cameron was the
[2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:45.160]  head of mk ultra that's declassified who was his adjunct his aid to camp his number two
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:50.960]  jolly and west who was tim mcvay's psychologist when he was on death row and who was theodore
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:56.240]  kazinsky psychologist by the way i will later we'll show you la time saying that theodore
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:02.920]  kazinsky all of uh mcvay all mind control they had all been deeply grabbed for years
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:08.040]  disappeared tell me they didn't see him put in bay's put in pods like the matrix and programmed
[2:40:08.040 --> 2:40:14.640]  and alex even the the vegas shooter who knows if it's true but he claims that his mind was
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:19.200]  erased and hacked and he has text messages that he sent to his wife claiming who knows
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:23.360]  if it's true claiming that they were able to erase his mind and we're gonna get to some
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:27.640]  of those declassified we know he was the governor for the cia and the reason that that's so
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:31.560]  significant is because when we were going through more of these they call them nonlethal
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:39.720]  energy weapons they say they admit the pentagon admits that they can use uh microwaves and
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:45.920]  electromagnetic frequencies to literally control someone's brain and change their emotions
[2:40:45.920 --> 2:40:49.400]  and we're going to show you the patents we're going to show you the news articles u.s. news
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:54.280]  and world report twenty thirty years ago when you read the patents it's five g five g is
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:01.320]  a mind control system absolutely and i think the whole thing ultimately shows us one simple
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:07.320]  thing the way that we win is when we realize who we really are we are not bodies this is
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:11.560]  a rental car that i have that you have we're spiritual beings in a physical body and when
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:17.080]  we do that that's when we get in the course you talk about inspiration being inspired
[2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:22.360]  and that's when we tap into that type of place being tell them what that means the latin latin
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:29.440]  inspiration means in spirit and when we're in spirit whereas jesus said we're in this
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:34.080]  world but not of it so the whole control system alex uses the term it's called the emotional
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:38.760]  control grid in the course emotional control grid you define it i watch a course like six
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:43.920]  times now you define it as a mental and emotional plane that they trap you into your emotions
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:50.000]  they trap you into your nervous system so you think you are of this world so being inspired
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.960]  is being connected to spirit it's when we realize we aren't powerless if you're a doctor
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:57.640]  you can go start your own private practice if you're a teacher you can go start a new
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:02.200]  education system if you're a broadcaster like alex you can become one of the most powerful
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:08.200]  broadcasters in the world alex started in a closet in a closet and when we're inspired
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:12.120]  they don't want us to ask how can god speak through me right now oh i totally was led
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:17.280]  by god it wasn't me i was like channel and when we let go of our mind in our attachment
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:22.640]  to ourself that's how we win and the whole control system is keeping us in our emotions
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:26.640]  and if we get stuck it's trying to get us to give our mind to them in a lower state instead
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:30.200]  of giving it up to god because you're gonna give it up you're gonna serve somebody like
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:33.800]  bob dillon says you're gonna give it to god of the devil right give it to the metaverse
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:37.680]  give it to mark zuckerberg give it to the financial systems you believe you can't make

[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:46.840]  and god will do it there's no doubt and god is now the run for this total attack in the

[2:47:38.160 --> 2:47:42.880]  pearls but you're gonna have to serve somebody i'm just gonna say this is very close to what the
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:47.840]  devil did in the garden of Eden what we're doing on there right now and i just gotta be honest with
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:52.240]  the listeners that's what this is but it's the other way back you see they already did it to us
[2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:56.960]  before to forget who we were now we got to wake up to that fact i gotta tell you that story again
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:04.000]  this is like the snake coming down the tree talking to eve and talking to adam we were
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:10.720]  perfect because we're following god's pattern and then a new pattern was put in but it feels dirty
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.120]  even go back to that moment to be there at the tree and to say hey you want to get rid of this
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:21.680]  pattern you could have god's pattern but that's what this is you got to serve somebody by whole
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:27.920]  will everything i am is about being straight with you that's why they say alex jones is never wrong
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:34.480]  no i i'm right about 97 percent of the time sometimes i get distorted or get sped up or get
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:39.120]  something wrong or see it wrong and later i tell you i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong but i
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.640]  mean you're right 97 percent of the time you know what's going on you know you've no comment you don't
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:49.680]  you already innately don't need the news to tell you you know in your spirit your spirit's so old
[2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:56.000]  so powerful so real made by god man you were built by the most amazing things ever been you were you
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:04.800]  rolled off the assembly line like smoking hot and and and we're here simply trying to get everybody
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:09.760]  to realize we can fight all the enemies attacks we can fight all the racism and all the sexism and
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:14.560]  all the stuff they spew with the name of stoppin and or we can just reach up to the divine and
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:19.600]  grasp what was already given to us we're given the false apple of i'll tell you about the universe
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:24.320]  just just do this with me over instead of like no you got to reach up even higher and god's hand
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:28.480]  is reaching down so let's start we got a whole other hour coming up jake doozy here but let's
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:34.640]  start getting into the documents and the facts here but the point is we're not all the church is
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:41.840]  in all the systems the islamics the the mainline christians the all the big systems hollywood all
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:47.440]  of it is about going through them and they know you're already looking but they want you to try to
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:52.640]  jesus was like no more temples no more priests pray in the middle of night at 3am i read that
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.160]  when i was a kid so what does that mean at sunday school that's when i get the transmissions at 3am
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:50:01.040]  i wake up at 3am that's when i always get the big whatever reason i mean i mean even the even the
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:06.080]  yogi abo vetics all those people tell you that's 3am whatever goes on then this is about your
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:11.680]  relationship with god who created the infinite i'ma stop ranting the point is this is what they
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:17.440]  don't want this is what they don't we understand and it's not something we have that we're giving
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.960]  to you this is something we want you to realize is already there that will end claus Schwab and
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:29.120]  bill gates the moment you begin down that real path yeah well the reason that it's i think reset war
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:33.680]  is going to be so powerful and why i think they're really going to be mad when it's out is because
[2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:39.920]  you even think about the race baiting everything that happens all the division it's perpetuated
[2:50:39.920 --> 2:50:45.120]  off of one simple idea and that's to convince us that we're just our bodies there wasn't it wasn't
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:50.960]  that long ago if you asked me who i was i would have said my name's jake doozy i'm six foot three
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:56.160]  this is i blew eyes this is how long my hair is this is who i am but this is just a rental car it's
[2:50:56.160 --> 2:51:00.800]  it's a fingernail to who i really am and how empowering is it once you realize that it's
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:04.400]  incredibly empowering and and here's what's something that's so interesting i sent you
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:11.760]  this text the other day on my youtube channel someone left a comment and they said uh as a as a
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:19.840]  black man i don't know how this this blonde hair blue eyed guys videos popped up but i don't want
[2:51:19.840 --> 2:51:25.200]  to watch you because legacy media has told me because you're white you're a racist you're evil
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:32.720]  you're the devil but while i'm listening to your video right now i have this deep fear that actually
[2:51:33.440 --> 2:51:40.640]  we all come from the same source and they've been lying to me he knows he was waking up he doesn't
[2:51:40.640 --> 2:51:46.800]  need you we're just saying look at the light exactly and that's why i said tyranny only works
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:52.960]  if you convince people that they're just a body and that you make them subconsciously habitually
[2:51:52.960 --> 2:51:58.000]  conform to the patterns of this world and that's why i love back to the bible pull up the first
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:02.160]  i forget where it is he's like don't conform to the pattern of the world it's be not be not uh
[2:52:02.160 --> 2:52:07.200]  conformed by the pattern of the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and in
[2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:12.720]  the course you talk about transform trans is beyond and form meaning the physical world that's why
[2:52:12.720 --> 2:52:18.160]  they create a counterfeit of trans take chemicals cut your penis off no transformation is the energy
[2:52:18.160 --> 2:52:24.320]  absolutely and how does this whole control system work and this is why reset wars is so powerful and
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:29.440]  that's why everyone needs to open up a web browser go to reset wars dot com and sign up because we
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:34.320]  have this all in in government documents and we now know through new neuroscience that shows us
[2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:38.560]  how this whole thing works every time you have an emotion you activate cells in your brain through
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:43.040]  hebb's law which is term in neuroscience it says that cells that fire together wire together every
[2:52:43.040 --> 2:52:47.520]  time you have an emotion you activate cells they build a neurological programming your brain yeah
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:53.360]  and they know it there here's this dot here's a document um from the u.s. army college of war
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:53:01.040]  and they say quote the mind has no innate firewall to protect itself from electromagnetic weapons
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:06.560]  what's an electromagnetic weapon well what's anything this is just an electromagnetic field
[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:10.720]  there's no such thing as matter in your in your court describes the pentagon documents from the
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:15.520]  sixties and seventies that we are these energy creatures they're controlling they say it we're
[2:53:15.520 --> 2:53:19.520]  gonna show all this and they have all the i mean there's hundreds and that i mean it's kind of
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:25.520]  freaky non-lethal electromagnetic weapons all these things so you think what are you well it looks
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:30.320]  like i stop right here and alex stops right here but you and i are a field of energy my field
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:35.280]  goes about right there and our fields join everything is just a field and max plank the father
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:40.320]  of quantum physics you quote him in your course he says as a man who's devoted he won the nobel prize
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:45.120]  in 1913 he says as a man who's devoted his entire life to the most clear-headed science in the world
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:52.320]  the study of atoms i can tell you this much there's no matter as such so the electromagnetic
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:56.480]  weapons are important because what are we we're an electromagnetic field of energy and the key
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:54:01.920]  is its observation which is the quantum physics other than microwaves it'll physically kill you
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:06.480]  if you're aware of the attack you can defeat it but you've got because your will controls the field
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:11.840]  not some stupid machine firing it and that's why i love to say that we're all mk ultra patient
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:16.880]  once we realize this it is our responsibility to de-program de-pattern ourselves just going
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:21.680]  in yelling and protesting isn't going to change it we all have to change ourselves and so it says
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:26.240]  in these quote in in these sections of the army documents they talk about how the mind has no
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:30.560]  firewall right one of the things china has is it is a firewall on their internet and it's
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:34.960]  something that we don't have that robert spaulding who wrote the stealth war about china in the us
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:41.200]  talks about and he talks about how we don't have a firewall so we're we're we're susceptible to cyber
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:47.680]  attacks but we don't have a firewall on our own minds and once we realize that and we realize
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:54.960]  they've got all these low frequency elf um uh radiation waves electromagnetic weapons we
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:55:00.720]  and that can influence the brain and the mind they say it the the the head of darpas the old
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:07.600]  head of darpa says that they figured out how to use electromagnetic weapons to quote induce the
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:12.160]  brain to release behavioral record regulation describe the frequency they were using in the
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:18.720]  70s and it's 5g and that's a 70s right yeah imagine folks i mean this is they're literally putting
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:23.600]  mind i've got the baltimore sun article in the stack here we'll cover it next hour where they were
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:29.920]  saying in the 90s oh cell towers are gonna also calm the public like pros act i mean that's what
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:37.760]  i'm saying is this is happening and that's why it's so important that we all take a breath
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:45.920]  realize we're not a body because you could feel the energy all the time if you just go is there
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:50.320]  life in my hands and don't ask your mind is a yes or no question but bring your attention to your
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:56.320]  hand can i feel the energy can i feel the life in my hands that's the moment i really woke up
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:00.320]  right i was watching end game i was doing all these things and i was a freshman in college
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:05.280]  and i was listening to an audiobook and the guy said is there life in your hands and you feel the
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:09.840]  energy in your hands and it's the first time i ever separated from my mind yeah your brain
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:14.080]  connects and goes i my brain's in control of this and there's something beyond my mind that's in
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:18.640]  control of it that that's when you actually then actually stand up yeah that we aren't our thoughts
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:24.000]  we aren't our thoughts we are in our body and we're in control of it that just like a computer
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:28.720]  operating system that's what i love about the reset wars course because you go step by step
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:33.920]  and you liken the mind we're in a simulation and you liken the mind to a computer operating system
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:40.160]  they have installed the operating system and the viruses into our computer it's happened for so long
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:45.280]  that we believed all the emotions and all the thoughts that we've memorized the pattern through
[2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:48.960]  our nervous system so we think it's who we are and we think we aren't confident we think we aren't
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:54.640]  as powerful as as ilan muska's mark zuckerberg there's so many people that look up to alex jones
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:58.720]  and they and they want to be powerful and make a difference in the world like alex jones but
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:05.280]  they think alex is somehow more powerful we all have to wake up to the fact that we are connected
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:11.280]  to this divine power and through inspiration we can transform our mind we can think and feel
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:15.760]  greater than our environment that's how we access new ideas that's how we change the world we must
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:20.480]  come out of the world and then get into spirit and then take over the world in this world but not
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:26.800]  of it right absolutely and that's why it's so cool it's like alex jones put together reverse
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:31.600]  engineered all their secret studies i mean i'm telling you this is weaponized mind control but
[2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:37.280]  to free people yeah this is the keys to mk ultra this the keys to mk ultra and the all these other
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:41.360]  documents that they're using they want you to feel alone and if you do hold on let's start the fourth

[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:52.000]  flip-flopping statements and comments on mask and then dr robert malone the future of global
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:01:02.640]  totalitarianism is here this is so incredibly powerful these two clips that go it together
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:07.120]  so i hope that you share this information right now jake ducey is our guest we're gonna come
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:12.960]  right back on the other side of this break and lay it all out today and believe me i don't you
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:18.400]  know i don't tell you stuff that's bs we're not about hoaxes we're about reality so stay with us
[3:01:19.520 --> 3:01:25.600]  around with masks let me just state for the record that masks are not theater wearing a mask might
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:31.040]  make people feel anyone a little bit better and masks are protective and we but it's not providing
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:36.160]  the perfect protection that people think that it is okay hasn't it not been any indication
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:40.240]  that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable period of time
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:45.920]  as any deleterious effects there are unintended consequences people keep fiddling with the mask
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:51.120]  and they keep touching their face and can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there of course
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:57.360]  you do not need to wear a mask indoors if in fact you've been vaccinated good that you're vaccinated
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:02.800]  but in a situation where you have people indoors particularly crowded you should wear a mask so
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:08.720]  even if you are vaccinated you should wear a man if in fact you are vaccinated fully vaccinated
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:13.840]  you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors when the children go out
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:18.960]  into the community you want them to continue to wear masks you know if you look at at children
[3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:23.760]  outside particularly when they with the family of walking down the street playing a game or
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:29.760]  what have you don't have to wear a mask the the the the pediatric the academy pediatric
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:34.720]  actually makes that recommendation that children should be wearing masks uh from two years old
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:40.320]  onward and you're asking now if your child is a member of your household can you walk outdoors
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:46.400]  with your child without a mask according to that chart the answer is yes but the child can't not
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:52.640]  to beat it and beat it to death yes yes because now the cdc says i mean i think i've got this right
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:58.000]  one mask is better than zero masks two masks is better than one mask but you don't have to have
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:03.840]  double masks is that right i mean you know it became clear that cloth coverings that you didn't have
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:09.680]  to buy in a store that you could make yourself were adequate and then you want it to fit better
[3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:15.200]  so one of the ways you could do it if you would like to is put a cloth mask over which actually
[3:03:15.920 --> 3:03:22.000]  here and here and here where you could get leakage in is much better contained are you a
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:29.840]  double mask or dr fouchy look like you are in terms of the virus and you know the virus is is really
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:38.640]  really seems increasingly to be a platform uh in the jab for advancing other agendas including
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:44.960]  political agendas i like to say and please quote me on this the future of global totalitarianism
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:52.320]  is here it's just not evenly distributed what we're seeing in canada australia austria now is
[3:03:52.320 --> 3:04:00.080]  the most uh egregious example hope sounds like we may be seeing it in germany soon is the the
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:07.760]  deployment of a totalitarian approach to this whole thing and it is amazingly coordinated
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:12.240]  we could you know that's another half an hour discussion about how this is happening
[3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:18.880]  but what i think we're seeing with the governments like austria is the symptom of what
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:25.200]  matias professor matias desmit is talking about more and more and many of us find a lot of traction
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:32.560]  in his thoughts it's called mass formation psychosis basically it's it's the madness of crowds would
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:39.360]  be a simple way to put it and a lot of these governments have been overtaken by this form
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:46.720]  of psychosis or hypnosis they believe that these vaccines are effective they're clearly not they
[3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:53.040]  are impervious to data just in the same way that we're seeing our own government impervious to actual
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:05:03.520]  facts there are so many crappy brands of energy products energy drinks energy powders energy pills
[3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:08.720]  and look almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides

[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:16.000]  you are listening to an infowars.com frontline report if you are receiving this transmission
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:24.640]  you are the resistance all right reset wars with jake ducey on all exchange your host
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:30.000]  let's start getting into all these documents the history the controlling what they admit they're
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:36.240]  doing how they're trying to erase our personalities they were beta testing in the 50 60 70s the last
[3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:41.840]  time was was declassified with 77 we can see it now all on a mass scale and i've got a bunch of
[3:06:41.840 --> 3:06:46.720]  articles where they admit they're currently doing it to us so shouldn't be people shouldn't people
[3:06:46.720 --> 3:06:52.720]  be aware of what's currently being done to them yeah this one's fascinating this one is from
[3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:59.760]  richard cesaro he's the deputy director was the deputy director of the pentagon's advanced research
[3:06:59.760 --> 3:07:06.960]  projects DARPA this is an actual quote he says quote in our experiments we did some remarkable
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:14.880]  things and there was no question in my mind that you can get into the brain with microwaves if you
[3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:22.560]  really make the breakthrough you've got something better than any bomb ever built because when
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:29.120]  you finally come down the line you're talking about controlling people's minds so that's their
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:35.760]  argument put in the 5g so no one riots so no one's bad but their depopulation is doing it
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:41.360]  it'd be bad enough if good guys put this in but these are bad guys that put this in and that's
[3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:47.600]  how the whole entire control system continues to perpetuate itself and that's why everything is
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:53.200]  designed to trap us into the as you talk about in the course the emotional control grid the emotional
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:57.840]  control grid i when we were i was laughing when we were watching that clip of the masks because i
[3:07:57.840 --> 3:08:05.040]  was thinking even masks are another example of trapping you into your physical body it's another
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:09.760]  anchor that makes brings you back into lower emotions you're afraid of dying even though you
[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:14.240]  can't die because everything's energy and energy's never created or destroyed it's only transferred
[3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:19.440]  to different states first law of thermodynamics yeah so you you can't die but the whole system
[3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:24.080]  has to get you into the emotion of fear so the mask just traps you back into the matrix into
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:28.480]  the third dimension so you think you're just a little physical body you gotta be a symbol of
[3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:33.520]  that you're a prisoner symbol that you're a prisoner and it's just another example of moving
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:39.040]  you back into the matrix and that's why i think they're gonna be so mad when they find out we
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:45.040]  that you broke everything down step by step by step and reset wars because this whole thing
[3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:49.680]  isn't just off of us waking up because so many people that are awake still think we're powerless
[3:08:49.680 --> 3:08:54.000]  they still think we can't win there's still debt slaves that's a key point you make no no we're
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:01.440]  awake we're powerful and that's what has to happen we have to realize that we are powerful
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:08.720]  and that's how the entire game operates and that's why reset wars is so powerful
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:14.800]  but you you got it coming out the beginning of december everybody go to resetwars.com sign up
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:21.040]  right now resetwars.com and sign up right now for the early bird list because look they've got all
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:32.240]  these they say um DARPA quote the aim of the program is to remotely disrupt political dissonant
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:40.560]  and extremism by employing transgranial magnetic stimulation in tandem with sophisticated propaganda
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:46.640]  based on this technology and you read it it's 5g basically yeah so the entire i mean and think
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:52.640]  about that think about what the metaverse probably actually has right zuckerberg wants to duct tape
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:57.760]  this mask onto your head and use 24 hours a day we stay in it we only break out of it to eat some
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:02.400]  cricket protein ground up cricket protein powder or something like that and that's the way this
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:08.880]  whole it's it's just to get into our brainwave state and that's why all of this is so powerful
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:12.800]  because at the end of the day it brings us back to what it brings us back to brainwash yourself
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:18.400]  before the world brain washes you as long as they just type in what you said from a 1970s document
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:23.280]  there was mainstream news the army doing it to the troops and they used to cover it yeah all of
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:28.720]  these things have like new york times associated press yeah like even 10 20 years ago they'd cover
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:34.400]  it now they don't yeah now they don't cover it at all but you can still find the old documents
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:38.000]  well see that metaphysically that was their fine print it's kind of like when you're gonna
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:42.480]  demolish a house or take over you publish it in the paper you're doing it they kind of tell you
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:48.560]  they tell you 20 years before then they do it and that's what's so powerful about all this because
[3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:54.480]  all all you did is find the entire playbook of how reality is created i mean we haven't even touched
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:58.880]  on quantum physics but we know everything we'll do that we'll do that the last segment of the
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:03.360]  sound but but let's look at some of these overhead shop please guys here's a small
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:09.120]  smattering of these here's the one in telegraph use of fear to control behavior in covid crisis
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:14.960]  was totalitarian scientists admit government mind control systems were used including
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:22.480]  classified systems to ensure compliance wonder what that was the next step outbreak why we're not ready
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:27.120]  medical and psychological emergency units
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:33.280]  lockdown is the world's biggest psychological experiment and we will pay the price
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:40.400]  the biggest psychological experiment history is running now scientific american they admit
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:48.000]  like you're an animal they're doing this through publications and it goes on and on and on how
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.920]  they're running these operations and how they prepared it and how they admit it the cia secret
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:12:02.880]  quest for mind control torture lsd and a poisoner in chief i've only started to get into all this
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:11.840]  okay yeah and again the entire thing is to convince you that you are your thoughts
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:18.880]  and that you are your body because they can use electromagnetic warfare to control your thoughts
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:26.320]  to control your emotions and thus control your body and that's why i say we're all a part of a
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:31.520]  massive mk ultra experiment called society right we think of all these horrific things that they
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:36.960]  did to people but they're using all these same technologies in order to control us and what
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:41.840]  really changed my life wasn't just waking up to you know what you've been talking about an end game
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:51.120]  for so many years what changed my life was when i said well how am i hypnotized and i realized i was
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:55.280]  controlled financially it controlled my career i didn't think i could become that successful i didn't
[3:12:55.280 --> 3:12:59.680]  think i was like i could i could achieve a lot i thought i couldn't be happy because there was
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:03.920]  all these bad things happening in the world and that's how this whole if if consciousness creates
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:08.720]  reality which it does and we know from the azerber effect that consciousness influence reality down
[3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:14.640]  to the subatomic level and that 95 percent of our life is subconscious it's a habitual pattern plan
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:20.480]  they're programming us as engines of builders we're like spiritual nanotech that if they can
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:26.400]  program us they can use us as slaves to build their new system so these demons these creatures
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:32.320]  whatever they are are trying to enslave us to be their slaves building whatever it is they want
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:37.840]  instead god's saying no break free be your own individual and the and the funny thing is that
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:44.720]  actually we are the ones ultimately creating our own enslavement unconsciously they're just using
[3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:49.600]  all this warfare in order to influence our consciousness but we're unaware that it's
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:54.320]  taking place so we unconsciously accept the viruses in the operating system and then they
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:59.360]  were in a false reality we've got a step in our office a sentient conscious beings made the image
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:05.280]  of god with free will and then do what we want we have to stop submitting the outside stimuli
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:10.480]  and that's what reset wars exposes is they've got their reset to stop us from awakening this is the
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:16.000]  real reset and imagine if everybody realizes that imagine if that if the nurse that's in the medical
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:20.320]  system that's fed up with it but thinks she's powerless realizes she can create her own private
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:25.280]  practice and it can eventually become the biggest private practice in texas imagine if the if the
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:31.840]  english teacher realizes that she can create the most one of the most powerful schools in california
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.640]  and you just start going down the line you realize the broadcaster that wants to be like alex jones
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:43.360]  and oan can actually tap in to the same spiritual energy that's moving through all of us and they
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:47.680]  can utilize that to become incredibly powerful to become the next we're not going to get upset
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.320]  they're successful because they're freeing us they're creating a wider ocean in which our spirit
[3:14:52.320 --> 3:14:57.520]  swims and the only way that we're ever going to win this the only way the great reset is defeated
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:05.360]  is by exactly that that's what consciousness that god gave us is it's art god created us with free
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:11.040]  will to be able to create new ideas create new systems create new frontiers and experience
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:16.800]  consciousness and and and the only way first einstein said god does not play at dice then he
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:22.480]  said no i'm wrong god's real god only plays at dice god's playing dice constantly just only
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:27.840]  creating free will is new when you're omni president what else is new when you're omni president
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:32.560]  creating new free will creatures there's a quote by iris murdoch she says we live in a fantasy
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:39.280]  world a world of illusion and the great task in life is to find reality what is real well what is
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:44.240]  real is that consciousness creates reality these people don't have any control over us they're
[3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:49.920]  actually at a lower level of consciousness and why are we following these democratic and republican
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:57.680]  politicians like nadler i mean these people are just wars dot com info wars life is bringing you
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:03.840]  a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[3:16:03.840 --> 3:16:09.280]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[3:16:09.280 --> 3:16:16.640]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france
[3:16:16.640 --> 3:16:22.080]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:27.760]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:33.440]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[3:16:33.440 --> 3:16:39.520]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:44.320]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:49.920]  enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the

[3:20:22.560 --> 3:20:33.200]  or kill the children we've got abc news reporting i said last week i said now that foutsy says
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:37.360]  we're going to inject newborns they're claiming there's outbreaks and newborns they're all dying
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:46.000]  it's very easy to predict sure as the sun came up this morning covet 19 live updates abc news
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:56.240]  pediatric covet cases ride for third week babies need shots and i've got the articles right here
[3:20:56.240 --> 3:21:01.520]  from all over the world where people that take the shots are double likely to die why do you think
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:05.920]  jake did see great research we'll get back into the mind control and how to counter it they just
[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:10.960]  want to kill so many people now i guess they just figure statistically there's a giant awakening
[3:21:10.960 --> 3:21:16.240]  just to just kill them but if we kill them with the military they'll rise up and defeat us we gotta
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:22.720]  do it through medicine well i mean even basos had that really bizarre speech the other day or quote
[3:21:22.720 --> 3:21:26.000]  the other day when he was talking about how they're gonna turn earth into a nature preserve and
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:32.240]  everyone's gonna live in space i mean they realize they don't really need most people right and that's
[3:21:32.240 --> 3:21:36.800]  what this is all about and when we go into all these documents you know for it can be a little
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:40.960]  scary right it's like oh my gosh they have all these like psychological warfare weapons they're using
[3:21:40.960 --> 3:21:47.200]  on us but i want to say that's why alex put together reset if you're conscious of their
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:52.560]  operation it's came owner like what does gi joe say knowing is half the battle knowing is half the
[3:21:52.560 --> 3:21:58.880]  battle and so when you go to reset wars this is exactly what mark zuckerberg cloud swab this is
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:02.560]  exactly what they don't want us to know and that's why the world's getting crazier because they're
[3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:08.960]  trying to move us back into the matrix to stop the spiritual awakening so deep create alex put a
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:14.720]  step-by-step guide to show you exactly how they use the warfare how to break out of it how to
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.520]  de-pattern reprogram your mind connect on your own not through alex but connect on your own
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:25.120]  to god the spirit to your higher purpose so look i've been a fan of alex for a long time i think
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:29.680]  this is better than even endgame the greatest work you ever did because this is the final step
[3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:36.960]  this is the final step for everyone to wake up so please go to reset wars dot com and sign up
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:43.200]  right now you were telling me uh recently about maybe 10 12 years ago you were gonna write a book
[3:22:43.200 --> 3:22:49.520]  and with some big author and when the publishing houses and cnn ever many times they tried to
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:54.400]  shut your book down and then so what we figured out is one now you've got something even more
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:22:59.280]  powerful this is step by step for you to find out how to break free from the physical and
[3:22:59.280 --> 3:23:04.160]  emotional planes how to break free from the lack of purpose how to break free from your financial
[3:23:04.160 --> 3:23:08.560]  health limitation to cover that next segment with the quantum physics that they know of the
[3:23:08.560 --> 3:23:14.400]  observer effect this is not like bs this is scientifically backed up we're about to cover
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:19.600]  notice we've given the globalist a big run for their money because i was subconsciously already
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:27.840]  using all this and as a fan of your of your work for so long the whole full circle is one step one
[3:23:27.840 --> 3:23:32.480]  was you woke everybody up to the new world order right and step number two is you woke everybody
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:37.360]  up to the great reset step number three is now we're waking people up to who they really are
[3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:41.440]  and giving reverse engineering the playbook of mind control first you got to realize you're
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:45.440]  under attack you got to realize what the agenda is then you realize who you are to fix it exactly
[3:23:45.440 --> 3:23:49.040]  that's how a fighter somebody comes up and for no reason you're like okay i'm just getting ahead
[3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:53.280]  okay i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna fight this i'm gonna win i'm gonna fight and then that that's that's it
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:24:02.320]  and that's why we're saying go right now sign up to resetwars.com get on the early bird list
[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:06.320]  because once mark zuckerberg sees this he's kicking metaverse into high gear he's gonna be like
[3:24:06.320 --> 3:24:11.600]  we must get metaverse set up to trap people into laws explain that notice it all happens at the
[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:17.120]  same time we play on the six months the the reset wars is the answer to the metaverse
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:22.560]  quite literally because the metaverse all it is is a simulation within a simulation we're already
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:28.800]  in a simulation the zombie apocalypse is coming the zombie apocalypse is already here and guess what
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:32.960]  i'm a zombie you're a zombie you're a zombie we're all zombies because subconscious programming
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:37.680]  controls 95 of our life and most of us been controlled by other people so all they're doing
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:41.840]  with the metaverse is creating another layer of a simulation within the simulation and they know
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:47.040]  we know that such as the big hit movies free guy he's the finally guy that gets it but they know
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:52.720]  we have that hunger so they want to stick the system will give us that exactly and to further
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:57.600]  entrap us into our this is like the real free guy i mean if people are looking for free guy how
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:04.720]  to break your player out of the the metaverse then that's what reset wars is and i told alex you
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:09.280]  know at you know alex alex just wants to do a show in an ideal world alex wouldn't promote
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:14.560]  anything and he would just do his show but i said alex reset wars this course is literally
[3:25:14.560 --> 3:25:18.240]  going to be the thing where people are going to walk up to you and cry and they're going to be like
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:23.760]  this changed my life i quit drinking i i broke out of my debt slavery show them to a bunch of
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:27.920]  people and i've had huge success i've had i've had friends quit drinking from it i've had a friend
[3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:32.400]  that's been watching you for 15 years saying he's watched thousands of episodes and it was literally
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:36.640]  the the most powerful thing that he'd ever seen you put together because you never you know all
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:41.760]  this stuff but you've never put it together you help me sit down for months and write it all down
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:47.120]  we've been meeting after meeting after meeting to write this out you made me do it i appreciate that
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:54.160]  and so i wanted to come on today just in honor of that because look i was telling alex i'm like
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:26:02.720]  info wars is tomorrow's news today but reset wars is tomorrow's wisdom today this is historically
[3:26:03.280 --> 3:26:09.440]  what tyrants always try to stop everybody from finding out so you better believe that when they
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:13.760]  actually find out that they put reset wars together there's a good chance that they're
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:17.280]  going to try to shut it down they're going to try to shut the website down that's why you
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:23.440]  got to go right now and sign up at reset wars dot com alex has it coming out in early december
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:27.840]  it's going to be massive and then the here's the exciting thing we're all energy we're all
[3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:32.480]  electromagnetic fields we're all connected to higher consciousness and we all tap into a collective
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:38.400]  unconsciousness once you wake up and you show how to break out of debt slavery hundreds monkey effect
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:43.120]  it's the hundredth monkey effect and so what happens is when you go well how do you have
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:47.440]  such a great life how'd you do x y and z that's why they're so panic we don't want to use this
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:53.120]  knowledge in slavery we want to use this knowledge empower you because we're selfish we want to rise
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:58.080]  with you these globalists are mentally ill they want to suppress you so they're on top of a singing
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:05.200]  ship no we want to be on top of a rocket with you and it's the only we are not going to win
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:12.000]  in by just yelling about in front of a in front of a building the pilgrims had to leave the nether
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:17.120]  ones they had to build a new country we've got to build a new thing and this is it and once
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:22.480]  everybody realizes one by one we go oh my gosh consciousness creates reality i've been programmed
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:26.800]  to believe i'm not that smart i can't make money i'm not that good at this i've been programmed
[3:27:26.800 --> 3:27:30.880]  through an emotional pattern that's been memorized in my brain and nervous system that i have a
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:36.400]  that i'm have a a tendency towards depression once we break out of that entire software system
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:41.280]  and re-engineer it that's when it's game over that's when the entire we have confidence in you
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:44.960]  folks we believe in empowering you and let's go back six months ago you entered me i really liked
[3:27:44.960 --> 3:27:51.600]  you nor do you you were a lot of my family were listeners and fans you were pitching me on a history
[3:27:51.600 --> 3:27:56.880]  course maybe to do or a cryptocurrency course or political course and i said no i want to do
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:03.120]  spirit wars mind wars and i'm not taking credit away from you but the once we decided on that topic
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.480]  you have been such an inspiration and more than half of what we put together so jake great job
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:12.880]  but it's just crazy that we never had to argue about making the spirit wars mind wars and i was
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:17.280]  like no that's the first chapter and now don't you see that's the key folks i got to i got to
[3:28:17.280 --> 3:28:22.880]  officially argue with alex jones who gets to say that no but reset it was i'm not that smart the
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:27.280]  smart the point is the point is is that we talked about a lot of things to help people let me say
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:31.920]  this a lot of great but if you don't get your mind free you're done let me say this so you call it
[3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:37.120]  reset wars go to the website right now and sign up please go to the website and sign up i'll tell

[3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:39.200]  they want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new ussa but we won't let them

[3:33:00.720 --> 3:33:13.680]  new world order it's alex jones from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:22.560]  so we see the whole corporate media telling us we're ugly we're depressed we're failed we're
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:27.680]  fallen we're racist we're here telling you you're amazing made of the image of god
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:32.240]  and you've got to simply realize the programming and transcendence so yeah we're hammering the
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:38.800]  hell out of it because under pressure the great answers come and i've knew all this my whole life
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:44.240]  but never really consciously took it in so that's why jake is so excited about this and hammering
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:50.480]  reset wars because we were there six months ago thinking how do we really help people how
[3:33:50.480 --> 3:33:55.200]  don't we do something positive he's a big positive guy so he interviewed me i said hey
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.400]  we ought to do something positive we ought to went out to dinner his his dad came and visited some
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:04.720]  of his crew i went on a show and i was like you know i really like what you do i'm a failure
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:08.880]  with your work a lot of my family or fans what do we do that's positive they're like well let's do
[3:34:08.880 --> 3:34:17.760]  financial or let's do and we settled on mental reset wars spiritual reset wars because that's
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:22.320]  the beginning of it all and then we went yeah we had the same understanding it was like was meant
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:26.880]  to happen god was doing it and now here we are got a bunch of these documents to go over and a
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:32.080]  bunch of the evidence where they talk about how you've got your real self how they program your
[3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:38.000]  subconscious to wall off your real self and create a new subconscious they call that de-pattering these
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:44.240]  are mk ultra documents i mean this this because we've finished the course and then you're like
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:49.360]  wait a minute this is everything we independently were saying because they already know you can
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:54.560]  give whatever name you want or label it but but every school of thought is just looking at what's
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:00.880]  actually going on and giving it its time yeah i mean none of this system operates none of this
[3:35:00.880 --> 3:35:07.760]  slave system operates unless they keep people patterned you can't have a debt based monetary
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:14.960]  system where 80 something percent of people live their entire life in credit card debt unless you
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:20.160]  keep people from thinking they can never wake up unless you keep people from realizing that they're
[3:35:20.160 --> 3:35:25.760]  actually more powerful they that that just like anything else i remember when i was 16 years old
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:30.240]  i had my first couple jobs i would get credit cards every month as soon as i got credit and did
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:36.080]  want that never get them sent they were like catching me early exactly and it's not just that it's
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:43.680]  every single area is designed to make us think we're just these little bodies and we're not
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:54.080]  capable of that much and they control everything and unless all of us realize that we have access
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:59.040]  to these higher levels of awareness and as you as you talk about in the reset wars course
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.280]  there's a term alex uses in the course is called your emotional control grid and the emotional
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:10.880]  control grid is when they literally trap us into a false identity we attach to it throw a nervous
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:15.760]  system over and over so we memorize our own thoughts and feelings for so long we think it's
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:21.040]  who we really are we think our personality pattern is cutting us from our original program
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:27.040]  to the new program exactly and they are you you know in in in the deep patterning in this mk ultra
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:32.480]  document they talk about how they have people asleep for weeks on end and they're just filling
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:39.280]  them with millions of suggestions from from affirmations subliminals putting them into hypnotic
[3:36:39.280 --> 3:36:44.720]  states and then they can later that's the joke like in the movies like codename cobra belly and
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:48.400]  you go out and kill somebody that's because that was real they were programming them with a term
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:54.320]  finally to wake up once that happened and do what they're told exactly and once we realize we are all
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:37:01.280]  a part of mk ultra on a social level whether it's fluoride in the water uh whether it's the
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:08.960]  algorithms whether it's keeping us in a fear state every single thing is designed to put us
[3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:15.040]  in a hypnotic state and that's why i say brain wash yourself before the world brain washes
[3:37:15.040 --> 3:37:20.480]  that's right so so be aware of the programming be aware of the systems be calm about it and
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:25.760]  trust god to guide you out of it and then just realize that this stuff exists and that's how
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:30.240]  you transcend it and then that's really what reset wars is and we go through examples and the
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:37.680]  history of it and how to do it and you know when alex was was filming this you know alex is a alex
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:42.080]  doesn't like to promote promote stuff but i just think that reset wars the greatest thing you ever
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:48.080]  did but one of the things that i found was really interesting and why i'm saying like you guys your
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:52.960]  lives are going to be changed literally by reset wars you've never heard alex talk like this go open
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:59.760]  open a new tab right now go to reset wars dot com and sign up right now literally right now because
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:05.520]  you're going to find some amazing stuff and i like i had no idea that you were a kid starting
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:09.680]  your career now alex jones obviously one of the most powerful broadcasters in the world
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:16.320]  i had no idea you started in a closet i had no idea that repeatedly the rug got pulled over you
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:22.160]  over and over and over again and it just shows that if you understand the power of consciousness
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:28.080]  and you live for an from an inner vision you can not only change your personal reality but you might
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:32.400]  be able to never any stuff because i was in line with god no matter what they threw in front i would
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:36.960]  just get stronger and power through it it would take a while but ollie it was it was inexorable it
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:44.960]  wasn't going to stop and talk about destiny talk about because once you realize these these systems
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:50.320]  that alex breaks down and reset wars you're gonna find yourself there's a quote by patanjali and he
[3:38:50.320 --> 3:38:55.680]  says once you're inspired by some great purpose some or extraordinary bond all your barriers
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:38:59.760]  break their limitations and you find yourself to be a more powerful person than you ever imagined
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:05.680]  and let me break that down it's like people think lightning comes from the ground up or the
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:10.800]  or the sky down it's actually ground up it's a it's an electrical connection once you have will
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:15.760]  and you reach out towards god god's free will god doesn't strike you with the lightning of awakening
[3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:20.480]  without you reaching up but once you start doing it it starts happening what i'm saying is once you
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:26.320]  reach out pass what cnn tells you to do and forget them and they're you know jimacosta and all that
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:32.160]  and and and barack obama and and and and all these people once you reach out of the universe to god
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:38.640]  god's gonna answer and and not just barack obama or cnn and think about the idea of this newtonian
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:44.000]  model of physics that we're still so attached to this newtonian model of physics is everything is
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:48.880]  physical in the universe and energy is this unextranable side phenomena max plank already showed
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:53.840]  us he won the Nobel prize studying atoms and he said there's no matter as such that matter jumps
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:39:58.880]  back and forth underspectrometers into another dimension and back it disappears and comes back
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:05.520]  and fluxes and that's why what if people realize the secrets of quantum physics and how to harness
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:10.720]  the power of consciousness if we already know the observer effect shows us that subatomic particles
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:15.760]  are sometimes particles and sometimes they're waves they're energy that moves into another dimension
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:21.200]  and what's everything it's made up of the same energy so your bank account is an observer effect
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:27.040]  once thousands of people realize this and they all break out of debt servitude once thousands of
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:33.200]  people realize that they could change the the the health system you can build private practices you
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:38.480]  can change the education system the tech system once people start using the power of consciousness
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:44.720]  to experiment on this reality and go if all of energy is affected all of reality is affected
[3:40:44.720 --> 3:40:50.400]  by subatomic particles that consciousness creates reality i can de pattern myself from the world
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:55.120]  be transformed by the renewing of your mind and then i can use the power of consciousness to do
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:41:00.160]  thought experiments to start to recreate my life and i think that's the next step that they don't
[3:41:00.160 --> 3:41:06.240]  want us to know they don't want us to start to test the power of consciousness and say uh can i
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:11.040]  create this new business this new movement can i change education system can i get out of debt
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:15.680]  and create my business bigger and better than ever before and that's why i'm pounding the table
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:23.200]  saying go to reset wars dot com right now there's no doubt the key if people go get reset wars when
[3:41:23.200 --> 3:41:28.480]  it comes out in just a few weeks if they research it if they put it in a function it will change
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:33.360]  the world because this is what the globals are aware of but they're using it against you instead of
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:41.600]  you knowing how it really works and it's incredible so real quick here alex as we as we come to the
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:47.440]  end of this segment first of all if you haven't yet like i said open up your browser and do this you
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:52.080]  honestly will know you're right jay we have to hype this up because this really is the key
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:56.880]  people need to go to reset wars dot com put in your email so you get hit with the notifications
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:01.680]  first the videos reports everything when it comes out because if we don't make a big deal about this
[3:42:01.680 --> 3:42:06.800]  nobody's gonna care this is a big deal this is a serious weapon but they want to arrest us why
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:11.200]  they want to put us in prison because they don't want you out of the present and they think well
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:15.280]  we'll just threaten you with jail if you don't shut up but we're not shutting up we're not going
[3:42:15.280 --> 3:42:21.200]  to join you globals we're going to stand against you because look i've got a daughter she's 16 17
[3:42:21.200 --> 3:42:25.840]  months old i'm concerned about what everything's happening to but just finding out the secrets of
[3:42:25.840 --> 3:42:30.560]  the pharmaceutical industry isn't going to save us the next step to actually defeat the great reset
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:34.800]  is we have to realize we are energetic spiritual beings in a physical body there's no such thing
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:40.080]  as death where the imagination of ourselves we're already in a simulation but we control that
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:46.720]  reality and that's exactly what reset wars is showing is very simple we are no longer mpcs

[3:47:12.960 --> 3:47:17.280]  you know folks i could have sold out to the globalist i could have done so many
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:22.320]  deals with them to push their propaganda and made money but you you hear me foaming at the
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:28.000]  mouth promoting reset wars it's because i know if you actually listen and watch and see what's in
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:32.800]  that you've seen a prelude here today this is the secrets of how it all works and it's just really
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:39.360]  true that like david ike yesterday explained we're like russian dolls where there's our larger 12th
[3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:45.120]  dimension consciousness 11th dimension 10th dimension 9th dimension 8th dimension 7th dimension
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:49.840]  6th dimension right down to where we are and they're trying to suck us into a false silicon
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:57.600]  division it's like a subset of the third dimension i mean the whole thing is about oh no no don't
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:48:02.640]  see that don't be involved and then i read white papers where they're admitting it because they
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:09.280]  don't want humanity to get out of their control i'm sorry i want you out of control and so uh
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:14.880]  satan is attacking our free will price said you must be born again and you must be aware of how
[3:48:14.880 --> 3:48:20.560]  you operate and who you really are and that you are eternal and connected to god to be born again
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:24.640]  and so that's what reset wars is all about and everything i've done is about freeing humanity
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:28.720]  everything i've done is about fighting tyrants everything i've done is about standing as to
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:34.880]  but we only got a 10 minutes left here uh with jake dosy here and so i want to continue here
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:38.640]  with some of these articles because there's so many and this one's fascinating alex
[3:48:38.640 --> 3:48:48.160]  what so this is about beamed energy to affect human behavior and it says quote
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:56.640]  while initial attention should be toward degradation of human performance through
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:03.280]  thermal loading and electromagnetic field that means heat the brain up and and electromagnetic
[3:49:03.280 --> 3:49:07.040]  field effects remember we are all just an electromagnetic documents you have on their
[3:49:07.040 --> 3:49:11.520]  mainline declassified say they manipulate our electrical field that's what it's saying right
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:18.160]  here that this is a non-lethal energy weapon uh to directing and interrogating mental function
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:24.880]  using externally applied fields within the possibility of revolutionary capability
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:31.280]  to defend and it goes on it says by using very low frequency electromagnetic radiation the waves
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:36.400]  way below radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum they found they could induce the brain
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:41.920]  to release behavior regulating chemicals which is what you're talking about earlier subduing
[3:49:41.920 --> 3:49:48.080]  the crowds with electromagnetic fields and they could put people into a stupor and it goes on to
[3:49:48.080 --> 3:49:56.320]  say that many of the non-lethal weapons under consideration utilize infrared sound and electromagnetic
[3:49:56.320 --> 3:50:02.800]  energy including lasers microwave or radio frequency radiation or visible light pulse
[3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:09.360]  at brainwave frequency welcome to the 5g world it's not about controlling robots that's a side
[3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:16.000]  issue it's about controlling us but if you're conscious in their own documents and are aware of
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:22.560]  it it can actually make you get even more upset and outside their control you want to submit to
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:28.080]  this or go along with us a question and that's why this whole battle of the great reset is
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:33.120]  ultimately a battle of consciousness and that's why alex said look if we're gonna do
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:37.360]  the first part of reset wars it needs to be mind wars and spirit wars because this is a
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:41.280]  mind war and a spirit war it's an attack on your mind which is what these are all about you agree
[3:50:41.280 --> 3:50:44.800]  now right because you've done a great job helping me research this like that was the best courts do
[3:50:44.800 --> 3:50:49.680]  first and i think it's the only look i i was depressed for a while looking at everything
[3:50:49.680 --> 3:50:54.480]  that's happening especially having a baby and saying we're screwed and to be honest i'm more
[3:50:54.480 --> 3:50:58.400]  optimistic and i agree it forced us i was the same way we're all together everyone's being forced
[3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:03.680]  into the answer yeah it looks like oh jones claims right while we take over he's been given the
[3:51:03.680 --> 3:51:09.280]  answer yeah that's how it works and it's like these people are such gaslighters this is the
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:14.880]  classified documents they talk about depatterning somebody's mind to the extent where they were
[3:51:14.880 --> 3:51:20.240]  literally putting a new operating system into people's minds they talk about electromagnetic
[3:51:20.240 --> 3:51:26.000]  frequency energy waves to influence we're saying what you said god made us we have free will you're
[3:51:26.000 --> 3:51:31.680]  allowed to mind control yourself you own your body you own your soul you have free will mind control
[3:51:31.680 --> 3:51:36.240]  yourself before somebody else does is that your quote yeah brainwasher i want to teach her that
[3:51:36.240 --> 3:51:41.680]  says that mind control yourself before somebody else does that's true use your freaking free will
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:47.600]  before they do this my god that is jake that is so powerful right i said brainwash yourself
[3:51:47.600 --> 3:51:53.760]  before the world brain washes you and and and i thought i was like awake and then i realized
[3:51:53.760 --> 3:51:57.760]  while i knew all this stuff wasn't crazy i was trying to do research for this and then it was
[3:51:57.760 --> 3:52:02.480]  like was it was going to be on like a financial thing or uh or like a survival video it turned
[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:09.040]  into this well that was the holy spirit yeah yeah because look i the reason i'm so optimistic now is
[3:52:09.040 --> 3:52:14.480]  because this is the secret it's not a it's not a coincidence that the metaverse came out like
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:20.400]  right when we were about to publish this stuff they don't want you to be renewed by the transforming
[3:52:20.400 --> 3:52:25.920]  of your mind they're not in his artificial reality you make reality literally we're already in a
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:31.520]  simulation once we understand this is the most fascinating stuff of all once we understand
[3:52:31.520 --> 3:52:36.640]  we create reality they do not control us but the whole way this works is through predictive
[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:41.680]  programming and unconscious collective hypnosis give us to surrender our free will get us to feel
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:46.880]  helpless and if subatomic particles that create all reality are influenced by consciousness we
[3:52:46.880 --> 3:52:51.440]  are creating our own enslavement by saying we're screwed we can't do it claus swabs controlling
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:57.280]  us so that's why i'm saying open up your browser i agree don't just give don't just give claus
[3:52:57.280 --> 3:53:02.800]  swab the power open up your browser to god and say god i want helps surviving this and not just
[3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:07.920]  surviving but thriving during this we didn't get to all these stacks hold on i mean well this one's
[3:53:07.920 --> 3:53:12.560]  crazy right here and and i was going to say open up your browser and go to risa wars dot com not
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:17.280]  it but open up your browser and go to god might even be better but check this one out this is a
[3:53:17.840 --> 3:53:25.680]  us patent number five one five nine seven oh three silent subliminal presentation system
[3:53:25.680 --> 3:53:35.280]  dated october 27 1992 quote a silent communication system in which non-oral carriers in the very low
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:41.760]  or very high audio frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum and it
[3:53:41.760 --> 3:53:51.040]  goes on to say that all of this is for the inducement into the brain typically through loud speakers
[3:53:51.040 --> 3:53:57.120]  earphones on and on and on what is this designed to do it's literally designed it says right here
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:54:06.000]  using supercomputers to analyze human emotional EEG patterns they're replicating human brainwave
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:15.120]  patterns so they can get direct access into the human electrical field by mirroring the same exact
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:20.160]  electromagnetic frequency patterns of the human brain that's why even if you think you know what's
[3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:25.760]  going on you watch info wars every day we are still under mind control and this is why i'm beating
[3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:31.040]  at the drum to open your web browser go to reset wars dot com sign up right now because
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:35.520]  this is how we win well this is literally how people break free and we're gonna do this on air
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:39.840]  we're gonna break it down everywhere but that's what this is and they admit with the fluctuations
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:45.440]  the music the concerts it's all a test try to put you in transit it feels really good we're
[3:54:45.440 --> 3:54:50.800]  putting you in a trance but folks it is total control you know you're supposed to leave today

[3:54:56.080 --> 3:55:01.200]  so many of them i mean it's could take us 15 but i mean this is the admissions of what's crazy is
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:06.400]  they're in the news admitting it yeah go so why do you think they metaphysically admit they're doing
[3:55:06.400 --> 3:55:15.840]  all this everybody um i think that there's something weird with black magic in that they
[3:55:15.840 --> 3:55:21.920]  leave the clues the same thing they did with event 201 right it's like they published event 201
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:28.880]  bill gates goes on now and he says beware of the next smallpox and or maybe it's their own stupidity
[3:55:28.880 --> 3:55:34.000]  and it's god making sure it's a rule you have to publish when you're in a demolition building
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:38.320]  or take property you got to publish it in the newspaper it's a galactic rule they've got to
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:44.560]  tell you what they're about to do but the funny thing is all it takes they didn't think alex
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:49.120]  whatever stop and put something like this together they're just trying to attack them so much well
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:53.600]  they they thought they'd attack us to keep us all balanced from where we were already going
[3:55:53.600 --> 3:55:59.840]  they just made us get there quicker exactly and they i mean this is what the reason i bring back
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:04.400]  to whose idea it was isn't about your idea my idea we were literally doing other stuff and this
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:11.200]  just came out it just it was there and that's why it feels so inspired if you're watching this right
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:17.120]  now and you don't feel that optimistic you feel angry you feel afraid you feel doubtful that
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:22.880]  we're going to win just remember who you are you're a spiritual being in a physical body your body
[3:56:22.880 --> 3:56:28.880]  is a rental car it's literally a rental car for your soul the energy's never created or destroyed

[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:40.400]  and sign up and we start being renewed by the transforming of our mind we will realize we create
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:46.720]  reality they do not control us and they cannot win that's why we called it reset wars because this
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:53.120]  is the war and we are going to win because this is a battle of consciousness bill gates these
[3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:57.920]  individuals are very low level creatures of consciousness they're totally disconnected
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.720]  from their spiritual self and that's why the whole psychological warfare is to trap you back
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:07.120]  into the emotional control grid which is the term that alex coined in the course the emotional
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:13.280]  control grid but they're the thing they fear most is that we invite god we invite spirit into our
[3:57:13.280 --> 3:57:20.080]  lives that's right higher power jake doozy we're going to be breaking it all down a lot more in

[3:58:50.160 --> 3:58:55.840]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that
[3:58:55.840 --> 3:59:01.840]  not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and
[3:59:01.840 --> 3:59:07.520]  the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that
[3:59:07.520 --> 3:59:15.600]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[3:59:15.600 --> 3:59:21.760]  situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lives and all their evil and all
[3:59:21.760 --> 3:59:28.720]  their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on
