[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:37.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.080 --> 00:45.200]  I was almost almost late getting on air a moment ago because I had this impromptu idea about three
[00:45.200 --> 00:53.280]  four minutes ago to do a skit to do a skit in the next week a comedy skit but the more I think
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.840]  about it it is probably not a good idea because the media takes out a context but I want to have
[00:59.840 --> 01:06.080]  some fun at the same time I don't want to all just be gloom and doom and I want to illustrate the
[01:06.080 --> 01:13.400]  absurdity of political correctness by being absurd obviously Egypt is melting down by globalist
[01:13.400 --> 01:17.960]  design we predicted it three years ago when they kicked housing with barricout because it's a part
[01:17.960 --> 01:24.880]  of a Pentagon plan that has been on paper for decades we're gonna be breaking that down we're
[01:24.880 --> 01:31.840]  going to get into more of the fake terror alerts that are coming out and just the incredible police
[01:31.840 --> 01:38.640]  state that we have in this country mother threatened for feeding baby goats milk instead of GMO soy
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.840]  formula by the way in western and also eastern medicine for thousands of years if a mother cannot
[01:44.840 --> 01:51.280]  produce milk or the baby is allergic to her milk you give them goat is about the best you can get
[01:51.280 --> 01:57.480]  unless you can get donkey jackass milk I guess it wouldn't be a jackass it'd be a Jenny so they
[01:57.480 --> 02:05.600]  call a female donkey right a female mule is a Jenny what is a female donkey we'll figure out that
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.440]  in a minute the point is I've just read that in me in medical literature that a that a female
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.600]  donkey is reportedly in some cases better than human milk for a human I mean obviously original
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.920]  human milk has all the immunities that the woman has in her colostrum the first few months especially
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.520]  the first few weeks passed on to the baby so you I know that conspiracy theory that women have
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.040]  mammary glands to feed their young and you know that mole mammals have hair and and feed their
[02:30.040 --> 02:36.440]  young through mammary glands I know scientific terms are racist I get it knowledge is racist not
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.520]  agreeing with the corrupt government is racist I not agreeing with the flavor of ice cream is
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.840]  racist having any opinions racist but I'm just going to get this out of the way right now and
[02:47.840 --> 02:52.840]  then come back into the serious news I saw these articles last few days and hadn't mentioned it but
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.360]  I noticed that some of the White House manipulated groups out there have been bashing me because
[02:57.360 --> 03:08.520]  in the past I've mentioned that I think it's wrong that they are trying to put men in women's
[03:08.520 --> 03:13.760]  sports because they say they're transgendered and that it's obviously a way to cheat sports and
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.680]  the Olympic Committee says the same thing but they say that I'm against transgendered people
[03:18.680 --> 03:22.480]  know I really could care less I understand it's about a big pity party and you're supposed
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.160]  to get all this attention and I'm supposed to hate you and then that makes what you do more
[03:26.160 --> 03:31.360]  fun no no that's not what's going on here but I just thought about it should I get a big
[03:31.360 --> 03:37.360]  polka dotted moomoo put a blonde wig on a fake mustache to make it funnier smoke a big cigar
[03:37.360 --> 03:45.200]  and call Leigh Ann McAdoo in here and say look I'm transgendered I'm gonna arm wrestle you and
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.240]  have a big you know betting around the office and if people don't bet for her they're against
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.760]  women you because that's bigoted to say that a man's gonna be a woman and then and then
[03:53.760 --> 03:58.920]  I'm gonna arm wrestle her as a woman in beer like Andy Kaufman who would do those stunts
[03:58.920 --> 04:04.360]  wrestling women and people hated him for it why didn't Andy Kaufman just wear a wig and say
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.920]  with transgender then it would have been okay hey Mike Tyson could go into women's boxing and he
[04:09.920 --> 04:17.400]  could put a wig on and smoke a cigar and that's the end of it I mean you know why I mean you
[04:17.400 --> 04:28.000]  know what I think I'm gonna go out for the Olympic I don't know how about curling or something and
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.520]  and I'm gonna go out and go against the weight division lower than me two of women and then
[04:32.520 --> 04:37.840]  just that's it also wear a wig Sam a woman that's the end of you go everything made people say
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.760]  they think they're women the point is ladies and gentlemen this famous African runner that was
[04:42.760 --> 04:48.280]  beating all the women it turned out he had wavos he had testosterone he was obvious everybody said
[04:48.280 --> 04:52.920]  that's a man they said how dare you bigot the guy's got six packs it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger
[04:52.920 --> 04:58.640]  either that or he's juicing and of course it turned out it was a man okay I mean that's all I'm
[04:58.640 --> 05:04.880]  saying here are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved
[05:04.880 --> 05:10.320]  through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions
[05:10.320 --> 05:18.440]  of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory
[05:18.440 --> 05:25.000]  state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.400]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.600]  testing it out and verifying it they can take total control of your awareness all of this is

[10:25.160 --> 10:30.040]  of the children were not warned of what was going to happen so just absolute terrorizing again
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.760]  chicken mcnuggets contain strange fibers microscopic forensic investigation by the health ranger uh
[10:34.760 --> 10:40.920]  ron paul says the drug companies and interest companies are the ones who hate uh and uh you
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.600]  the uh who write the laws like the health care law i had a Freudian slip who's i was going to say
[10:46.600 --> 10:53.640]  who hate us i have 40 slips all the time it's like i'll call obama hitler and then i do it uh
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.160]  again ron paul uh the drug companies and the insurance companies are the ones
[10:57.160 --> 11:03.880]  who write these laws he breaks down the truth i mean that's not a joke i mean that's not even
[11:03.880 --> 11:09.160]  our opinion it's i know it sounds crazy because obama's like we're gonna get the insurance
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.600]  companies and the rich guys and the rich people with this health care law communism forward
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.440]  forward socialist soldiers and using terms like forward msnbc your kids belong to the state
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.440]  now your kids belong to the foreign corporations that are above the law and tax exempt 95 year
[11:26.440 --> 11:35.080]  old vet died after uh resisting medical treatment tased and shot with uh beanbags by cops of course
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.640]  this happened a few weeks ago but now it's back in the news that specifically he was killed for
[11:39.640 --> 11:50.040]  refusing uh refusing the medical treatment uh and we're also going to get into some other
[11:50.040 --> 11:56.840]  very important news obviously uh geopolitically dealing with what's happening over in egypt in
[11:56.840 --> 12:09.880]  uh just a moment some of the big news upon info wars dot com right now us army buys nearly 600 000
[12:10.680 --> 12:16.840]  soviet ak-47 magazines now this is one of the least expensive most readily available
[12:17.480 --> 12:25.080]  well functioning guns that the american patriot has gotten because the ak-47 and its variants
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.800]  are made in over 100 countries it's a 1940s design based off a german design partially
[12:31.800 --> 12:38.680]  but perfected by the russians by kalishnikov and it is the most famous gun probably in history
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.720]  and i i own like five of them myself just just i've shot deer wild hogs with them at hundreds of
[12:43.720 --> 12:50.360]  guards open sites they're just amazing little firearms uh they've they've really been perfecting
[12:50.360 --> 12:56.920]  the m4 i didn't used to like the m4 but now i like it it works pretty good but uh i don't know which
[12:56.920 --> 13:07.240]  rifles you know my favorite but for the cost a ak-47 is the gun in my humble opinion and the 7.6239
[13:07.240 --> 13:14.200]  round that it fires you could buy these 20 years ago from narinco for a hundred dollars and i've
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.360]  got a couple that i bought still that are great you could buy bulgarian for a couple hundred
[13:18.360 --> 13:23.640]  dollars even better you could buy russian for a couple hundred dollars they're now 500 600 700
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.080]  over a thousand dollars in some cases because of clinton's import ban that then expired under
[13:29.080 --> 13:36.040]  bush now they've brought it back by fiat trying to use regulations outside of law to block them
[13:36.040 --> 13:43.720]  coming in but we reported on the pentagon buying millions of the guns last month just about 18
[13:43.720 --> 13:52.840]  days ago right at the end of july millions what it was almost four million ak-47s and uh
[13:52.840 --> 13:58.280]  sks's it's like three million one hundred thousand ak-47s and then almost another 900
[13:58.280 --> 14:03.720]  thousand sks's kit daniels wrote about that well kit daniels who just weekly goes and looks at the
[14:03.720 --> 14:09.800]  federal uh registrar and to see where on the fed dot biz site the bids are being put out
[14:09.800 --> 14:19.480]  uh they have bought now 600 000 on top of the millions they just bought of the mags with the
[14:19.480 --> 14:25.000]  guns more mags to dry those up so this is every few weeks this is going on they're buying tens of
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.720]  millions of rounds of the 7.6239 and we found purchases last year and by the way he looked
[14:31.720 --> 14:37.960]  into this about a month ago when we're getting tips from gun manufacturers and ammo depots and
[14:37.960 --> 14:45.000]  then i made some phone calls and confirmed that indeed they're not getting the 7.6239 ammo just
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.760]  like they're not getting all the other NATO rounds because the pentagon and homeland security will buy
[14:51.400 --> 14:56.440]  whatever anybody can make basically if you can make it they'll put an order in so big that you
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.800]  can only sell them for a year or two three years if you up the size of your factory they'll go four
[15:01.800 --> 15:12.600]  years out so this is unbelievable ladies and gentlemen that they are stockpiling millions
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.760]  and millions and millions and millions of rounds of ammo that that here's the key
[15:18.760 --> 15:25.480]  the pentagon homeland security all these domestic armies now have never used and do not use
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.760]  and it was hitting me last night
[15:36.680 --> 15:37.960]  it hit me last night
[15:40.520 --> 15:48.120]  that wow i need to sit back and really think about the the the the extremeness of all of this
[15:48.120 --> 15:56.600]  7000 plus giant war wagons or it's like 2300 a year the last five years i don't know i
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.640]  guess that i keep using a number a couple years old i guess it's probably i don't know what's 2300
[16:02.200 --> 16:09.000]  for five years since over 10 000 the point is is that they're buying thousands and thousands of
[16:09.000 --> 16:23.800]  giant new armored vehicles they have used iraq and and and other wars like afghanistan on record
[16:23.800 --> 16:29.400]  mit in the pentagon admit this to battle harden the the military for domestic operations
[16:30.280 --> 16:37.240]  against the american people some years they buy 2300 of these vehicles other years it's 2700 the
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.360]  point is is that the bradley fighting vehicles are being pre-deployed all over the country
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.120]  abrams are being pre-deployed around the country uh warrior fighting vehicles are being
[16:50.920 --> 16:56.040]  pre-deployed around the country and then i read yesterday out of the new hampshire newspapers
[16:56.840 --> 17:00.200]  where the police chiefs are getting homeless security grants and in the grants it says
[17:00.200 --> 17:08.040]  for combat with sovereign citizens militia and the tea party and the army war college came out
[17:08.040 --> 17:14.600]  last year we reported on it washington times their credit picked up on it they had the image of a
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.160]  flag with a teapot on it with bullet holes in it and the headline that pentagon prepares for war
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.760]  with tea party let's show tv viewers that radio listeners can just look it up and i know i harp
[17:24.760 --> 17:31.000]  on this it's just wow it's unconstitutional it's illegal it's historically incredibly dangerous
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.600]  it's an it's incredibly obvious and they're trying to train the cops to have this arrogant
[17:36.600 --> 17:40.920]  bearing towards the public they've got face scanning and lysis plate scanning cameras going up
[17:40.920 --> 17:46.360]  everywhere all the official training manuals for police say it's for gun owners returning veterans
[17:46.360 --> 17:53.480]  conservatives libertarians in the fetters i mean this is open treason and now they're saying every
[17:53.480 --> 17:59.000]  rodeo clown in missouri's got to take 300 to 500 to thousand dollar depending on who you go to
[17:59.560 --> 18:05.720]  mandated federal classes and sensitivity or you'll be fined through the state by the feds i mean
[18:05.720 --> 18:11.720]  it's just authoritarianism because one guy worn obama mask i mean it's like north korea or something
[18:11.720 --> 18:17.080]  talk bad about kim jong-un or his stupid daddy or his stupid father you know the grandpa their
[18:17.080 --> 18:23.720]  redditary dictator and you disappear i mean that's what we're getting close to here they run tv ads
[18:23.720 --> 18:27.960]  put out by the police in missouri we've played these here going if you talk bad about obama
[18:27.960 --> 18:34.280]  we're gonna arrest you is that clear we decide what isn't true or we decide what's in uh you know
[18:34.280 --> 18:40.360]  not respectful you will respect your dictator i mean even the russian newspapers i've got articles
[18:40.360 --> 18:47.560]  here they're going man america is like the old soviet union what is going on here and i'll tell
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.960]  you what's going on ladies and gentlemen we've got authoritarians trying to take over and most of
[18:51.960 --> 18:57.960]  the republican leadership like lindsey graham and call rove and all the rest of them are lined up
[18:57.960 --> 19:02.600]  behind it because they're part of the very same foreign banking takeover they're just going to
[19:02.600 --> 19:09.000]  use leftist ideology as the as the cutting edge front of this takeover and that's why they get up
[19:09.000 --> 19:16.120]  on msnbc and say alex jones but not just him he's the prophet of the libertarians that carried out
[19:16.120 --> 19:23.560]  the boston bombing think about that now the the the zarna brothers zohar and tamerlin

[24:08.280 --> 24:14.520]  live thank you for joining us on this friday worldwide broadcast i think what i'm trying
[24:14.520 --> 24:20.360]  to get across everybody is that i have a sense of urgency like i've never had a sense of foreboding
[24:20.360 --> 24:28.040]  but also an optimistic sense of human potential and destiny in all of us to really shine in these
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.000]  dark times that we've entered because this is a great awakening that's happening right now
[24:33.720 --> 24:38.760]  and just because the globalists have control of the central banks just because they have control
[24:38.760 --> 24:43.960]  of the corrupt federal government just because they have control of the centralized military
[24:43.960 --> 24:50.440]  does not does not mean they have control of the hearts and the minds of the people congress has
[24:50.440 --> 25:00.760]  a 10 approval rating obama with his supporters has what like a 45 approval rate on many fronts and
[25:00.760 --> 25:08.600]  is and is hemorrhaging out and it doesn't matter most of obama's supporters are literally jellyfish
[25:08.600 --> 25:14.360]  that can't even tie their shoelaces or fake intellectuals that that that think they know
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.360]  everything because they're part of the democratic party you've got a lot of useful idiot republicans
[25:18.360 --> 25:24.040]  as well but at least the republicans put out some common sense anti-collectivist rhetoric
[25:25.160 --> 25:33.000]  but it is a fact on record that the pentagon is training 24 7 with syop divisions in every major
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.320]  city to take over america and this is what i want to say right now before i get into what's
[25:37.320 --> 25:41.320]  happening in egypt and how that ties into america and what's happening with stock market and the
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.480]  world economy and how this isn't a preparation for a collapse and so they're gearing up with a
[25:47.480 --> 25:53.320]  police state they have engineered the collapse well but will behave like they're trying to stop it
[25:54.600 --> 26:00.360]  but i want to get to a point here we were up here at about 10 30 last night working on obama
[26:00.360 --> 26:07.560]  deception too and darryl mcbrain said man i just watched a documentary a british documentary
[26:07.560 --> 26:16.440]  that came out decades ago uh on bbc about how hitler six seven years before the battle of
[26:16.440 --> 26:28.760]  britain started before world war two even started and he said it's incredible they went in they
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.640]  invited the police chiefs and members of parliament you name it over to germany they whined and dined
[26:33.640 --> 26:40.120]  them they have incredible gifts hired them prostitutes got them drunk and then it was later
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.120]  came out that the nazis were planning to once they'd taken over england come to all the police
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.920]  chiefs and people and say hey we like you we want to keep you in place and we're going to double your
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.400]  salary but here's a list of people we want you to go pick up and bring to us to kill and some of them
[26:57.400 --> 27:02.920]  by the way we want you to kill in their homes and by the way kill their families now this is by
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.840]  the way a standard takeover operation and the germans actually did this and i've talked about
[27:08.840 --> 27:18.680]  this at nauseam because it's so important with the french for the again seven years before
[27:18.680 --> 27:25.640]  world war two started when hitler got into power they were full tilt bringing in the french that
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.960]  agreed with some of their policies and ideas buying them off giving them massive payoffs
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.240]  the best you know the cream of german women were told you must go be sex servants to these people
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.600]  for the rike these weren't women that were prostitutes folks these were you know members of
[27:42.600 --> 27:47.320]  some of the most powerful families were told we need you to do this to go infiltrate the
[27:47.320 --> 27:53.560]  kennedy brothers two of the kennedy brothers were under the control of a german sex operative
[27:53.560 --> 27:58.280]  that's been declassified they had him over here as well they'd taken over a lot of the general
[27:58.280 --> 28:04.760]  staff over here doing that and we're gonna have the coup d'etat but then spandley butler they
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.480]  tried to hire him he turned around and stopped it see people just don't know all this so the
[28:09.480 --> 28:16.120]  reason i raised the whole nazi issue is our government that's been occupied by the globalists
[28:16.120 --> 28:26.200]  for decades completely went and paid off the iraqi generals before the 1991 attack and they
[28:26.200 --> 28:32.680]  totally paid him off to stand down in the 2003 attack and that's been admitted they paid off
[28:32.680 --> 28:39.240]  nine out of ten of their generals and they stood down and then it was just iranian and other groups
[28:39.240 --> 28:47.000]  fighting for control of iraq that actually resisted okay and that's on record as well so you have to
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.280]  understand ladies and gentlemen that what you see with the troops on the streets and the check
[28:52.280 --> 28:58.600]  points and the army syops is here in indiana army syops is here in austin you know for a drill
[28:59.480 --> 29:05.240]  behind the scenes they walk in that the police chiefs in the case of san antonio i broke this
[29:05.240 --> 29:11.480]  in 1998 look it up and associated press and they brought in two hundred thousand dollars and said
[29:11.480 --> 29:16.680]  we just want you to take this to work with uh north com before north com was even officially set up
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.480]  and the police chief told me and it came out in the news they bought off them
[29:21.480 --> 29:27.960]  everybody except the police chief took the money and then after that they just corrupt
[29:27.960 --> 29:38.040]  them even more so what the nazis did to the french tried to do to the brits and what the pentagon
[29:38.040 --> 29:47.000]  did to iraq has now been done here you understand that and the pentagon is controlled by foreign banks
[29:47.000 --> 29:56.040]  now that's the big secret we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[34:18.360 --> 34:29.640]  Freudian slip thinking about the Rothschild's oh man and and we sit here and we watch all this
[34:29.640 --> 34:39.560]  unfold the good news is we know about the program the good news is we are aware of it and it's
[34:39.560 --> 34:45.320]  totally illegal it's totally illegitimate and people keep saying but i'm not a bad person i
[34:45.320 --> 34:49.800]  just go work hard i'm not going to worry about that look they're going to take your bank account

[35:07.160 --> 35:16.920]  they will break up your family i am a total piece knowing how much danger i'm in and i don't just
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.880]  say that for theatrical reasons folks i get death threats serious ones where they let me know that
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.080]  they know about my travel habits what i do and what i just talked about with my wife on the phone
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.400]  i have been through all sorts of stuff i won't even get into here on air believe me
[35:33.400 --> 35:38.920]  this stuff's real and you don't have to believe me anymore it's coming out in the news the persecution
[35:38.920 --> 35:44.040]  of pro-life groups the persecutions of libertarians and conservatives because the republican party
[35:44.040 --> 35:50.760]  may be bad and globalist but the ideas that libertarians and realty partiers carry in their
[35:50.760 --> 36:00.120]  hearts is the antidote to the new world order we are antithetical to their program and i am at total
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.920]  peace you know i talked to my dad this morning who's a smart guy and he said no undoubtedly
[36:06.360 --> 36:12.840]  you know they know that half the military listens to you undoubtedly they know that i mean that the
[36:12.840 --> 36:16.840]  escrow rider was there and would see troops walking down the street and see me and run over
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.000]  and then it would be the next group would run over and and then i mean you know they actually saw
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.440]  what i see every day that's in escrow i'm not bragging oh i'm an escrow the point is is that
[36:26.440 --> 36:33.880]  i'm not making that up how popular the show is one way or another we reach massive numbers of
[36:33.880 --> 36:39.720]  people but i may walk by 20 people before somebody stops and talks to me on average is about every
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.720]  five now i was on the hiking bike trail this morning it was about every five people stopped
[36:43.720 --> 36:50.200]  and were listeners but when it's a military it's 50% or more now and that's got to scare the new
[36:50.200 --> 36:54.920]  world order and i keep going back to this why does it scare them then we're going to our guest
[36:56.600 --> 37:02.040]  because i have and i keep saying this every show because i realize this is the message that's
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.280]  got to get out this is why they hate me so much and this is what people need to listen to and
[37:06.280 --> 37:10.360]  understand we've reverse engineered their plan we know their plan
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.920]  the average military person doesn't know why they're told that george washington's a bad guy
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.120]  even though he's on the purple heart they don't know why they're taught that families are bad
[37:22.120 --> 37:26.200]  they don't know why they're told women are going to be in front line combat they don't know why
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.720]  they're told that tea partiers are going to be their enemy they don't know why they're told that
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.640]  gun owners are their enemy and they've got a train to take their guns they don't know but they're
[37:35.640 --> 37:41.800]  starting to get it and i'll say this again it's because they tune into the show and they hear
[37:41.800 --> 37:44.920]  things that they've already been through and they go that guy knows what he's talking about
[37:44.920 --> 37:53.080]  and then they're uncompartimentalized they're not they're not tuning in and hearing something new
[37:54.520 --> 37:59.960]  they're tuning in and hearing something they already knew but i'm simply shaking i'm going
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.960]  look at this look at it our collective house is on fire they're intending for you to do some
[38:05.960 --> 38:09.960]  really bad stuff what are we going to do about this and people say well what is your answer
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.480]  well states rights saying no people blowing the whistle i mean i mean here's a microcosm example
[38:15.480 --> 38:23.080]  okay 2001 they give the troops the experimental deadly anthrax shot that doesn't even protect you
[38:23.080 --> 38:29.240]  from the anthrax and was known to kill people in trials and it killed thousands of troops tens of
[38:29.240 --> 38:35.480]  thousands of convulsions finally the army doctors and air force doctors and and marine corps doctors
[38:36.920 --> 38:43.720]  refused to give the shots anymore they started court marshaling those was like 10 doctors in
[38:43.720 --> 38:49.320]  genver alone at one of the air bases at memory serves you can look this up i had one of them on
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.000]  and they went stood before the man and said this is telling people i won't be part of it
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.720]  and the whole thing imploded and they had to stop giving the shots
[38:55.720 --> 39:04.920]  now that's what i'm talking about right there is you've got to start saying no no matter what
[39:04.920 --> 39:08.840]  what are they scared of they're scared of whistleblowers i had staff sergeant bigs on
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.680]  i showed wired magazine i showed ap where they admit they're putting the troops who aren't even
[39:14.680 --> 39:22.280]  injured on psychotropics on amnesics on antipsychotics and on opiates to addict them to then
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.280]  say that they're mentally ill at the end of their tour and to have that in their medical
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.960]  file they order them to take it and then take their rights away trying to screw them up because
[39:31.960 --> 39:37.720]  they hate the veterans they want to use you now before they get their drones and robots in their
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.760]  autonomous system but you're their number one enemy this is a foreign globalist takeover
[39:42.760 --> 39:48.280]  first thing a foreign globalist takeover does or any other takeover in history is after the brown
[39:48.280 --> 39:52.680]  shirts help bring them in they're going to wipe you out or at least take your rights away
[39:54.680 --> 39:58.520]  and the military's now figuring that out and i saw comments it was a minority of comments
[39:58.520 --> 40:03.400]  but i took a screenshot of it actually this morning let me pull it up and i'll even show tv
[40:03.400 --> 40:09.880]  viewers and we'll go to our guests if you can give me a a document cam document cam shot on this

[40:33.800 --> 40:41.800]  it's obviously another non-commissioned officer now that's the kind of stuff that you see he comes
[40:41.800 --> 40:48.600]  on and talks about a public program to drug the troops order them to take drugs and deadly vaccines
[40:48.600 --> 40:54.040]  to screw them up he talked about how the officers don't have to take the shots and admit they don't
[40:54.040 --> 40:59.800]  but say you're going to take all these shots and to see all his men get sick this is what woke him
[40:59.800 --> 41:04.440]  up he wasn't a listener and then to see the government drug dealing and all this and somebody
[41:04.440 --> 41:10.280]  says he's a traitor for admitting the torture the government drug dealing the dea there running
[41:10.280 --> 41:18.520]  the drugs in afghanistan he was also in iraq who is who is sergeant bigs he's a traitor not the
[41:18.520 --> 41:26.440]  globalist treating our troops like absolute dog dude no no no he's a traitor for talking about it
[41:26.440 --> 41:33.560]  and see this is the stuff that tyranny's made of oh you're the backbone yeah you're the people that
[41:33.560 --> 41:39.160]  keep everybody in line under this tyranny and how dare you have bullet wounds i mean you know
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.200]  that i was out water skiing with a guy or water surfing with him wake surfing to be technical
[41:44.200 --> 41:48.120]  and you know just shrapnel wounds bullet holes you can see the bullet holes in his feet you know
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.760]  he's got like shrapnel in the back of his head and his hair is turning gray and like blast points
[41:52.760 --> 41:56.520]  where the where the shrapnel has never seen anything like that it's like boy that's got to be good
[41:56.520 --> 42:01.960]  for you he hasn't done enough for the new world order he's supposed to he's supposed to let them
[42:01.960 --> 42:06.040]  try to turn him into a drug addict and give him all these deadly vaccines because that's what a
[42:06.040 --> 42:13.320]  patriot does this is the mind control ladies and gentlemen and the psyops and the system knows
[42:13.320 --> 42:19.800]  that we've broken through into the inner sanctums of the cia the defense department all of it

[42:51.320 --> 42:57.160]  nazis mainline history books their own declassified nuremberg stuff with their own manuals and i go
[42:57.160 --> 43:03.000]  oh my gosh delta force is buying off police nationwide in a federal covert takeover of local
[43:03.000 --> 43:10.920]  governments discovered that broke that the ap had to cover it 16 years ago 15 years ago
[43:10.920 --> 43:15.720]  i'm not bragging it's it's that history repeats itself those that don't know history or do them
[43:15.720 --> 43:21.080]  to repeat it who said that was it lord actin where'd he say power corrupts absolute power
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.920]  corrupts absolutely he said pal he said power tends to corrupt is the actual quote absolute

[43:53.480 --> 44:00.040]  milk do you have any idea what's in the regular formula 70 plus percent high fructose corn syrup
[44:00.600 --> 44:05.000]  you do you know about the studies about cc size of the brain if you don't abuse your child and
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.440]  give them a shriveled zombie brain to serve the new world order if you give them goats milk or
[44:10.440 --> 44:16.200]  genny milk from a jackass from a female donkey you are going to have your children taken ladies and

[45:25.080 --> 45:32.440]  comparison uh the fact is you know you're right uh if we don't stand up now uh we're very close
[45:32.440 --> 45:38.120]  we're teetering on the edge of irreversible tyranny in this country without there being an extreme
[45:38.120 --> 45:43.000]  amount of bloodshed and and and that's what we're that's what we're out there for we need to wake
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.040]  congress up so that they'll see what's going on those that can do something those that want to do
[45:48.040 --> 45:54.840]  something about it to stop it and uh you know just like you said go to overpasses.org you can find
[45:54.840 --> 46:01.400]  us on facebook and and and get all the dates and everything i end up i'm sorry about the locations
[46:01.400 --> 46:07.160]  and everything uh we've got three going on going on just in the small state of delaware those people
[46:07.160 --> 46:12.040]  are great up there and it's uh i mean just every state across the country right now we've got something
[46:12.040 --> 46:20.920]  going on in in at least your biggest city and and all over the place really but but we have got to
[46:20.920 --> 46:26.040]  speak out we absolutely have got to speak out and get something done you know the fact is this
[46:26.040 --> 46:32.040]  movement's growing and it's getting bigger and bigger every single day and it's people just you
[46:32.040 --> 46:37.000]  know ordinary people we aren't nobody nobody in the movement's anybody special except for the fact
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.320]  we've all we all woke up and that's all we want everybody else to do is just just wake up and speak
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.680]  out before it's too late before we can't speak out anymore uh you're and you're absolutely right
[46:48.680 --> 46:55.080]  alex history is just replete with times of of of what's going on right now what's going you know
[46:55.080 --> 47:02.440]  the the slow stomping out of our rights until eventually anybody that dares speak out is quite
[47:02.440 --> 47:08.360]  simply just killed and if we don't do something about it now it's just going it will get nothing
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.920]  but worse and how could we live with ourselves knowing that our children our grandchildren
[47:12.920 --> 47:20.200]  who knows how many generations of people will have to live under conditions what i what i believe
[47:20.200 --> 47:24.200]  will be worse than what the soviet union had to bring you know oh absolutely it's the very same
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.640]  people running this uh today expanding on this historically for those that aren't aware of this
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.360]  the reason homeland security which is the takeover arm of america we have marine
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.920]  corps kernels going public and saying this is the illegal army to absorb and kill the republic
[47:38.920 --> 47:45.240]  it's the opposite of homeland security properly uh orwellian that their prepositioning and getting
[47:45.240 --> 47:51.160]  ready for war because the system is going to push people until you don't have a choice but to
[47:51.160 --> 47:57.640]  physically fight back so we're trying to stop that from happening peacefully but as but as
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.280]  Churchill said there may come a time when you've got to stand up against an enemy when you have a
[48:02.280 --> 48:07.320]  good chance of winning but if you wait too long to paraphrase it may come when it's you know a
[48:07.320 --> 48:13.000]  50-50 chance and then may come when it's really tough odds or it may finally come to where you
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.600]  know you're going to be defeated but it's better to die on your feet than to be enslaved and
[48:16.600 --> 48:21.160]  basically killed slowly and so people need to understand there is no choice in this and i'll
[48:21.160 --> 48:27.720]  tell you something really sad from all the videos and photos i've seen and it's not overpasses.org
[48:28.360 --> 48:33.960]  it's it's what msnbc and the white house has done they have said that tea party and any resistance
[48:33.960 --> 48:40.840]  to obama and his agenda is racist and so i see in the photos it's almost all white people and and i
[48:40.840 --> 48:46.280]  know there have been some black folks and hispanics and asians out there but we need to invite all
[48:46.280 --> 48:51.640]  races religions and creeds that are upset about the evil of this government and and their front
[48:51.640 --> 48:58.840]  man obama to come out everywhere for whatever your beef is with this system and to be seen and to be
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.920]  heard you agree sir oh absolutely i mean you know race is absolutely we don't even consider it it's
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.320]  absolutely the last thing i mean we don't care if you're democrat libertarian independent you know
[49:11.320 --> 49:16.840]  just whatever it absolutely does not matter if you love america and you want your children to grow
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.360]  up in a in a in a world that that you would you would want to grow up in or or better you know
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.720]  i mean we're always supposed to try to leave our children with a better environment than what we
[49:25.720 --> 49:31.960]  lived in if that's what you want then you've got to step up now i mean the fact is this government
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.520]  is not looking out for the minorities it's doing the exact opposite they're they're doing everything
[49:36.520 --> 49:40.600]  they can to create a permanent peasant class in this nation you can just look at obama care
[49:40.600 --> 49:46.520]  and that's exactly what it'll do i mean the fact that nobody could work more than 29 hours a week
[49:46.520 --> 49:51.320]  if you think it's hard finding a job now it's incredible you know what yeah what will it be
[49:51.320 --> 49:56.120]  like and if you look at unemployment in the in the especially especially in the black community
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.920]  right now obama has not done them any favors whatsoever and he has no intention of doing
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.120]  oh no that they like you said that the the cloud and piven plan is bankrupt them permanent peasant
[50:06.120 --> 50:10.200]  class where there's no reason to work because you'll get more money if you go on welfare
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.560]  this is so diabolical this is slavery sir we're going to get you back up next week

[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:50.120]  america but the rest of the western world is in a death struggle against anti free market crony
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:56.920]  capitalist interest that use socialism to collectivize the general population creating a peasant
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.800]  class this is the official policy of the department of health and human services with the head of it
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.560]  and others calling for malice policies they want a permanent peasant class in america and they want
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:15.640]  to replace basic rights of privacy rights to not be killed in a in a in a illegal war
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:22.360]  all the basic war crimes that are being committed all that is ignored now the right to not have 85
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:28.280]  billion dollars a month stolen from you and given to foreign offshore banks and congress has told
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.040]  that they're not even allowed to know where the money's going violating the constitution common
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:38.440]  sense and law just thousands of examples we all know of of the out of control system
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.360]  and the fact that it's illegitimate and they're rolling the pentagon out against the people and
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.720]  shutting up all this face scanning surveillance and listening to our phone calls and saying the
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.320]  biggest terror threat is the tea party and the pentagon is preparing for war and taking the
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:02.040]  children of casual marijuana smokers are taking the children of people who give goats milk to their
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:10.680]  baby uh because uh that's known as the best milk if your child refuses your milk on and on and on
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:19.480]  just a manifest predatory tyrannical government in our face and instead the new rights arm
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:29.320]  if you're transgendered the the the taxpayers should pay so that you can have your genitals removed
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:38.440]  or if uh you are a beach rat as you call yourself you should have a escalade and eat lobster every
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:47.800]  day uh off of people that do work and uh it doesn't matter what you do as long as you're a good
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:54.840]  little collectivist but we're going to swat team people who can't pay their property taxes and
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:02.360]  take their home and if they resist we're going to kill them to make sure that 101 million people
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:10.600]  can be on welfare uh food assistance in this country right at 50 million on federal food stamps alone
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.520]  this is a public plan they've done it in with the the american indians they've done it with
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.360]  other groups that have been enslaved making them dependent it's how you domesticate animals
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:27.560]  and it's the clowered and piven plan from 1966 officially adopted by barack obama
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:35.960]  is to have obama care come in bankrupt all the smaller hospitals and hmo's and insurance
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.680]  companies that are creating competition for the big insurance companies and shut down
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.960]  all the little clinics make 61 percent of the doctors are now announcing they're going to
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:52.040]  retire early that's associated press a few weeks ago international poll bankrupt that
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:12:02.440]  uh and basically make the entire system fall apart and then make everyone in the country who
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:09.320]  was lower middle class go to less than 30 hours a week 29 hours a week uh creating again a permanent
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:16.120]  peasant class under obama care that doubles the premiums by 2015 already a 50 plus percent increase
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:22.520]  just in one year of semi-implementation written by the insurance companies we have a video of ron
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:28.280]  paul breaking that down i mean that's a fact written by mainly foreign insurance companies
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:37.320]  to gang rape the economy if you don't think shutting thousands of power plants down the
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.200]  last five years and doubling power prices in many areas the country isn't shutting things down if
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.480]  you don't think paying to ship general motors to china isn't shutting things down quick enough
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.320]  if you don't think all the regulations and red tape selectively put on small businesses
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.840]  isn't enough to shut things down if you don't think the federal government violating federal
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.200]  law and not giving contracts to small businesses isn't going to shut things down if you don't think
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.720]  bringing in 30 million illegals to get welfare so they can subsidize and work for below minimum
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:09.400]  wage isn't going to bankrupt things and bring you to your knees and collectivize you then nothing
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:16.760]  will wake you up obama according to the la times has tripled federal raids on marijuana legal
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.600]  medical doctor dispensaries has tripled the number of raids taking people's children it was on cnn
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:28.520]  today uh where they give them hemp oil proven in major studies to have massive anti-cancer properties
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.920]  just savaging everyone but it's okay because he's black and if you don't like it you're a racist
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.440]  what did sabilia say three days ago the head of health women's services said if you don't like
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.920]  obama care you're racist if you don't like foreign banks literally shaking you down you're a racist
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.080]  and if you want to be a rodeo clown and make fun of obama you're a racist

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.760]  channeling for you from my understanding who the globalists really are
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:51.400]  so i hope that you will listen to me because i'm in pain watching humanity
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.120]  attacked by these scumbag scientific technocrats spiking the food the water the air with all of
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:03.400]  their anthropogenic garbage and their soft kills their their their binary weapons all of it it's
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:10.840]  all a big joke to them to mess with our endocrine system to mess with our endocrine receptors
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.040]  they are playing god ladies and gentlemen and i'm not going to sit here and put up with it anymore
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:24.680]  and then me well oh look israel this is uh live science washington's blog uh links through
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.040]  out of the supreme court of israel and the health ministers press release and the israeli
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:37.640]  newspapers israel has outlawed water fluoridation saying that it is forced medication and linked
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:45.000]  to cancer uh and lower i cube so israel will not be fluoridated i i guess they're they're
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  bad to msnbc i i i guess but what do you want to bet just like europe won't fluoridate and israel's
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.320]  getting it out i thought israel everybody says runs everything why were they being fluoridated
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.160]  before because the same elites over there want their people dumbed down in an haze as well
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.760]  by or obsessed with things like this california becomes first to pass historic transgender law

[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.680]  out with andy kaufman yeah i just want to say that i'm very disappointed about the challenges
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:57.080]  that i received last week as some of you might have seen last week i polished off four women in a
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:05.800]  row falling 30 seconds each 30 seconds each i challenge gz yarnetta and macadoo to arm wrestling
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:10.760]  i'm going to come back that's chivalrous about a month yeah but i'm not going to offer 500

[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.520]  that can beat me and see he was hated in a month because he did this but if he just said he was

[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:37.640]  you shut up kaufman i'm talking right now i want silence when i say i'm transgender
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.400]  again here i'm another woman get in here and fight me by the way the olympics they're now

[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:22.440]  generate mass hysteria and chaos but i believe you should be informed about it because when the
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:27.640]  sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this

[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.560]  all right ladies and gentlemen i apologize that i give you harvard studies
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.360]  that florida's brain damaging you and your family by design
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.480]  and i apologize as msnbc says i'm deeply racist with no evidence that i've reported that the
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.640]  israeli supreme court has ruled that they must take the florida out because it is a carcinogen
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.560]  and brain damages people and the source is the israeli health minister's office press release
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.640]  and haraq's individual and post so i apologize for that racism uh i'm not being sarcastic according
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:57.720]  to msnbc that is racism and it's homophobic that uh that to say that andy coffins should not have
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.080]  been transgender and allowed to wrestle women i mean you know it's it's the same deal i mean
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:10.040]  it's just madness folks they've got us all talking about you know kin kin one day a guy can come into
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.760]  the girl's bathroom the next thing go to the boys bathroom or vice versa it's all just the craziness
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:20.040]  of these of the globalist to get us obsessed with all these other side fights while we're all
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:26.200]  being annihilated by the new world order but i want to go to kevin booth for the balance of the hour
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:33.000]  and we are exclusively the distributor of the dvd american drug war two that gets into it kevin
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.360]  in a nutshell this is such an important film i have a copy of it right here
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.480]  wall street journal calls it this film is a game changing moment from the film entertainment industry
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:50.280]  as well as the cannabis industry and it just exposes what a fraud all this is but my biggest
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.000]  reason to decriminalize is that i know people all over the place having their kids taken
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.240]  and if they get caught with half a marijuana cigarette they come take their kids and hand them
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:07.160]  over to you know literal pot belly pedophiles uh who will be convicted coke dealers and stuff i mean
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.720]  they are really coming after people that smoke marijuana and the feds seem to be driving the
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:17.080]  train but i guess i guess it is good to take people's kids that smoke pot because obama's a black
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.240]  president and you got to do what he says or that's racist so i guess you support obama
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.640]  crippling the raids on cannabis dispensaries right because you're not a racist right kevin
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:33.480]  uh that's correct so you do support obama how's it going alex good hey wait what do you think of
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.240]  uh uh guys are going to be able to join the girls wrestling team now i'm from hollywood baby
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:47.720]  i don't talk like that that that kaufman bit is classic i love that that's amazing i'm i'm from
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:53.960]  tennessee i don't talk like this from tennessee i don't mean don't you want to get anybody you
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:59.160]  could beat me why don't we take a 400 pound kid and then put him in the ring with some girls let
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.640]  him wrestle him in the high school i think that's a good idea because because we want to be tolerant
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:10.040]  here and let the we can put a wig on him uh dress how about the boxing club we can let the boys
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.160]  beat the girls up because they're really they're really girls too kevin now come on alex i live
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.920]  in west hollywood now don't go crazy kevin there you go so you agree with it there you go what about
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.760]  put about putting a wig on mike tyson and letting him get in the women's boxing league uh if i could
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:35.000]  bet on it sure so that that might actually be the way he could come back yeah yeah exhibition
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.720]  fights mike tyson versus women you'd have to you'd have to muzzle him though because he might bite
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:45.480]  him but that's okay women get the same rights as a vander holyfield now why don't we put them both in
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:54.760]  wigs say they're both transgender oh man that's funny is that what american drug wars are really
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:01.480]  about you got you got it you always throw me for a loop i'm always ready to come on here and i'm
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:08.120]  never ready it's funny that's funny man so you are endorsing mike tyson entering the heavyweight
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:13.800]  women's league as a transgender athlete i hadn't thought about it until now but yeah i'll endorse
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:20.280]  that sure i think i endorse it as well next i'm gonna be a guest on uh on msnbc they'll go now

[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.840]  kind of erotic i don't know well kevin let's not get into your sexual fantasies here on there okay
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:42.440]  you're a major filmmaker we're here to talk about that the point is is that those women are obviously
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.440]  taking a bunch of male hormones right so they are men basically yeah that's pretty creepy
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.320]  did you know when the women take that of those hormones they actually grow an appendage
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.800]  okay so i'm not allowed to talk about it but you can talk about it i did not know about this
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.200]  appendage alex tell me about the appendage i'm not gonna do it no i'm just giving medical facts

[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.520]  a lot of them had to leave the inner city to find safety wearing the outlying areas known as the
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:28.040]  suburbs one such boy who grew up in this area was a very bright boy but suffered from an addiction
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:34.600]  a terrible affliction and the only way you can find a balance to his harmonious inner yin and yang
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:40.120]  dark and light positive negative polarities was an ancient chinese method known as karate

[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:23.800]  karate i have real high hopes upon becoming a ninja warrior sweet lamb no really i think it
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:28.840]  would be a fine career for i wish i was never born to hear the words that are spewing out of my
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:34.760]  son's mouth at this practice table this morning good one first of all son there is no market for
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.720]  being a ninja look at the index they're down point 10 and 20 percent this year down 2 percent from
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.200]  last year good one buzz you tell him the truth and you tell him loud and clear first of all son i
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:49.160]  am so disappointed in you and i'm hurting hurting bad if my ills could bleed they would bleed blood
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.680]  and i'll be there to swab them up and blame you my son blood would spout out of my ears like a plasma
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:00.520]  sprinkler and i would water the earth with my own disaster all right folks that is not his new film
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.320]  his last big film aired all over the big cable channels and his award-winning american drug war
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.800]  one that i consulted on i did not consult on this one it's i think it's even better the wall street
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:14.520]  journal called the film a game-changing moment for both the film and entertainment industry
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.600]  as well as the cannabis industry and folks i'm a serious person but when i get with old friends
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:26.760]  and start joking around with comedians i tend to shift into another mode and by the way this is
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.600]  a very serious film american drug war two that's something kevin made with bill hicks back before
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:40.600]  bill hicks was even known as a comedian obviously a icon of a comedy today but i was shifting gears
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.000]  out of that into american drug war two cannabis destiny and i just saw the guys and they're
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.560]  watching a clip from ninja ninja ninja ninja bachelor party while we're talking about andy
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:57.640]  koffman i'm not only bill hicks folks i'm actually andy koffman as well and uh we are back live
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.560]  folks if you're a new listener you're going what are you talking about it's an it's an online thing
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.680]  that i'm bill hicks and it's it's it's comical to us but also painful to the hicks family so we
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:12.360]  shouldn't shouldn't joke about it but uh very very interesting uh kevin we we need to get serious
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.600]  and get into the new film uh which i think i'm psychologically avoiding because it is so hardcore
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.480]  uh and the persecution of people that even use marijuana that doesn't have thc medicinally but
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:29.000]  what is the new wrinkle in the i'm bill hicks saga okay well the this guy took our last interview
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.560]  and he claims that we're doing damage control now for him discovering that you're really bill
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:39.240]  hicks and he took our last interview and he plays parts of it backwards and so it's like a
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:44.360]  back masking thing and and so when you play our last interview backwards we're really like
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:50.120]  admitting all these secret truths about who we really are and it's funny too it's it's it's ironic
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:55.560]  because maybe he is a bill hicks fan obviously because uh bill actually had a joke about back
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.760]  masking and and the joke was about if you play new kids on the block backwards it actually sounds good
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:06.600]  and i actually did a lot of back masking just because i was uh into jimmy page and led zeppelin
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.080]  and i was reading a book called hammer the gods when i was producing uh marblehead johnson and
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.280]  relentless album and so i was always i always put little little like back masking moments in
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.000]  little places and uh little secret hidden things so it's funny that he did that it's kind of ironic
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.800]  he's obviously a bill hicks fan if he's out there doing this but i've actually also discovered
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.920]  something new which should be ultimately ironic and that was who was born only days after bill died
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.640]  who would be uh in fact if anybody can guess this during the duration of the show who was born
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.800]  just a matter of days after bill died who would be the actual ironic thing if bill was to have been
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:49.160]  reincarnated as somebody okay they can send their answers to real alec shones on our twitter and guys
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.720]  bring in uh at the end of the hour the answers and i'll go over that all right kevin let's get
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:38:00.440]  serious here okay let's in a nutshell tell people why american drug war two is so powerful and quite
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:06.200]  frankly hard to watch i mean because it makes me mad it makes me angry i know it's all true because
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.800]  i've researched the stuff that's in it you know the cps uh all of it uh that denying the medical
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:16.760]  treatment the harassment i mean this is really a powerful film as the wall street journal called
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:23.880]  it it's a game changing moment for film well you know the whole time they've been selling the drug
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.920]  war agenda on everybody it's all have been about trying to protect the children protect the children
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.880]  protect the children and so i thought like the the the best place to take the sequel to the the
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:40.280]  original movie would be to how is the drug war really affecting the children how is american
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.280]  drug policy the so-called drug policy really affecting american children and children all over
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:51.000]  the world and you know what we see just like that story that just happened recently in round rock
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.760]  where that uh a two-year-old girl was taken away from the parents because they smoked marijuana
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:03.240]  and now the the the little girl was actually murdered by the foster mother and it just goes
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.360]  on and on from people being denied to use the best medicine by the way the foster parent dad
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.520]  was a two-time convicted drug dealer yeah no it's you know they they do do you know and and my wife
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.720]  and i we became foster parents not as some sort of like a stunt for a movie and all that and people
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.960]  have accused us for that that that's fine we actually know i mean i've known you i've known
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.840]  you 18 years you've been trying to have a kid yeah exactly and so we decided to come by there's 35
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.040]  yeah but you shouldn't even bring up what trolls do i don't want to give out your private medical
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.760]  info but you and trave gone through hell to try to have a biological baby yeah we went to the we
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:42.600]  went to this means very angry that that that that people would say that but go ahead you know it's
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:48.760]  okay i mean but you know it's expected uh so we decided there's 35 000 children here in the foster
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  system in los angeles so we decided to become foster parents and and you know we're thinking
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:56.600]  like you know what we won't get a baby we'll start with somebody older we're older we're ready to you
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.680]  know have it and so uh our first child that came to us was an 11 year old girl who had been taken
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:07.400]  away from her mother her mother was in prison uh various charges i won't go into that because
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.200]  we're friends with her and she's back with her mom good really good person and uh this little girl
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.680]  is a completely normal little girl uh and then all of a sudden they hand us all these prescription
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.760]  drugs and we find out that we have to give her aterol in the morning and we have to give her a
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  powerful barbiturate at night and she just came directly from a a foster home where they did this
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.320]  to all the children and we're finding out that almost every child in fact finding children in
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:39.160]  the foster system that aren't put on powerful uh psych meds uh add medication is is that's hard
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.680]  to find almost all the children in the foster system are put on powerful pharmaceuticals and
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:48.920]  the ironic part obviously is that a lot of these children being removed from their parents because
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.520]  they did drugs including marijuana go figure i mean i've been i've sat there in child protective
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.520]  meetings with these people that i'm friends with and you hear like the thinking that they're going
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.200]  through where we were inside these people's house and oh we saw the bong on the coffee table
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:08.520]  child's coming with us it's like wow okay yeah i mean you lose your children because you smoked
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:15.160]  marijuana that's in every research and statistic a lot less worse uh than things like alcohol and
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:22.840]  then over 68% nationally of foster kids are on an average of seven psychotropic drugs and medical
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.640]  doctors have said we take healthy kids and they're dead two years later they're killing them
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.040]  with kevin it's thx 1138 it's breaking the world they're making all the troops take drugs
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.920]  as well they want to wreck people's minds and and the and the really sad part about it i mean
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.400]  the the little girl in the movie we we were able to get her off the medication we had to go through
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.040]  a long process because the thing is if you just yank the medication well first of all you could
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.560]  be playing with fire on a medical level to just stop the medication or to like mess with the
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.400]  with the cocktail that they give them much less you could get in trouble and the child would just
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.320]  be taken away from you if you monkey with anything and they're checking on you constantly
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:08.200]  but we've since the movie gotten another foster daughter uh who is 16 and here comes like another
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.960]  tricky factor that you have to deal with and all this and that she doesn't want to stop doing the
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.440]  drug she actually likes the drugs you know and so sometimes she seems like she's speeding out of
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  her mind and she's like fun as much as like anybody have ever hung out with that's doing speed um
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.080]  and you try to like explain it she she understands the movie she loves the movies watch the movie 100
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.880]  times living with us and yet when it comes to like well maybe we should back off of your medication
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.000]  she's like no no no no i love this stuff you know it's like hey you know that's uh you know how is
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.240]  this going to turn out 10 years from now well we caught researchers up in um minnesota caught the
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:49.320]  police became national news going and finding young kids on the streets and putting them by the hundreds
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:56.440]  in just one research case on hard drugs to then have them become dealers for them so the truth
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.400]  is the whole system knows this the government deals the drugs they run it all and they run the kids
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:05.240]  they take the kids because your child broke their finger at the playground doesn't matter you have
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:09.880]  witnesses or you go to have a baby and they go oh we found marijuana in your system and then they're
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:14.040]  going to take your kid and put them on deadly antipsychotics that eat their brain and they love
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.480]  it they know exactly what they're doing you're saying the average social worker just doesn't
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:22.120]  understand it well that's because they were probably brought up the same way yeah i mean that's just
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:28.760]  it's it's such a huge crazy system that you can't when you get into the system you find you know a
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.360]  lot of people are going how did you get away with making this movie you know i i'm surrounded by all
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:39.000]  these people it's like such a big crazy broken system there's nobody really to point the finger at
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.360]  i mean i'm i'm surrounded by these people and uh i could you know i could do whatever i wanted
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:50.200]  it's not going to stop anything change anything or you know it's just so big and broken and people
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.320]  ask how let me get him a film big and broken people you're like you're like too big to fix you're
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.680]  not too big to fail too big to trade i already trademarked it okay good but i mean seriously
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:07.640]  kevin that's it people ask how am i so alive at a certain point stuff is so screwed up
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.480]  it's been done by design but it's like a perpetual motion machine right once they set
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:19.640]  this thing going it's just going to eat society yeah i mean you can sit there and be the whistleblower
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.680]  and and and all these people are like yeah good point i mean i've sat in there in meetings
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:29.880]  with these doctors and these are intelligent you know these are like cool intelligent people uh
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:37.320]  young hip you know they're not old bureaucratic you know dummies and you know look i'm this guy
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.800]  i do these lectures and here's my films and here's my message and all these things and
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.040]  there oh that's really interesting and and then it'll be like okay here's her refill for her
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.240]  medication see in two months see that's what's so invincible about this spirit of not caring
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.480]  it's beyond evil it's like they'll even recognize what you're saying but keep going on with it
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:00.520]  right it's like when i flew back in from england they said do you have any drugs on you
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:03.800]  blah blah i said no and i go and you know the government brings most of them in
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:10.440]  and the guy went yeah i know that's so what and i'm like so it's only bad if i've got them right
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.040]  and then i went to the next lady and she said your passport's up in a year and a half why
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.400]  i would should we done it i said is there anything wrong with me doing that she goes
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.560]  i go you just want to act powerful don't you and she just looked at me went well yeah kind of
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:30.280]  yeah this is like what uh i mean i'm seriously that conversation happened i believe it love those
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.760]  airports no but i mean i miss i miss going to airports with the alex there's always a treat
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:40.600]  to go through an airport with alex jones i guess we have flown together yeah before yeah you ought
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:48.280]  to fly with ventura i think i flew with him like the last time he flew i mean it was literally
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.840]  like south park meets ventura women exactly like that same voice same deal rubbing in between you
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.040]  know grabbing on him and he went on and on they were giggling taking shots and ventura you know i
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:07.560]  mean literally was beyond anger on the flight over there once we got to new orleans and he was
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.360]  fuming and he apologized three days later because he we almost got into it he almost got into with
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.720]  other people and i got why he was mad and he was totally violated but see that it's bad that he
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:23.880]  felt violated isn't it he should just give into it to women and men knowing full well who he is
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.280]  rubbing all over him and laughing i think the funniest story always was the joe rogan story
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.360]  and people are going to think i'm racist maybe we're saying this uh it goes along with your theme
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.760]  today oh am i saying this story absolutely you're right but the joe the joe rogan story when he was
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.520]  like sitting there at the airport and the guy's like talking to him about fear factor do people
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.440]  really eat cockroaches to meet all the fear factor questions while they're searching him
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:55.400]  and then a guy with a giant turban oh yeah exactly i've seen that exact type of stuff going well you
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.800]  know the saudi arabians don't have to get searched when they come into the us because they complained
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:04.520]  yeah well and again that's some of the real terror group is from there being funded by the
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:11.160]  government to kill christians but that's okay i guess it pays to own all the oil uh you know
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.360]  what i think it's more than that i think they're working with the globalist to be able to take
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:20.840]  over the west it's it's all part of a dog and pony show yeah it's crazy the saudi use the
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.800]  the muslim extremist excuse to enslave their people but then actively run them that's the same
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.880]  thing here they're like you want to try this yeah we fund these guys they even think they're
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:34.440]  doing it for all of them you can enslave all your people they'll never notice you know a few years
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:39.560]  flip flop it onto the tea party they're like sounds like a good plan yes sir and what's
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.120]  interesting too is that a lot of this top marijuana research now is actually coming out of israel
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:50.360]  it's kind of a a crazy ironic twist that that was racist to say the word israel oh sorry
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.160]  you can bleep it out on there i'm not joking i was at martin springs there were two hispanic
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.840]  guy and a white guy there and they're sitting there in the water and two of them get out one
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.920]  white guy hispanic guy i just say this people know you because you know it was they felt politically
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.600]  like they did something wrong as well so i just white people and the hispanic guy goes
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.200]  and they were obviously been smoking potting until they were stoned they go
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.880]  man let's go up in sizes let's get that great chinese food yelling like 20 yards to them and
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:21.720]  they go shh don't say chinese and they were looking around serious they think the people now think the
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:27.640]  word like the like if you say black it's racist or white it's racist i mean this is what do you
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:34.040]  call this kevin or mexican i've always been taught the word mexican is the bad word oh yeah
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.800]  that's the evil word right um that's the word you're not allowed to use everything's bad
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.080]  although mexico is a giant country just right over there practically see it from here um that's
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:49.400]  racist racist racist i don't know what you're talking about but the film's not just about that
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.360]  you get into a child with cancer right i mean it's incredible right well i mean you know i mean a
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:59.640]  big part of this we're trying to tie in the running theme of the film is children are the ultimate
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.560]  victims of all this and a huge part of the film is this incredible saga about a little boy named
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:12.040]  cash hides diagnosed when he was two years old with a uh peanut sized brain tumor and uh after
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:18.360]  having like just huge radiation and chemo and surgery and all the like horrible western things
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.640]  he's in a coma for 40 days hasn't eaten for 40 days the doctors are telling the parents to
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:30.840]  make funeral arrangements and that's when the the mother and father start sneaking in this this
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:35.720]  cannabis oil this highly uh controversial cannabis oil that's reportedly curing cancer all over the
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.000]  world and the mother who's a nurse she's a registered nurse so she knows what she's doing they start
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.080]  putting this stuff into the little boy's feeding tube and little boy pops out of the coma and the
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.760]  doctors and everybody at the hospital are like it's a miracle it's a miracle it was christmas
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.680]  they're calling it the christmas miracle and and in the story he's like well yeah it's a miracle
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.040]  it was a miracle cannabis so when and when the hospital staff finds out what they did uh that's
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:04.440]  kind of where our story starts and and it's even i got one of my favorite clips in there is when
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:10.520]  they they're on dr drew and dr drew is kind of like uh giving them a stern lecture for going against
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.440]  all hospital just i know you're trying to save your child's life but you should never go against
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:23.800]  hospital uh well you know the cps now takes kids if you ask for a second opinion wow that's crazy
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:30.440]  man it's crazy it just there's no end to it and uh you know it's uh you know we're we're in the
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.840]  middle of it right now you know i mean trie and i're you know we have another another foster
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.400]  daughter right now and it's uh it's a tough road because once these kids get in the system
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.120]  for them to like be able to adjust i mean another problem too that we don't even go
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.920]  into in the movie is that once these kids are in the system they become so dependent on everything
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:54.120]  i mean we had some foster girls with us a long time ago um they didn't even know how to make a

[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:18.840]  a month ago and almost had to turn it off uh because it's so sad and i'm telling you folks
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:23.800]  because it's real and i have empathy anybody who has any humanity has empathy this needs to be given
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:33.080]  to police and and cps workers this is a powerful truth weapon folks and and kevin i i'm very excited
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:40.440]  by the way uh just briefly coming up the next hour saudi king calls on arab to stand with egypt
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:44.600]  and to stand with the military because they say there's foreign attempts to destabilize and bring
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:49.880]  down the nation that's saudi arabia breaking with the west that's the truth by the way and i'm not
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.000]  defending the the disgusting saudi establishment but they're not one tenth as evil as the globalist
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.280]  even though they're part of it uh that shows really that saudi arabia understands the west did this
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:07.960]  to try to bring down the whole region into chaos even quote allies yeah they kicked hazing mubarak
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.040]  out three years ago so i'm going to be breaking that down this is a big deal this could lead to just
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:21.320]  mega mega massive geopolitical events kevin going back to american drug war two available

[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.640]  because i've read the reviews your last film was great aired on what was it show time and a bunch
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.120]  others but this one's got even better reviews from what i've seen i think is even a more hard
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:48.120]  hitting and even groups that normally you think would attack you big magazines conservative groups
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.320]  wall street journal have come out and said this really changed their mind i mean i think you've
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.960]  hit it out of the park on this one uh yeah i appreciate that i mean you know there's just not
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.560]  a lot you could say when you watch the story and i don't want to you know give a spoiler alert to
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.160]  the people out there that haven't seen it yet and because you know they think the first time
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.000]  that you see it is when it really hits you the hardest and having to edit such a such a sad
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.160]  powerful film was uh was an experience all of itself you know i mean after after working on this
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.480]  film i need like a break i need to go work on some silly stuff you know i need to do another ninja
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.840]  bachelor party or something um but yeah i mean there's just there's just not a lot you can say
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.320]  when when you when you watch how the things turn out for the children in this movie and and like the
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.840]  what happens to the children and uh there's really you know there's no way you can disprove
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.920]  what happens to this movie it's not some conspiracy it's not something that anybody can doubt there's
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.000]  just not a lot there's no room for doubt when you watch this film and it's kind of interesting too
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.680]  that sanjay gupta just came out with this special on cnn the other night called weed and it's great
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:53.800]  i mean part of it's really great and it's cool that they're they're bringing it to the forefront but
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:58:01.080]  it it almost in a way mirrors uh american drug war two like uh thematically and they they uh
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:07.160]  focusing on a child getting cannabis oil that's having seizures and and uh a lot of other things
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:12.840]  they don't get into cps or foster child children but they get into the the research and the things
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.880]  going on with the cbd's and the non-psychoactive effects of all these other marijuana strains

[02:00:53.320 --> 02:01:02.920]  whenever i talked about that little girl uh who got her alexandra or alexandria hill who got her
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.480]  head bashed in reportedly by her foster mother who was whose husband was a two-time convicted
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.880]  drug dealer because the neighbors smelled marijuana and they came and asked him do you smoke pot and
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:16.600]  they said yeah so liamshah county took their kids and the family lined up and said yeah
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.560]  shouldn't have kids if you smoke pot and i heard people in the youtube comments and saw the comments
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:27.800]  people made videos saying they she deserves it you serve you right dopers and i don't even smoke pot
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:31.400]  as you know kevin i mean i've been at your house many times and you're having a movie showing or
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.000]  a party when you used to live in austin and you know i'd drink one beer and wouldn't smoke pot
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.800]  when people were smoking it i mean i don't smoke pot very often and and because i don't really like
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:44.360]  it particularly but my whole issue is there's always other medical things involved in it
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:49.160]  and the demonization of pot smokers this is how slavery works well they're black so they
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.320]  deserve to be slaves so they're bad or they're pot smokers they deserve to be slaves this is
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:02:00.200]  just modern slavery that criminal groups want to feed on and then you learn the government's pushing
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:06.680]  deadly psychotropics on little kids they really are sick and anybody that gets arrested or ticketed
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:12.760]  or takes somebody's kids uh for smoking marijuana you're the criminals you're you're as bad as the
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:21.160]  nazis your dirt bags scum i wanted to say that i agree well closing comments kevin and the whole
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.400]  point about people don't even get that hemp is something totally separate that's outlawed too
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:31.640]  well there's a lot of different aspects i mean if hemp has basically you've been allowed you can
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:36.920]  grow hemp in every industrialized nation except for united states now i think that's just recently
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:42.680]  changed in kentucky but american companies are allowed to make hemp based products you know there's
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:49.160]  hemp like cereal and different grains and food and clothing and different fibers uh but they have
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.960]  to ship it in so they control it from china and something else i just heard from a top researcher
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.000]  just some new information i got just this morning and that they do some of these people i'm i'm in
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  touch with a lot of people that travel around the earth like looking for rare strains this is like a
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.640]  big part of like this new movement and research and top cancer research and all this they've
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:14.120]  discovered some little village in china recently where everybody living there is uh been eating
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.840]  this one type of hemp and there's that grows the size of trees and they use the hemp in their
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:24.040]  soups and they're at every yeah i read about that i read about that and the average death age is like
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:29.720]  110 like they supposedly there's somebody that's like 130 something years old there and and the
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.840]  average death age is like over a hundred years old and these people never touch western medicine
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:40.840]  nothing and uh so it's pretty incredible so yeah the government's done an amazing job at demonizing
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:48.440]  a plan and and calling it some like horrific addictive substance when really in reality uh just
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:54.280]  back uh like a hundred years ago it was derivatives of cannabis and hemp were in every single doctor's
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:00.040]  little black bag until david rockefeller came in basically created all the american medical
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:07.240]  societies always switched over the entire thinking of of western medicine from plant-based to chemical
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.000]  based you know let's stop there i'm going to hold you over five more minutes to give me the floor

[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.680]  singer they created the fake left movement to disenfranchise minorities and bragged how they
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.640]  do it i mean and you read the books they wrote it's it's not like you know kevin's saying the same
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.240]  thing i say because that's what he went and researched and found i mean it's just these

[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:50.920]  mean this is a powerful film info or store dot com a powerful tool to wake people up i'm gonna get
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:56.440]  into the big geopolitical news and have some breaking food news uh coming up but but but
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:01.800]  speaking about this when i've had say a hundred a hundred copies of my magazine i drop them off
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.680]  on a business family in east texas they give it to other family and then in the other family who
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:14.600]  loves me goes we're worried about alex he's pushing dope in his magazine and it was hemp oil that's
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:21.080]  a different version of the plant no thc hundreds of studies conservatively about how incredibly
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:26.040]  it is for lowering cholesterol the heart the brain i mean it's like coconut oil i mean it's just
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:32.200]  really got a lot of the same attributes uh i guess it's cannabinoids or what you know but but it's a
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.720]  subsection of us and then it doesn't have the thc or whatever and it's just the ignorance and here's
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:43.240]  another one info wars dot com is a link to the abc news piece mother threatened for feeding baby
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:48.920]  goats milk instead of gmo soy formula it's on record the soy uh makes women hyper feminine and
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.640]  boys feminine and leads to breast cancer on major studies it's on record their brains don't grow as
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:11:00.520]  much it's on record the formula on average is 75 sugar and uh and uh stuff like high fructose
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:06.600]  corn syrup we've done reports on it i mean they've had cases where the formulas killing kids worldwide
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.320]  guys google a formula it causes thousands of die in china you know where they even get more sugar
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:17.880]  and less protein and fat so they're persecuting people that give their babies things that they need
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.000]  but then they're persecuting this shows how predatory the system is so kevin you've got the
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.440]  floor you were getting into your research about the rockefellers and the medicine system recap all
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:34.840]  that and then give us a five minute uh overall cannabis news report okay well once again back
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:40.840]  just about a hundred years ago uh most of all of our medicine was plant based and in almost every
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:46.760]  back in back in the day doctors used to carry the little black bag uh and in every doctor's black bag
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:52.120]  was all types of different cannabis oils and hemp oil and it corrects you slightly there the the
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:58.760]  hemp plant is the non-psychoactive cousin to the cannabis plant now there's cannabis plants now that
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.640]  that they've bred to have just cbd's instead of thc thc is what gets you high look i know you're
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:09.720]  the expert all i'm saying for layman out there is the regular hemp will not do anything too yeah it's
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:14.120]  just for fiber yeah it's just for food and fiber and fuel basically you can't you you could smoke
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:18.600]  and it's a wonder product better than dupeont they lobby to get rid of it because it would be
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:23.480]  better than polyester but go ahead and yeah and they're able to lump it together is in one classification
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.040]  called marijuana and that's how they got rid of it and that ties back into the to william randolph
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:33.240]  hearst and the logging industry and all that i mean so it's it's like the hearsts and and the
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:38.120]  rockefellers that have like a huge history of promoting the drug war agenda and so when the
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.720]  rockefellers took over all the medical foundations around uh 1913 starting in that in that period
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:50.360]  uh they switched the whole thinking of western medicine from plant-based which before then there
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:55.080]  wasn't like this huge cancer rate into chemical based and it just so happened that they owned all
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:59.640]  the chemical plants they owned all the processing and it turns out that david rockefeller didn't
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.560]  even take his own medicine that david rockefeller lived to be over a hundred and he stuck with
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:08.040]  plant-based medicine uh which just goes to show that he wasn't even taking what he was
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.800]  had a full-time old-fashioned plant-based md that was biased all the time that's on record yeah yeah
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.120]  so it's very interesting and now another aspect of this that we haven't covered today that's in
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:24.200]  the movie is that in and for any doubters out there in 2003 and look this up our very own
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:31.400]  department of health and human services uh obtained the patent for cannabinoids to be used as in a
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:36.440]  neuro-protectant and an anti-inflammatory now that right there is like the end of the argument you
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:40.120]  see our own government which by the way the government is not supposed to be allowed to get
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.640]  patents like this so that in itself is a very crooked weird underdealing and while they're
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.040]  silently arresting everybody uh or I should say not silent while they're been arresting
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:56.200]  still 800 000 citizens a year uh for marijuana related charges they're out there making deals
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:01.880]  with foreign pharmaceutical companies namely GW Pharmaceuticals out of england to basically
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:06.680]  how to tear the marijuana plant down and turn it into a bunch of different pharmaceutical things
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:11.400]  that they can patent and because you can't patent the entire marijuana plant because it's made out
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:17.080]  of over 60 cannabinoids and so many compounds it's unpatentable and that's why you can't just get
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:23.000]  the just the marijuana plant as is through the FDA process with the way the FDA is set up it's a
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.120]  catch 22 where they go round and round so a lot of these companies the one company in our in our
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  film uh is uh cannabis science out of denver dr bob a really cool amazing guy who i've been friends
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:39.720]  with for a long time they're trying to get the natural derivative of marijuana through the FDA
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:46.440]  process and that in itself is uh been you know just like an incredible feat and and so basically
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:51.240]  it's a race against time but you got these more evil minded pharmaceutical companies
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:56.520]  that are basically their long their goal in all this is to tear the plant down and so instead
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:03.160]  of being able to grow one plant in your backyard that you can be used for anxiety for uh sleeplessness
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:10.040]  for pain relief for depression on and on and on uh they want you to have to buy 50 different pills
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:14.520]  that would be okay this is the one cannabinoid we found best for pain this is the cannabinoid
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.160]  that we find best for headaches this is the best cannabinoid for menstrual cramps this one's a
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:23.480]  spray this is a pill this is a syrup this is a salve they want to break it down like that they
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  don't want you to be able to grow the one single plant that's the end all and they've they've tried
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:33.000]  to like brainwash the public into thinking that only a crazy person would believe that you could
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.800]  have one answer to all these different problems they want you to believe that you have to have
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.200]  like a separate medication for every little teeny tiny ailment that you have but George Washington
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:48.280]  did smoke it uh you can look it up they called it stomachache hemp toothache hemp because he grew
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.320]  hemp he grew a bunch of other stuff but uh he grew what they called the toothache hemp and the stomach
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.160]  ache hemp and that was the kind that you know you got a toothache or whatever you got stomachache
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.480]  you get your pipe out you don't smoke tobacco which you also grew you know George Washington
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:05.880]  smoked marijuana he's he needs to be arrested right now well and and I guess they say the
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.360]  Declaration of Independence was actually drafted on a hemp paper I mean the like you know the our
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:16.840]  wars have been fought with hemp using hemp for the sale yeah I mean we went through they mean
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:20.120]  there's the whole the whole hemp for victory period where they actually there was actually
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:25.240]  a period in our history where you had to grow hemp uh you know they're you know so it's it's
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:30.280]  a very crazy history with the hemp plant and there's a little chapter in our film about that
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:37.080]  about a guy named Dr. Bronner um who uh you know was it's like they uh they import like thousands
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.680]  and thousands of pounds of hemp oil from they have to get it from Canada and China it's another
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.720]  reason for patriots to be upset right now because American farmers could be making a fortune growing
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:51.480]  hemp uh but they're not allowed to that's another secret it grows anywhere yeah Chinese people the
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:57.080]  Chinese people in China now are having a hemp renaissance uh people in China is going getting
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.920]  way ahead of America now on all this hemp R&D the whole thing because all the all that all of us
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:09.000]  Americans uh have our hands tied with these ridiculous laws while China and other countries
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.520]  are out there racing ahead of us on this deal and it's just another way for us to be left behind
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.760]  and and we're gonna have to buy all our products and get our research from other countries uh
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:21.880]  because of these laws well that's because the globalists are all invested in China we're not
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:27.960]  allowed to have anything nothing it's everything's being shut down and and i tell you cops pull me
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.960]  over sometimes usually at state police they go got any drugs in there i'm like no i don't have the
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:37.320]  drugs the government brings in and i don't have marijuana you know that it just makes me so sick
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:43.880]  i mean i'm just so sick of it yeah man it's uh it's it's a sad situation you know but it's also
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:49.160]  crazy i mean there is some good news on the horizon i mean it's interesting to go to Denver right now
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:53.720]  i just got back from Denver again since i was on your show again and i'm filming a thing out there
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:18:00.280]  and uh all i can say is that Denver is probably a lot like Chicago was when they ended prohibition
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:06.680]  i mean it is basically people in the streets just smoking and uh you know i mean everybody's you
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:11.560]  know i mean everybody's got a joint or pipe in their hands it's it's kind of crazy and funny to
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.920]  see what happens when prohibition ends i i hope they don't ruin it by kind of going overboard
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:20.520]  and becoming a bad example for the rest of the country but you know it just got completely
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:26.920]  legalized for recreational in Colorado and washington state so uh it's an interesting
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.480]  time to keep your eyes on that so you know where there is a lot of stuff there is also a lot of
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:36.680]  forward uh movement in ending the drug war so it's it's a battle i mean we're still
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:41.720]  i'll say this absolutely great job kevin people can get the film at m4store.com very important
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:45.960]  we got friends and family i'll say this though as a proviso and i've you've said this on air
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.600]  last time you were on and we've said it privately there's extremes in everything the drug war is
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:54.280]  one of the biggest evils ever to kill our constitution has to end when you have drug
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:59.080]  prohibition it makes more drug use happen makes it avon guard makes criminal groups make money
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:04.360]  off of it so it's it's evil up one side down the other but the total pothead movement where
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:11.080]  that where they get it so strong now and just i mean you can abuse marijuana you can abuse
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:16.760]  you can abuse aspirin you can abuse uh coconut oil i mean there are a lot of people abusing
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:20.360]  marijuana now i don't think we should they should have their kids taken away unless they're actually
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:25.160]  hurting their kids but i mean i mean you've admitted to me there's some really people getting
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:31.800]  screwed up on pot i mean pot is not god and it's not perfect right well i mean but this is kind
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:36.360]  of like what happens with prohibition right this this is the reaction that's why it's interesting
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.520]  to go to denver and see what's happening denver right now because this is this is what happens
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:44.600]  when prohibition gets lifted in one little area and that people jump to these extremes
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.800]  it's also very interesting to to note and this is in the film as well you know that you hear
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:54.040]  the same thing about like well the the marijuana today is no longer your your parents would stock
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:59.000]  pot it's way stronger but because of prohibition they've they've they've made the pot stronger

[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:21.960]  the facts about what i'm about to tell you to explain things i don't have time to get the whole
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:26.840]  geopolitical breakdown but but basically there's this you watch the movie laurence of arabia that's
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:32.280]  based on the true story of uh almost a hundred years ago a little under a hundred years ago how
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:37.240]  the british went in funded the better ones to basically take over much of what is saudi arabia
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:43.880]  today and syria and surrounding countries and they carved out the most radical sect of ohabia's
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:52.760]  like the super enforcers holy rollers of the muslims basically uh of the of the sunnis of the majority
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.080]  group the brits are always smart with their empire they want me to deal with with the biggest group
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.840]  80 percent of islam and the most radical sect of that which was like one percent but now is the
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:09.880]  majority basically in control of saudi arabia and projecting their empire worldwide and they've
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:17.000]  got to deal with the globalist okay and you go back three years ago with hazy mubarak who was a
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:23.400]  31 year dictator trained in the west but was a stabilizer just like saddam folks he said i'm not
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.680]  given libya to al qaeda and the radicals they're too dangerous you want to destabilize things
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:33.240]  they had him house arrest drugged up you never heard from him again and they carried out this
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.640]  program that's in the peanut documents and that wesley clark also talked about a plan to bring
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:43.560]  down eight countries to deindustrialize them and create absolute squalor put in radicals
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:50.200]  so the pentagons got somebody to bomb and could have no bid weapons contracts black hole
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:56.760]  pool not a u.s interest as has been pointed out by many many top analysts we've had on
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:03.240]  on the interest of defense contractors themselves owned and run by hedge fund hyenas that just
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:07.720]  look at bottom lines these people are going to cause world war three according to every top
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:13.720]  analyst out there left right center conservative libertarian but ran paul and ron paul have had
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.760]  the nerve to come out and say it and be attacked by all the neocons and all the authoritarian left
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:25.960]  people and you've got the authoritarian left the neocons circling the wagons together trying
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:33.320]  to put al qaeda in all the middle east raising unholy hell okay and saudi arabia we've heard
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.120]  rumblings of this from our nsa sources wane madson and others that have proven to be very
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:44.360]  accurate in the past our plea others that there's a shift and that's why bandar bush was his nickname
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.760]  prince bandard has disappeared the last few years because he was part of a coup counter coup not
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:54.520]  want to be our coup not wanting to be part of this reportedly and that saudi arabia
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.920]  and it's a horrible corrupt elite any corrupt elite become sick but i mean there's nothing
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:03.240]  compared to the new world order the point is that that that saudi arabia is not going to go along
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:08.520]  with all of this that they understand that this is a destabilization that will finally even bring
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:14.760]  them down which by the way is part of the plan finally saudi arabia will be the last to fall and
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:20.360]  then by the way the un plans to make israel fall next as the final deal for world government this
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  has all been charted out okay so saudi arabia then israel now that's down the road but look
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:31.880]  saudi king calls on arab's to stand with egypt he said the kingdom is saudi arabia and its people
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:36.920]  and government stood and stand today with the brothers in egypt against terrorism and against

[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:32.200]  we've got a story up on info wars dot com
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:37.320]  where wiki leaks julian assange says that the only hope for america
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:46.760]  is a libertarian movement led by rand paul uh and matt drudge and i think that that's really true
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:52.440]  all he's been doing is pointing out that putting the radical muslim brotherhood
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:57.880]  and morris cn and increasing their funding was to destabilize and because he's up there he knows
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:08.920]  what's going on and now that's happened and now even saudi arabia has come out and said do you
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:14.760]  know arab's must not side with the muslim brotherhood and must not side with the al-qaeda groups
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.680]  which have been their little proxy army because now saudi arabia is getting what's happening here
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:29.080]  and of course they've always known it's it's all a balancing act with these different empires but
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.400]  bottom line the globalists want to bring down every country they want squalor they want collapse
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:41.720]  that allows them to buy things up and i'm telling you uh for three years we've been breaking down
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:47.560]  what's going to happen in the middle east and it's now happening and this is a big big big deal
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:53.800]  out of roiders saudi king calls on arab's to stand with egypt saudi king abdulla called on
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:58.520]  arab's to stand together against attempts to destabilize egypt and a strong message of support
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:05.000]  yeah the full quote is outside destabilization in a strong message of support for the country's
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:10.520]  military leadership read out on saudi television on friday the kingdom of saudi arabia its people
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:15.400]  and government stood and stands today with the brothers in egypt against terrorism he said i call
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:20.520]  him the honest man of egypt and the arab's of all muslim nations to stand as one man with one
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:24.760]  heart in the face of attempts to destabilize the country that is the forefront of arab and muslim
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:29.960]  history he added saudi arabia was close ally with former president hazing mubarak historically had
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.600]  a different relationship with the muslim brotherhood it pledged five billion to aid egypt after
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:39.080]  mohammed morris see the brotherhood was ousted from the presidency last month and again that just
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:47.880]  further proves their siding against obama and let me tell you there's big splits in the pentagon
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:56.920]  big splits uh in even the cfr i mean you see them out there saying this is crazy i mean we do crazy
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:02.840]  stuff but i mean we're gonna put basically al qaeda in charge and the egyptian military i never
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:08.200]  support military mowing down people but when our news says pro i saw this last time on cnn i was
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.840]  walking to the coffee room about night night they were like yes protesters fire bombed and
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:17.960]  shot the military that isn't protesters fire bombing and shooting they call them protesters
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.280]  in libya and syria when they're burning down churches and now the egyptian military promises
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:26.840]  to rebuild christian churches they have been protecting christians they're being ethically
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:32.120]  cleansed and they're attacking the military bases and you know who's giving them weapons and training
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:41.560]  i mean folks they want to take every stable pro america country and bring them down over there
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:48.200]  why is that or country that's third party and neutral because they want total chaos their
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.520]  globalists they are playing all our countries off against each other it's called full spectrum
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:59.160]  dominance where where the globalists fund the al qaeda and the taliban who then funds subgroups
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:04.360]  that don't even know they're funded by the central banks who then fight us soldiers so the us soldiers
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:10.360]  have an excuse to be there so the opium can be grown so the no bid contracts can be given by the
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:18.680]  trillions this is the plan remember the guy 15 years ago in new york got caught hundreds of
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.560]  windshields for years got knocked out every night with a ball peen hammer and and the police detective
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:29.640]  finally noticed he looked us up billboards everywhere for inexpensive windshield repair
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:32.920]  that just happened to be the perfect type for what was happened with the ball peen
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:39.000]  the spot windshield crack repair and they staked out and they caught the guy knocking windows out
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:44.280]  the owner at night would go out in just an hour and bust windshields that's for the new order
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:50.120]  busting windshields la la la la la la la totally amoral playing all sides scientifically
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.800]  might as well be bore-glanding from the planet snoopy or something doing this
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:59.880]  and i mean the hypothetical folks for the new york times says i believe there's a planet
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:05.640]  snoopy in the borderland all right now shifting gears to give you an example of how the establishment
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:11.320]  it has has turned food into something entirely uh different i want to show you just so you know
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:16.680]  the history of this uh what's in fast food what's in the non-chicken half of the mcnugget
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:21.880]  having composed here's a london guardian 10 gross ingredients you didn't know were in your food
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:30.280]  chicken mcnuggets from mcdonald's have a breakdown of silicone or a flat-out silicone
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:38.120]  silly putty and breast implant filler in it i mean ladies and gentlemen you cannot make this up well
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:44.120]  mike adams of of the health ranger report of course at naturalnews.com right here in central
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:50.520]  texas with us he always is hiring outside labs do tests well they've now set up their own labs and
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.320]  they've gotten their own people and uh he's got a factory outside town puts out his great products
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:01.080]  everything and uh we've got a video up on info wars dot com that shows what's in it and folks this
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:08.680]  makes the pink slime look nutritious uh and uh he joins us now uh to give us the first big interview
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:14.040]  breaking this down uh mike adams you describe this in your text to me this morning as more
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.720]  gallons like materials what is going on sir hi alexa thanks for having me on yeah we just launched
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:25.400]  the naturalnews forensic food laboratory and this is our first research project you may have noticed
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:30.040]  i haven't been covering politics as much lately because i've been in the lab and we are taking a
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:36.040]  really close look at foods we started with chicken mcnuggets and we so we have a really high end it's
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:41.080]  it's like a hundred thousand dollar microscope that we have access to now as part of this lab it's a
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:46.440]  it's a 3d modeling digital microscope and we're able to look very closely at chicken mcnuggets
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:55.400]  and if you do that you find some shocking things we found mysterious fibers that resemble more
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:03.720]  gallons or resemble some kind of hairs or resemble even algae or one thing looks like an egg shaped
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:10.600]  structure with a tail i don't know exactly what these are that someone else who's maybe an expert
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:16.760]  in in this realm would would be maybe proteins forming ring structures because they reconstituted
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:23.640]  them i'm telling you but the thing is alex i did not find anything that to me looked like chicken
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:30.920]  so it's a chicken mcnugget and you would expect to find things that look like chicken meat fibers
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:37.960]  or strands of meat tissue i personally after hours and hours of looking at multiple chicken mcnuggets
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:44.440]  i did not find anything that looked like chicken i found weird alien shapes i found like transparent
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:51.480]  it looks like silicone to me i found gel like structures i found you know these weird fibers
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:57.880]  and things that look like a hair of some kind it freaked me out i i literally almost puked on
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:04.760]  the microscope it was that bizarre and alex we're just getting started i also bought a big mac
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.600]  i'm going to look at the beef patty under the microscope i'm going to go i'm not going to
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.280]  give out the names of where i'm going but i'm going to other fast food chains and we're going to
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:18.120]  put these foods under the microscope and report forensically scientifically exactly what we're
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:24.600]  finding there and by the way i'm showing folks the london guardian uh here from several years
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:30.200]  ago pointing out that it has silicone uh in it from silly potty and breast implants by the way
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.800]  just a little bit of that leaking into women everyone knows caused lupus and autoimmune
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.600]  disorders and even deaths and in some of the confirmed cases but it's okay for you to eat it
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.320]  and just as a layman uh mike i've done research i know you've gone to all the medical experts
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:48.360]  but it doesn't silicone actually clog up the kidneys and attack the intestines and everything
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.080]  else i mean like i don't i don't mean to be an extremist but we probably shouldn't be eating
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:59.720]  silicone especially fried silicone or is that extreme to say well it's it's a it's a compound
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:05.400]  form of of silicone it's not it's not the you know the same thing exactly that's used in breast
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:11.960]  uh implants it's a it's a variation of it but i agree with you these elements the these compounds
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:17.160]  are not food okay they don't belong in the human body and across the board i'm not talking about
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:21.320]  just chicken McNuggets but across the board when you have all of these additives and foods
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:27.000]  that are not foods themselves you begin to see patterns of kidney function problems you begin
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.480]  to see digestive problems you begin to see crone's disease which is inflammation of the digestive
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:38.920]  tract all kinds of disorders come out of this and i i gotta tell you i this is my new focus alex is
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:44.760]  to run this forensic food laboratory throughout the year i'm going to be bringing you if as time
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:49.640]  allows if you're interested in absolutely really amazing reports of what we're finding not just
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:55.480]  with microscopy but also some other tests i'm not going to give out what we're doing yet but it is
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:00.040]  stuff that's going to shock the world i think today the fda needs to take a look at this you
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:05.400]  know the fda jumps on raw milk because of what's supposed to be what's in oh they they they take
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.120]  people's children and try to take their children if they feed them goats milk i think i think the
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:15.400]  entire family should be executed exactly and then and then they say well this is okay to have these
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:20.600]  weird fibers and hairs in uh chicken mcnuggets because it's all dead food so therefore it's not
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:26.200]  harmful look i'm not saying these structures are harmful but we need to investigate and people have
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.640]  brought to my attention today the topic that you have covered a lot more gallons this mysterious
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:37.000]  disease that the cdc says doesn't even exist and yet people keep finding all this evidence of weird
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.360]  fibers well they do have medical doctors that say it is real yeah yes yes but the establishment says
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:48.840]  they're they're not acknowledging it yet well we found things in these chicken mcnuggets that resemble
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:55.160]  more gallons i'm not saying it is more gallons i we can't say that yet but it resembles them and
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:44:00.280]  that alone is pretty frightening to me well let me expand on this because according to the medical
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:08.600]  reports they even cnn's done uh this dimethopoly siloxane how do you say the silo zane silo zane
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.480]  so how do you pronounce it correctly the stuff that's in in silica that they fry in in not just
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:18.200]  mcdonald's let's not single them out i was reading that this is used in hundreds of not just fast
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:25.080]  foods but products that have a quote uh any type of breading for the for the fluffing in the frying
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:31.720]  process it's an anti foaming agent is what it's used for and you find throughout the food supply
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:36.280]  some of the research that we're doing for example you'll find polypropylene glycol very commonly
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:42.520]  used in like fake blueberries used in blueberry muffins and breads and polypropylene glycol is
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:48.200]  an antifreeze that's used to winterize our v's and it's listed right on that even mainstream news
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:51.800]  well what's wrong with that i mean shouldn't we give our dogs and cats little bowls of it
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:57.640]  well i think the big picture of all this alex why are the globalists able to pull off what
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:04.120]  they're doing right now in egypt and with america trying to destroy the the real constitutional
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:09.880]  roots of our nation it's because they can dumb people down through the food supply they can poison
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:13.960]  you with the food it's not just the chemicals it's also the heavy metals we know that lead
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:18.200]  and cadmium and so on in large quantities i'm not talking about just trace amounts like parts per
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:23.720]  billion i'm talking about big amounts yeah i was reading a watching post that 40 plus percent of all
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:31.480]  sugared processed foods have high levels of lead in them uh why is that is where is all this coming
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:37.480]  from the a lot of it well there's two main sources one the chemtrails are actually distributing
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:43.480]  metals mostly aluminum as you know that then falls on the the agricultural land it's incorporated
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:48.200]  into the soil and then taken up into the plant but the other thing is that all across the country
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:54.760]  they're using human biosolids in other words actual human waste products as a fertilizer
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:00.280]  and putting that on the crop lands the human waste products i mean it's basically sewage sludge
[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:06.200]  that's turned into you know soil that has bio accumulated all the big pharma drugs everything
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:10.840]  yes the metals are accumulated there a lot you can get a lot of metals from eating let's say
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:16.680]  shrimp from china for example loaded with well some some of it is loaded with mercury and then even
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:22.360]  if you don't eat a lot of bad stuff it doesn't matter the plants you're eating uh are having
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.920]  the uh that most the big uh sewage places are producing they're having the human
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:32.200]  excrement put on it so you're getting a nice allotment of the estrogen mimickers the prosax
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:37.480]  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors yep this is just wonderful and the antibiotics and also trace
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:44.760]  amounts of mind-altering psychiatric drugs which are based on fluoride how loving the puzzle starts
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:52.280]  to come together they're using food as a vector of a mind control weapon of sorts and it's very
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:58.200]  effective at keeping people dumbed down to the point where they will buy any other agenda out there
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:04.520]  absolutely look at this article out of live science it's also out of uh haratz it's also from
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:09.640]  the israeli government on what george washington blog links right through to it uh israel supreme
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:16.280]  court has outlawed water fluoridation saying it is uh reduces IQ and gives you cancer uh sounds like
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:22.280]  they're they're they're pretty extremist there uh they've said quote uh israel supreme court has
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:26.360]  ruled that water fluoridation the country must end next year according to news reports the landmark
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:31.880]  decision doesn't even further legislation by the health minister uh yield german good good for them
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.480]  wish we had him as a health minister earlier in the year that would have ended mandatory
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:40.920]  fluoridation nationwide reports the irish uh publication hot press then and then in the
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:46.120]  washington's blog it links through to the israeli government uh doing that so wow i wonder what's
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:51.080]  happening also uh uh they're ending the practice in portland oregon they're ending it in most of
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:57.000]  new zealand many cities like calgary uh in canada uh tampa ended it but then they reverse the law
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.640]  boy i tell you there are a lot of crazy people that read the harvard study that it brain damages us
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.600]  well the the big news on fluoride which is going to come out in more detail and in fact your team
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:11.240]  did an excellent video report on this i think last year in austin an undercover hidden camera
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:17.800]  report remember that the big story on fluoride is that the fluoride powder that is bought to
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:24.520]  dump into the water supply is absolutely loaded with heavy metals and oh yeah that's from china
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:30.280]  mainly uh they admitted it's hundreds of things yeah yes chemical compounds industrial waste heavy
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:37.960]  metals uh if if the truth gets out on what's in fluoride it's going to be the largest public
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:44.520]  health scandal in human history it is a extremely toxic substance toxic not all into neurology but
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:50.920]  also to the kidneys and alex if you damage your kidneys you can't process vitamin d meaning you
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.840]  you can be in the sun and you can take vitamin d supplements but you can't turn it into blood
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:48:59.640]  soluble blood circular extreme you know how dare you because i mean we've got news reports
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:04.840]  so they admit it to 350 chemicals in the chinese fluoride this the majority of fluoride here it's
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:12.840]  all their toxic waste lead mercury arsenic uh cobalt uranium plutonium uh strontium what is
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:19.960]  wrong with that china is using the united states water municipalities as its toxic waste disposal
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:26.200]  system well but that's good it's good to have your child die i mean yeah i i guess but it's
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:29.720]  certainly effective at keeping people dumb down well thank god homeland security's keeping
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.360]  us safe from al-qaeda right now right but they'll let china ship in toxic metals to be put right
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.400]  into the mouths of babies it's it's it's absolutely incredible the crimes against humanity that are
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:44.280]  taking place through food and water and medicine right now are just absolutely astonishing but
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.400]  we are going to be working on this now with a whole new level of laboratory equipment and and
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.480]  training that i've gone through to be a certified lab technician on a lot of different pieces of
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:58.440]  equipment we're gonna we're gonna blow the lid on this stuff alex and that's that's my new focus so
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.360]  i appreciate you sure i know you've been hiring a lot of firms do that in the past but now you're
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:08.280]  doing it very exciting mike adams natural blues dot com but you know none of it matters msnbc says
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:12.840]  that this is a hate filled show connected to the boston bombing and that way and that i'm deeply
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:17.080]  racist mike i could not believe that i actually started writing an article in your defense to
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:22.520]  say publicly i've been around you in person i've never seen you act in any kind of racist way in
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:27.720]  fact you've always gone out of your way to protect african-american babies against the the uh the
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:33.000]  abortions that's racist holocaust you've gone out of your way to talk about vitamin d uh needed
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.720]  among people with dark skin because of of of how they can't generate it from sunlight as much
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:43.400]  you've gone out of your way actually to help free all americans for them to call you racist or anything
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:49.480]  it it just discredits them well then they didn't show where i was racist either it's like it's so
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:56.040]  over the top i don't know whether to sue them or sue them i would sue them yeah yeah well we'll say

[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:31.240]  a villain who works with the water treatment plant adding let's be conservative 10 different radio
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:38.520]  active isotopes in high levels known to give you pancreatic cancer colon cancer intestinal cancer
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:44.040]  to hurt eyesight to destroy your kidneys it would be oh my gosh the investigators would
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:49.720]  find them they'd get the death penalty but they ship in from florida where they do the
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:57.560]  some of the mining for uranium colorado but mainly china whatever's left from it but then they
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:04.040]  have the all the other toxic waste plants the aluminum purification smelting the fertilizer
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.320]  production where they're not allowed under the law because there's old regulations to put toxic
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:13.960]  waste on on on the crops it unless it's from human waste that's how they get around that
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:18.840]  so they take all that put it in a bag and have cities pay for it and put it in the water so
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:26.440]  we're not even debating fluoride here and in one newscast they did a study and found over 300
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:30.280]  this is years ago i'm glad mike's gonna do it and get all the numbers and show what he finds
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:36.440]  we've shown this newscast before it was local newscast they got like wisconsin 350 plus deadly
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:41.400]  chemicals and i mean high levels and when this all came out because i was talking about it
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:47.880]  rick perry signed an order you can look this up in texas blocking the release that every
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:53.800]  municipal water supply in the state of texas that florida it just so happened it's about 75%
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:59.240]  of them at the time few about this about four years ago had high levels of radiation so the
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:02.840]  local news heard me talk about this austin's done it outside cities have done it we ought to find
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:07.400]  those newscasts play them again i've played them many times they went over with geiger counters
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:14.680]  and it's like you know 10 12 15 times what it should be high radiation and then the state all
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:20.120]  like to dumb it said we don't know why gee we don't have and rick perry then signed an order
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:26.920]  because he loves you he's so conservative to block all of that so i'm gonna explain this to you again
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:33.240]  lobbyist on record would have to store all this toxic waste but they get paid to come pay off your
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:39.560]  city austin pays over a million dollars a year to put what they call fluoride in the water
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:46.120]  and it's totally secret what brand they buy they won't release it they're about to get sued
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:51.000]  that's some inside baseball over all this that's finally going to happen but just where i live
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.920]  so you need to filter your water and this is a plug at the end of the show go get a
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:59.720]  pro pure water filter with pro one that has the special filtration system to massively
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:04.440]  reduce fluoride fluoride is so hard to get out it's so small one of the smallest little molecules
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:09.640]  out there you can look it up or elements i guess but the point is it massively reduces it all with
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.280]  the pro one all in one filter they have some other filter systems as well the cop to glyphosates
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:19.160]  all that kind of stuff the the roundup ready that's just absolutely devastating people on record
