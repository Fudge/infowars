[00:00.000 --> 00:11.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.500 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:32.880]  Texas Alex Jones here we are it's December 6th 2011 we're gonna be here
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.040]  live for the next three hours at least and we do have Wayne Madsen
[00:39.040 --> 00:42.600]  investigative journalist joining us on the drone that went down and I ran and a
[00:42.600 --> 00:49.640]  host of other issues the latest on Syria Pakistan Wayne always has amazing
[00:49.640 --> 00:56.040]  inside Intel being there in the Beltway and globetrotting across the world he
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.440]  will be joining us coming up in about an hour and a half from now but a lot of
[01:01.440 --> 01:04.560]  times I get up here on the air and I say I'm gonna take a lot of calls today and
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.720]  I end up not doing that but the last few months I've actually done a bit of a
[01:07.720 --> 01:15.800]  better job and so today I am going to go over just some of the headlines we've
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.040]  got here and some of the really big news and then we are going to open the
[01:21.040 --> 01:27.040]  phones up in the first half of the broadcast and after Madsen leaves us in
[01:27.040 --> 01:33.480]  the third hour as well and we're going to take a lot of your phone calls and a
[01:33.480 --> 01:36.560]  lot of times I end up giving callers about 45 seconds we can move on to the
[01:36.560 --> 01:40.160]  next person to get everybody on but I think today and in other days I give
[01:40.160 --> 01:43.280]  people like five minutes and that's when we never get to anybody basically but
[01:43.280 --> 01:45.800]  today I think we're gonna give people about one minute and then I'll try to
[01:45.800 --> 01:52.400]  limit myself to a 30-second response to your question or your comment in fact
[01:52.400 --> 01:55.480]  why not just go ahead and open the phones up right now on any issue you
[01:55.480 --> 02:00.480]  want to discuss any question any comment any news item because the callers just
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.000]  always bring up things that either I didn't know about or that I meant to
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.360]  talk about a day ago a week ago a month ago or different local news a lot of
[02:08.360 --> 02:13.760]  times stuff people call in about I then go look up discover it's true we write
[02:13.760 --> 02:17.720]  articles about it info wars.com and prison planet.com and it becomes a big
[02:17.720 --> 02:22.160]  story it was the middle of 2010 we started getting reports about TSA going
[02:22.160 --> 02:29.160]  in the pants and then some of my crew witnessed it happening and we reported
[02:29.160 --> 02:33.240]  on it and the TSA would say it's not happening it's not happening it's not
[02:33.240 --> 02:36.520]  happening but then our listeners videotaped it happened to some of my
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.120]  crew and it became national news and the drudge report picked it up and
[02:42.120 --> 02:50.000]  remember they they always stonewall it's a it's a military tactic to make the
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.760]  debate about whether they're doing it or not instead of whether should you be
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.440]  doing it and for many years now they've taken people in back rooms especially
[02:58.440 --> 03:04.200]  the old because it sometimes if they're traveling alone it takes multiple TSA
[03:04.200 --> 03:07.680]  agents to get them out of the wheelchair and and do everything to them and go
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.960]  turn off their oxygen bottles ask them of their bombs take the diapers off take
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.880]  the colostomy bags or the urine bags off of them ripping surgical sutures open
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.840]  and it's all on record and they always say we didn't do that and then when the
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.800]  video gets released they say well taking your clothes off is not a strip
[03:27.800 --> 03:33.840]  search we it's a week we call it a procedure and now there's a report up at
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.840]  info wars.com of the American dream blogger has collated nine recent
[03:38.840 --> 03:44.600]  examples of admitted strip searching of elderly it's like a tack wolves whenever
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.320]  you see some old person in a wheelchair who looks like they're about to die I
[03:48.320 --> 03:53.280]  mean I've seen a lot told the story probably ten times I was out in San
[03:53.280 --> 04:00.640]  Francisco flying back years ago this is like five six years ago and there was a
[04:00.640 --> 04:05.280]  group of veterans of Pearl Harbor they were all some of them were wearing
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.880]  Arizona hats you know USS Arizona the battleship they had oxygen bottles they
[04:11.880 --> 04:15.200]  could barely walk they had their wives or attendants with them who looked like
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.000]  they were pretty much almost you know not of this world anymore and I'll never
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.220]  forget they had checkpoints at the gate as well something called Wolverine
[04:25.220 --> 04:30.880]  security guys in like Cobra Commander uniforms these bright blue uniforms and
[04:30.880 --> 04:38.800]  in berets on screaming at them it was this old Pearl Harbor veteran with a
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.840]  walker with his eyes peeled down you know dripping probably the last trip you

[08:19.720 --> 08:44.600]  alex jones
[08:49.720 --> 08:53.720]  Oh, my God.
[08:53.720 --> 08:56.720]  I'm sorry.
[08:56.720 --> 08:57.720]  No, I'm not gone crazy.
[08:57.720 --> 08:59.720]  That already happened a long time ago.
[08:59.720 --> 09:01.720]  Sorry.
[09:01.720 --> 09:04.720]  I went back to the coffee room,
[09:04.720 --> 09:07.720]  a little half cup of coffee.
[09:07.720 --> 09:11.720]  And when I came walking back into the control room in there,
[09:11.720 --> 09:14.720]  wow.
[09:14.720 --> 09:18.720]  They were playing a clip of the Corbair report,
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.720]  on Comedy Central, I guess it was last night.
[09:22.720 --> 09:26.720]  Tim Fruget, back office manager came running up here
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.720]  from the warehouse and said, hey,
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.720]  you were on the Corbair report last night.
[09:32.720 --> 09:34.720]  Here's the YouTube video of it,
[09:34.720 --> 09:37.720]  and we're going to laugh so hard as we're crying.
[09:37.720 --> 09:39.720]  We're going to play it coming up.
[09:39.720 --> 09:41.720]  It's hilarious.
[09:41.720 --> 09:44.720]  Of course, it's making fun of 2012 conspiracy theories
[09:44.720 --> 09:46.720]  about Into the World.
[09:46.720 --> 09:49.720]  And I'm not laughing at the parts that I'm in.
[09:49.720 --> 09:52.720]  Of course, it's funny how they take stuff out of context,
[09:52.720 --> 09:54.720]  and it's a sigh-op overall,
[09:54.720 --> 09:56.720]  to imply that anybody that doesn't trust the government
[09:56.720 --> 09:57.720]  thinks the world's going to end,
[09:57.720 --> 09:59.720]  but at the very start of it,
[09:59.720 --> 10:01.720]  it's got all these ridiculous images
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.720]  into the world things,
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.720]  and then it cuts to this old lady wearing a cowboy hat
[10:06.720 --> 10:09.720]  at the public information office
[10:09.720 --> 10:11.720]  at the Denver International Airport,
[10:11.720 --> 10:15.720]  and she goes, hi, welcome to the Denver International Airport.
[10:15.720 --> 10:18.720]  She turns into like a reptoid vampire demon.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.720]  It's just, it's funny.
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.720]  You got to see it to know why it's so funny.
[10:22.720 --> 10:25.720]  Oh, boy, oh, man.
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.720]  And then I was literally watching this as we went live,
[10:28.720 --> 10:30.720]  and I ran in here laughing,
[10:30.720 --> 10:32.720]  and I couldn't stop laughing,
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.720]  so I guess they made the decision to just go live with me.
[10:36.720 --> 10:38.720]  Wow, that gave me a headache.
[10:38.720 --> 10:40.720]  I laughed so hard.
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.720]  Okay, I got to stop right there.
[10:42.720 --> 10:44.720]  I've been making myself jog twice a day.
[10:44.720 --> 10:48.720]  I mean, there's got to be some way to get this blubber off of me,
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.720]  and I've been working out pretty hard now for about three years,
[10:52.720 --> 10:54.720]  and haven't lost much weight,
[10:54.720 --> 10:56.720]  so I've been running twice a day.
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.720]  I've actually lost like 10 pounds the last two weeks,
[10:58.720 --> 11:01.720]  and I've been running in this cold weather, though,
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.720]  and it just makes me cough constantly to be running outside,
[11:05.720 --> 11:08.720]  so that's why I'm also coughing a lot here.
[11:08.720 --> 11:11.720]  Okay, let me just settle down here for a minute.
[11:11.720 --> 11:14.720]  This is ultra-ridiculous,
[11:14.720 --> 11:18.720]  and we'll get it posted up at infowars.com.
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.720]  I'll get Nimmo or Watson or Aaron to write a blurblet about it,
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.720]  and get it up on infowars.com.
[11:24.720 --> 11:26.720]  People want to watch the whole thing.
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.720]  We'll play some clips of it and analyze the propaganda
[11:29.720 --> 11:31.720]  if I can control myself from laughing.
[11:31.720 --> 11:33.720]  It won't be as funny on radio,
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.720]  but plus we have to review it.
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.720]  There's some kind of racy stuff for primetime TV on there,
[11:39.720 --> 11:41.720]  and we are on a lot of AM and FM stations,
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.720]  and a lot of children also listen to the show
[11:43.720 --> 11:46.720]  as part of their homeschooling at least an hour or so a day,
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.720]  so I've got to review it and maybe pull a few clips out of it,
[11:51.720 --> 11:55.720]  because they do engage in a bit of mild profanity on there,
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.720]  so I've got to watch it.
[12:00.720 --> 12:03.720]  Wow, that totally threw me off.
[12:03.720 --> 12:06.720]  A serious piece of news during the break,
[12:06.720 --> 12:08.720]  a lot of times I'm late getting back on air
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.720]  because I'm out there researching stuff.
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.720]  Never is really off-putting,
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.720]  but being all set and ready to go live as the show starts
[12:18.720 --> 12:23.720]  and seeing that just has completely put me into a tailspin.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.720]  It's so ridiculous.
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.720]  Oh, man.
[12:28.720 --> 12:30.720]  Oh, boy, I've got to stop right there.
[12:30.720 --> 12:36.720]  Those shows, the Colbert Report and, of course,
[12:36.720 --> 12:39.720]  the John Stuart Show are both so hilarious,
[12:39.720 --> 12:43.720]  but John Stuart's brother heads up the New York Stock Exchange,
[12:43.720 --> 12:45.720]  and, of course, that's not his real name,
[12:45.720 --> 12:47.720]  and they are big globalists,
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.720]  and they are anti-gun, anti-patriot, anti-family.
[12:51.720 --> 12:54.720]  So in the final equation, they're pretty bad news.
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.720]  When Bush was in there,
[12:56.720 --> 12:58.720]  they would talk about Constitution huggers
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.720]  and show Homeland Security beating people
[13:00.720 --> 13:03.720]  that didn't want to go along with the New World Order.
[13:03.720 --> 13:05.720]  They would do little funny skits and things.
[13:05.720 --> 13:08.720]  They don't really do that so much now.
[13:08.720 --> 13:11.720]  They just mainly are the partisan hacks that they are.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.720]  Now, they started losing viewers for my research,
[13:13.720 --> 13:16.720]  because I do follow those shows occasionally.
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.720]  Some of the few things on broadcast TV or cable TV I do watch,
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.720]  at least once a week when I catch it online later.
[13:24.720 --> 13:27.720]  I have seen a change kind of criticizing Obama now
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.720]  because the Obama faithful have certainly woken up,
[13:33.720 --> 13:39.720]  and that's good news because we don't have time to be idiots.
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.720]  We don't have time to be bamboozled and conned.
[13:42.720 --> 13:44.720]  Now, when I criticized George W. Bush,
[13:44.720 --> 13:47.720]  I was a left-wing extremist, according to the media.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.720]  When I didn't like Obama, I was a hardcore right-wing racist.
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.720]  Okay, I'm going to explain something for new listeners.
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.720]  Barack Obama and his advisors and the people that finance him
[13:58.720 --> 14:01.720]  are total anti-America, anti-free market,
[14:01.720 --> 14:04.720]  authoritarian, technocratic eugenicist.
[14:04.720 --> 14:06.720]  That's all you need to know.
[14:06.720 --> 14:09.720]  If you're a noodle listener and don't know what a eugenicist is,
[14:09.720 --> 14:12.720]  or eugenics is, or don't know what a technocrat is,
[14:12.720 --> 14:15.720]  or authoritarian finance capital oligarchs,
[14:15.720 --> 14:18.720]  or neo-futilistic crony capitalism,
[14:18.720 --> 14:21.720]  those terms have volumes behind them.
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.720]  I'm not just throwing terms out to sound...
[14:25.720 --> 14:27.720]  to sound uppity or smart.
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.720]  I coined the term neo-futilistic fascism.
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.720]  Okay, I coined propaganda placement and behavior placement,
[14:36.720 --> 14:38.720]  now in popular use.
[14:38.720 --> 14:40.720]  I've coined hundreds of terms,
[14:40.720 --> 14:43.720]  and I don't have time to toot my horn because I don't care.
[14:43.720 --> 14:45.720]  I want to hang out alone in a farmhouse.
[14:45.720 --> 14:47.720]  I don't want to be out here on air.
[14:47.720 --> 14:50.720]  I want to hike around mountains and fish and fire firearms
[14:50.720 --> 14:56.720]  and cook English short ribs in a red wine sauce.
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.720]  I don't want to be here, but I have to be here
[15:00.720 --> 15:03.720]  to fight the psychopaths, the control freaks,
[15:03.720 --> 15:06.720]  the egomaniacs, the sadists, and the rest of them
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.720]  because they're not going to go away if we don't fight them.
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.720]  The corrupt will take control of government
[15:12.720 --> 15:14.720]  and will turn it around as an engine of control.
[15:14.720 --> 15:17.720]  They will swing the military's guns around the people
[15:17.720 --> 15:19.720]  in every case, and it's now happening.
[15:19.720 --> 15:21.720]  It's now happening.
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.720]  I'll tell you something else, though.
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.720]  I'm not here risking my life because I think resistance is futile.
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.720]  I know resistance is victory.
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.720]  So when I get up here and I tell you that I know what I'm talking about,
[15:35.720 --> 15:40.720]  it's not because I want you to go, ooh, Alex Jones is real smart.
[15:40.720 --> 15:43.720]  I try to have other voices on with their perspectives,
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.720]  with their ideas, because that ups the level of thinking and debate.
[15:47.720 --> 15:52.720]  But in the final equation, if you had the full spectrum together,
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.720]  there's really no other broadcaster show
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.720]  that is bringing it all together like this one.
[15:57.720 --> 15:59.720]  And I don't like that.
[15:59.720 --> 16:01.720]  That's a dangerous position to be in.
[16:01.720 --> 16:04.720]  I see a lot of people starting to get large pieces of it.
[16:04.720 --> 16:06.720]  That's good.
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.720]  I am probably going to start a search, and I don't know how to do it,
[16:10.720 --> 16:15.720]  and it's very daunting to try to find two or three reporters or people
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.720]  who can do what I do, cover what I do,
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.720]  and break it down the way I do so that I don't even have to be as prominent
[16:23.720 --> 16:24.720]  in all of this.
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.720]  Paul Watson gets it, doesn't want to be on air.
[16:28.720 --> 16:32.720]  Of course, someone who gets it is reclusive.
[16:32.720 --> 16:38.720]  Aaron gets it and is smart, doesn't want to be on air.
[16:38.720 --> 16:40.720]  It's the same story over and over again.
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.720]  The type of people you find who are going to want to be on air generally
[16:44.720 --> 16:48.720]  may get parts of it, but just long term,
[16:48.720 --> 16:53.720]  will either sell out or get in infighting or destroy themselves.
[16:53.720 --> 16:58.720]  It's just human nature that worldly, flesh-filled egomaniacs
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.720]  cannot grasp the New World Order.
[17:01.720 --> 17:03.720]  They are slaves to it.
[17:03.720 --> 17:05.720]  And again, I'm not up here.
[17:05.720 --> 17:10.720]  People take my aggression and my confidence as arrogance or ego.
[17:10.720 --> 17:12.720]  It is the opposite.
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.720]  I am someone who gets angry that I have to be here
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.720]  researching all this, being aware of it.
[17:19.720 --> 17:23.720]  It is a frustrating, disgusting joke for me
[17:23.720 --> 17:27.720]  to understand this information to a very detailed level,
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.720]  growing daily in its fractal, interconnected,
[17:32.720 --> 17:35.720]  multivariate, multifaceted way.
[17:35.720 --> 17:38.720]  And then to see the public caught in the web of deception,
[17:38.720 --> 17:41.720]  like little flies to the spider,
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.720]  being destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[17:44.720 --> 17:46.720]  It is just ultimately frustrating.
[17:46.720 --> 17:51.720]  And it's why I tend to spin out of control and just explode.
[17:51.720 --> 17:53.720]  Because it's frustrating.
[17:53.720 --> 17:57.720]  It's frustrating watching neighbors that go ahead
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.720]  and buy non-existent magazine subscriptions from con artists
[18:01.720 --> 18:04.720]  that are casing out their house when I lived in the city.
[18:04.720 --> 18:09.720]  And you try to warn a neighbor and they think you're being uppity with them.
[18:09.720 --> 18:11.720]  I mean, it's things like that.
[18:11.720 --> 18:17.720]  It's watching a domesticated, soft, spoiled population
[18:17.720 --> 18:20.720]  that are lambs to the slaughter.
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.720]  And in my own life, being decadent and slovenly,
[18:24.720 --> 18:27.720]  but being aware of it, I'm aware of it.
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.720]  Trying to pull myself out of it is the difference.
[18:31.720 --> 18:33.720]  When you don't care about propaganda
[18:33.720 --> 18:38.720]  and you say it doesn't even exist, you are wide open.
[18:38.720 --> 18:42.720]  As Thomas Jefferson said, even if you defend the jewel of liberty,
[18:42.720 --> 18:47.720]  even if you throw your whole weight behind it and work 24 hours a day,
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.720]  around the clock, you probably can't keep liberty.
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.720]  But if you don't care about liberty,
[18:55.720 --> 18:57.720]  or you think it's something that doesn't have to be defended,
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.720]  you are going to fall to despotism, to abuse.
[19:02.720 --> 19:06.720]  And then it always gets so bad that then people start to struggle for liberty.
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.720]  And then there's that process.
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.720]  And tyrants throughout history generally just go ahead and wipe everybody out.
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.720]  I was reading about wars in the 1800s and 1900s in Paraguay.
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.720]  What was it, five successive wars in Central South America
[19:21.720 --> 19:30.720]  where 90-plus percent of the population was killed by Paraguay's neighbors?
[19:30.720 --> 19:37.720]  I mean, I just, studying warfare, studying geopolitical systems,
[19:37.720 --> 19:40.720]  and then looking at where we are on the map,
[19:40.720 --> 19:43.720]  where we are in the time frame continuum.
[19:43.720 --> 19:49.720]  Man, you talk about sweaty nightmares, you talk about cold chills.
[19:49.720 --> 19:54.720]  If you knew, if the average dumbbell out there who wants to be dumb,
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.720]  if you knew what I knew, if you could see what I could see,
[19:59.720 --> 20:00.720]  where we're going.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[20:31.720 --> 20:35.720]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[20:35.720 --> 20:41.720]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[20:41.720 --> 20:45.720]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[20:45.720 --> 20:50.720]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.720]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[20:55.720 --> 20:59.720]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[20:59.720 --> 21:02.720]  Have you ever wanted to give a gift that expresses faith and liberty?
[21:02.720 --> 21:05.720]  Those powerful beliefs that shaped our nation at its founding?
[21:05.720 --> 21:09.720]  If so, pay close attention, because this may be the most important holiday message you'll hear this year.
[21:09.720 --> 21:11.720]  Beautiful Liberty Blankets are now available.
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.720]  The Liberty Blanket is made right here in the USA out of all natural cotton.

[21:19.720 --> 21:23.720]  of the enduring values that won the battle for freedom in early America.
[21:23.720 --> 21:25.720]  The center of the Liberty Blanket has the words,
[21:25.720 --> 21:28.720]  Appeal to God, a phrase that Washington and the founders used often
[21:28.720 --> 21:32.720]  as they announced to the world that their rights and liberties came from a sovereign creator.
[21:32.720 --> 21:37.720]  And in each corner of the Liberty Blanket details one of the pillars of American freedom.
[21:37.720 --> 21:40.720]  Education, church, civil government, and justice.
[21:40.720 --> 21:46.720]  Regularly $59.95, now just $39.95, it's the perfect Christmas gift that helps your friends and family

[22:34.720 --> 22:40.720]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.720]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.720]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[22:50.720 --> 23:00.720]  The war is here, it's an info war, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[23:20.720 --> 23:24.720]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.720]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter,
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.720]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[23:31.720 --> 23:33.720]  Use it any time you're away from home.

[24:20.720 --> 24:26.720]  Sooner or later, gonna cut you down.
[24:26.720 --> 24:32.720]  No amount of spying, no amount of tattletale squads, no amount of federalization,
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.720]  no amount of tough guy black uniforms are going to allow these foreign banks to continue their tyranny.
[24:38.720 --> 24:42.720]  Ten years ago, almost no one knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[24:42.720 --> 24:48.720]  Now I've seen polls the last two years as high as 80 plus percent or more want to abolish it, oughta to get rid of it.
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.720]  Look at the number one website, news website in the world, DrudgeReport.com right now.
[24:52.720 --> 24:57.720]  Iowa Blitz, Ron Paul goes for the Newt Throat.
[24:57.720 --> 25:00.720]  Goes for Newt's Throat.
[25:00.720 --> 25:10.720]  And you click on it and it's the 60-second TV version of the two-minute version that we aired here last week of Newt Genrich's serial hypocrisy.
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.720]  And we're gonna play it with the audio here in just a moment.
[25:13.720 --> 25:20.720]  Newt Genrich, after being endorsed by the former Federal Reserve head and known congenital liar,
[25:20.720 --> 25:26.720]  liar, oh, he gave her money for 13-plus years because he felt sorry for her, he paid her rent.
[25:26.720 --> 25:32.720]  He was her sugar daddy and any of you mainline Republicans who were dumb enough to believe his lies are foolish.
[25:32.720 --> 25:37.720]  Just like people who thought Obama was gonna give them free houses and free cars, the Federal Reserve is your enemy.
[25:37.720 --> 25:46.720]  But look how far we've come, where the DrudgeReport, by the way, has been continually pointing out the attacks and the censorship of Ron Paul.
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.720]  And Matt Drudge and the other folks over there at DrudgeReport deserve our thanks.
[25:51.720 --> 25:58.720]  Because believe me, behind the scenes from the Republican Party power structure, I'll guarantee you there's been pressure brought on them.
[25:58.720 --> 26:01.720]  I don't know that, I haven't been told that.
[26:01.720 --> 26:11.720]  But you got Drudge, you've got Curl over there, you've got the people that run that site, and it's having a big effect.
[26:11.720 --> 26:14.720]  It can set the agenda, even the New York Times admits that.
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.720]  And there they are, guaranteeing now that YouTube video alone will probably get four or five million views.
[26:19.720 --> 26:21.720]  And it's airing in Iowa.
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.720]  It's airing in Iowa right now, showing his incredible hypocrisy.
[26:25.720 --> 26:35.720]  I just told Kurt Nemo to not only post the 60 second, but to repost under it the two minute version that's even more powerful at infowars.com the next 10 minutes.
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.720]  And it's gonna have that same headline.
[26:37.720 --> 26:39.720]  Ron Paul goes for Newt Gennrich's Throat.
[26:39.720 --> 26:42.720]  We're gonna post it with both version at infowars.com.
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.720]  Get that page and send it out to everybody you know.
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.720]  Let's go ahead and go to this one minute ad that will destroy Newt Gennrich if it's seen.
[26:52.720 --> 26:53.720]  Here it is.
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.720]  If you want to put people in jail, let's look at the politicians who created the environment.
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.720]  The politicians who profited from the environment.
[26:59.720 --> 27:01.720]  The politicians who profited from the environment.
[27:01.720 --> 27:04.720]  Newt Gennrich on the defense for taking one and a half million bucks.
[27:04.720 --> 27:09.720]  After he left Congress, Freddie Mac paid Gingrich at least $1.6 million.
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.720]  $1.6 million, some of it just before the housing market collapsed.
[27:13.720 --> 27:20.720]  A think tank founded by Newt Gennrich collected at least $37 million from major healthcare companies.
[27:20.720 --> 27:22.720]  The group supports individual mandates.
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.720]  Newt Gennrich renewed his support for an individual mandate.
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.720]  A key tenant of President Obama's healthcare law.
[27:27.720 --> 27:29.720]  Support for an individual mandate?
[27:29.720 --> 27:31.720]  Folks, don't ask me to explain this.
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.720]  Everything that Gennrich railed against when he was in the house.
[27:35.720 --> 27:39.720]  He went the other way when he got paid to go the other way.
[27:39.720 --> 27:43.720]  He's demonstrating himself to be the very essence of the Washington Insiders.
[27:43.720 --> 27:45.720]  It's about serial hypocrisy.
[27:49.720 --> 27:50.720]  That is powerful.
[27:50.720 --> 27:52.720]  I'm Ron Paul.
[27:52.720 --> 27:54.720]  Yeah, I'm Ron Paul and I approve this message.
[27:54.720 --> 27:55.720]  There you go.
[27:55.720 --> 27:57.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we accidentally cut the end off there.
[27:57.720 --> 27:59.720]  Get these videos.
[27:59.720 --> 28:01.720]  It's up at Drudge the 62nd.
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.720]  Again, we posted the last week when it came out and played on the Nightly News, the two-minute one.
[28:05.720 --> 28:13.720]  I'm going to have the one minute with the two-minute under it posted with that same headline that Drudge has got at infowars.com in the next 10 minutes.
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.720]  Please go get it.
[28:15.720 --> 28:16.720]  Get it out to everybody.
[28:16.720 --> 28:19.720]  Don't just sit there and say, oh, he can't win, they'll cheat.
[28:19.720 --> 28:22.720]  Or, oh, they only gave him 89 seconds in this debate.
[28:22.720 --> 28:23.720]  Are they banning from that debate?
[28:23.720 --> 28:25.720]  It's because they're scared.
[28:25.720 --> 28:34.720]  And even if Ron Paul doesn't win, and by the way, even CBS and ABC News have enforced a report, he now is in second place, undoubtedly nationwide.
[28:34.720 --> 28:36.720]  We destroy Newt Yenrich.
[28:36.720 --> 28:38.720]  Ron Paul is number one.
[28:38.720 --> 28:39.720]  And they may attack him.
[28:39.720 --> 28:44.720]  They'll say, you know, he's been kidnapping Easter bunnies like they said about his son, Rand Paul.
[28:44.720 --> 28:51.720]  The system's so out of bullets that when they lied about Rand Paul, he went from a six-point lead to a 16 to 17-point lead.
[28:51.720 --> 29:06.720]  He gained at least 10 to 12 points, depending on which pole, and won by a landslide in Kentucky because they said he was kidnapping women, using drugs, worshipping water Buddhas, fornicating with possums.
[29:06.720 --> 29:10.720]  You know, I mean, they will say anything.
[29:10.720 --> 29:23.720]  They got caught, the Democratic Party operatives, people that worked for the guy he was running against, got caught dressing up in hay seed outfits with overalls, literally with hay seeds, going, I don't like black people.
[29:23.720 --> 29:24.720]  Remember that?
[29:24.720 --> 29:28.720]  And people tracked them back in, what was it, two or three different cases and found that.
[29:28.720 --> 29:40.720]  People that actually worked for the Democrats were out there wearing, you know, overalls and red checkered shirts going, I like Ron Paul. I don't like Mexicans and black people.
[29:40.720 --> 29:45.720]  I mean, they won't try anything because they're scared. Good attack, Ron Paul.
[29:45.720 --> 29:59.720]  It's the ignoring game that we're starting to defeat.
[29:59.720 --> 30:23.720]  Have you ever wanted to give a gift that expresses faith and liberty, those powerful beliefs that shaped our nation at its founding? If so, pay close attention because this may be the most important holiday message you'll hear this year. Beautiful Liberty Blankets are now available.
[30:23.720 --> 30:32.720]  The center of the Liberty Blanket has the words, appeal to God, a phrase that Washington and the founders used often as they announced to the world that their rights and liberties came from a sovereign creator.
[30:32.720 --> 30:40.720]  And in each corner of the Liberty Blanket details one of the pillars of American freedom, education, church, civil government, and justice.

[31:59.720 --> 32:08.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[32:13.720 --> 32:19.720]  We have turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[32:19.720 --> 32:24.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:24.720 --> 32:34.720]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[32:34.720 --> 32:40.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[32:40.720 --> 32:47.720]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[32:47.720 --> 32:58.720]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[33:18.720 --> 33:30.720]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.720 --> 33:36.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live. It is open phones.
[33:36.720 --> 33:42.720]  I'd like to get your take on all the issues, all the items that I have raised here today.
[33:42.720 --> 33:48.720]  Any of the news you want to point out, where you see our society going, where you see our world going.
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.720]  I love taking your calls because you bring up news items that I have forgotten about or that I didn't know about.
[33:53.720 --> 33:57.720]  Regional news, local news, your questions are great, your comments are great.
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.720]  If you disagree with me on something, we don't screen your calls. We just ask your first name where you're calling from.
[34:03.720 --> 34:10.720]  You can say Bob from Timbuktu, even if your name is David and you're calling from Austin, Texas. I don't care.
[34:10.720 --> 34:15.720]  You can call yourself mud if you want. You can call yourself Kebler. It doesn't matter.
[34:15.720 --> 34:25.720]  The point is, we'd love to hear from you. Here's the toll-free number. 800-259-9231-1800-259-9231.
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.720]  Now, obviously, I've been exposing Newt Gennrich for many years.
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.720]  He is a singularly wicked devil.
[34:35.720 --> 34:43.720]  He's read his quotes about the end of the family, global government, cyber-tronic, technocratic, world computer, running everything.
[34:43.720 --> 34:51.720]  Kind of a zeitgeistian system. The authoritarians, the communists, the fascists always sell their tyranny as high tech.
[34:51.720 --> 34:58.720]  That's an old model, even Bloomberg Business Week and even the economists were reporting that just last week.
[34:58.720 --> 35:05.720]  All of this is being sold as new, but it's really very old.
[35:05.720 --> 35:15.720]  His anti-gun stances, his flip-flopping on that, his open border promotion, his government-run healthcare promotion, his carbon tax promotion.
[35:15.720 --> 35:21.720]  Do I need to continue? Do I need to continue here with Newt Gennrich?
[35:21.720 --> 35:34.720]  The point is, Newt Gennrich is now number one. Ron Paul in multiple states, New Hampshire, Iowa and other states, in multiple polls is number two.
[35:34.720 --> 35:44.720]  Is number two. Regardless of what your position is on Mormons, mainline evangelicals will not vote for a Mormon.
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.720]  They will probably hold their nose and just not vote.
[35:48.720 --> 35:52.720]  I'm not making judgments about that. That's just what the political numbers break down to.
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.720]  Mitt Romney is not going to get the presidency. He's a ringer, even if he doesn't know it.
[35:57.720 --> 36:03.720]  And he was for carbon taxes, Obamacare. He wrote that. Gun control. I mean, do I need to go on?
[36:03.720 --> 36:10.720]  With Mitt Romney. Newt Gennrich, quite frankly, is worse. I'm not into lessers of two evils. I don't believe in that.
[36:10.720 --> 36:18.720]  But in the case of a Mitt Romney versus a Newt Gennrich, Newt Gennrich is part of key think tanks. And I've read the names.
[36:18.720 --> 36:31.720]  The quotes here who have, who are public about their new age, illusifarianism, high, higher consciousness thing, which is a counterfeit of what some people are talking about.
[36:31.720 --> 36:38.720]  And is super creepy and talks about overthrowing political systems and ruling and he's destined.
[36:38.720 --> 36:42.720]  Let me tell you something. Newt Gennrich is seething with evil.
[36:42.720 --> 36:51.720]  Not just politically, his fruits. I can look at him and my discernment says, red alert, red alert, red alert.
[36:51.720 --> 36:57.720]  I mean, I get chills looking at Newt Gennrich. He is bonafide wicked.
[36:57.720 --> 37:07.720]  And all of these mainline conservatives who can't, even if you don't have discernment or gut instinct, a nose, as police detectives would call it, even if you don't have a nose.
[37:07.720 --> 37:14.720]  What is your problem? His fruits. What comes out the other end of his factory is evil.
[37:14.720 --> 37:21.720]  Oh, he'll call himself the most conservative candidate. You can label a cyanide pill as aspirin.
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.720]  It doesn't, or vitamin A. It doesn't mean it's vitamin A or aspirin. It'll kill your daughter in the hammer.
[37:26.720 --> 37:35.720]  So you need to stop looking at labels. Obama said he was going to go after Wall Street corruption and was going to end all these wars and torture and stuff.
[37:35.720 --> 37:43.720]  His advisors were the people that set all of this in motion, the very kingpins that are running things.
[37:43.720 --> 37:49.720]  Of course we knew Obama was going to be bad. Said he wouldn't hire one lobbyist, hired nothing but high powered lobbyists.
[37:49.720 --> 37:53.720]  Said he wouldn't sell out and have, you know, give money to campaign contributors.
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.720]  Look at all the energy deals and half a billion here, half a billion there, all the corruption.
[37:57.720 --> 38:01.720]  He's Chicago mafia. Look at who he's surrounded with.
[38:01.720 --> 38:09.720]  But Americans and people across the world in general are trained to buy into hype.
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.720]  You know, a lot of times you see big, giant ads and rollouts for a movie and then you go see it and it's terrible.
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.720]  In fact, most of the time when the movie is really hyped, it's terrible.
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.720]  It's those little jewel films that nobody talks about that don't get any attention that are incredible.
[38:24.720 --> 38:32.720]  And it's the same thing. Ron Paul has been buried. He's been ignored. He is our elder statesman.
[38:32.720 --> 38:37.720]  He doesn't have all the pizzazz of these narcissistic control freaks.
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.720]  He doesn't want to be president. It's a duty for him.
[38:42.720 --> 38:45.720]  He's a dedicated person who grinds himself into the ground.
[38:45.720 --> 38:48.720]  And I'm not going to sit here and election here for Ron Paul.
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.720]  It's just that God always gives you a way out. God always gives you a choice.
[38:52.720 --> 38:57.720]  It's up to your free will. And it doesn't mean if Ron Paul got elected that he would be able to fix everything.
[38:57.720 --> 39:00.720]  He's been honest about that because a president doesn't run everything.
[39:00.720 --> 39:07.720]  He can try to talk to people. The globalists are going to implode things even faster, regardless of whether he gets in or not.
[39:07.720 --> 39:10.720]  But they're going to blame everything on Ron Paul if he got elected, but it doesn't matter.
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.720]  He knows he's walking into a trap.
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.720]  Don't you think Colonel Travis, taking command at the Alamo knew he was walking into a trap?
[39:20.720 --> 39:28.720]  And he said, for my posterity, his son that he dropped off with my family.
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.720]  But they're in Gonzales. That's what it takes.
[39:33.720 --> 39:40.720]  Because Hollywood advertises Texas is about a land grab and all this other garbage.
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.720]  Texans had come here. Texans had been forced to convert to a religion they didn't follow.
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.720]  Texans were then told, turn your guns in and it was on.
[39:50.720 --> 39:57.720]  Just like it was on in 1775 when they came to take the guns and then 1776.
[39:57.720 --> 40:03.720]  And it's going to be on again.
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.720]  Why do you think it got leaked that the government was shipping guns into Mexico?
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.720]  Because we have our people in every federal agency.
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.720]  They're called Americans. They're called patriots. They're called good people.
[40:14.720 --> 40:22.720]  And our people, people that know the truth and who are honorable and who are disgusted by corruption and evil are everywhere.
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.720]  That's why the globalists want totally centralized government and total non-whistleblower protection.
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.720]  So that the power structure can burn good people and cover things up.
[40:33.720 --> 40:38.720]  That's why they want total centralization. That's why they don't want any jurisdictions.
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.720]  They want one giant global system controlling the federal government that controls our local systems.
[40:43.720 --> 40:45.720]  So they can be above the law.
[40:45.720 --> 40:50.720]  And they're trying now in the internet age because they can't hide this stuff to just throw it in our face.
[40:50.720 --> 40:53.720]  Okay, the government does launder drug money, but only to track it.
[40:53.720 --> 40:56.720]  Okay, we do ship guns to Mexico, but we didn't mean to.
[40:56.720 --> 41:03.720]  Okay, we do grow the opium in Afghanistan, but let's just not discuss it any further.
[41:03.720 --> 41:09.720]  Okay, Diane Corbyn and Halliburton do kidnap children and women worldwide and take them to slave camps and sell them.
[41:09.720 --> 41:11.720]  But let's just not discuss that now.
[41:11.720 --> 41:18.720]  Okay, we are putting radioactive isotopes in your drinking water, but let's just move on.
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.720]  That's the point of what's going on here.
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.720]  I am about to commit a federal crime right here on air.
[41:27.720 --> 41:29.720]  You're watching us on prisonplanet.tv.
[41:29.720 --> 41:36.720]  I'm about to drink whole milk from a dairy in San Antonio.
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.720]  Oh, that's real milk.
[41:42.720 --> 41:44.720]  It's like at the store now.
[41:44.720 --> 41:47.720]  It's weird like the beef costs twice as much if it says grass fed.
[41:47.720 --> 41:57.720]  It's like abnormal to feed cows grass, which is what the only thing we're supposed to eat, by the way.
[41:57.720 --> 42:02.720]  There are resting people who produce raw milk and those that buy it.
[42:02.720 --> 42:11.720]  They have year and a half long million-dollar stings on Amish.
[42:11.720 --> 42:12.720]  You know what?
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.720]  Governments that say this is a crime, they're the criminals.
[42:17.720 --> 42:21.720]  Governments that say that people are slaves of the state, they're criminals.
[42:21.720 --> 42:24.720]  You're illegitimate.
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.720]  And you see, it has to get absurd before people wake up.
[42:28.720 --> 42:30.720]  The system wants to be absurd.
[42:30.720 --> 42:37.720]  They want to grope your children and strip-search 85-year-old women in wheelchairs.
[42:37.720 --> 42:44.720]  Because if they can get away with that, they can get away with anything.
[42:44.720 --> 42:46.720]  And that's what they're doing.
[42:46.720 --> 42:57.720]  They're training the general public who's not criminal, the 95% of the population, that you are criminal, that you've done something wrong, that you're going to be inspected, that you're going to be searched.
[42:57.720 --> 43:00.720]  The government, it's all secretive.
[43:00.720 --> 43:10.720]  It's not supposed to be looked into, but you, you are bad.
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.720]  And you notice this pattern.
[43:12.720 --> 43:13.720]  It's a handbook.
[43:13.720 --> 43:15.720]  When they get caught groping, people, they say we're not groping.
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.720]  When they get caught strip-searching old ladies, they say we're not doing it.
[43:18.720 --> 43:21.720]  And then later they're asked, well, what are you doing?
[43:21.720 --> 43:24.720]  Well, when we take your clothes off, we don't call the strip search.
[43:24.720 --> 43:42.720]  See, it's all lawyer games because they found in psychological warfare, if they just deny they're doing it, even when you have video of it, it then becomes a debate about whether or not they're doing it instead of should they be doing it.
[43:42.720 --> 43:48.720]  And why do they claim the authority to do it?
[43:48.720 --> 43:54.720]  You see, the controllers of this planet, they study human psychology.
[43:54.720 --> 44:03.720]  And instead of trying to get people to think and understand psychology, so you're aware of it, the public's not really dumb.
[44:03.720 --> 44:06.720]  They are ignorant.
[44:06.720 --> 44:08.720]  They are intellectually lazy.
[44:08.720 --> 44:19.720]  They have been trained that they're not active participants in the world, that they're just spectators who sit back and are told what to do.
[44:19.720 --> 44:33.720]  In fact, I have a video clip I'm going to play later after I play the Colbert report that made fun of myself, Jesse Ventura and others.
[44:33.720 --> 44:57.720]  Bruce Fine, who we had on yesterday, a constitutional lawyer, Ron Paul's head policy advisor, on a play clip of a part of a speech he gave, we are at the verge of despotism where he describes this, where Nixon would order different prosecutors and people to get off the case.
[44:57.720 --> 45:06.720]  And they would say, no, we have a job, this is not the third right. And then he would order their bosses to fire them and they refused. They would order their bosses and they refused.
[45:06.720 --> 45:15.720]  But today there's this idea of, well, if you are the president or you are my boss, and you tell me to do something, I'll do it.
[45:15.720 --> 45:17.720]  And they've had university studies.
[45:17.720 --> 45:37.720]  They had the Stanford one, they've had several others where they found that over 90% of graduate students going for their PhD in psychology believe that in a prison environment, they were ordered by successive approximation to abuse verbally than physically and then to put people in chairs and
[45:37.720 --> 45:53.720]  electrocute them and they hired actors and even ran some electricity into them in some cases to make it real. And 90, what was it, 93% actually took the order to murder, to murder.
[45:53.720 --> 46:02.720]  Like I should do a nightly news piece on this. I'm going to do one later in the week and then we'll air it here on the radio where I actually, they even shot film of it, of some of the tests.
[46:02.720 --> 46:12.720]  And it's been duplicated over and over again that when an authority figure, in fact, in one of the cases it took the head of the psychology department to come in and say, yes, this is sanctioned, follow your order.
[46:12.720 --> 46:25.720]  And they said, all right, and flip the switch to kill people. But it's that five to 10%, depending on which culture and who will not go under mind control, who will not do immoral things.
[46:25.720 --> 46:43.720]  We are the guardians of every society. And it is not a right. It is a duty. It is a duty to say no to things that are immoral. That's why they slowly get us to fantasize about doing evil.
[46:43.720 --> 47:00.720]  They show us Jack Bauer torturing people in the comic book, Good Guys Torture. And it's sexy. It's cool. It gets things done. It's wimpy not to do it. Not to torture. They are trying to get you ready for all of this, the law enforcement publications, all of it.
[47:00.720 --> 47:12.720]  Evil controllers are trying to binge you and twist you so they can get you to come over to the dark side and not even know it.
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.720]  Still, other systems go out and actually find people that are on the dark side.
[47:17.720 --> 47:25.720]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls. Then I'll get into North Korea, making missile label to hit the US. Astronomers discover biggest black hole ever. I want to get into some cool science news.
[47:25.720 --> 47:32.720]  NASA finds the first habitable zone planet.
[47:32.720 --> 47:43.720]  Pepper spray tasers and LRADS. What's behind the explosion of less lethal weapons for crowd control? Now nine elderly people have come forward being strip searched.
[47:43.720 --> 47:52.720]  And the response of TSA is just to say, okay, yeah, we take your clothes off. We weren't lying though when we said that's not a strip search.
[47:52.720 --> 48:02.720]  Just like they keep groping newborn babies. Comes out every week, them taking diapers off children, colostomy bags off people, stripping people down.
[48:02.720 --> 48:09.720]  They settle cases, two of them the last few months where they made women pull their breasts out and then the men hit on them.
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.720]  So delusional that they're like, hey, can I have your number? You've got beautiful, beautiful body parts.
[48:16.720 --> 48:26.720]  I mean, stripping down naked, running through LAX, screaming, I'm God. There have been two cases of the I'm God thing, one in Chicago, one in LA.
[48:26.720 --> 48:35.720]  What type do you think wants to sit there all day around microwave ovens, grabbing people's genitals?
[48:35.720 --> 48:44.720]  I mean, you could not pay me $10 million a year to do that.
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.720]  There's only one person I touch sexually and that's my wife.
[48:48.720 --> 48:55.720]  It's not like I'm some wild animal just running around wanting to have sex. Sex is a big deal. It's about children.
[48:55.720 --> 49:06.720]  It's about creating a hybrid's entire genetic history, cross splice clone. This is heavy duty stuff.
[49:06.720 --> 49:17.720]  This is not, this is not, it's a sacred thing. And that's why airline pilots, veterans, you name it, would many cases have to go home and would throw up.
[49:17.720 --> 49:23.720]  And the media is like, oh, get tough, let the airline pilots have their genitals grabbed.
[49:23.720 --> 49:32.720]  What whims? No, this was about their whole life being violated, their whole life not having any freedom, their whole life being over, America being dead.
[49:32.720 --> 49:40.720]  They're now prisoners. They now are people that have to go through a prison induction every day of having people grab their genitals.
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.720]  When they control a giant aircraft, it's a huge weapon.
[49:44.720 --> 49:52.720]  Let's see, there's the idea. Oh, we have to have computer controls so the pilot can't be trusted they're talking about now that override the pilot.
[49:52.720 --> 49:59.720]  But then who programs the machines? How do you trust the machines? See, it's this idea that we're all guilty except for government.
[49:59.720 --> 50:05.720]  Big corrupt bankers, they can steal, they can bring drugs in, they can launder drug money there, but they're good.
[50:05.720 --> 50:10.720]  They're untouchable. But all of us, airline pilots, you name it, we're trash.
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.720]  In fact, they were having the air marshals go through it, which was ridiculous.
[50:15.720 --> 50:21.720]  Oh, yes, let me check your gun and everything. Cuckoo. It's cuckoo.
[50:21.720 --> 50:27.720]  And then the ignorant public's like, why do air marshals have guns? Won't they shoot holes in the aircraft? No morons.
[50:27.720 --> 50:34.720]  They have a type of safety slug that won't penetrate the plane, but will kill a person.
[50:34.720 --> 50:39.720]  It's basically a hollow, completely hollow plastic bullet.
[50:39.720 --> 50:47.720]  But why don't we just arm the pilots? Oh, we can't trust them with a firearm, but we can trust them with the aircraft. Idiots.
[50:47.720 --> 50:54.720]  But see, why did those men have to go home? Why did they throw up? Because it's such a violation.
[50:54.720 --> 50:59.720]  It's such a degradation of your rights. Your calls are straight ahead. Stay with us.

[54:33.720 --> 54:40.720]  It is pretty funny, but we'll analyze how they use humor to discredit things so it'll be very informative.
[54:40.720 --> 54:50.720]  And then I also have a clip I'm going to play of, well, an expert breaking down exactly what's happening with this police state takeover situation.
[54:50.720 --> 55:00.720]  Bruce Fine, we are at the verge of despotism. I'm going to go to your calls here. Ray, Mike, Jay, Joe, Ed here in just about 20 seconds.
[55:00.720 --> 55:10.720]  I just want to remind you, we're running a special Until Christmas. All of my films on DVD, 18 DVDs in the individual packages.

[55:44.720 --> 55:47.720]  And again, your support also makes what we do here possible.
[55:47.720 --> 55:54.720]  And where can you say anybody's having a bigger effect fighting tyranny than this radio show, except for Ron Paul, and that's all symbiotic.
[55:54.720 --> 55:58.720]  Ray in California, thanks for holding your on the air.
[55:58.720 --> 56:05.720]  I wanted to mention a couple of points. The first point is about Fukushima Daiichi.
[56:05.720 --> 56:13.720]  I think he might have made some errors concerning that. Have you considered Arnie Gunnerson from Fairwinds?
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.720]  I don't know who that is. It's like...
[56:16.720 --> 56:18.720]  Arnie Gunnerson, go ahead.
[56:18.720 --> 56:20.720]  No, you're on the air.
[56:20.720 --> 56:32.720]  Arnie Gunnerson from Fairwinds is a nuclear engineer, and Fairwinds is his website on the Internet.
[56:32.720 --> 56:40.720]  And he used to be working for as a vice president for a major utility, and he became a whistleblower.
[56:40.720 --> 56:48.720]  Okay, I understand that his website's on the Internet and everything. Tell me what he's saying. Tell me my errors. Tell me what I've done.
[56:48.720 --> 56:59.720]  Okay, first of all, he has a video on YouTube that does a comparison contrast between the Unit 1 explosion and the Unit 3 explosion.
[56:59.720 --> 57:11.720]  And he says Unit 1 explosion was a deflagration, and Unit 3 explosion was a detonation, and he goes on to say that it was only the Unit 3 fuel pool that went up, not the Unit 3 reactor.
[57:11.720 --> 57:20.720]  Well, I've had a whole bunch of... People a lot of times call in and say they disagree with me, and then I don't know what they disagree with.
[57:20.720 --> 57:28.720]  It's like, Alex, you're saying the sky isn't blue, and I disagree with that. And I never said the sky wasn't blue during the day, or that it doesn't have stars in it at night.
[57:28.720 --> 57:35.720]  I've had a whole bunch of nuclear physicists and people on. I said that Fukushima was much worse than what they were saying.
[57:35.720 --> 57:44.720]  And I said that the Mox 3, Number 3 reactor that exploded did put a bunch of fuel rods into the air before anybody else did, because I blew the video up.
[57:44.720 --> 57:57.720]  Turned out that was true. There's been forms of fission going on. The isotopic readings show that. I've had nuclear physicists, nuclear physicists on, and so I don't understand what you're saying I'm wrong about.
[57:57.720 --> 58:01.720]  The point is, is Arnie Gunnerson a whistleblower?
[58:01.720 --> 58:12.720]  Yeah, I got he's got a website, and the website's on the internet. I understand that. What I'm asking you, Ray, is what are you getting at? What am I wrong about? What did I say that wasn't true?
[58:12.720 --> 58:19.720]  States being an expert, he states the UN3 reactor vessel remained intact while the UN3 fuel pool went up.
[58:19.720 --> 58:28.720]  Well, they admit that that Reactor 3 containment vessel's breached. So, I mean, what are you saying Fukushima's not that bad?
[58:28.720 --> 58:34.720]  No, no, no, I'm not saying that. What I'm stating is that he is an expert.
[58:34.720 --> 59:00.720]  I understand he's an expert. Look, I appreciate your call. We'll be right back.

[59:53.720 --> 01:00:00.720]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:17.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.720]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:28.720]  All right, we're going to analyze how the system uses humor to discredit the Liberty Movement.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.720]  Those that question corruption, the Corbett Report attacked myself and Jesse Ventura last night.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.720]  We'll be looking at the Denver International Airport.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.720]  Coming up a little bit in the third hour, also have this Bruce Fine interview I did yesterday.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.720]  Well, I wanted to play a video clip of Bruce Fine talking about we are at the verge of despotism.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:53.720]  Just a section of it. I'm going to have all three parts of the video posted at infowars.com.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.720]  So that's coming up. Got a bunch of economic and police state news and Iran news and space news I'm going to get to.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:05.720]  But right now, let's go back to your calls. I wasn't trying to get an argument with the last caller if you just tuned in.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.720]  I just when people call it disagreeing and they said, you know, you're wrong about Fukushima and then I can't understand what I'm wrong about.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  And they just keep repeating this person's an expert.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.720]  I don't. Okay, this person's an expert. Aren't they have a website? It's on the Internet.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  I'm like, I know websites are on the Internet. I'm just, I don't know.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.720]  It's just sometimes I love people that disagree with me because sometimes they bring up real things I've been wrong about.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:38.720]  Like yesterday and I went and did research. I said, we're at death con four.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.720]  Well, then I didn't have time to look it up this morning because I actually couldn't find it.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.720]  Isn't death con one the worst level? And I was trying to imply death con fives are the worst and we're at death con four.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.720]  I get stuff wrong all the time because there's so much jumbled up there. I get things wrong.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.720]  In fact, a lot of times on the weekend, I'll listen to a rebroadcast to my show.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.720]  Not that I enjoy listening to myself, but, you know, I'll listen to it. And I always hear some little factoid.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:10.720]  I twist, but it's not on purpose. But other than that, just because like a me and my brain's like bailing hay up there.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.720]  And every once in a while gets a, it's a wire across the wrong way.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.720]  And then everything gets foobard or caddy wampus or, you know, a little bit.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:27.720]  Fandango doesn't matter the general information I'm covering spot on and I challenge people to show me where I'm wrong.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.720]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air. Thanks for holding good air from you.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.720]  Hi there, Alex. You know, I think that he just didn't realize the broad scope of the whole thing.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.720]  And he kind of focused on maybe somewhere where there's somebody that knows something and you weren't so thorough, I guess.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  But that's not really true either.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:55.720]  Well, I also guess see these comments and emails about why don't you cover the Federal Reserve or why don't you cover the Vatican calling for world government?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  Or why don't you cover what Israel did? And I've always covered whatever it is they're saying.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:08.720]  And I'm like, again, if the one video they watch of you isn't what they're into at that time, you're covering it up.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.720]  And again, that's one dimensional, moron thinking processes.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.720]  But shot issue. Let's get off me. I apologize. How can I serve you, Mike?
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:22.720]  The door is up for us, for me. I mean, that's exactly. I mean, I have the Jekyll Island book next to my bed here.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  And I was going to call and I asked you about we have a lock and dam here around Peoria.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:37.720]  And I was wondering how you can watch, how you can monitor when they empty it?
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  Because I heard about the Nebraska nuclear plant and it's because they did not empty some of the water when they should have the Army Corps of Engineers.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.720]  So I'm curious about that.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.720]  Well, that got covered up. Whatever happened in Nebraska, France had a big nuclear spill.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  They've covered that up. But radiation levels have gone up all over Europe.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  Our radiation levels have gone up from Fukushima because we're right downwind from it across the Pacific.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.720]  And that's been covered up. I mean, the media never gave it attention.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.720]  The EPA said, we're just going to raise the level of what we say is safe.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  And then it's basically a non-issue.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.720]  Sometime somebody off air with me, I live in between Springfield.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.720]  I live around Peoria. I live between Springfield and Chicago.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.720]  And we have the Department of Agriculture. We have so many things going on right here.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.720]  In fact, I'm trying to get all the public access TV here in East Peoria.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.720]  But they won't return my calls and it's inside the school.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.720]  You have to physically go down there and go through the bureaucracy and get the shows on.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.720]  There'll be some effort. But get in there, get it done.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720]  Every person we reach out to is key.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and a ton of news.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.720]  Stay with us. We'll try not to go cattywampus.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.720]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.720]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.720]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.720]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.720]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.720]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.720]  and America's biggest small owner, general growth properties.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.720]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.720]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.720]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.720]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.720]  He explains everything you need to know,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.720]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.720]  who'll give us a huge breakdown on what's happening in Iran,
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.720]  in the latest on Libya, where he's traveled and visited Syria.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  Also, we'll get the latest investigative info he's got on Barack Obama.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.720]  He's been going to Chicago and other areas and digging in to that.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.720]  But I want to put on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.720]  not just a radio show, folks, the article.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.720]  Radio listeners can go to infowars.com and find it.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.720]  Iowa Blitz, Ron Paul goes for Newt's Throat.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.720]  We copied Drudge's headline, but we added the little blurblet.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.720]  Ron Paul's campaign bought airtime in the important caucus state of Iowa
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.720]  in order to inform caucus participants about Newt Gennrich's record,
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.720]  not only as a flip-flopper, but as a seasoned insider
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  pushing the establishment's big government agenda of carbon taxes and endless war.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:25.720]  Now, if you scroll down, you can see the 60-second ad that is there.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.720]  And then below that, we have the two-minute version.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.720]  And I'm calling this Operation Sink Gennrich.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.720]  Now, we've already done newscasts. We've already done reports.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.720]  In fact, last week, I did an in-depth report about him supporting carbon taxes,
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.720]  open borders, amnesty, socialized healthcare with the Nancy Pelosi clips and things.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.720]  I think I'm going to have Kurt also add that to that page,
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.720]  because we make no mistake, folks, true libertarian constitutional,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.720]  as you can call us conservatives, whatever label, we're into freedom.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.720]  We like the founding fathers. We think they had good ideas.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.720]  Compared to what we're seeing, you know, the globalists bring forward.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  We exposed Perry. People six months ago thought we were crazy.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.720]  He didn't go to Bilderberg. He didn't work for Al Gore.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.720]  He didn't support government healthcare for Hillary.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.720]  And then it all came out, and they're like, wow, you didn't lie about that.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.720]  First, we put it out, then some tea parties picked it up, then Drudge picked it up,
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.720]  and boom, that was over. And I'm telling you, folks, there's no other, quote,
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.720]  conservative libertarian outlet that will actually expose these candidates
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:38.720]  but infoawars.com, prisonplanet.com, because we transcend these labels of liberal conservative.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.720]  Now, that said, the only other big outlet is Drudge, and that's why I gave him kudos earlier.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.720]  The system undoubtedly does not like the fact that Drudge is top linking to videos
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.720]  of Newt Gennrich supporting carbon taxes and government run healthcare and stuff like that.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  You've got to get these out, because I talked to friends and family.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.720]  I was talking to one crew member. He was at his father-in-law's this last weekend.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.720]  He's like, I like Gennrich. He's scientific and really smart and a statesman, and he's got it.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.720]  They kind of buy that media talking point of, Gennrich has a lot of ideas.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.720]  He's really a great guy. Gennrich is the most conservative.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  Newt Gennrich is a Republican version of Al Gore, but Al Gore is corrupt and anti-freedom and pretty dangerous.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.720]  He's a bad guy, but I've gauged him. I've been around him in person just like I've been to events.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:37.720]  Newt Gennrich was at years ago, and I'm telling you, on the chart of one to ten of the evil aura,
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.720]  Gennrich is about a nine and a half. Al Gore is about a six, so I'm telling you.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:50.720]  And I know why. He's part of some really creepy, futurist societies that talk about global enlightenment
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  and the end of the family and all this Luciferian buzzword stuff.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  He's definitely on the inside track.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.720]  Newt Gennrich, through academia, has been brought in to the highest levels of the Illuminati.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.720]  I can tell you from deep research. He walks like a duck. He quacks like one.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  He gives all the little key signs, beware Newt Gennrich.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.720]  He's probably just a ringer for Obama, because the globalists like Obama, they like the division he brings.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.720]  They like the fact that he can carry lessons, reads off a teleprompter.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.720]  So he's a ringer. He's so many other things, and now Ron Paul is number two undisputed.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  He's CBS ABC admitted he's number two. You destroy Newt Gennrich with his own record.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.720]  Like we've done Mitt Romney, like we've, he's not totally destroyed, but he's flopping around damaged.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  Perry is in deep trouble. He was high level Republican analysts thought he was going to be the man,
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.720]  and you saw him try to push him. And what did we do? We just fired torpedoes right into him
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:56.720]  and draw his link to those torpedoes. Bye-bye, Rick Perry. Bye-bye, Mitt Romney. Bye-bye, Newt Gennrich.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.720]  But bye-bye hasn't happened. Submarine pops up. There's that big fat whale of a tyrant, Newt Gennrich.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:10.720]  Fire at will. Fire at will, Commander. But you've got to fire on him.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.720]  Open fire. Fire at will. Go to infowars.com. Get that article linked in red. Get it out to everybody.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.720]  And I'm going to go through some of our videos we put on the YouTube channel where I've exposed him,
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:30.720]  and I'll get those posted there, too. Nice little arsenal area for you to get it out to your Republican family members
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:38.720]  who are just as ignorant and just as in the dark and just as conned as the moron Obama supporters.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:44.720]  You cannot make fun of Obama supporters for being upset about Bush and hoping that Obama would change things
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:53.720]  because he lied to him. You cannot sit there and make fun of them and then support Newt Gennrich.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:03.720]  You are as big a moron. A willful moron. So we've got to force Republicans to look at what Newt Gennrich is,
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.720]  and they don't want to, though, because, see, they got sucked into the con.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.720]  This is how the con works. I'm going to your calls. Because I know I was conned.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:19.720]  I was a senior in high school. No, I guess I was out of high school when all that happened.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  I've been out of high school for a while. The point is, I remember being in high school and watching Newt Gennrich
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.720]  leading the Republicans so he could take over the movement when they got elected.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:34.720]  The system knew what was going to happen and then basically kill all the real reforms and bring in false reforms.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:43.720]  But I remember in 1994 and all the things he did, and when the media would attack Newt Gennrich,
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.720]  I wasn't sophisticated enough to go, well, if CNN's attacking Newt Gennrich and Bill Clinton's attacking him,
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.720]  Newt Gennrich must be good. You know, Bill Clinton burned up Waco, Bill Clinton's for gun control,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.720]  Bill Clinton's for the UN, Bill Clinton's for the Federal Reserve. I at least knew enough about that.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.720]  I was kind of like a mainline Tea Party person is today. I knew socialism wasn't good.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.720]  I knew private property was good. I mean, I was a decent person, but still very ignorant.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  I thought, well, if Al Gore and Bill Clinton are attacking him, he must be good.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.720]  And I got his book and I read it and then I started waking up to him and I started watching C-SPAN
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.720]  and saw some of the freshman people in the house talking about what he was doing
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.720]  and how he would kill deals behind the scenes. And that was another beginning of my awakening.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  And so take heart, just like I woke up to how I was being conned, we've got to wake up Obama supporters.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:45.720]  We've got to wake up supporters of Newt Gennrich because once you show them,
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:51.720]  a great example we covered on the Nightly News last night, Nancy Pelosi came out yesterday
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  and told what Politico, she said, I got dirt on Gennrich and I'll release it at the proper time.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.720]  That's after he has the nomination. Oh, he is a lame duck.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.720]  The cheating on his wife, the adultery, the lying about it, but then it goes on and on.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  The lobbying, the corruption, the bailout supporting, the sanctuary cities, the illegal supporting,
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.720]  just all of it, the government health care individual payer mandate.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.720]  It goes on and on, the end of the family. I mean, this guy is a walking globalist.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:29.720]  People think, well, no, he flip flops. He's a smart politician. No, he's not in the way you say.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:35.720]  The flip flop is that he'll say conservative things, but do globalist stuff.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.720]  Okay, that's where the flip flop is.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.720]  And Pelosi came out and she said, I'm going to release stuff on you.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.720]  And he said, oh, give it to me now. Give me a Christmas present. Like, oh, you know, throw me in the briar patch.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.720]  These two do TV ads together promoting carbon taxes. It's all a big sick joke.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:03.720]  He is a ringer. Period. Period. Newt, the ringer, Gennrich. We must sink him. We must sink him now.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:09.720]  Okay, I'm done ranting. Let's go to Ed and PA, then Jay and others. Go ahead, Ed. Thanks for holding.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.720]  Hey, Alex, how's it going? Pretty good.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:22.720]  You know, in RT, there's a little thing a lot of people missed. It was a Russian general complaining that harp stopped their spacecraft from going to Mars.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.720]  And but my father.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.720]  Now, wait a minute. That is big news.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:39.720]  They're saying that their spacecraft was sabotaged by different waves or systems that hacked it because they there's certainly microwave weapons and other things that can do that.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.720]  I don't know if I'd call it harp in general. What was the headline on that? And I'll look that up.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.720]  Just Google Russian general grunt harp.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:57.720]  Russian general what grunt grunt. They call the spacecraft grunt.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.720]  Russian general NT.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:04.720]  Okay, I got it. Russian general grunt and harp HRP.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.720]  Okay, we'll we'll get that RT.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.720]  Is it RT or is it something else?
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:20.720]  Yeah, that's not RT. So I'll have to I'll have to look into that and see if we can find that video. What else is on your mind?
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.720]  My grandparents or my dad's side escaped from Russia like around 1918.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:35.720]  And me and my dad always had used to have long discussions on how Russia was becoming more like America and America was going toward Russia. This was 30 years ago.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:41.720]  And he I wish he was alive to see that they're the Formula One race cars running around the Red Square.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.720]  And they had a big bungee. They had a big crane with a bungee car going up and down and people getting in it.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:56.720]  And I saw the Red Square and you know, Russians are finally, you know, I know they're controlled by the mafia, but they're finally starting to get some, you know, some money and going and some things going.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:06.720]  And you know, it would tear me apart to see us go to work, you know, with the Russians and it would be deadly for both sides of Russians are a totally different race of people or slobs.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:12.720]  And they could cut cut our heads off. I mean, they're blood thirsty.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.720]  I appreciate your call. I think all humans have the capability to be blood thirsty. The Russians are certainly smart. Now, the very scientific.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.720]  Now, let's expand on this.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.720]  And look at what you're getting into. I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin or Medvedev or any of these people.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:37.720]  The all I know is the Russian government pays people to have children and is anti eugenics.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:46.720]  Okay. And that's the difference right there. Yeah, it's a mafia. Yeah, it's corrupt, but they don't want their people to all disappear off the face of the earth.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:20:14.720]  The globalists that run us are sick. By the way, I did find the article he mentioned will cover when we come back and we'll get to Jay, Joe, Lyndon and Ryan.

[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:36.720]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to your calls. Then we're going to pull up that article again. We'll print it off where RT did ask the question.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:49.720]  Did Western groups sabotage the Russian space probe to Mars? I know that governments basically do do that to each other. The U.S. government a couple years ago accused the Chinese of firing lasers at our satellites.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:58.720]  And there was a big high-level diplomatic fight over that arow as they call it. JN Utah, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:12.720]  Hello, Alex. I had just a quick question for you and then maybe a comment or suggestion. When you first mentioned the article on the Dredge Report, Ron Paul goes for Newt's wrote.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:24.720]  You mentioned it should have, that's the kind of thing that should send that video into the millions of views, which I completely agree and it's good for, you know, to see that kind of visibility.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:33.720]  I noticed that that article, I'm sorry, that YouTube video, the number of views on that does not increment. And I was just wondering.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:48.720]  No, that's a big misconception. It's cashing. It's a cashing issue with YouTube and other systems. When it goes to 301 views, it's only on one server basically with YouTube and it's low quality.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:59.720]  Once they know a video is a bigger video, it takes about five hours to a day to update. And that's why the view counter jumps. It's not a real time system because you're not on one computer.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:07.720]  That video is out on clouds and content distribution systems. And so that's a cashing system.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:21.720]  Especially when you put a video up, it's like 100,000 views an hour. We've had that happen. They might freeze it for a day sometimes as the computers check that it's not some automated spam system to game the YouTube system.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:31.720]  But the reason I was mentioning Dredge having as the top link, you know, the point is, is that, is that this is really becoming a big news issue of how corrupt and out of control.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:50.720]  Newt Gennrich is, and I was just saying thanks to Drudge for helping Ron Paul out. I mean, I mean, Drudge, Matt Drudge obviously is a patriot and is really over the years getting more and more awake to the full spectrum of what's happening and has really been exposing all these Republican candidates that are globalist.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:27:09.720]  And I, and that's a big deal for what is the number one internet news site and the number one conservative news site. I'll assure you the establishment is not like it. I will assure you that the insiders are not happy about the fact that Matt Drudge probably more than anybody other than this show has helped
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:16.720]  torpedo all of these Rhino Republicans. That's a big deal.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:32.720]  Well, it's, it's as much as they'd like to deny, you know, the people are waking up and, you know, pretend it's not happening. And this is the kind of thing that they can't deny. And they can't keep a lid on this type of type of information.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.720]  Well, that's it.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.720]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:54.720]  Just a comment for you was, I know that you have a, I've really enjoyed the variety of guests that you have on the show. I do know that from personal experience, I know when you had author Naomi Wolf on the show, for example,
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:11.720]  I had a friend who was actually kind of surprised that that person was on and pleasantly surprised. But it does a paradigm shift for people, you know, when they, when you have different people on like Roseanne Barr or Naomi Wolf or others,
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:18.720]  maybe give something people to share and say, hey, you know, I know you like this author or I know you like this performer or lecturer.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:27.720]  Did you happen to catch them on info wars or that kind of a thing? I just think that it is another way for people to introduce the show.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:36.720]  No, I agree with you. And then some people say, well, why are you having a liberal on? Or why are you having some other person that you don't agree with on?
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:49.720]  That's the whole point of getting dialogue going. I believe in my ideas and I believe they're stronger than theirs. And I want to engage them as humans and say, hey, let's get past left and right. Let's talk about right and wrong.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:29:03.720]  Let's talk about liberty and freedom. The system wants everybody in their camps, hating the others. That's divide and conquer. So we never have a real discussion and really understand things and really turn things around.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:14.720]  Roseanne Barr and Naomi Wolf, they have no future in this new world order. Neither does the children of these mainline Republicans.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  And so that's why I'm doing that. I really appreciate your call. More calls coming up. Here's the article out of RT.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:40.720]  Did U.S. climate weapon knockout Russian probe? Russian space experts are struggling to decode fresh telemetry signals received from the stricken Phobos grunt probe. Meanwhile, rumors are circling in America's ion sphere research site in Alaska caused the spacecraft failure.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:49.720]  A total rumor. They wouldn't use heart to do that. They've got all sorts of microwave and other weapons systems that could. We'll be back.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:30:00.720]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:18.720]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:34.720]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:34:00.720]  Okay, while we're getting Wayne Madsen on the line, I want to remind you that I'm going to play clips of the Colbert Report from last night on Comedy Central where they attacked Governor Jesse Ventura and myself and made a big joke out of investigating the Denver International Airport.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:12.720]  And then basically implied that we think the world is going to end in 2012 or roughly a year from now in late December of next year.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:24.720]  I have always said that that's a fraud, that it is not the end of the world, but you watch when it's not the end of the world. I will be attacked for being wrong saying it would be the end of the world.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:34.720]  And they just mix it all together. It's very funny, but that's why good humor is so powerful to sell a lie.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:55.720]  The piece starts with an old lady. They're saying, hi, welcome to the Denver International Airport. And then they have her morph into a reptoid vampire lizard. Pretty ridiculous. So I'm going to play that. If you're a prisonplanet.tv where you'll obviously be able to watch it.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:16.720]  You can watch it on the propaganda. Then we'll also get that posted by tomorrow for everybody at infowars.com. Because not only do we stream the show live at prisonplanet.tv, we then also post almost all of Alex Shone's live, this daily radio TV show, and the nightly news every evening at 7.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:31.720]  The prisonplanet.tv members get to see when it airs live, when it airs the first time and then restreams throughout the evening in this archive. Then we post almost all of it there at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube with 160 million views on that one channel alone.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:43.720]  So those of you that are prisonplanet.tv members, you get the high quality, all the films, the higher quality podcast, commercial free, my book, Paul Watson's book, everything in one place.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:53.720]  But even better, you are then supporting our entire news operation to have this posted on thousands of video sites across the web every week.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:36:01.720]  And it reaches millions of people conservatively on those news video websites alone.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:17.720]  And we've already got some cable systems around the country that are picking it up off the internet or downloading the file after it airs live and playing it. And I'm just in the beta testing mode right now, but we're moving into getting more reporters, a few more crew members, thanks to your support.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:25.720]  And then we'll go ahead and I think I'm going to go ahead and just make it an hour long every night. We've been beta testing two hours, 30 minutes an hour, and then really take it to the next level.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:34.720]  But that's what we're doing here. Never resting on our laurels. The only area I haven't gotten into is publishing.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:43.720]  Even though I've had a lot of big New York publishers call me. They want me to do like Glenn Beck does have a new book every six months that I don't write that has my name on it.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.720]  And it makes a lot of money.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.720]  But and maybe I should do it just because of that and then use that money to fund this operation.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:02.720]  The point is, it takes a lot of time, even when it's been ghostwritten, and then it comes out and it's a huge hit if 100,000 people read it. I mean, whoop, do you do?
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:09.720]  I can make a YouTube video today in 10 minutes that'll be seen by 100,000 people guaranteed.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:16.720]  I can drive on the road shooting a YouTube talking about points and 100,000 are going to watch it. I make videos that 35, 40 million people watch.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:28.720]  And in the final equation, it's not about money, but I do need the money to be secure and strong and be able to fight lawsuits or attacks and to expand this operation, not just keep it where it's at in the face of this depression.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:33.720]  So I might actually get into that area because they're knocking down my doors.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:43.720]  The problem is they get that you I've been through this once and refused to let the book be published because the ghost writers that people get you just it isn't what you really believe.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:49.720]  So I don't know how to, I don't know how to do that.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.720]  All right, side issue. I'm now digressing.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:38:01.720]  Coming up, I'm going to play the Colbert report from last night and give you an example of propaganda and demonization.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:07.720]  The latest on the TSA, NASA telescope confirms alien planet and habitable zone.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.720]  That's interesting. I'm going to break that down.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.720]  Europe is setting itself up for a decade long recession. You mean depression.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.720]  Iran's Revolutionary Guard prepares for war. Now it's admitted that drone was shot down.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.720]  We're going to break that down and also take your phone calls.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:30.720]  But I'm going to give you the Corbert report and I'm also going to play part of this Bruce Fine breakdown of speech he gave very powerful.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:42.720]  Kind of want to Bruce Fine Jag right now because I had him on yesterday and then I have to see my video, my interview with him post yesterday and saw the other suggested videos and started watching his speeches this morning.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.720]  And he just really has a way with historical breakdown. So we're going to play that.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:53.720]  But look right now. Let's go ahead and go to Wayne Madsen.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.720]  Wayne Madsen is a Washington, D.C. based investigative journalist author and syndicated columnist.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  He's written for The Village Voice, The Progressive Counterpunch, Online Journal, CorpWatch, Multinational Monitor, News Insider.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:13.720]  These times, the American conservatives, his columns have appeared in Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Columbus Dispatch, Sacramento Bee, Atlanta Journal, Constitution, and others.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:22.720]  And whenever you're watching C-SPAN in years past, I've seen him over and over again, watching some international spy event or national security hearing.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:28.720]  You'll see Wayne Madsen back there reporting, back there writing notes. And so he's always got a lot of hot issues.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.720]  A lot of times over the horizon info, you hear it from Wayne first.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:39.720]  I got a lot of questions on Iran, on Syria, on Libya, on the Iran attack, on the police state.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.720]  But it's always interesting to ask Wayne what he's working on right now first, WayneMadsenreport.com.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.720]  Wayne, good to have you here with us. What are you looking at first right now?
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.720]  Well, I have been checking out this new, what we could call the Obama doctrine.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:40:04.720]  And it's under the rubric of something called mass atrocity prevention map, otherwise known as responsibility to protect R2P.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:14.720]  This is all coming out of the National Security Council, particularly a woman named Samantha Power, whose husband you, of course, are familiar with.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:20.720]  Cass Sunstein, who is Obama's information czar, propaganda czar.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:33.720]  But this is basically something that came out of the Soros, George Soros funded think tank, that basically gives the United States the cover of humanitarian intervention to launch aggressive wars.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.720]  And we've seen it already play out in Libya. We're seeing it play out in Syria.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:50.720]  We're also going to see it play out in Iran, but that's more of a military operation right now than trying to undermine various groups,
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.720]  undermine the government with various domestic opposition groups.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.720]  And we're seeing it play out in Russia right now, with charges that the election there wasn't fair.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:09.720]  We hear Hillary Clinton making these statements that she normally does before she lets loose the thoughts of war on these countries.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.720]  And China is another country that's in the gun sites right now.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:23.720]  And not that China or Russia are wonderful people. It's just that the banking cartels, the most nasty people ever on human history, have seized America.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:33.720]  So it's not Russia, China, good, America, bad. It's banksters of hijacked America and are trying to use us to bully other countries, especially Russia.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:37.720]  I know there's more of an incestuous relationship with the banksters and China.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  Looking at this new, new, new idea that they, the West funds rebels who attacked the government.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.720]  If the government fights back, it's called oppression.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:53.720]  If they fired tear gas, it's called oppression, but here they billy club people and then they invade the country.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.720]  Now we see the UN wanting to, you know, declare Syria a war zone.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:06.720]  The puppet Arab League calling for attacks. Al Qaeda being sent now out of Libya into Syria.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:15.720]  All of this confirmed. How does the system square this that we've got to give all our rights up and have TSA fondle our children and strip search whole ladies?
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:26.720]  Because they might be Al Qaeda, you know, hiding in their diaper, but then Al Qaeda is good though and fights the evil, evil Assad and Syria.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:34.720]  Well, I mean, Al Qaeda has always been the CIA. They created them. They, they nurtured them. They use them when they have to use them.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:42.720]  I mean, this is quite apparent as I'm right now working on a book on the Obama-Satoro-Dunham connection with the CIA.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:51.720]  You look at past operations, even before the Mujahideen war against the Soviets and you see this play out over and over again.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:58.720]  The U.S. supporting these various groups that in some cases come back and invite us big time.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:06.720]  And it's quite clear, of course, that Obama and his, well, especially his grandparents grew up in this type of environment.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:14.720]  His mother grew up in this type of environment, so he's perfectly happy with his own doctrine, whether it was given to him or not.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:23.720]  He's happy with it. And as far as, you know, overthrowing governments by saying they're not democratic, right now, presently,
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:32.720]  Greece and Italy have unelected governments in charge of those countries. And we have Hillary criticizing Russia, Hillary criticizing China,
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:38.720]  other countries when, in fact, Italy and Greece have unelected governments in charge.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:48.720]  And just yesterday, Belgium, which has been without a government for over 500 days, appointed a government which is very unreflective of the situation.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:53.720]  That country is being split in two between the Flemish and the French.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:04.720]  And the government is not representative of other people, but it was another government installed by the bankers because the Belgium's credit rating had been reduced.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:15.720]  And today we find out that 15 members of the eurozone are also facing similar credit downgrades if they don't get, so-called, get their house in order.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.720]  Is this a prelude for installing unelected governments on those various countries?
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.720]  I believe this is what we're seeing now. The bankers are in charge.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:30.720]  We've got the suppression of the demonstrations in this country with tear gas.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.720]  And as you mentioned, billy clubs and all kinds of...
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:39.720]  Now we have the Pentagon offering free military hardware to police departments around the country.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.720]  Your warnings about the fact is takeover of this country, I'm afraid it's over.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.720]  We had it. It's in place now, so what do we do about it?
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:45:04.720]  Well, Wayne, let me get to that point because on the nightly news last week, I covered a report that got into a very, very important issue.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:21.720]  And that is the fact that in Time Magazine, in Newsweek, and the Financial Times of London, in all of these publications, Wayne, they just calmly come out now and say,
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:35.720]  You know what? Rule by governments and elected people is bad. We need a technocracy. We need experts. And the Economist actually said this is a good system.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:43.720]  And it's good that Goldman Sachs has taken over Europe, and it's good that they're installing leaders now who are part of the Bilderberg group and groups like that.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:52.720]  And they are now just flaunting it. We see Newsweek saying the Constitution's the problem when getting rid of the Constitution has brought us to this point.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:46:01.720]  So there's this now, there's this hiding in plain view that I saw the opening salvo of two years ago with the article titled,
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:14.720]  And Now for World Government that was in the Financial Times of London and their foreign editor said, Yeah, it's authoritarian. Yeah, it's secret. Yeah, it's ruled by bankers and it's undemocratic and we're going to do it.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:29.720]  And so now they're calling it the United States of Goldman Sachs in Europe. They're just publicly saying this and Congress is saying, Yeah, we'll use troops on the streets and we'll secretly arrest you for no reason.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:35.720]  And Obama's like, I'm going to veto that because I already have that power. I don't need Congress to tell me I can.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:46.720]  I mean, it's even twilight zoning for me seeing it coming a million miles away, Wayne, because it's so out in the open and so obvious.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:54.720]  And yes, they said in Europe they're going to install unelected technocrats from the banker installed bureaucracy.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:04.720]  I mean, it's really happening, Wayne. I'm sorry to be. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I ran a story this past week. We know that Obama was over in Asia.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:10.720]  He announced he was going to open five new military bases in Australia.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:23.720]  And I got kicked off by a well-placed person in the government of New Zealand who said that the US military presence and intelligence presence in the Asia Pacific region
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.720]  is unprecedented. He said he hasn't seen anything like it.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.720]  The last time would have been World War II when we were fighting the Japanese in the Pacific.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.720]  Now, what is this all building up to? This is a confrontation with China.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:43.720]  And we know tomorrow, December 7th, what we all often remember.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:50.720]  I think we're probably looking at down the road and in short order some sort of military confrontation,
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.720]  maybe an attack blamed on the Chinese going to put us in a full-scale war with China,
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:05.720]  with the Japanese, Koreans, Australians, Filipinos and Vietnamese and others as our so-called allies.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720]  But this is, I think, what we're coming to.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:17.720]  It may be in the South China Sea where the Chinese and the US backed surrogates in the area now fighting over oil and natural gas reserves in that area.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:26.720]  And I think if we have read much about how Roosevelt knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor before it happened
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.720]  and let it happen to get us in the war, and I'm afraid we may.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.720]  And I'm not saying this next week or next month, but I think down the road,
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.720]  especially if we see a second administration of Obama, but it doesn't matter.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:48.720]  We could, at one of the Republicans in there, except for Ron Paul and a couple others, maybe, but if we get a gingrich or a Romney or somebody like that,
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.720]  forget about it.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.720]  I think we're facing another specific war.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:49:00.720]  And the warning came to me, as I say, from somebody very high-ranking in the New Zealand government.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720]  And that's now confirmed, by the way.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  Iran has threatened to cut off Gulf oil exports if nuclear facilities are attacked.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:13.720]  They have officially said, as of yesterday, they'll cut off Australia Hormuz, 40 percent of the world's oil surprise.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:22.720]  It will conservatively go to $7 a gallon here or $200 a barrel in adjusted dollars as a conservative estimate from that way.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:33.720]  And you just literally hit the nail on the head there because what's happening here is China has said an attack on Iran in their major state-run media
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:39.720]  as an attack on them, just like the West, and I'm not defending the Imperial Japanese, it was one devil fighting another,
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:46.720]  with flying tigers, which were a corporate army, were sent in, as you know, for two years before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:51.720]  and were attacking Japanese aircraft in southern China and surrounding areas.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.720]  The Japanese continued to protest.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.720]  Their oil supplies were being cut off in the region.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:02.720]  And so, you know, being a warrior class, led by a warrior class, they, you know, Yamamoto thought they'd probably lose the war.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.720]  He said, I fear we've awoken a sleeping giant.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.720]  And his command said, we might want you to invade the West Coast.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.720]  He said, there'd be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.720]  Are you insane?
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.720]  But the point is, he still followed his orders and attacked.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:23.720]  And China, the globalists have played a double game with all the cheap slave goods to de-industrialize their competition here.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.720]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.720]  Wayne, they've moved into this.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.720]  We're going to come back from break and talk about it with Wayne Madsen.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:38.720]  This is so incredible that these proxy wars with Syria and all these other areas is meant to get around China and Russia.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.720]  And again, it's not America doing this.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.720]  It's the banking cartel using our muscle to do it.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.720]  And I want to get his geopolitical view in this segment and the next.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  Then I'm going to get to the callers who've been holding.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.720]  Okay, I'm going to get to you.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.720]  We'll do the Corbett report thing after that.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.720]  And then get into this speech on the police state.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:56.720]  It's all coming up.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:59.720]  It's going to be a jam packed third hour prison planet dot tv.
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:28.720]  Stay with us.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:58.720]  We'll see you next time.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.720]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.720]  Big Berkey water filters.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:11.720]  Yes, the gift of clean water, a gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:19.720]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:25.720]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:34.720]  And that saves time and money and filter replacements that other water filters require and are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.

[01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:05.720]  Bio-age, the age of advanced organics.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:10.720]  By the way, it's a side issue, but I'll get to it later if I can.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:25.720]  The London Guardian and others are reporting that the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, has come out and said that everyone in the national health care system will be opened up as a research patent and that your blood, your DNA, your individual proteins are owned by the state.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:35.720]  A federal judge ruled last Friday on the court cases of women's DNA for the cancer gene has been patented, so you can't get treatment for that.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:43.720]  It costs $100,000 instead of a fraction of that because they won't let it ever go generic because your genetics are owned by them.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:55.720]  And how they get your genetics? Everybody for 40 years. It's now 40 years. We have 40 years and two months. For 40 years in every industrialized country, it's had their blood taken for the secret database.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:02.720]  And now David Cameron's public about it. They do what they want. They do atmospheric tests. They put stuff in our water.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:11.720]  It's a scientific dictatorship. And while you're busy worrying about football and all the rest of it, they're absolutely hammering the daylights out of us.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.720]  Okay? That's what I'm here to get you to do, to think.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:21.720]  Wayne Madsen, you heard my question, my friend, and you're really the expert on these subjects. They are full steam ahead for war.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:30.720]  Iran, the situations get the serious. They've shot down the drone that could have even been weaponized. They're admitting now that the West is bombing them, blowing up bases.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:36.720]  Iran says they're preparing for war. I mean, things are really going into high gear. Where are we going?
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:45.720]  Well, I believe we're already at a war, in a war situation with Iran, a low-level covert war.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:54.720]  The shooting down of the U.S. drone is just part of this. The explosion at the missile base outside of Tehran was part of this.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.720]  The explosion at the nuclear facility outside of Isfahan was part of this.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:07.720]  And I'm sure we've got many other incidents like this happening that aren't being reported. Now, the Iranian government doesn't have a lot of interest in reporting it
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  because it would tell their people that maybe the government's not able to defend the nation.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:21.720]  And, of course, the U.S. and our side doesn't want to report on this because, essentially, these are accidents that are taking place.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:32.720]  This is how they're being reported from both sides. But every war game run by the U.S. Army War College, the Naval War College,
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:41.720]  where this scenario of going to war with Iran has been fed into the computers, it always has the same result.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.720]  First, there's a regional war, and then it goes to global thermonuclear war.
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:56.720]  Remember the movie War Games from the early 80s, where this was always the ultimate result of these war games with global thermonuclear war?
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:06.720]  And that's exactly what we're talking about here because, as we were talking before, a cutoff by Iran of their oil exports hurts China,
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:12.720]  which relies heavily on those exports. Now, where will China go to compensate?
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:20.720]  They'll go to the South China Sea, which will put them in a military, potential military conflict with countries like Vietnam, the Philippines,
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:31.720]  and others in the area. And that could get us in a war, especially if we put our Navy ships in there between the Chinese and these other countries.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.720]  We're asking for the potential for some sort of an incident.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:44.720]  We already know that even if the Chinese don't conduct an incident or bring one about,
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:51.720]  that we're always capable of doing one on our own and blaming them, should I mention the Gulf of Tonkin?
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:57.720]  And what happened there? We blamed North Vietnam for attacking two U.S. destroyers. They did not attack.
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.720]  This was totally made out of whole...
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:05.720]  Why do you think Gary Hart sent them a letter, what was it, five years ago, saying we'll stage terror attacks on ourselves?
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.720]  Well, I mean, I think this is part of the scenario. I mean, we know about these false flag attacks,
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:17.720]  and how they're used to promote these war situations, that it is a global war on terror.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:24.720]  This is crazy thing that we lost all of our rights because of what happened on 9-11, another false flag attack.
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:32.720]  But you go back through history, a recent history anyway, a false flag attack, and you find a CIA fingerprint all over these.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.720]  Absolutely. Stay there. Back in one minute. Final segment with Wayne Madsen.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:39.720]  Then your calls. In a ton of news, stay with us.

[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:02.720]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:14.720]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:20.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:29.720]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.720]  Already into hour number three, we're talking to Wayne Madsen.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:33.720]  Wayne Madsen continuing looking at where the world's going. Are things going good for the big megabanks?
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:38.720]  The cartel operators. Yeah, they're taking over Europe. They're imploding sovereignty everywhere.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:44.720]  They've got the Congress here passing laws, put the military on the streets.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.720]  But as the economy falls apart, more people are undoubtedly waking up.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:59.720]  I guess what I'm getting at is, are things going well for them overall, though? Or have they bitten off more than they can chew?
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:10.720]  Well, I think what we're seeing now with these street demonstrations popping up, even in small towns in the United States and, of course, around the world,
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:19.720]  I think the powers, the elites are worried about people making common cause with one another.
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:30.720]  Obviously, we know that what's happening in London is being followed by the people in New York and other places who are out there demonstrating.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:39.720]  But now we have the City of London police coming out with internal documents stating that the occupying London people are terrorists.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:55.720]  And we know what happened just here in the United States with the Congress passing this Defense Appropriation Act with this rider stating that people can be picked up in this country
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:05.720]  by the military and thrown in some stockade somewhere, some Navy Brig, and never see the light of day if they're deemed to be terrorists.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:17.720]  I think these are all indications that the elites are worried about the mass movement of the people on the street and they're going to do everything in their power to try to stop it.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:24.720]  By the way, Wayne, you're not just saying that. We ran headlines yesterday out of England where they list protesters as terrorists.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:32.720]  And then we got the memos that are public now saying anybody protesting is a, quote, low-level terrorist.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:38.720]  Right. And here's my fear, though. My fear is what's happening with the U.S. Postal Service.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:47.720]  Remember this? The Post Office was the feather in the cap of one of our founders, Benjamin Franklin, who created the Postal Service.
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:56.720]  And now it's in danger of collapsing because of the fraud of the Congress and the fraud of the administrators.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:02.720]  And the people have been just pulling the money in what had been a flush system out of that system.
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:16.720]  And now they're saying it's bankrupt. And, you know, when you go to small-pound America, sometimes the only interaction that an American citizen has with the federal government is when they go to that local small Post Office.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:26.720]  And if that disappears, I think we could be seeing these protests sweep across the country in what I would call a stagebrush rebellion.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:33.720]  And I think if that happens, we're going to see a lot of people in places like Kansas and Oklahoma.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:40.720]  Maybe they haven't been real supportive of what's happening in New York and LA and San Francisco and Oakland and other places.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:47.720]  But I think they would then realize, why do we need the government when my grandma can't get her social security check anymore?
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:55.720]  We've got to drive 70 miles to a Post Office because our mail service has been discontinued.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:01.720]  And I also think the other part of this, I've always thought about what happens if they take over the Internet.
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:05.720]  Well, in my case, I have the people who subscribe to my website.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:14.720]  In many cases, I have their mailing address. Now, I could easily go to paper and send the we match report, not dot com,
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.720]  but, you know, basically, you know, a Xerox copy out to them through the mail.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:28.720]  But if the Postal Service is disrupted and it's privatized and it's handled by FedEx, where it becomes cost prohibitive, then where are we at?
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.720]  We have no backup. We have no backup to the Internet.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.720]  Well, that's where it's all moving is the post industrial world.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:38.720]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.720]  I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.720]  You bet.
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:48.720]  There goes Wayne. Okay, I'm going to get to a smattering of your call straight ahead.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.720]  I'm going to briefly get into the collapsing society, the post industrial world.
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:55.720]  It's Wayne, which is raising. I don't have time to make the point now.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:01.720]  Then we'll get to the Colbert report.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:03.720]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:08.720]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognize risk.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:10.720]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:19.720]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:27.720]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:35.720]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:40.720]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:48.720]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:07.720]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here. If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up. This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:14.720]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family. Here's why.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:22.720]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full-acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:32.720]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds. It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:41.720]  And here's the best part. All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:56.720]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:26.720]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to play some clips from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central where they demonized myself and former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura last night.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:41.720]  It's very entertaining, it's very funny, but it's also very deceptive, so I want to play it and then kind of decipher the different layers of brainwashing that are going on here politically.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:56.720]  But before I go any further, Wayne Madsen was just mentioning the collapse of society. They're talking about getting rid of Saturday delivery, getting rid of many of the different options of the Post Office, maybe getting rid of it entirely.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:01.720]  And my issue with that is why are all the services going away now?
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:12.720]  I was reading reports where all over the country police aren't responding now, in the case of Oakland, to 35 crimes including aggravated assault, things like that.
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:29.720]  I saw reports where police all over the country are saying they're going to have to charge you now if you want them to help lead your motorcade so you don't block traffic and things when you, you know, drive your family member in the hearst to the cemetery to bury them.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:42.720]  Why could we always have that and now we can't? You know, it's funny, they write more tickets, the taxes are up, the revenues up, the gas tax is always bigger, and they say, oh, we want to put a satellite tracker box in there and tax you now?
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.720]  Because we don't get enough revenue, then you go look, they're getting more revenue.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:10:00.720]  It's because it's globalism, it's a plan, it's a post-industrial world. The vast majority of your tax money is siphoned off to pay for the derivatives that the federal government signed on to.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:06.720]  Not our debt. That's the same in every other country. The only country to say no are the Icelanders.
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:16.720]  The Icelandic nation said no for over a year. They said, we're going to sue you, your government's going to implode, England's going to list everybody in Iceland, all 400,000 of them.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:28.720]  As terrorists, you won't be able to fly out of the country all the bluff. They said, oh, 92% or was it 93? 90 plus percent of the money is owed actually by the very banks that were threatening you.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:39.720]  Will you pay the 8%? And Iceland said, yeah, we'll pay that. It was going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars per person of debt. They didn't owe.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:51.720]  They didn't owe it. They say, well, Europe's in trouble because they get a month of vacation a year. They're lazy in Europe. No, they're not. No, they're not. No, they're not.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:11:00.720]  We're not lazy. There's some lazy people on welfare that are Democratic voters basically. You got all the people on corporate welfare that are Republicans.
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:09.720]  But the majority of Americans, in fact, they've done international studies, work more than anybody. The average American works something like 12, 13 hours a day, six days a week.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:16.720]  I know I do. The average American has more than one job.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:26.720]  We have one of the highest rates of our women working in this country. Just 50 years ago worldwide, most women didn't work. That was a luxury to not have to work.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.720]  It was a good thing to take care of the home, take care of the children. That's important.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:38.720]  Daddy had to go work in the factory and get his arm caught in the machinery or run the combine. Mama didn't have to.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:51.720]  Now, in the Depression, Mama had to get out there and work. The point is, is that we've been taught this is all a great thing. I saw numbers last night in Bloomberg where they're calling it a man's session because the men are having the really bad depression.
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.720]  All designed, folks. All designed.
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:06.720]  All right, I'm going to go to your calls. I'm going to go to Joe and then Lyndon and then Ivan and then Otter and everybody else that's holding.
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:10.720]  It's just that all the services go out the window.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:16.720]  The taxes go up. You get pulled over. They nickel and dime you for tickets and they tell the cops it's come out.
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:25.720]  We're going to go bankrupt and lay all of you off if you don't have these quotas and then that money at the county and city level with the city managers crooks pretty much all of them.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:27.720]  The vast majority.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:36.720]  They've been investing it on generally more than 70%. Some numbers are more than 80 in the comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:44.720]  That's the real set of books. You're always told about budget, budget, budget. That'd be like if I made $100,000 a year. I told my wife, honey, our budgets only $40,000.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:52.720]  And I tricked her hypothetically to think $40,000 was everything we made because I said budget, budget, budget.
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:59.720]  Meanwhile, I'm pocketing $60,000 and we've got a whole other family across town with five kids.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:05.720]  That's basically and the Chicago mafia developed this. It's called the 1313. They had it by the 20s.
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:15.720]  It was adopted by the Federal Reserve in 1947. The National Security Act was meant to back it up and they set this up where they get the city council people and the city manager.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:22.720]  The city councils didn't know what they're doing. They fly them around, bamboozle them, promise them we'll give your wife, your husband a job.
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:27.720]  You know, when you get out or we'll give you a good property deal, just let the city manager be in there.
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.720]  And the city manager takes that money and invest it in the stock market. Not your pension, not for, no, that's on budget.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.720]  And then they swindled all that in the derivative.
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  Remember 10 years ago, we talked about how they had enough money to not pay any taxes ever again and pay every American dividends like they do in Alaska or like to do for Native Americans.
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:57.720]  The wealth is so great that you could live off of it, get a huge dividend, not ever have to pay taxes again.
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.720]  Many people could just retire at like age 55, the numbers showed. Not anymore. They stole it all.
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:10.720]  The globalists admit their jobs to destroy wealth, their jobs to destroy businesses, their job with the IRS is to shut down the country.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:20.720]  NAFTA and GAAT shut down the country because liberty and the engine of freedom and the engine for human desire is so great we'd all live like kings and then we wouldn't need government.
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:28.720]  They want to keep you on a tiny welfare check, living in a hovel with CPS workers feeding on you, putting your kids on drugs and putting them in prison later.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:35.720]  To go to college in prison to learn how to come out and deal drugs and rob houses. That's a college, crime college.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:41.720]  They've got it all figured out in social engineering and I for one am tired of it.
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:52.720]  So I read about S&P downgrade threat a clarion call for Euro reform and they're saying raise your taxes, cut all your benefits, pay everything the private banks or we'll cut your debt rating even more.
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.720]  The very groups that created the debt. But the public is so ignorant and the media won't tell them that.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.720]  Here's another one. Anxious Greeks emptying their bank accounts, Der Spiegel.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:10.720]  It's already starting here. Bankruns are down the road if this continues.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:19.720]  This article ends up at Drudge Report. It's also up at infowars.com right now and I'm going to cover this on the nightly news this evening because bankruns are the real deal.
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:23.720]  In fact, I'm going to have a news package done. I was going to send Aaron McBreen out on cloning.
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.720]  I think I'm going to go out on the street too soon, but I'm so busy.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:33.720]  I want to go out and ask folks about bankrun. Would they ever take their money out of the account? What do they think of folks that are doing it?
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.720]  What do they think of banks trying to give people their money back? That's what we need to cover.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:45.720]  Okay, let's go to your calls. It's just that our system's rotting and it's by design. It's not going to get better.
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.720]  People always say, well, the politicians are trying to fix it, but they're too dumb.
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:59.720]  Oh, New Genrich will fix it or Donald Trump will. It's not that the government doesn't know how to fix it. It's working just fine.
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:07.720]  The top 1% get richer and richer and then they're going to sick the lower classes, the working classes, almost left to the middle class saying get them rich people.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:14.720]  Oldest trick in the book. Pressure from above and below. Joe in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:18.720]  Hey, God bless you, Alex, and you're reporting your reporters and all you do.
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:25.720]  I'm calling. I just want to make a quick comment and ask a question and listen off there.
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:37.720]  My comment was, I had heard you talk a while back about the private property issue and game wardens coming on your property during the hunting.
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:45.720]  And I just want to suggest that as I do on my gate, the state nerve put a you can go down print shop and get you a cheap sign.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:56.720]  It says this property protected by SB State Bill 378 and just wear a firearm in your your life and on your property.
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.720]  And my question was show my ignorance. Tell me about that bill.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:04.720]  It's a Texas Castle Law State Bill 378.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:09.720]  Oh, sure. The Castle Law. Yeah, saying anybody comes on your property without a warrant. Bye bye.
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:13.720]  Well, I mean, here's the deal. It's not even it's my dad's property. I guess it's mine.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.720]  The point is it's an old family ranch out in East Texas and my family's been there forever.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:25.720]  Family had family worked at the county and stuff. I'm not going to get into the whole story and you're constantly harassed.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.720]  I mean, I've told the story of my dad, you know, taking his uncle who was dying of pancreatic cancer.
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:35.720]  He's dead now. Last time he hunted taking his dear state police flipping out, threatening them, grabbing guns out.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:39.720]  And they're like, it's legal for the landowner to transport the deer. No, it's not shut up.
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:44.720]  And then now the game warden is showing up and, you know, wanting to go in buildings and stuff.
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:52.720]  And it's just it's not America being pulled over by the state police and them wanting to search my car and checking my tent and asking me questions.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:58.720]  It's not freedom. Get out of my life. I'm not a drug dealer like your government. I'm sorry. I'm not a criminal.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.720]  You are. Get out of my face. I mean, you see what I'm sorry. Go ahead. You had a question.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:17.720]  You're correct, Alex. And my question was what what is your opinion on what's going to happen that they're investigating the Justice Department and Holder on the fast and furious thing?
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:21.720]  This has already said he's not going to do anything that it's up to Obama to do something.
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:30.720]  You know why? Because Holder walked in a month ago and said, Bush would ran this operation and they all literally put their tails between their legs and shut up.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.720]  I told you that was going to come out. The government didn't just start shipping drugs in and guns out.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:43.720]  It didn't start with Reagan either. Our government has been shipping the drugs in since the 30s, since they made it illegal.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:51.720]  So that's where it goes. And Holder's still going to use it to try to restrict the Second Amendment. They don't even need a law.
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:19:04.720]  They're ordering, as you know, four states, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, to not sell more than when they sell two guns now, they file a suspicious transaction with the ATF,
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:12.720]  as if the ATF didn't already have the computer file with the NIC system. It's all about the gun shops doing something that's unconstitutional.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:20.720]  It's all about setting the present when the ATF criminals say something they do it. What's your take on that?
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:27.720]  Oh, the phone system just shut down. I'm sorry. Callers are going to have to call back in. I've never seen that happen before.
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:38.720]  My phone system just said idle and hung up on everybody. So that's too bad. We'll go to break here.
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:43.720]  I don't have any audio either going out to break something going on. All right.
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:49.720]  Okay, we're going to be right back after this break with if you got hung up on, please nobody else call.
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:57.720]  Just if you're a listener who got hung up on 800-259-9231, we'll try to get you back up on the system.
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:01.720]  I apologize that phone system had a little bit of a hiccup over there.

[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:36.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:42.720]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:45.720]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:56.720]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:16.720]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:26.720]  Okay, let's go back to your calls and then when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to break down this little hit piece.
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:37.720]  It's multifaceted from the Corbett report last night against yours truly and others, another masterpiece and misrepresentation, but it is funny.
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:42.720]  Right now, let's go to Otter in Mass. Otter, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:55.720]  Okay, you surprised me there because we got disconnected and blame there you are. Well, hello human being and Patriot and bless you.
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:04.720]  I just there's just so much information coming down and I am amazed at the prescience that you exhibit.
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:13.720]  You are so focused on all of this that I get on the phone and I think I'm going to say X, Y, or Z and you say it while I'm sitting here waiting.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:25.720]  So ditto to everything that's been going on a while back and you mentioned just recently about the actually a caller called in about the RT report and you haven't gotten back to it,
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.720]  but the Russian ship going up and then blaming us, etc.
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:38.720]  It only makes sense. Of course, we would do something like that because, you know, everything's got to be under the thumb.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:45.720]  You know, we've got to show them that we isn't necessarily the United States.
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  I think one of the things that I'd like to say is that there are sovereign nations within this country and yes, all the trees have been broken forever.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:08.720]  If you go back a couple decades ago, you'll find a Mohawk reserve half in New York, quarter in Ontario, quarter in Quebec and the progressives decided to build casinos.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:18.720]  You go to someone like Russell Means site and you'll see that the statistics of cancer and alcoholism and suicide, etc, etc.
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:31.720]  And of course, yes, the BIA has got its thumb on these, but they are sovereign. And if you look at MSM, you'll see footage from spring of several decades ago.
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:39.720]  You'll see someone on the west end of the blockade because the traditionalists said, no, gambling is not right.
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:49.720]  And we're not going to have this and all of the detriments that come with it fall upon us.
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:57.720]  Well, all over the United States, they're trying to give national ID cards through Homeland Security to the Navajo and others.
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:00.720]  And it's just a terrible, absolutely terrible idea.
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:06.720]  But you're right, there are sovereign nations within this country and within Canada and the sterilization of natives, all of it.
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:13.720]  Everything you see practiced on Native Americans is the model, admittedly, of the New World Order.
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:23.720]  Hitler's concentration camp model was off of the reservation model here, the Jewish ghettos in Prague, all of it.
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.720]  Great points. Good to hear from you. Appreciate you calling in, Otter. Always great to hear from you.
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:32.720]  Let's go ahead. And who's been holding the longest once we got the phone systems back up?
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:36.720]  Ryan in California, you're on the air, then Lyndon and others. Go ahead.
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:42.720]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to let you know the Sublime album with Rome.
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:50.720]  If you look at the album cover, you'll see the all seeing eye and there's colors, purple, yellow and green.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.720]  That means something. And I looked up the article on the guy who designed this album cover.
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:03.720]  And I thought, because I like the band and everything, I thought, oh, it's the Illuminati, you know, going to mess with my mind or whatever.
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:09.720]  But if you listen to it, the first long panic, it talks about the bankers and the globalists.
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:14.720]  Yeah, well, just because somebody puts pyramids and all seeing eyes on something doesn't mean they support it.
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.720]  That's like Rick Linkletter made a scanner darkly off Philip K. Dick's book.
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:23.720]  I was a consultant on it. I was in it, worked with Tommy Pallotta, you know, some.
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:31.720]  I mean, I'm honored a little bit. I contributed and some of the scenes, they're openly wearing Illuminati symbols and talking about it.
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:37.720]  It's not subliminal. They're exposing the government dealing drugs and that it's the Illuminati.
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:39.720]  And people are like, that's an Illuminati movie.
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:49.720]  It's like we today put up a graphic of like, you know, these robots running the matrix and it's like a pinball machine with all seeing eyes.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.720]  We're pointing out that's who runs it. That's the system we're going towards.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.720]  It's not, it's not that exactly. I mean, you've hit the nail on the head again.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:08.720]  Yeah, yeah, you're right, too, because I started listening to the music and on it, the panic is talking about like the gold globalists, the bankers and saying,
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:14.720]  don't you wish your worth is your money or along those lines? I don't memorize it by heart yet.
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:24.720]  Yeah, well, listen, I mean, popular music, as I scan through all of it, all the popular music, whether it's hip hop, country music, rock and roll,
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:32.720]  all the new stuff is, it's not just muse. It's not just rush. It's everything.
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:40.720]  I mean, everywhere it's anti-New World Order, anti-globalist, anti-corruption, revolution calling, revolution calling.
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:48.720]  I mean, the people are waking up and that's manifest through the art. The globalists are not in control. They're scared.
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:16.720]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:21.720]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:28.720]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:31.720]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:38.720]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:42.720]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:46.720]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:54.720]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:31:00.720]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America3.com.
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:05.720]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:14.720]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:19.720]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:30.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:35.720]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:40.720]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:45.720]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:53.720]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:32:00.720]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:28.720]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:35.720]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:41.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:48.720]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:53.720]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:33:18.720]  We're watching online right now in Super High Quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:25.720]  A piece of propaganda from Comedy Central in a moment, then I'll get to this short clip.
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:35.720]  A Bruce Fine breaking down how despotism operates and why people in government follow orders that are clearly illegal, unconstitutional and criminal.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:41.720]  That's all coming up and then some more news, but to anxious Greeks emptying their bank accounts.
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:52.720]  Many Greeks are draining their savings accounts because they are out of work, face rising taxes, or are afraid the country will be forced to leave the Eurozone.
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:34:01.720]  By withdrawing money, they're forcing banks to scale back their lending and are inadvertently making the recession even worse, which is what the IMF plan calls for.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:07.720]  Then the riots happen, then total confidence is destroyed, and the bankers come in and buy it up.
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:18.720]  I remember when Steve Forbes three or four months ago was over in Greece and Max Kaiser ran into him and Steve Forbes knew Max and said, it's great.
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:20.720]  You ought to come into the meetings with us.
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:22.720]  We're going to buy everything up for pennies in the dollar.
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.720]  This is awesome.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:26.720]  That's how arrogant they are.
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.720]  I actually ran into Steve Forbes one time at a hotel too.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:34.720]  That guy must be all over the place in Dallas.
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:46.720]  I'm walking up to my room. It was like 15 years ago and I was up there visiting a girlfriend's where I met my wife and I'm walking up.
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:48.720]  It's like right across the Steve Forbes.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:50.720]  I'm like Steve Forbes.
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:51.720]  It didn't matter.
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:53.720]  Boy, he's an ugly little creature in person.
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:54.720]  I don't usually go off looks.
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:56.720]  I don't care, but he was just like a rat.
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.720]  He was like a demonic rat or something.
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:01.720]  It looks like his face was run over by a lawnmower.
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:03.720]  Okay, I'm sorry I'm being mean and I shouldn't be.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.720]  Just another globalist and I'm sick of all of them.
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:17.720]  Now, we are carrying a new film that I am in and that I can say conservatively is the best and only modern film about the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:24.720]  And the reason this is important is because the globalist are been hyping staging new terror attacks.
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:32.720]  You've seen White House advisors like Robert Shapiro and the Financial Times of London and others talk about there needs to be a new Oklahoma City to blame.
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:41.720]  Libertarians and conservatives and to sick Homeland Security on domestic groups and for Obama to pose as a savior.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:48.720]  Now, even if Obama was to be thrown out of office, the next president may do this as well because Homeland Security is for the American people.
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:50.720]  It is the new film.
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:52.720]  We just got it in.
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.720]  And if you order it by the 19th, it will be shipped to you by Christmas.
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:02.720]  So everybody should get a noble lie.
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:04.720]  Oklahoma City 1995.
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:08.720]  That's what insiders call stage terror attacks is a noble lie.
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:14.720]  We did this because the radical domestic groups are getting in the way of our utopian collectivist control freak eugenics.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:15.720]  New World Order.
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:17.720]  So we'll blow it up and blame them.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:20.720]  And it's an incredible film with eyewitnesses with victims.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:21.720]  Jane Graham, you name it.
[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:23.720]  The wife of Terrence Yakey.
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:25.720]  Only interview ever.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:27.720]  Saved all the people saw the ATF involved.
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:28.720]  They murdered him.
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:29.720]  Good.
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:30.720]  It's got the grandeur.
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:33.720]  Happy Heidelberg, the head grandeur, all of them.
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:35.720]  In fact, I can show you the back of it here.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:37.720]  If we document cam shot it.
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.720]  The point is, is that this is the only modern definitive and it's got incredible high def archival footage.
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.720]  I've never seen before.
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:47.720]  Just amazing.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:52.720]  In 1995, the bombing of Oklahoma City was a direct blow to the heart of America.
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.720]  168 people were killed, including 19 children.
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:01.720]  For those watching the nightly news, terrorism had come home for years.
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:09.720]  Following the bombing, countless victims, family members, survivors, rescuers and ordinary Americans have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:23.720]  Helping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored both by prominent media outlets in the U.S. government, a noble lie peels back what we thought we knew about the bombing and its perpetrators.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.720]  The film exposes information never before examined are brought to the attention of the American public.
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:34.720]  A noble lie is the culmination of years of research and how Bill Clinton did it, by the way.
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:47.720]  This is the way to wake up conservatives about government-sponsored terror and research and documentation conducted by independent journalists, scholars and ordinary citizens, often risking their personal safety and sanity.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:55.720]  They have gathered evidence which threatens to expose the startling reality of what exactly occurred at 9.02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, Oklahoma City.
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:04.720]  Utilizing footage and eyewitness testimony, previously unseen noble lie will change forever the way you look at the true nature of terrorism.
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:07.720]  And I consulted a bit on this film and was also interviewed for it.
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:15.720]  It is powerful. It is the only modern film that were a few made the year after it happened that were excellent and exposed it.
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:25.720]  I have a chapter in Road to Tyranny about it that is extremely powerful. It is only about 30 minutes. This is a full-length film with expanded extras with the latest info.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:34.720]  This proves it was a government-sponsored terror attack and it proves the motive who did it, names, names. It is a very dangerous film.
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:43.720]  A noble lie, interviewing the directors and people that were involved in it off and off the next few weeks, they rushed to get this out, but they took their time.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:46.720]  It took them years to do it and they finally rushed to get it out here.
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:49.720]  I have been working on this at least two years and I know of.
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:56.720]  So get it today, infowars.com, pre-order now.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:07.720]  It officially comes out next week and it will start shipping, but I have been authorized to start shipping these as early as Friday.
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:19.720]  Here it is, a noble lie, Oklahoma City, 1995, perfect to give to friends and family, the gift of awakening, available at infowars.com.
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:32.720]  Or you can simply call 888-253-3139 or you can also get all 18 of my films on DVD and get all your Christmas shopping done in one whack.
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:38.720]  For $99.95, we've never offered anything even close to that and it comes with bumper stickers and citizen rollbooks.
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:45.720]  Again, infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.720]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let me now shift gears.
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:57.720]  Right as I went live today, Tim Fruget ran up here and said, you were on the Colbert Report last night on Comedy Central.
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:05.720]  And been there, done that. They've talked about me on there before, I've been on the view, Nightline, Jay Leno's talked about us, whatever.
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:08.720]  The mainstream media are legends in their own minds.
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:15.720]  But when I started watching and it was so funny, I died laughing and couldn't quit as I went live on air.
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:21.720]  I think I was laughing and then realized I couldn't stifle it, it was going to look crazy when I went on air.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:30.720]  So I just said, go ahead and take me on air laughing. It'd be the only way to explain either why I didn't make it on air or why I had tears in my eyes when they went live.
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:36.720]  Because it was so funny, it shows it says, oh, the evil of the Denver Airport.
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:43.720]  And then it cuts to an old lady who's a greeter with brochures there and a cowboy hat saying, hi, welcome to Denver International Airport.
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:49.720]  And then she turns into like a reptoid vampire and that just set me off in some of the other scenes.
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:53.720]  I haven't even watched all this yet. This piece from the Cobare Report.
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.720]  We're not going to play at all because it gets into, you know, making fun of conspiracy theorists.
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:03.720]  Oh, look, there's obelisk at the airport. Yeah, and the God of Nubis and all this Egyptian stuff there.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.720]  At least last time I was there.
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:12.720]  And, you know, we do point out that it's phallic symbols of the male God and the domes of the breast of the female, the God and the goddess.
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.720]  I mean, this is all admitted. We have a myth or a cult basically running things.
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:23.720]  I had history channel here just last week, taping five episodes of what's the name of the show.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:28.720]  I don't even give the name of the schedule. It comes out. The point is, is that this is real.
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:33.720]  But what they do in this piece, at least the first couple of minutes I watched, I don't have time to watch the whole thing.
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.720]  We're going to watch it now together and analyze it and critique it as fair use is looking at it.
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:49.720]  It's like 2012 end of the world. And then they cut to Jesse Ventura, myself and others and imply that we're saying there's an end of the world.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:58.720]  Or if we talk about Illuminati iconography and symbolism and archetypes, we're saying a scene of the world.
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:08.720]  And guaranteed when 2012 comes and goes, I'm tempted to churn a film out because I started one and then never released it on 2012 and how it's a hoax.
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:13.720]  Because it's such a deception. It's such a scam. It's going to come. It's going to go.
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:16.720]  But things are going to be crazy because the globalists have timed it all out.
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.720]  They have done the whole 2012 hoax because they know a lot of people are agnostics or atheists.
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:29.720]  But they want you to have the same false Christian doctrine that it's the end of the world every week so nobody ever gets politically involved or fights corruption.
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:34.720]  Oh, it's the rapture next week. Why should I care? You know, that cop out.
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:40.720]  Well, even if it is, you're still your duty to expose corruption. I hear mainline Christians. Oh, praise God.
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:44.720]  The government wants to put microchip sentence. That means Jesus will soon return.
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:48.720]  My Bible says you go through the tribulation. God defeats the devil.
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:53.720]  The archangel ties up the devil and the chains and then the people are raised from the dead.
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:57.720]  But whatever. Regardless, let's not even get into religion here.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:06.720]  The point is they want a secular version of it's the end of the world. Why be involved? And that's what the whole fake New Age 2012 thing is.
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:13.720]  The Mayans thought that the world was on the back of an alligator or a crocodile.
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.720]  The Mayans said that a new hearth is lit at 2012. The Mayans hadn't invented the wheel.
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:25.720]  They were certainly interesting and took a lot of hallucinogens and tortured themselves while they did and human sacrifice.
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:31.720]  Again, it's all just Timothy Leary asked New World Order stuff from the 60s and 70s.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:39.720]  Kind of a missionary at protectorate or gone conclusion, self-fulfilling prophecy that you can't do anything at the end of the world.
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.720]  And that's what 2012 is. It's a big cop out.
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:49.720]  But there's going to be the added fraud of that I am then going to be blamed when it doesn't end.
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:53.720]  Okay, I've never said it's the end of the world. I've never said that's going to happen.
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:44:00.720]  They can release a bioweapon, a nanotech system, they can have a nuclear war and end our civilization.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.720]  That could happen, CERN could do something, but that's not being discussed.
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:07.720]  It's all into the world, self-fulfilling. And it is the end of the world as we know it.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:12.720]  The world government's forming. The Age of Aquarius, the Illuminati, it's all happening.
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:18.720]  The overthrow of the system that New Genres talks about, it's here.
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:25.720]  And so they just mix it in there that you're all a bunch of crazies, you think old women are reptoid lizards, if you question it.
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:30.720]  And so I'm going to play parts of it and then stop it and start it and analyze it here right now.
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.720]  Because it's very informative to, again, learn their different tricks of propaganda.
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:41.720]  Here it is from last night. The 2012.
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:48.720]  But how exactly will the End Times end? This is...
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:54.720]  So there's your Loch Ness monsters.
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:01.720]  Mysteries of the Ancient Unknown. 2012. End of Times.
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:07.720]  America. Long Macy wave. But how long?
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.720]  When the End Times come, the last words you hear just may be...
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.720]  Welcome to Denver International Airport.
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:19.720]  Hit pause. Hit pause.
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:25.720]  Okay, they don't show you any of the serious murals or they don't show you the serious pyramids and anubis and obelis.
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:28.720]  They just make fun of everybody and have the lady turn into a creature.
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:33.720]  So again, America. Long Macy wave. The globalists are killing America.
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.720]  They are killing the private property bill of rights constitution.
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.720]  But see, they're implying that all these people say America's dead, how dare them.
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:46.720]  That's why that old guy at the Grand Canyon, when I was pointing out the UN sign, got real mad and told me to basically shut up.
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:52.720]  He didn't like hearing about it. You see, I'm the one hurting America, actually pointing out that the banks are taking it over through fraud.
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:58.720]  So we've just seen the old woman turn into a goblin. Now let's go to the next clip.
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:09.720]  Denver International Airport. It may look like a transportation hub, but conspiracy experts have long speculated that there's something more sinister going on.
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:12.720]  There's a lot of strange things about this airport.
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:15.720]  Secret bunkers built for a 2012 apocalypse.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:21.720]  To bring Americans in on aircraft, disappear underground into prisons and execution centers.
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:24.720]  Denver Airport's runways have resembled Nazi swastika.
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:28.720]  Many believe it's being used for government coverup.
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.720]  Super creepy. What the hell is this?
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:34.720]  What the hell indeed.
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:37.720]  All right, pause. Hit the hit pause.
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:43.720]  Now, Colorado is the designated backup for Congress after Camp David.
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:50.720]  There's giant underground bases all over the place, publicly there. Cheyenne Mountains there, North comm is based there.
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:47:00.720]  They've had giant building equipment, and I've talked to some of the construction people who won't come on air, of course, but they've been on record here on the show disguising their voices years ago.
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:05.720]  Yeah, there's underground stuff. They use different crews. The dirt piles up and is hauled away.
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:13.720]  It's a giant facility. There's COG bases all over the place, and they just make a big joke out of it.
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:22.720]  And it's got weird murals of, like, Nazis chopping up children and stuff, and weird Masonic stuff, and weird pyramids and obelisk.
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:26.720]  But see, we're the nuts for talking about it. Let's continue.
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:32.720]  All of these theories can be true, so we went to find out what's the real story here.
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:37.720]  The real story here at Denver International Airport is we're an airport.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:43.720]  This is airport spokesman Jack Green.
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:47.720]  He doesn't want you to know what's really going on here.
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:53.720]  What's really going on here at the airport is we are operating flights in and out on a daily basis.
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:56.720]  We're operating just like any normal airport.
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:47:59.720]  And...
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:00.720]  And...
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:02.720]  Anything else?
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:04.720]  Nope, that's it.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:09.720]  Strange art. Mysterious architecture.
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:13.720]  Science. What is going on here at Denver?
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:19.720]  Again, it's on record that they're training the military, particularly in Colorado, to take on the American people,
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:27.720]  to suspend Congress under Bush's executive order that Obama continued to do all of this,
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:34.720]  to admittedly, I've seen it in the Rocky Mountain News before they went bankrupt, and the Denver Post that
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.720]  they bought a bunch of multi-million dollar incinerators for during plagues.
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  They've got giant federal processing center in Oklahoma where they fly prisoners for all over the country.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:50.720]  They've got all sorts of weird drills that go on in Denver and at the airport for mass arrest.
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:56.720]  This is all admitted. I have articles today about them listing protesters as terrorists.
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:01.720]  And mobile cells, all of this, but we're all just crazy cooks.
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:05.720]  You know, they point at a men's bathroom sign and say, and there's signs.
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.720]  You know what? There's a big deal at Denver Airport because people know what's going on there.
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:15.720]  And they know what's going on at Colorado Springs, 30, 40 miles down the road.
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.720]  There are underground bases. It's on record. Let's go back to the clip.
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:25.720]  No one has been able to crack the code until now.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:33.720]  William Tapley is a sweet 72-year-old man who loves the outdoors, working in his garden,
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:36.720]  and exposing the truth.
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.720]  So while others spout crackpot theories about aliens and hidden bunkers,
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:44.720]  William Tapley has discovered the answer that would...
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:48.720]  Did pause. Well, they talk about aliens and they cut to me.
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  I don't talk about aliens. Everybody knows that.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.720]  They put the camera on me, Alex Jones, and say aliens.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:01.720]  And then they cut to this guy who says that there's phallic symbols and then don't show you what he's talking about.
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:04.720]  They've got obelisk all over the stinking thing.
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:10.720]  They've got giant 60-foot Egyptian gods. I shot video of it when I flew out to Hardin, Montana.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:13.720]  Go ahead and finish the part about the phallic symbols. Here it is.
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:16.720]  In our face the whole time.
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:18.720]  Phallic symbols.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.720]  You know, I see an awful lot of phallic images in the Denver airport.
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:26.720]  In fact, I'm accused that I see them everywhere. And believe me, I don't.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  Phallic symbols. Phallic symbols. Phallic. Phallic. Phallic. Phallic shapes. Phallic.
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:35.720]  Somebody's butt. Phallic symbols. Phallic workers. Phallus.
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:37.720]  That's enough. That's enough.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.720]  And it is true. The globalists are nuts reporting on what they do is crazy.
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.720]  I mean, what do you think the Washington Monument is?
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:49.720]  On record, it's George Washington's. It's incredible.
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:54.720]  Oh man, what a hit piece.
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:51:16.720]  No way. I don't talk about UFOs. So they're trying to discredit us. We'll be right back.
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:27.720]  It will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[02:51:27.720 --> 02:51:36.720]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:41.720]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.

[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:18.720]  The Supertuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:21.720]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:35.720]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:56.720]  16 kicks later, and the Door Sentinel is still holding strong.
[02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:06.720]  CrossbreedHolsters.com. That's MySafeDoor.com
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  I just had to laugh.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:38.720]  I saw the photograph.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:44.720]  He blew his mind out in a car.
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:48.720]  He didn't notice that the lights were shining.
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:51.720]  Alright, it's the final segment. I didn't get to the British Fine video.
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.720]  I'll try to play it tomorrow.
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:59.720]  We've got some big guests coming up in the week.
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:02.720]  I'll just leave it at that. I've got some really bad news here.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:07.720]  Reuters reports that in San Antonio, Texas, that's just south of me,
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:12.720]  a woman denied food stamps kills herself, shoots children.
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:18.720]  Now, roughly 7 million people were reported to have starved to death
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:23.720]  and died of complications from malnutrition during the 10 years of the Great Depression.
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:26.720]  A major university studies show you can look them up.
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:30.720]  That's when 90% of the public was somewhat self-sufficient and rural,
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:33.720]  or had rural self-sufficiency skills.
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:39.720]  Now those numbers are flipped. Right at 90%, some studies show 91,
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:44.720]  are urban and don't know how to basically tie their own shoelaces.
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:49.720]  When society collapses and it's designed to, that's the globalist stated goal.
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:52.720]  Things aren't going to get better with Newt Gennrich,
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:55.720]  because he doesn't want them to get better, or with Al Gore,
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:58.720]  or with any of these criminals, or with Obama.
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:01.720]  That's what I keep explaining to people. Government isn't idiots.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:05.720]  They're not morons. They know what they're doing.
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:10.720]  They want to totally collapse our society so they can come back as the saviors and re-engineer it.
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:13.720]  That's how they plan to finally get the guns.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:17.720]  Ask yourself, how would tyrants take over how they're doing it?
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:20.720]  And they do this incrementally, testing every stage of it to make sure
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:23.720]  that they've got everybody properly brainwashed.
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:27.720]  A woman in the border city of Laredo, Texas, the article's out of San Antonio,
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:30.720]  who was angry because she had been denied food stamps, killed herself,
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:33.720]  and shot and critically wounded her two children.
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:36.720]  What a scumbag should have given the children to family.
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:40.720]  A 38-year-old woman entered the Texas Health and Human Services Commission office
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  downtown Laredo on Monday afternoon and demanded to speak to a supervisor.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:48.720]  An investigator, Joe Bazia of the Laredo Police Department said,
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:51.720]  and it just goes on that she shot herself and the children.
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:54.720]  But don't worry, a SWAT team managed to evacuate the people.
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.720]  I love these articles where when somebody's attacking something,
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:00.720]  they lock it down so you can't get out.
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.720]  The Greeks are taking their money out of the banks. It's already starting here.
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:06.720]  I mean, this is not going to be pretty.
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:09.720]  We're in a depression, but the media keeps telling you everything's fine.
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:11.720]  Now, here's the even bigger news.
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:14.720]  China's who urges Navy to prepare for combat.
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  This just came out minutes ago.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:21.720]  What was Wayne Madsen talking about?
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:24.720]  The so-called U.S. military, that's the occupied U.S. military.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:28.720]  The globalist-controlled hijacked military is starting to circle around China
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:30.720]  and trying to cut off their oil in Iran.
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  You're like, why do they want to do that?
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:36.720]  Why do these people always different empires start wars?
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  That's why they're an empire.
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:41.720]  And you're going to pay for it. I'm going to pay for it.
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.720]  In rights and money and in our good name,
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:48.720]  unless we get control of our government again.
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:51.720]  But the government list trying to get control of your government
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:55.720]  is some type of terrorist action when it couldn't be more American.
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:58:02.720]  Chinese President Hu Jintao today urged the Navy to prepare for military combat
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:05.720]  and growing regional tensions over maritime disputes
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:09.720]  in a U.S. campaign to assert itself as a Pacific power.
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:11.720]  Yeah, U.S. campaign.
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:18.720]  Moving military bases into Aussie land.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:21.720]  The Navy should accelerate its transformation and modernization
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:25.720]  in a sturdy way and make extended preparations for military combat
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:28.720]  in order to make greater contributions to safeguard national security.
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:31.720]  That is the Communist Party.
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:33.720]  Addressing the powerful Central Military Commission,
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:35.720]  he said, it just goes on.
[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:37.720]  Prepare for war with the U.S.
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.720]  But the TSA is busy grabbing our genitals.
[02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:41.720]  See you back tonight.
[02:58:41.720 --> 02:58:42.720]  7 o'clock.
[02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:44.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:48.720]  Get the video, the film, a number live at infowars.com.
[02:58:48.720 --> 02:59:04.720]  They're going quick.
