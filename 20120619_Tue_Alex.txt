[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:35.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones

[00:49.400 --> 00:56.120]  author Daniel Estolin will be joining us you know Daniel Estolin got invited
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.920]  after he wrote a book on Bilderberg to Cuba to talk to Fidel Castro a few years
[01:01.920 --> 01:09.160]  ago and I was so hyped up whenever I was running around like a piranha a land
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.720]  piranha at the Bilderberg meeting foaming at the mouth the covering things
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.640]  that when I had him on the show he was in Spain I was in Virginia and walking
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.880]  along the street protesting you had a love technology while I interviewed him
[01:22.880 --> 01:26.600]  but I never brought that up but that's not why he's joining us that just popped
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.080]  in my head as I was about to tell you that he was coming up in the second
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.120]  hour Daniels never contacted us to come on we always contact him to come on but
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.280]  he contacted us because he's got such big news he's he wants to break here on
[01:40.280 --> 01:47.080]  Bilderberg so Daniel Estolin from Spain a guy in Europe more than anybody who's
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.560]  exposed Bilderberg it's Jim Tucker and myself now here in the United States and
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.440]  of course Matt drudge of drudgereport.com has really helped break that
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.720]  damn completely down but he's got sources inside Bilderberg in fact one of
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.760]  his sources just separately he probably doesn't know I know this I discovered
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.880]  who one of his sources is but I'll just I'll just leave it at that just very
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.720]  very interesting that is coming up in the second hour I've got a huge amount of
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.560]  it very important news the good news is down in Rio where they've started the
[02:19.560 --> 02:24.720]  big UN world government conference women in mass are protesting the green
[02:24.720 --> 02:32.720]  economy and austerity saying it will destroy their country so all over South
[02:32.720 --> 02:39.640]  America in Argentina and Brazil and other areas people are really getting it
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.040]  down there in fact my radio show is extremely popular down there I know
[02:44.040 --> 02:48.280]  routinely because I see copies of it online and I mailed copies of it I love
[02:48.280 --> 02:54.280]  Latin America they don't ask they just take info wars.com and prisonplena.com
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.080]  articles plus it's well known that I authorized that I want my info out I
[02:58.080 --> 03:02.280]  want it to be republished as long as you don't alter it that's that's that's
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.720]  what I reserve copyright on and they publish our articles in Latin America
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.000]  as the point and they know what's going on and they're like no thank you we we're
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.040]  suing Monsanto over their GMO crops we're suing over pesticide we're suing
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.040]  over real issues we don't want to have our carbon dioxide output taxed thank you
[03:23.040 --> 03:30.520]  very much we've got what Mark Moreno is tomorrow from that event of climate
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.960]  depot.com and then we've got Lord Moncton on Friday if he hasn't been
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.160]  beaten up or arrested as this happened repeatedly he's been blocked out of the
[03:38.160 --> 03:44.320]  conferences he was in South Africa late last year and had to parachute in to the
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.840]  controlled area kind of like G20 they locked down a large area of Durban he
[03:48.840 --> 03:54.000]  parachuted in and then they backed off at that point because they realized that
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.120]  arresting him would be a big issue he's just something else you got to love him
[03:58.120 --> 04:04.440]  what a character so that is coming up here on the broadcast speaking of Drudge
[04:04.440 --> 04:09.000]  Report this story is up at DrudgeReport.com we covered it yesterday but
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.800]  it dovetails with another article out of Business Insider leaked Microsoft
[04:13.800 --> 04:17.880]  master plan to take over the living room with a new Xbox well that's always been
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.840]  their plan and their connect system on record spies on you in your home but

[04:35.720 --> 04:40.440]  call everyone will get the supreme leaders break in and then it'll be
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.120]  phased in to be local police as well so anything you see in a science fiction
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.520]  dystopian movie or novel the globalist are adopting it saying that's a good
[04:49.520 --> 04:54.840]  idea by the way they're back promoting taser bracelets for all who fly but the

[08:18.040 --> 08:22.200]  incredibly important worldwide transmission lined up for you today
[08:22.200 --> 08:28.600]  thank you so much for joining us coming up from Spain Daniel Estlund investigative
[08:28.600 --> 08:33.960]  journalist has big breaking news so big he actually contacted our office
[08:33.960 --> 08:36.560]  something he's never done wanting to get on the show we've normally got a
[08:36.560 --> 08:40.120]  twist his arm on the coming on because he likes to write instead of really
[08:40.120 --> 08:44.840]  doing interviews but he's got big breaking Bilderberg news for us dealing
[08:44.840 --> 08:48.600]  with the globalist and some of their plans and I do know for a fact he has
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.520]  multiple Bilderberg sources because separately through my Hollywood connections
[08:52.520 --> 08:58.080]  I was able to discover who one of them is I'll just leave it at that also Larry
[08:58.080 --> 09:03.480]  Summers has come out and talked about a total catastrophe globally well sure the
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.080]  globalist are engineering that but they want to milk each country bailout after
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.160]  bailout always promising that this bailout will fix the global economy
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.120]  whether it's in Ireland or Greece or Spain or Italy or the United States or
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.400]  England they're not bailouts they're direct taxes to the six megabanks that
[09:22.400 --> 09:28.440]  issue the currency and credit of the world G20 summit Baroso blames Eurozone
[09:28.440 --> 09:35.120]  crisis on US banks and on the American people and demands a stronger Euro and
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.640]  that's always been the plan they're going to collapse the old Euro and bring
[09:38.640 --> 09:41.960]  the people into the new dictatorial one and that's their own words I mean this
[09:41.960 --> 09:45.480]  is out in the open look I can't stand Barack Obama we're going to be
[09:45.480 --> 09:49.920]  exposing him he needs to be politically destroyed and not just sail off into the
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.960]  sunset he needs to be punished that said it's clear the political winds are
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.800]  turning against Mr. Obama political reports Kissinger headlines Romney
[10:00.800 --> 10:07.280]  event of course he also headlined four years ago a Sarah Palin event so that
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.040]  doesn't necessarily mean anything but you add it together with this at the
[10:11.040 --> 10:16.080]  party Bloomberg tips hand on endorsement New York Times oh yes it's a leak no it's
[10:16.080 --> 10:23.000]  it's on purpose obviously a saying that he thinks Mitt Romney is better not a
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.280]  good sign when Bloomberg likes you a guy that wants to ban civilian ownership of
[10:26.280 --> 10:32.120]  firearms a guy by the way other states I saw in the news today are following suit
[10:32.120 --> 10:38.480]  and other cities as well to ban soft drinks popcorn milk products I mean
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.040]  government literally in your bathroom in your toilet telling you which size
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.760]  toilet you can have in your light bulbs in your computer watching listening to
[10:48.760 --> 10:55.080]  you Google driving around with tech snorkels sticking up stealing passcodes
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.320]  and downloading everyone's info I mean it's beyond 1984 and they're just getting
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.080]  started but see what's happening here is there's two parallels because there's
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.440]  been so much liberty and freedom in this country in our history and I'm gonna
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.840]  talk about this more later today it's so important that there's good running in
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.560]  parallel to evil there's different train tracks and so we still exercise the
[11:18.560 --> 11:21.360]  First Amendment we still have the Second Amendment we still have property rights
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.080]  to a certain extent we still have parental rights and there is a battle over
[11:25.080 --> 11:30.640]  every millimeter with the power structure with the TSA and its federal
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.320]  power grab and its attempt to break us and now rolling out on the streets and
[11:34.320 --> 11:41.280]  and drones and wars and checkpoints and all the new taxes and regulations and
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.960]  surveillance and prisons and government shipping drugs in with major
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.360]  corporations to destabilize the country and corrupt police our country's like a
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.640]  nervous system forget the government but the people the culture and it's it's
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.320]  under constant bombardment just as we are individually with propaganda with
[12:01.320 --> 12:08.040]  chemicals biologicals radiologicals the GMO the aspartame the additives the
[12:08.040 --> 12:15.440]  globalist favorite saying is as above so below what you see writ large on the
[12:15.440 --> 12:22.320]  universe is also writ tiny in the very makeup of matter and so everything you
[12:22.320 --> 12:28.280]  see on the mass scale is going on on the tiny scale against you and your family
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.800]  we're gonna be breaking that down so it's a struggle they don't have world
[12:31.800 --> 12:35.040]  government yet they're in control of the money in control of most the
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.880]  governments but there's still too much free human activity going on and they
[12:38.880 --> 12:43.200]  can't move out in the open against the Second Amendment at least until now
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.880]  because people have refused to budge and understand what it's all about they're
[12:47.880 --> 12:51.720]  losing their fight pushing abortion worldwide they're losing their fight
[12:51.720 --> 12:55.280]  worldwide on vaccinating people are learning about that they're losing
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.360]  their fight pushing GMO they're losing their fight but they're losing it
[13:00.360 --> 13:04.120]  intellectually and in the court of public opinion cars with a 9% approval
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.640]  rating some of the parliaments of Europe have even lower than 9% but the
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.480]  but the system we're in a paradox best of times worst of times because the
[13:14.480 --> 13:21.160]  system is still just going full tilt against us it's still just rolling out
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.800]  it's attacked even though we're awake now we've got some big activism first and
[13:26.800 --> 13:29.600]  I'm going to explain why we're doing this some more detail after the break but
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.560]  taking us into the break this article and video is posted right now red linked
[13:34.560 --> 13:40.760]  at the top of info wars comm and featured news explosive activism stop
[13:40.760 --> 13:47.480]  Obama dictator contest and the point is his office is being turned into an
[13:47.480 --> 13:53.240]  executive dictatorship so I'm calling for everyone to take action with this
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.680]  contest and if everyone does it I'm going to do it myself today or tomorrow
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.920]  I've just got so much to do but I'm gonna get done to dare tomorrow I'm gonna go
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.320]  out and hang these posters up all over Austin if our listeners if everyone
[14:06.320 --> 14:10.040]  listening hangs up at least a few of these and legal and lawful commons
[14:10.040 --> 14:15.640]  areas or hands out a bunch it is going to have a huge response I'll explain why
[14:15.640 --> 14:21.360]  coming up but here is the video and audio for radio and TV viewers it's a
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.040]  titled stop Obama dictator contest here it is
[14:30.960 --> 14:36.120]  America is starting to wake up to the fact that Barack Obama is becoming a
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.120]  dictator you know about him launching wars and Libya Syria and other areas and
[14:42.120 --> 14:45.680]  when Congress comes to him and says you've got to get authorization from us
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.480]  under the law under the Constitution he says no I don't because I have the UN
[14:50.480 --> 14:57.280]  and NATO that is treason Obama has been having the ATF put in new anti-gun
[14:57.280 --> 15:03.160]  regulations outside of law now the ATF talking about banning most shotguns
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.440]  with a new regulation ladies and gentlemen it's time to stand up to
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.800]  Barack Obama and let him know and let the prostitute accomplice collaborator
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.960]  media know that America is waking up and will not put up with this type of
[15:18.960 --> 15:25.160]  executive abuse the latest outrage Obama came out last Friday and he said
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.680]  I'm gonna legalize 80,000 illegal aliens to begin with because I can't get
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.160]  Congress to pass the law just a few years before that he said that he'd like
[15:35.160 --> 15:38.840]  to act like a dictator but that he couldn't because the Constitution I
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.840]  know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own
[15:43.840 --> 15:49.280]  believe me the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting now he's saying
[15:49.280 --> 15:56.000]  he can do this if he wants to this is treason it is important to create a
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.440]  grassroots campaign to say no to this so we're doing something new to new

[18:06.480 --> 18:12.960]  demonized for it we have to identify that Obama is becoming a dictator because

[24:33.000 --> 24:38.880]  and making him dig up his dead wife you cannot make this up and remember this is
[24:38.880 --> 24:43.440]  the age where mega banks take houses that aren't even theirs that they don't
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.960]  even have deeds to that are actually paid for and were paid for in cash this
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.000]  is the criminality the sheriff is refusing to be part of it so the feds
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.560]  are getting ready to come after him we're gonna try to draw some attention to
[24:57.560 --> 25:01.120]  this thanks to Oathkeepers what Stuart Rhodes we have some clips of an interview

[25:36.320 --> 25:39.560]  next segment I'm gonna go through a bunch of news a holder agrees to meet with
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.920]  this how gracious of him Syria Iran Russia and China plan joint war games
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.920]  Iranian news agency reports we told you last week the Russian were sending
[25:49.920 --> 25:53.720]  Marines and ships then the media said it wasn't true now Russia confirms it's
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.840]  true McCain urges us led war in Syria that's raw story once boots on the
[25:59.840 --> 26:03.520]  ground big developments in Europe the design and
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.160]  explosion accelerates avoid a global catastrophe Larry Summers has written an
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.920]  article in the Washington Post saying give the bankers total control and just
[26:12.920 --> 26:16.560]  each time they get trillions more trillions more give us more power make
[26:16.560 --> 26:22.040]  us above the law make our carbon trading diplomatic immune worldwide just give
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.400]  us total power and we'll turn the economy back on are they doing that the
[26:27.400 --> 26:33.680]  answer is no I've also got a very important stack of technology news that
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.160]  we're gonna be breaking down but let me just stop there let me just stop there I
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.400]  put up this video well I shot the video yesterday afternoon Aaron edited it had
[26:42.400 --> 26:47.080]  it up but by yesterday evening and info wars.com and I right away noticed
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.400]  Obama supporters not web bots not fake Department of Justice or defense bots we
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.080]  can tell how those operate by watching them for years and the Pentagon admits
[26:56.080 --> 27:01.720]  they have those but actual Obama supporters because I would go look at
[27:01.720 --> 27:05.720]  their comment look at their channel last night this morning and they posting for
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.760]  years many of them are accomplished people it's their official channels and
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.760]  they're basically engaged in veiled threats that oh you'll get your butt
[27:14.760 --> 27:20.360]  kicked if you post to post your bat of Obama and oh you know you're not allowed
[27:20.360 --> 27:23.800]  to do that or oh you're gonna get arrested well not if it's in legal or
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.280]  lawful areas in and again they try to selectively enforce a law or claim a
[27:28.280 --> 27:32.960]  law doesn't exist if they've been hanging garage fell stuff on telephone
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.000]  polls for 20 years and nobody ever got a ticket for it well then that's up to
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.880]  your discretion at your own risk but I'm gonna be out hanging them up in
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.720]  commons areas I've checked the local laws and if it's in a you know commons
[27:43.720 --> 27:50.560]  area nobody gets tickets for that so I'm gonna go do it today or tomorrow I'm
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.280]  gonna hang up a bunch of Obama dictator posters in fact I need to go ahead and
[27:55.280 --> 27:58.640]  give the order to somebody in my tiny crew I'm like giving orders to people
[27:58.640 --> 28:02.120]  that don't exist we need to go ahead and get a bunch of these PDFs they got a
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.960]  bunch of these printed but I want to send them to a print shop and get some
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.560]  double size you know you know double what a regular page printout is and then
[28:10.560 --> 28:16.160]  a few hundred smaller ones and I'm gonna go out my shelf and hang up and stay
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.160]  up or tape up tomorrow probably tomorrow at the latest I'll do it
[28:21.160 --> 28:28.040]  Thursday but the point is we're doing this contest for a reason we're doing
[28:28.040 --> 28:30.960]  this to show the power of the people if they try to shut the web down with a
[28:30.960 --> 28:35.440]  fake cyber attack that could happen you know if the globalists do a false
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.000]  full flag they've talked about doing it they admit Obama has a kill switch or
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.040]  maybe Romney down the road you people need to know the power of going out and
[28:44.040 --> 28:49.400]  hanging up provocative posters like V for victory the French did against the
[28:49.400 --> 28:55.480]  Nazis or what our forebears did during the 1776 adventure and leading up to it
[28:55.480 --> 29:00.240]  and it's meant to be provocative Obama is launching wars that are illegal he is
[29:00.240 --> 29:04.720]  killing whole families with drones he is a murderer and I know he's a puppet but
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.720]  if I go hang up Henry Kissinger's image or David Rockefeller or somebody it
[29:09.720 --> 29:14.680]  won't get any media attention you got to go after their puppet and we did this
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.440]  three years ago with the Obama poster because another person hung up some
[29:18.440 --> 29:22.160]  Obama posters and they tried to arrest him so I said that's it we're going all
[29:22.160 --> 29:25.560]  the way and it was huge and they tried to come in people there but they they
[29:25.560 --> 29:28.560]  would call police and say arrest this person arrest that they couldn't because
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.240]  it's free speech as long as you don't put it on somebody's private property or
[29:32.240 --> 29:37.560]  don't put it on federal stuff you know like what do you call them post office
[29:37.560 --> 29:41.360]  boxes put it in the big commons area legal offal areas the side of your
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.240]  bar and whatever I'm gonna finish up with this when we come back folks trying
[29:45.240 --> 29:51.080]  to intimidate us straight ahead and in the news we're on the March the

[33:11.800 --> 33:17.880]  listening to the Alex Jones show I want to just say one little note here real
[33:17.880 --> 33:20.920]  fast for I forget to make it because it I've been thinking about the last few
[33:20.920 --> 33:28.200]  days I know why Rand Paul endorsed Mitt Romney I understand the political
[33:28.200 --> 33:32.640]  decision and I think Rand Paul is a great guy show is Ron Paul but he's not
[33:32.640 --> 33:36.840]  Ron Paul I mean that's true what Lou Rockwell and others have said but I
[33:36.840 --> 33:44.040]  understand the need and the desire to want to make things better and to
[33:44.040 --> 33:49.160]  project on to someone like Mitt Romney that that well maybe they're better than
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.720]  Obama because they were nice to me and because they sat in a room with me and
[33:53.720 --> 33:58.840]  said they agreed with me that abortions bad and agreed that the second
[33:58.840 --> 34:03.040]  amendments good the problem is Mitt Romney has always been against those
[34:03.040 --> 34:07.120]  things but maybe because he is a Republican I see the argument that he
[34:07.120 --> 34:13.040]  won't be able to go against those type of issues because of his constitution
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.280]  once won't let him I still think that's an overall naive view but but I was hurt
[34:18.280 --> 34:23.360]  at first and an angry at Ron Paul because now they've had campaign people
[34:23.360 --> 34:27.920]  come out and say in press releases I saw last night that yes of course Ron Paul
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.040]  helped coordinate that so you know don't be mad it ran because Ron's involved
[34:33.040 --> 34:37.960]  they're now using that well obviously Ron Paul was involved and I got mad at
[34:37.960 --> 34:42.200]  people lecturing me saying oh Ron Paul didn't know or Ron Paul's not involved
[34:42.200 --> 34:48.440]  give me a break okay and I know the polls are tired of running against the
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.560]  wind they're tired of of always trying like salmon to swim upstream but that's
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.440]  why Ron Paul's been so successful and stood out because he never compromised
[34:57.440 --> 35:02.400]  that's all I'm saying I get why they did it I understand it look Obama is so bad
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.320]  I described this myself that I have this thought process that oh maybe Mitt Romney
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.880]  is good but but then I'm like wait a minute wait a minute Alex pinch yourself
[35:11.880 --> 35:16.680]  you know that this is all part of a globalist operation I mean we've got
[35:16.680 --> 35:22.080]  Mayor Bloomberg now endorsing Mitt Romney and that isn't even saying that
[35:22.080 --> 35:28.480]  Mitt Romney's worse than Obama because somebody so bad like like mr. Tyrant and
[35:28.480 --> 35:35.640]  chief over New York Bloomberg is endorsing him that's happening because
[35:35.640 --> 35:41.080]  the elite are done with Obama he was never anybody he was a hush he was a
[35:41.080 --> 35:45.520]  front man he was a puppet just like all these other high-level politicians and
[35:45.520 --> 35:52.000]  that's what's sad because the process of compromising turns you into a puppet so
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.560]  I think it's good that we've let Ron Paul and Rand Paul and their media people
[35:55.560 --> 36:01.200]  know that we're upset but it shouldn't be something that demoralizes everybody
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.040]  I'm now had a week and a half to think about this now shifting gears why am I
[36:06.040 --> 36:10.720]  going up against Obama if he is politically like garbage that's to be
[36:10.720 --> 36:16.040]  taken out of the curb because he's not gone yet he could stage a terror attack
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.240]  as a lot of his top advisors have been telling him to do even though he's a
[36:19.240 --> 36:23.320]  puppet there are different factions of the power structure that are in the
[36:23.320 --> 36:26.840]  Democrat and Republican parties they may want to hold on to power like
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.040]  Clinton before the election in Oklahoma City and they've got all those
[36:31.040 --> 36:35.080]  fundraising letters and statements in the financial times of London by
[36:35.080 --> 36:42.200]  Shapiro and others about an Oklahoma City or 9-11 would really help us win the
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.720]  election and so some of their underlings or some of the minions of the system
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.320]  could do anything a fake assassination attempt that would give him probably 15
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.440]  points right through the election probably 30 or 40 at first for a week or
[36:55.440 --> 37:02.400]  so you know a sympathy vote of people just getting into the hype but 15 up to
[37:02.400 --> 37:07.800]  the election see if it happened next week God forbid he could do anything if
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.880]  they could start a new war in Syria that a lot of them are pushing I mean a hot
[37:11.880 --> 37:16.640]  war boots on the ground as they're calling for all over the news remember
[37:16.640 --> 37:19.800]  six months ago I said they want boots on the ground oh conspiracy Terry Fair
[37:19.800 --> 37:22.720]  Monger it's not gonna happen now it's happening and they're using al-Qaeda to
[37:22.720 --> 37:27.200]  start the war it's incredible who could make that's something that crazy up give
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.280]  all your rights up as al-Qaeda is hiding under your toilet but don't worry the
[37:32.280 --> 37:37.040]  toilet safety police will grow up you to keep you safe but the globalist that have
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.920]  hijacked our country using al-Qaeda and living in Syria I know I'm digressing he
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.080]  could do anything and again people are like well what's the point of just be
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.160]  Mitt Romney anyways well different factions could escalate things into a
[37:52.160 --> 37:59.000]  crisis instead of a gentle handover of power to the next puppet so we're in a
[37:59.000 --> 38:08.840]  very dangerous critical time right now an extremely extremely important time at
[38:08.840 --> 38:15.600]  this juncture right now and our first amendments under attack now more than
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.200]  ever and because the elections heated up I see threats on info wars.com
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.640]  prisonblooded.com on the Obama deception one version's got like almost 11
[38:26.640 --> 38:30.480]  million views on YouTube I see threats on there that we're gonna get you guys
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.000]  and then you go to the sites it's real people you go to the YouTube pages who
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.080]  really think it's racist to criticize Obama and that's because MSNBC and
[38:41.080 --> 38:46.320]  others say if you even show an image of a black person in a newspaper doing
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.120]  something wrong it's racist and I've talked about experiencing this myself
[38:50.120 --> 38:55.240]  catching a white guy paying off to black guys to go give a testimony and pose as
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.000]  gang members to say restrict guns you know gangbangers like us are dangerous
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.200]  I exposed that in the paper called me up and said are you racist and I said is
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.040]  this a joke and they said no and I thought it was a prank call and said
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.560]  give me your number I'll call you back at the statesman the guy gave me his
[39:10.560 --> 39:14.360]  number I called him back transferred through Godding and I was like this is
[39:14.360 --> 39:18.640]  real and he said yeah would you have done that report if they had been white
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.160]  being paid off I said is that a joke and the guys went to print with that that's
[39:24.160 --> 39:33.760]  what these people do okay that's what Bill Maher does you know the mayor of DC
[39:33.760 --> 39:37.720]  says Asians shouldn't be allowed to live there he puts an image of him up
[39:37.720 --> 39:44.320]  but the former mayor boom it's racist Bill Maher says drudges this is how they
[39:44.320 --> 39:51.520]  operate and they know full well that people aren't predominantly going after
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.960]  Obama because he's black you know what white people are the folks that put
[39:54.960 --> 40:00.000]  Obama in there put him over the top with a with a big win white people hoped
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.840]  this would bring racial reconciliation a lot of conservatives were kind of
[40:04.840 --> 40:09.720]  mainline voted for him just to try to create friendliness didn't work because
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.840]  the system never wanted that it's about driving a wedge that's why they want
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.840]  unlimited illegal aliens here to be put on welfare and be clients of the
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.560]  government who can then be legalized with all these motor voter things I mean
[40:22.560 --> 40:25.880]  I saw an article today where dogs are getting registered and able to vote and
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.440]  they can then I mean that's the old trick of the book bring in foreigners who
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.160]  will go along with the corrupt bankers that have hijacked the country to sell
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.400]  the nation out this is treason that we're talking about here and I don't just
[40:39.400 --> 40:44.480]  use those words lightly so before I get into the news banning of gardens you
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.000]  name it this is the type of comments there's a whole bunch of them on the
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.840]  video that's at info wars comm titled stop Obama dictator contest linkedin
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.800]  red please email the video out to everybody even if you're not going to
[40:56.800 --> 41:03.600]  take and again the contest just makes it fun the fifth of the $5,000 prize that

[41:10.720 --> 41:13.480]  on hiatus this week while we get some new people hired and finish up a few
[41:13.480 --> 41:18.160]  things I've just bitten off so much I can't even complete half the stuff I got
[41:18.160 --> 41:21.400]  in the pike to be completed so I'm doing another pit stop and then we're gonna
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.160]  relaunch the nightly news sitting you know five nights a week next Monday and
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.360]  I'll announce the winner the end of the $5,000 prize but that just makes it fun
[41:29.360 --> 41:35.360]  everybody wins by exercising the First Amendment and I see the comments on the
[41:35.360 --> 41:42.120]  video in there you know on YouTube itself and it's ha ha ha ha ha Alex Jones is
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.960]  trying to get you killed in a big way so that's the message why don't you Alex
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.120]  lead your pack of followers and be the first to make up a poster and post them
[41:53.120 --> 41:59.960]  everywhere well we did that we did that three years ago we were the first to go
[41:59.960 --> 42:04.320]  out and hang them up I mean I go out in public all the time I mean local talk
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.400]  show hosts have bodyguards I just I just went right out to Bilderberg with no
[42:08.400 --> 42:12.720]  bodyguard for four days with playing clothes Marines trying to set us up with
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.720]  bomb threats I mean I'm up here saying I'm a tough guy but you know I always
[42:16.720 --> 42:21.800]  love these absolute cowards on the internet trying to imply there's some
[42:21.800 --> 42:28.720]  actual threats in here by some of these guys you know these people trying to act
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.560]  like a I'm a coward B we're all cowards and see we better watch our back that's
[42:33.560 --> 42:39.520]  the reason we're doing this Jack and I went to the guy's website he's a somewhat
[42:39.520 --> 42:45.240]  successful black rapper that said this and he goes on to say including on your
[42:45.240 --> 42:51.320]  front lawn oh the implication is I'll get it and let's see how it fares out well
[42:51.320 --> 42:54.600]  I would I would really hate anybody that did something in my house that would not
[42:54.600 --> 43:01.520]  be advised when I'm there that would not be a healthy move number what number two
[43:01.520 --> 43:05.720]  if I did live in the city I would put some of my front yard I live back in the
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.840]  woods you see with the woman and the kids and the dogs in me I got a shotgun a
[43:10.840 --> 43:17.760]  rifle and a four-wheel drive and a 50 cal and more and still more so and still
[43:17.760 --> 43:25.200]  more and so and cameras everywhere and still more and not the little not just
[43:25.200 --> 43:28.520]  a little French dog French Bulldogs you see on video not no those aren't the
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.360]  only dogs so I'm here trying to understand I'm bad and I better watch it
[43:33.360 --> 43:37.280]  and I'm gonna I'm gonna get people hurt not if they're out legally and lawfully
[43:37.280 --> 43:40.760]  hanging up signs and if somebody did try to do something to that that's that
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.520]  person's problem not my problem that people don't respect free speech in
[43:44.520 --> 43:49.920]  this country so don't give in to the punks out there that are trying to shoot
[43:49.920 --> 43:53.760]  their mouths off like big men on the internet but never in person that you
[43:53.760 --> 43:57.320]  better not dare hang up stuff and defile the great leader that's why I did this
[43:57.320 --> 44:02.640]  three years ago it was because somebody was hanging these up in Los
[44:02.640 --> 44:06.800]  Angeles is similar to what we had put up an Obama Joker and they were talking
[44:06.800 --> 44:10.760]  about arresting them and the news was saying oh it's illegal not to hang stuff
[44:10.760 --> 44:16.280]  up in public commons but to criticize Obama local papers in central Texas the
[44:16.280 --> 44:20.720]  Kyle paper called it hate speech and said should I be arrested because people
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.200]  were hanging them up on telephone poles not because it was they say illegal to
[44:26.200 --> 44:29.160]  hang them up on telephone poles because that's a commons people have been
[44:29.160 --> 44:34.520]  posting it then it's common law you can do it no because we were criticizing him
[44:34.520 --> 44:40.280]  listen I'll criticize anybody I want people are like on the other hand they're
[44:40.280 --> 44:44.240]  like Alex has got to be a fed nobody could hang up posters like this calling
[44:44.240 --> 44:50.080]  Obama a murderer and get away with if they weren't listen just because you've
[44:50.080 --> 44:53.600]  never done anything in your life just because you're gripped by fear don't
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.320]  associate your fear with me okay I have committed to this fight and it's
[44:59.320 --> 45:05.760]  nothing nothing to tell people to go hang up some signs exposing that Obama's
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.680]  becoming a dictator and the fact that people air threatening us over it and
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.560]  others and be saying it's impossible no one could be this bold no one could go
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.600]  with several thousand people over five days and bullhorn world leaders and
[45:19.600 --> 45:23.920]  heads of state at point blank range into their vehicles the reason we have the
[45:23.920 --> 45:27.040]  First Amendment is because we're exercising it they're trying to get rid
[45:27.040 --> 45:30.280]  of it all over the world free speech in general and the First Amendment here
[45:30.280 --> 45:33.720]  the reason we have the right to film police is because we're exercising it
[45:33.720 --> 45:38.160]  you understand there's a parallel track of liberty on one side and tyranny on
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.520]  the other and if we don't exercise the liberty muscles they will actrafe and
[45:42.520 --> 45:46.960]  the tyrants will take over this is an eternal continual struggle over every
[45:46.960 --> 45:54.000]  inch of dirt you know I think about my grandfather who always told everybody
[45:54.000 --> 46:01.120]  that he was my dad's dad that he was a cook in the Army Air Corps until decades
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.000]  after he died he died back in like 1981
[46:08.680 --> 46:15.080]  decades after he was dead my grandmother had died and my dad got his well my
[46:15.080 --> 46:17.560]  uncle actually got him but my dad got to look at him we get to look at him and
[46:17.560 --> 46:22.520]  take some photos of it my my my grandfather's Army Air Corps graduation
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.920]  book and then the letters and medals and stuff like that and you know he only
[46:26.920 --> 46:33.080]  had to do the basic missions over Europe and on average yeah only 22 missions
[46:33.080 --> 46:36.560]  twice they catch only two but half the time in those missions they were dying
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.680]  that's how dangerous it was imagine the people that did even more and never
[46:41.680 --> 46:46.240]  wanted to be known about see that's why we admire people in the military is the
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.560]  memory of when our military actually went into situations where half the
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.960]  people died in many cases or I think about my uncle you know who flew
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.000]  helicopters in Vietnam and got shot up and was you know highly decorated and I
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.400]  know listen to the show right now never wants to talk about it that's the
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.520]  difference that's what a warrior is even if the war is wrong in the case of
[47:07.520 --> 47:11.360]  Vietnam is when you're actually facing other men with weapons that can
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.840]  resist you not cowardly drones flying around killing whole families so you
[47:15.840 --> 47:21.360]  can say you get one terrorist and then they want to use the drones against us
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.000]  and then they want to criticize Syria if one child gets killed when the West is
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.480]  funding al Qaeda to attack their government and that government's
[47:28.480 --> 47:31.800]  responding we're supposed to get sad about the one dead girl but not care
[47:31.800 --> 47:35.560]  about the thousands or millions of other dead this is all being done in our
[47:35.560 --> 47:41.520]  name and I think about modern Americans who are shocked that I would dare say
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.280]  hang-up signs pointing out that Obama is becoming a dictator launching wars
[47:45.280 --> 47:50.000]  without approval shutting down power plants gun control legalizing
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.400]  illegals I mean this is treason that we ought to create a poster that says got
[47:55.400 --> 48:02.880]  treason with Obama maybe as Mao will do that I mean whatever poster you want
[48:02.880 --> 48:10.520]  just exposing $5,000 price this Friday I'll give it out next Monday and then
[48:10.520 --> 48:14.840]  two Fridays later 10,000 just phase two you win the first prize you can win the
[48:14.840 --> 48:18.600]  second prize do it now it's about taking action and then I think about how
[48:18.600 --> 48:21.640]  people can't believe that I would do something like this because I'm supposed
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.840]  to live in fear and I think about World War two veteran being forced out of his
[48:24.840 --> 48:30.800]  home because he's bankrupt and forced to exhumed his wife's body he owns the
[48:30.800 --> 48:36.840]  land outright and the little house but now when you're bankrupt they try to
[48:36.840 --> 48:40.720]  take your house I guess he got tricked into it or something and he parachuted
[48:40.720 --> 48:46.160]  in on one of many combat missions in the 11th Airborne Division prisoners of
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.520]  war at Los Benos internment camp on the island of Luzon in the Philippines
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.800]  paratrooper into the prisoner of war camp because as the Japanese were pulling
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.120]  out being defeated they were killing all the prisoners of war parachuting in
[49:01.120 --> 49:10.040]  against larger numbers that's what people were like in the past and now
[49:10.040 --> 49:15.240]  Americans can't believe I would get up here and say Obama's a dictator I mean
[49:15.240 --> 49:21.640]  I'm a hero I've got courage no I'm not and I'm sick of it the bar has been
[49:21.640 --> 49:28.360]  lowered so much in this country down to almost nothing by the way you know the
[49:28.360 --> 49:36.840]  story about that gentleman who was beaten to death out in California what
[49:36.840 --> 49:41.480]  was his name Thomas Kelly out in the same area another schizophrenic person
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.080]  was beaten to death and tortured to death the very same way and and these
[49:45.080 --> 49:49.040]  videos get released and the they aren't even resisting and the cops just take
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.240]  their time beating your brains out and breaking your ribs and breaking your
[49:52.240 --> 49:58.720]  throat and I just think about what we've become what is tough today is being a
[49:58.720 --> 50:04.040]  big fat bully is is is attacking somebody with a drone or attacking
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.720]  somebody when there's 10 cops and some hundred pounds schizophrenic person you
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.080]  know who thinks you're you know thinks you're monsters and to hear these guys
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.760]  when they cry and beg as they're slowly killed crying for their mommies and their
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.080]  daddies and the cops are getting all excited I mean wow steroids does that
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.160]  to you because I mean I don't know how somebody normally gets off on that I
[50:25.160 --> 50:29.920]  mean yeah if you're in a fight somebody attacks you they're hurting you pretty
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.680]  bad and you finally get the better of them and and and I get being vicious

[58:53.440 --> 58:57.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:57.760 --> 59:01.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:01.960 --> 59:06.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:09.880 --> 59:14.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.160 --> 59:18.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.320 --> 59:22.640]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.640 --> 59:26.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.320 --> 59:30.520]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.160]  Alex Jones
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.960]  there are really three rails in society but the middle rail is a no man's land
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:52.160]  of lukewarm foolishness there is conscience calculated organized evil
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:59.760]  that's one rail and there is uncoordinated good in the world good is a
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.040]  very rarely coordinated and every good action every loving action every strong
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:12.680]  action every action of courage when you don't back down from being lied to when
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.560]  you're lied to you confront somebody when you don't back down from somebody
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.480]  trying to intimidate you when you don't back down when someone tries to bully
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.440]  you when you help those that are weak when you make yourself look deeper into
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.840]  the more complex meanings when you build up strong things when you work hard when
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.000]  you invent things when you appreciate the world when you appreciate beauty when
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.720]  you recognize good from evil and then make the right choice it makes the world
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:49.520]  a better place not the Illuminati thousand points of light but seven
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.120]  million points of light bringing light to the world people say that's Illuminati
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.160]  no the Illuminati the globalists take every archetype that's real and good and
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.960]  they expropriated they've expropriated our American flag they've expropriated
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.920]  all of our sacred ideas everything that's that's written on our heart and
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.040]  they have set up their world government it's not complete yet though they have
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.120]  to eradicate the common sense they have to eradicate the private property the
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.640]  parental rights the second amendment they have to eradicate all the major
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.440]  religions that aren't into devil worship because they don't fit in to that larger
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.560]  system of total control where the state and the globalist and the petty hype
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.520]  system is God the neural orders greatest crime is attacking the innocence and
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:48.160]  seeking to dumb down people and keep them from learning true knowledge it's all
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:59.120]  a riddle wrapped in an enigma we've got Daniel Estolin coming up in the next
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:06.440]  segment with some breaking news and we're gonna look at this report here out
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.400]  of the Washington Post today avoiding a global catastrophe by Larry Summers
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.840]  this is the guy that helped get rid of Glass-Steagall sell derivatives not just
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.720]  here but worldwide we're gonna get into him G20 summit Baroso blames Eurozone
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.480]  crisis on US banks well it's the same banks run Europe run the US it's like
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.480]  the left hand is blaming the right hand in a way it's true but it's a spin we're
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.480]  gonna be going over all of that the big news here obviously McCain urges US led
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.560]  war against Syria Syria iron and Russia and China playing joint war games Iran
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.240]  news agency reports there's also reports out that Putin lectured Obama at the
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.960]  meeting yesterday that they were both very very tense the weekly standard is
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.280]  reporting there's video of that looks like Putin got in his face and again
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.680]  Putin is a globalist but he wants his own new world order Putin is a KGB guy
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:12.160]  FSB guy but all that's happening is that's one group competing with the other
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:22.840]  group a big dominant group that that is the most virulent is the group that's
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:30.240]  hijacked the West it's not Putin it's not the chai coms that are putting drones
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:36.160]  in the skies and cancer viruses in our vaccines well cancer China come cancer
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.760]  China actually works with the globalist to do a lot of that they made that deal

[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:42.720]  the audio streams at info wars.com joining us for the full hour is Daniel
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.720]  Estolin he is a best-selling author researcher who lives in Spain his true
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.240]  story of the Bilderberg group is an international best-seller I forget how
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.920]  many countries it's been published in and it's also available on a trine day
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.800]  right here in the United States Daniel Estolin estolin.com is his
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.520]  excellent website now Daniel is a hard guy to get on he's very busy there's a
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.800]  lot of interviews in Europe and the national TV shows of all the big
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.000]  countries he can't travel a lot because they try to block him flying to the US
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.760]  they wouldn't let him in last time to be on Ventura TV show he had to come up a
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.560]  week later Ventura confirmed that it happened he's had death threats you
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.560]  name it and I've never had him contact us to say hey I want to come on I got
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.880]  breaking news so it must be big if Daniel Estolin is wanting to talk to
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.200]  people in North America we're also listened to obviously around the world
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.880]  and I'm just now discovering during the break when we got him on what it's
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.760]  about and it's the latest from Bilderberg because you always learn a few
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.120]  weeks later after the meeting is when you get the really good leaks and it
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.040]  ties into exactly what he predicted two three weeks ago daring it with his
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.240]  initial sources so this is a bird's eye view into the globalist but we have
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.280]  Larry Summers who helped engineer so much of this you know the head guy for
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.760]  Clinton openly saying that we could have a total collapse now if you don't give
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.400]  total power to the banksters that's an article titled avoiding the global
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.840]  catastrophe we've got Syria Iran Russia and China planning joint war games
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.560]  Iran news agency reports McCain says prepare for boots on the ground they're
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:30.920]  calling for war in Syria the West is using al Qaeda in Libya to take over and
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.800]  now Syria and admitting it and a Bilderberg last year was upset from our
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.440]  sources that that it was even in the LA Times that yes the West uses al Qaeda
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.000]  because that messes up their system of using them to take our liberties the
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.360]  the imaginary or semi-imaginary threat so joining us to break all this down is
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.800]  Daniel Estel and joining us from Spain you're in Spain right now correct Daniel
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:01.160]  I'm in Madrid right now but I'm not sure how long I'm gonna be actually in Madrid or Spain because Spain is going to hell in a head
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.760]  basket fast but it's actually you can see the systemic collapse in Spain over the
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.120]  past six months it's been tremendous because Alex I live here I can tell you
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.040]  what I've been witnessing over the past six months it is difficult to travel for
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.560]  anyone who's been living in the Western world it's like three we're a pre-baptist
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.800]  situation where people know things are wrong we have crime literally
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.280]  increasing two-fold you know month-wise it's just tremendous how much Spain has
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.960]  changed over the past six months so again I'm here now but I have no idea how
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.720]  long am I going to be here for because again things are not looking up I want
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.560]  to start because again this is important information with the elections in Greece
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.160]  we just again Greece obviously was on the agenda at Build-A-Book this year but
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.760]  you know regardless of what we're seeing in the mainstream press regardless of
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.440]  consequences the European Union the largest economy in the world is now
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.560]  suffering under the weight of two not one but two traumatic crisis striking
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.040]  simultaneously and these two crisis striking simultaneously literally mean
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.920]  doom for the United States and for the world for the Western world. Trauma number
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.520]  one Europe's governments are in big trouble debt is out of control tax
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.720]  revenues are plunging and interest rates and interest costs are surging these
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.040]  are obviously the things that Build-A-Bookers were very very concerned
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.080]  about the elections in Greece have not changed that at all and the second big
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.200]  situation traumatic crisis right now is that Europe's banks are under siege
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.800]  drowning in massive losses swamped with withdrawals and lining up a bailout
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.680]  money that no government can afford and again some people seem to think that the
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.000]  European Union's sovereign debt problems are limited to just a few countries such
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.040]  as Spain or Portugal or Ireland for example but it's actually not the case
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.760]  it's systemic it's across the entire continent and no wonder the Build-A-Bookers
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.040]  were very very concerned about the repercussions of that not only in the
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.760]  world the colleges obviously the American Build-A-Bookers were concerned what
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.640]  will happen in the United States especially with elections coming up in a
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.120]  few months for example Greece has gross government debt of three hundred and
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.360]  fifteen billion dollars Spain with more than double that amount of almost nine
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.860]  hundred billion dollars and Italy with debt that is six times larger than Greece's
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:31.320]  which is nearly two trillion dollars but that's not all if I just found out from
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.600]  our sources one of the concerns of the Build-A-Booker meeting was that they
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.760]  concerned not only of these big countries as they call southern European
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.160]  nations and and Ireland but also they concerned with countries such as France's
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.840]  debt is almost as large as Italy at almost two trillion and Germany which is
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.560]  the motor of the European economy and supposedly the only nation that can save
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.680]  the world from oblivion is that it's actually larger than Italy's over two
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.560]  and a half trillion dollars so again the situation is is stark in all the
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.360]  countries across the continent and of course on the one hand as you saw many
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:13.000]  times I've stated on the air so the plan is depopulation because if you can
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.080]  destroy the economy you're destroying the population needs because there's no
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.480]  growth there's no progress but as you and I talked about this two years ago in
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.080]  your show what they're doing right now is there's a faction within Build-A-Book
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.440]  that is increasingly concerned that this destruction which is being done on the
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.480]  purpose may actually wipe them out as well and that's something that you know
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:38.000]  no one is actually covering or talking about now I know you have some amazing
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.600]  sources inside Build-A-Book so I've got some questions along those lines but
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.800]  every country Greece Spain people ask why is it called the pigs you've got
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.440]  Portugal you've got Italy you've got Greece Spain that spells out pigs and
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.400]  as as the mega banks bail their own debt out they have the media push and say
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.720]  that most the debt was actually the populations but we've done those numbers
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.800]  in some countries it's over 90% of the debt that they're being told is their
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.760]  debt is actually Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo their
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:17.480]  European divisions and Baroso who's a big neural order guy as you know he came
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.800]  out the London Guardian and blamed US banks that's like blaming your other
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.640]  hand so we're getting down towards the end game no matter how many bailouts
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:39.000]  there are they always need more and a lot of people are asking are wondering
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.440]  what does that do now the thing is that the banks are buying it because the idea
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.760]  is to bankrupt nation it's not to save the world from destruction actually to
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:54.160]  destroy the nation this is the old Venetian game in having your adversary
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.640]  go so far in debt to you that you control the adversary you see the banks
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.400]  themselves are buying debt which is worthless but many of these banks are
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.880]  not intended to survive which is the case with a lot of banks in Spain which
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.600]  is literally have been downgraded to junk status if you take the oligarch at
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.400]  its word the Empire says they want to reduce the population to 1 billion
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.480]  people on this planet which means that huge sections of the banking system yes
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.400]  huge sections of national economies huge sections of the population they're
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.880]  gonna go so this system is never coming back and this is what this bailout
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.400]  really is in trying to save this money which is really virtual money doesn't
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.280]  exist the debt can never be paid the derivatives they have absolutely no
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:43.600]  value it's all a sham it's like monopoly money but in trying to save that what
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.720]  we're doing is destroying ourselves destroying the nations destroying the
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.040]  country let me ask you this why does Bilderberg want a why does Bilderberg
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:58.920]  want a post industrial world why do they want to reduce the population because
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.360]  they're meeting right now in Rio and they're saying they want a post
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.040]  industrial world and here's AFP women march in Rio to protest a green economy
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.960]  because it's not really a green economy why is Bilderberg so obsessed with
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.840]  reducing population and wrecking economies Daniel Estelen well you know
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.560]  again it goes back to the you know we're living on a very small planet of seven
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.160]  billion people with natural real limited natural resources in a generation we're
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.000]  going to get to 10 11 billion 15 20 40 it's going to get to the point they're
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.240]  simply not enough food or water on the planet for everyone and so for people
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.920]  like Rockefeller who just a euphemism for powerful people to survive for the
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.680]  elite most of us have to disappear because again this is something that you
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.840]  know we lose people have been saying for a long time this is something that you
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.600]  know the circles of Goldford lighting it's over 250 years ago you know realize
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.040]  the new that progress and development is directly proportional to population
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.400]  density so if you want to progress if you want to have more people on the
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.720]  planet you have to have the technological levels to be able to
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.880]  sustain the life of all these alive all these billions of people on the other
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.560]  hand if you want to destroy the population base undermined it and wipe
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.440]  most of us out what you need to do is destroy demand destroy production and
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:25.040]  that's why we so often see phrases such as zero growth post-industrial age as you
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.240]  said you know you and I talked about this after the 2006
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:32.480]  building meeting in canada in Ottawa in Canada when we were working on the end
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.200]  game documentary and you were interviewing me for that documentary we
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.360]  were talking about it so people haven't seen end game go back and see what Alex
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.240]  Jones did back in 2006 so that people can understand that this isn't some
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.040]  nonsense from a conspiracy freak this is real and what they're doing is they're
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.560]  destroying nation-state republics and creating this world company limited the
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:04.160]  concept which was first brought up at the 1960 build the burger conference in
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.440]  Canada by none other than George ball of Lehman brothers who announced the
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:14.320]  project to build this world company of the idea is that nation-state at the time
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.480]  this is nineteen nineteen sixty-eight they're outmoded that are k-form of
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.560]  government in a malfunction world they can't be relied on they tend to believe
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.480]  that the resources in their countries most countries belong to the people who
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.440]  run the world the Rockefellers and company and so we've done in order to
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.880]  control the natural resources they created a new form of government that
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.440]  decided in a corporation so that's what the world corporation is that's right
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.960]  and you don't you don't have a vote in it that's why in the 1974 network they
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.320]  call Howard Bieland and explain it all to him when we come back I want to

[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.720]  I'm not trying to shoot our guest horn but he really has had a dramatic effect
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.240]  on the landscape and has amazing sources Vanity Fair the Wall Street Journal of
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.080]  Italy you name it have have you pointed out just recently that he's one of the
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:36.480]  top researchers in this area and of course a few years ago I'll ask him
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:42.000]  about this before he leaves us at the end of the hour Fidel Castro invited him
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.840]  to Cuba and again regardless what you think of Castro's political bent you know
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.800]  here is Fidel Castro effect a photo on screen inviting Daniel Estolin whose
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.400]  books he reads to Cuba and I mean so it just shows that you know he knows who
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.640]  runs the world these banksters so we'll be talking more with Daniel about that
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.200]  this is a short segment Daniel I wanted to get into what's happening
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.160]  geopolitically because the world is obviously as it economically collapses
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.520]  by design to consolidate it's militarily the battle lines are being drawn I mean
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.960]  Russia it's not even really in our news but it's all over European news as you
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.080]  know has said three times the last two months me yet you have and Putin we will
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.440]  nuke you if you keep moving missiles in now they're sending Spitznets special
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.600]  forces and a marine Spitznets and ships into Syria all sorts of high-tech
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.920]  weapons I mean this is getting crazy Daniel what is your Bilderberg sources
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:48.400]  telling you on these fronts well you know because Bilderberg's top headache into
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  foreseeable future continues to be Putin and that's something that they've all
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:57.360]  agreed on here is a concern for the secretive organization is Russia's
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.360]  opposition to war in Syria and Iran be they spot a humanitarian bombing or
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.080]  colored revolutions but the concern for Bilderberg is Russia's insistence on
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.400]  maintaining state sovereignty in fact that something that Putin and the
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.160]  measure quite a few times that are talking about the American media at least
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.840]  has completely eliminated from the discourse now another concern for
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.880]  Bilderberg is how exactly to deal with Russia's quote-unquote belligerence as
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.520]  one of the Builderburgers put it with respect to number one the U.S. bases
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:33.920]  concerning Russia and number two missile defense pointing its warheads at Moscow
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.800]  now as far as Syria is concerned Bilderberg agrees that the country's
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.280]  presence and Mediterranean is a great concern to NATO and the United States
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.440]  and to Bilderberg who would generally wish to remove Russia's Navy from the
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  Syrian port of Tartus now but as one European Bilderberger security
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.880]  expert commented on far greater concern is Putin's emphasis on Eurasia
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.680]  integration now Putin's ideas coordinating a powerful super national union
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.660]  between Europe and the dynamic Asia Pacific region now one positive for
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.520]  Bilderberg as far as Russia's position on Syria is concerned is that
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.760]  Putin's options to oppose regime change in Syria are fraught with danger the
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.360]  deliberate degree that an inflexible proposition would be Russia out of many
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.520]  international future understandings for Syria and I quote from one of the
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.360]  Builderburg they said Russia was completely left out of Libya and they
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.680]  won't want a risk being shut out of Syria as well said one high-ranking U.S.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.960]  diplomat attending the Bilderberg conference now Bilderberg is convinced that
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.200]  Putin would rather share Syria with the United States and the European Union and
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.440]  have a say in the country's future direction than try to oppose it too much
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.160]  which wrong that's why Russia's position is not as powerful as a lot of people
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.840]  believe but as you said Russia is certainly flexing its military muscle
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.200]  getting the spit not which are the special forces into Syria talk to you
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.840]  talked about that as well my source of things as well and what you said is
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.760]  Alex is absolutely correct incredible shifting gears and I've got Aaron Dyke
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.320]  since you mentioned it earlier trying to find it it's almost a three-hour film
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:19.960]  in 2006 almost two years before the housing collapse began and no one was
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.280]  talking about it your sources said that in that meeting because I talked to you
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.640]  that night right after it ended and you hadn't had any sleep in over two days
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:34.000]  because you'd flown in from Spain that and it's it's an endgame that they were
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.600]  going to implode the housing market and begin a recession that would lead to
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.080]  global depression the derivatives the imploding economy Europe then the
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  United States and you lay it all out in endgame and and there it is all these
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.240]  crises that they act like are just now starting and the globalists have a
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:58.240]  solution to them we have them on record engineering them
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.560]  that's one of the reasons why we get the Wall Street which is not exactly a
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.040]  slouch getting you know giving me front-page coverage an entire page
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.640]  talking about my 2012 billboard report and saying as you just mentioned one of
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.160]  the few people actually got the inside information from the people at the
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.960]  meeting these are people who are very very serious about what's going on and
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.160]  again those of us have a lot of opposition within the group but also
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.720]  people who actually work for mainstream media who understand what's going on who
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.320]  don't want to see their country's wife down as for example right now we've seen
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.400]  who's Italy now as Nigel Farage mentioned in the European Parliament in
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.360]  Strasbourg not those safe Spanish banks Italy is being forced to lend money at
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.160]  three I'll tell you what long segments start interrupt long segments stay there
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:46.400]  tell us about opposition to Bilderberg inside a lot more what's happening in
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:53.200]  Italy back in just a few minutes we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:02.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that

[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:26.520]  okay we did dig out the clip this is from endgame blueprint for global
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.080]  enslavement I also then updated it in my Obama deception film of almost four
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:40.080]  years ago and this is Daniel Estalan in the hotel lounge at around 11 o'clock at
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:45.200]  night with Jim Tucker as they're exchanging notes from their sources
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.400]  I mean this is shows the power the Bilderberg group has are they are they
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:55.240]  absolute rulers no but they're as high as it gets in this Atlantic European US
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:00.080]  England alliance but not of our countries of the global bankers that have
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.760]  hijacked us and conquered us and are trying to leverage our military our
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:10.560]  tax money our science against the rest of the world that mean Russia and China
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:16.600]  are good guys no it simply means that we are under the control of the most vicious
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.280]  group who want total extermination I mean Putin pays people to get married and
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.560]  have kids here they don't want you to again it's a different group and again
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.360]  the Chinese the Russians they're not the ones taking over the US the Chinese are
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.720]  to a certain extent they're allied with the globalist more but I'll get I'll get
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.680]  Daniel sources on that and see if he agrees with that statement we're gonna
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.720]  get into what he was saying in Europe and then in the military situation a
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.000]  moment where he left off in Italy but first here's that clip from endgame
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.520]  blueprint for global enslavement by the way it's free online if you want to watch
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.920]  it it's a very important film here it is well one of the things that you know
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.560]  we're getting from this morning this afternoon's conference morning consoles
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.000]  about the the energy crisis the press of this the afternoon conference which
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.960]  started about four o'clock 4 4 30 they're talking about one of the American
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.000]  delegates I wasn't told who exactly was was talking about the the concern that
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.440]  the American citizens have had with the housing prices going down so they're
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.200]  not investing that money so what they needed to do is I needed to create the
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.320]  illusion that everything is going well so what they're going to do over the
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.040]  next year year and a half is to bring the market back up to it 1998 1999 levels
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.760]  they're gonna get all the suckers to invest whatever little money they have
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.680]  left over and that's when they're gonna make the economy's bottom dropout they
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.160]  need to destroy the economy because as we're running out of oil when people don't
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.560]  travel at least that's what they're saying when people don't travel when
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.360]  people don't have money they don't travel they don't spend any money which
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.080]  means you don't waste a lot of oil and natural gas that's the actual source I
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.480]  mean just ballparking me so so you have the sources of well actually the two
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.760]  people that will members of the bill about okay that's good and again that's
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.560]  a really bad internet clip just the first one we could find there's higher
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.560]  quality ones available online of in-game blueprint for global settlement or get
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.080]  the DVD at info wars.com but there is that clip and you go on repeatedly in
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:17.400]  the film and just predict everything that's going to unfold. Let's continue
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.520]  now tell us tell us what they're planning now to do to the economy you had
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.880]  left off with the fact that there's people within Bilderberg that don't like
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.920]  what's happening and that a lot of the nationalistic structures that are left
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.560]  they're finally realizing that the New World Order is going to destroy their
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.080]  countries please continue.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:50.080]  I want to mention that I just commented on what you said about the Chinese taking over the United States. One of the key conclusions from the Bilderberg meeting is that the United States will manipulate the fall of the US dollar in value against the Chinese Yuan.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:56.080]  Now the thing behind it is that a devalued dollar will inflate away America's debt and its obligations.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:03.080]  The Bilderberg is not particularly concerned about the people of the United States and obviously they're going to use them as guinea pigs in this entire experiment.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:08.080]  What of course is being sacrificed is the purchasing power of the American dollar.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:18.080]  It's all part of the deal with Beijing to help Washington inflate away debt and give China more say in the global economy.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:24.080]  Now if you look at the actual list of that in these you will see China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:37.080]  now this individual was there at the Bilderberg conference, also Yiping Huang, Professor of Economics, China Center for Economic Research at the Beijing University was also invited to Bilderberg 2012.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:46.080]  Now this gentleman talking about the people who have been financed by the Rockefeller Corporation, by the Ford Corporation for many, many years.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.080]  Now collusion between the US government and the Chinese government is in progress.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:38:01.080]  Now you would think, Alex, this should be the front-page news in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, in the Financial Times and Time Magazine.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:13.080]  Now you will not see any of this because needless to say what we're seeing is an active participant in the debate on the destruction of the American dollar at the expense of the Chinese currency.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:26.080]  These individuals are also involved in the Bilderberg meeting this year, who also participated in the collusion, Chang Li, the director of research and senior fellow at John Thornton China Center with Brookings Institute,
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:34.080]  and of course, Kurt Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury and also Court Chairman of the Powerful Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:45.080]  These individuals are plotting with the Chinese government and the American government to destroy the United States dollar, and I think it should be on the front-page of every news from America.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:55.080]  Yes, sir. And paying $22 billion of US tax money to move General Motors, Volt, and Cadillac factories to China.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:01.080]  So we don't just pay, and then our traitorous, globalist government has tax incentives to move our jobs to China.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:11.080]  But now our government pays to shut us down. Let me ask you this detailed question, because from my sources, going back to 75 and those agreements with Nixon,
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:22.080]  there is a strategic plan with the United States and China, and that there was a deal offered by Russia around that time to do a sneak attack with the US on China,
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:36.080]  that China said, you know, basically, well, that Russia said no, and so the deal was made for the, quote, US, the bankers to go with China.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:45.080]  But then you have the double game of bases being set up around China. So I guess the globalists make deals with them, the carrot, but then have the stick.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:52.080]  Does that mesh with your deep sources and research? What's the real lay of the land with the three power blocks or four?
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:57.080]  But Europe and the United States and England and the Commonwealth is one or two, depending on how you look at it.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:05.080]  Russia and then, of course, what's happening with China, with Japan basically allied out there with the United States.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080]  What's the real power breakdown globally?
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  Actually, it's a very, very good question. You brought up a very interesting point. Now, you have to go back, actually, to the fact that the critical breakdown,
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  which the Bilderbergers and their cohorts have been working on intensely, as you said, you know, going back to the 70s, actually, since the 1960s,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:33.080]  was the breakup of Bretton Woods system, without which you could have never had the oil hoax of the second part of the 70s.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:41.080]  And, of course, that whole thing was destroyed by Nixon at the beginning in 1971, in 1973-74, extending all the way through the Carter administration
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:48.080]  and the second oil hoax, 79-80. Now, what they've done, talking about these divisions between different countries and the Chinese and the Russians,
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:41:01.080]  now the European oligarchy was intent on breaking up the system that FDR had set up for post-World War II order that was premised on the decolonization of the planet.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:09.080]  So what they've done, you know, the elite, they took a series of steps in the mid to late 1960s, in Britain, for example, under Harold Wilson,
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:19.080]  to weaken and effectively destroy the Bretton Woods system in 1971. That's one of the reasons why we have Nixon going to China, Kissinger going to China,
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:26.080]  you know, the Chinese and the Americans working together, also with the Russians on the other side. Now, what happened was, okay,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:34.080]  another individual involved was, of course, George Schultz. So, you see, the stage was set to go from a system of fixed exchange rate
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:43.080]  that gave an advantage to real productive development and investment, and after 1971, everything went in favor of the speculators.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:51.080]  And that, again, something that was very much decided between the Americans and the Chinese, because you could never get something like this done
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:57.080]  without these other big nations, superpowers, you know, being on the take or knowing what was going on.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:07.080]  So, you see, the oil shock of 1973, the 400% targeted increase which Bilderberg talked about, we have the documents to prove it in May 1973,
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:14.080]  saying that in six months' price is going to go to, you know, between $10, $50 and $12 per barrel, went to $11.65.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:22.080]  So, look back and compare those numbers today. It probably goes way beyond the 400%, but what I'm saying is all of that was aimed at launching
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:30.080]  a systemic or systematic process of the looting of the actual productive wealth of all of the major nations of the planet,
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:36.080]  and what you have, for example, in countries such as Saudi Arabia and almost other countries of the Persian Gulf,
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  are super states that are under the domination of the city of London, which is just, you know, another way to say Bilderberg, however you want to call it,
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:54.080]  you know, the financial elite, the financial oligarchy, and needless to say, the Chinese were in on it back in the 1970s, and they're in on it today.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  How does Russia play into this?
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:04.080]  Well, you know, Putin is in an interesting position. On the one hand, the Russians and the Chinese, they obviously understand that, you know,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:10.080]  they have to work together. That if they don't work together, you have, you know, the United States government, you have Bilderberg,
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:17.080]  you have, you know, London, you have all these nations actually going up against the interests of the Russians.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:23.080]  But also, on the other hand, you know, the Russians are fully aware that the Chinese and Americans are working together, you know,
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:31.080]  destroy the United States dollar. So what the Russians are actually doing, working on right now, is bilateral agreements with the Chinese,
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:36.080]  and of course, Russia's strength, you know, on their playing to its strength, is its energy reserve.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:44.080]  And Bilderberg, that's one of the things they talked about at the meeting, is particularly concerned about this thing called South Stream Pipeline,
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:55.080]  which is a mega project of over $20 billion. Now, South Stream Gas Pipeline is to transport Russian natural gas under the Black Sea to the southern part,
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  part of the European Union through Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Slovakia, and then also Italy and Austria supplying over $60 billion cubic meters of gas annually.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:14.080]  And of course, Bilderberg is extremely concerned, is that South Stream could turn into a major victory for Russia at the expense of the European Union,
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:25.080]  American-backed Nabucco Pipeline from Turkey to Austria, and of course, of even greater concern to Bilderberg, is Putin's attempt, and this is where Russia and China come in working together,
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:35.080]  is Putin's attempt to integrate Asia into cohesive bloc under the leadership of Russia, and of course, this merger, this union between the Russians and the Chinese,
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:47.080]  will preempt all Bilderberg meddling, because what they're planning to do is, they're planning to turn Pakistan and Iran into full members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:54.080]  The repercussions of this will be groundbreaking, according to one European Bilderberger security expert.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:05.080]  Well, if you look at what the West has been doing in Pakistan, is driving Pakistan, who's hated the Russians, and the Chinese to a certain extent, into the arms of the Chinese.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:15.080]  So again, you see a double game where Kissinger and these people actually have more investments in China, so in the final equation, they just want to have it all balanced out,
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:22.080]  and in the final equation sell the United States down the river, as you said, we're just more real estate to them.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:27.080]  How are things going for them? Because the break interrupted you, we never went back to Italy.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:35.080]  I mean, how are things going for the banksters? How are things going for the money changers? Are things going well, or are they going badly?
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:42.080]  Well, things are not going as well as they had hoped. Obviously, Europe is in a systemic breakdown.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:52.080]  You know, the United States is in a terrible situation. You have all these nations such as Russia, which, you know, allegedly almost were subjugated back to the 1990s, without alcohol and juice,
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:46:01.080]  but by the name of Yeltsin, and now Putin steps in, and he turns the whole thing around, and he basically runs roughshod over the United States policy,
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:07.080]  and he's a much better negotiator than all these other Bilderbergers are, and so neither's to say they're very upset.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:13.080]  They also understand, according to what was said at the Bilderberg meeting, is that, you know, they basically give up.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:20.080]  Kasparov, who's a former world chess champion, was in attendance, as you know, at this meeting, you know, but according to Bilderberg resources,
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:31.080]  Bilderberg has very little confidence in Gary Kasparov, you know, and as one Bilderberg resource said, his street smarts relating to Kasparov leave a lot to be desired,
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:38.080]  and as one American Bilderberg has stated, and I quote, if this was a boxing match, we'd be looking at a mismatch of the century.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:41.080]  That's Putin versus Kasparov, who will have to wait.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:48.080]  And while Bilderberg continues to finance Kasparov's United Civil Front in hopes of stirring up trouble in Russia,
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:55.080]  the secretive cabal without looking for wiser and smarter and more charismatic figures to give Putin a run for his money,
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:01.080]  and have a hell of a hard time doing this because Putin is very, very, very, very difficult not to break.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:05.080]  Now, going to Italy, I don't know how much time we have, but just a few words about that.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:11.080]  Italy is not Spain. Spain is being wiped out, is actually, you know, giving up for dead.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.080]  That's what Bilderberg has agreed on.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:20.080]  Now, Italy is in a much better situation because, unlike Spain, Italy has never had much of a real estate bubble.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.080]  Second of all, Italy, unlike Spain, has very little private debt.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:30.080]  And also, Italy's hopes of the Venetian Black nobility and its far-reaching first-trade backing apparatus,
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:37.080]  stretching back almost 750 years as well as hundreds of first-trade companies with secure niches in the world,
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:44.080]  export markets, and most of these companies, they form an important part of some of the world's most powerful,
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.080]  secret societies and private organizations, such as Buildable Group.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.080]  Then, of course, there's another very important link in Italy.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.080]  There's an interlocked relationship between the mafia, the state, the corporate world, and the clergy,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:00.080]  which isolates Italy from any impending crisis.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:06.080]  And finally, again, Italy is home to this very little known institution called the Vatican.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.080]  So, you know, all in all, Italy is in a much greater position.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:14.080]  They're home to Venetian Black nobility, which is the base of what Bilderberg is today.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.080]  Also, we've talked about that in the end game, you know, the Venetian nobility.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:26.080]  You know, the situation is not as well as it could be for us, but obviously much better than they had hoped, you know, several years back.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:30.080]  What about domestic things here in the U.S. tidbits?
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.080]  I see the media swinging towards Mitt Romney.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.080]  I see the left establishment coming out against Obama.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:40.080]  I see a lot of king-makers drifting towards him.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.080]  I see Bloomberg coming out and doing a purposed leak saying he's endorsing Romney.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.080]  Did you get any word on who the Bilderberg group wants for the U.S. elections?
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.080]  Because our information looks like they're leaning towards Romney.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.080]  You know, I'd say the same thing. I don't have a lot of information on that.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:05.080]  But from which pieces I have heard, that makes a lot of sense because Obama, you know, he's spent, you know, he was good.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.080]  You know, there's just too many people that figured his game.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.080]  And if, you know, they figured out Obama's game, he's no good to the Bilderbergers.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.080]  So they need somebody else, a fresh base with fresh ideas.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:22.080]  So I see quite likely because I also see a lot of, you know, positioning behind the scenes.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:25.080]  You know, there's a lot of in the intelligent world, in the intelligence world.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.080]  There's a lot of, you know, consistently, you know, games are being played and system being tested.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.080]  So the way system is being tested right now in the intelligence world,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.080]  I see a lot of possibilities that Romney is actually going to be the presidential candidate.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:44.080]  And that's all going to be obvious. He depends on his ability to present his ideas to the American public.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.080]  And this is exactly the same thing that happened back in 2008.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.080]  And we talked about this on your show.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.080]  You know, Bilderbergers said Obama is going to be the candidate.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.080]  He's his presidency to lose.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080]  He won the presidency. He didn't do as well as they had hoped.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.080]  Now, four years later, a new man is going to come in.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.080]  Again, that all depends on Romney. It doesn't depend on Bilderberg.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:09.080]  They can pick a candidate, you know, they got two, you know, two horses in this race, the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:14.080]  But it's up to Romney to actually make a plan and convince, you know, quote-unquote the Americans
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.080]  that he is going to be the leader to lead America through the difficult period.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.080]  So at a certain point, as long as they own both the candidates, they'll let them battle it out.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.080]  Exactly. They always own the candidate.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.080]  You know, the game plan has been set. You know, the pieces are in place.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:35.080]  So just the question of, there's always, you know, 10, 15% unknown factors of what could actually happen.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:41.080]  You know, we talked about this scenario, you know, back in 2006, 2007, when there was plans
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:46.080]  or at least talk about assassinating Ron Paul and, you know, the trial balloon at the time was
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.080]  what would happen if this were to happen? That thankfully didn't happen.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:53.080]  But the point is that these are the kinds of games that they play.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.080]  Hold on. I want to hear in our final segment what you're getting at with that.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:00.080]  Here's some information with Daniel Ustalin, DanielUstalin.com.

[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.080]  Alright, he's with us about five minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:18.080]  Then a big news blitz ahead of a guest joining us who's having his home taken a World War II hero.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.080]  Daniel, you were finishing up with Ron Paul.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:24.080]  They don't want to ask you about the U.S. economy briefly.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:28.080]  And then, a few years ago, you got invited by Fidel Castro to Cuba.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.080]  Tell us what that was like. You've got the floor.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.080]  I actually went to see him in August 2010 at the end of August.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.080]  And he loved the book. You didn't know what he liked.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:44.080]  I'm not sure whether he knew or built it, but he certainly understands the world politics and geopolitics.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.080]  And inviting me to Cuba, I spent one week with him. We had a three-and-a-half-hour meeting,
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:54.080]  which was invited into about an hour-and-a-half meeting with him and I and other journalists,
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.080]  asking questions on his behalf.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:00.080]  Castro and I had a 15-minute private conversation.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.080]  And then we had lunch with some of the dignitaries of the Cuban government.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:09.080]  But what was interesting about this whole thing is he understands better than most politicians
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  about who actually want things in the world.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.080]  He spends most of his time reading. He understands where all these individuals come from.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.080]  He knows them personally, obviously.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.080]  And we're talking about, for example, immortality and demand destruction and zero growth.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.080]  He understood these concepts from the word going up. He explained it to him.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  He knew exactly how things run. And I tell you, for an 85-year-old man,
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  he had incredible charisma if he actually read in the American policies.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.080]  Even without speaking English, he'd wind his whole thing, you know, hands down
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:40.080]  because there's no prepared speeches.
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.080]  You know, there's no teleprompter. It's just a guy.
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.080]  Fidel Castro, you know, talking.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:48.080]  It doesn't matter, as you said earlier, whether you left or you right.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.080]  And, you know, I certainly have no relation to people whatsoever.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.080]  But it's still, it's amazing how you talk to an individual like Castro
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.080]  and you realize how much you can actually offer, you know,
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  from the point of view of knowledge and understanding and wisdom.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:08.080]  And you also realize how little American press knows about him.
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.080]  Well, I know that early on the CIA worked with him,
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.080]  but then supposedly there was a falling out.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.080]  Well, you know, there's obviously been over, you know, I can tell you one thing.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  He has tremendous security. And if we actually got him to see him,
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  you know, I was pushed ten times over, obviously, you know, he had,
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.080]  I don't know, 20, 30 bodyguards around him.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:30.080]  But he actually sat down and, you know, for our meeting,
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.080]  the whole atmosphere was very relaxed, very, you know, outgoing.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.080]  And he was a very, very funny man.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.080]  After the meeting, they took me throughout the week that I was actually there
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:44.080]  to see the Chernobyl Center.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:48.080]  One of the kids from the Soviet Union, from Ukraine,
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.080]  were there actually being nursed back to health.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:56.080]  And over the past 20 years, over 20,000 kids have passed through Chernobyl
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.080]  and Cuba, obviously being a very poor nation.
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.080]  All these kids are being treated for free,
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  something which is unfathomable in the United States.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.080]  I'm not promoting Cuba, I'm just saying what I saw with my eyes,
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:12.080]  and it's amazing, you know, how the whole idea of nation states,
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.080]  and what's actually, you know, common good,
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080]  what actually is working, something is working,
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.080]  how much good that actually does for the community.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:22.080]  Well, what's interesting is that he invited you there
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.080]  because he'd read your book, I saw that in Reuters everywhere,
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.080]  you know, that Fidel Castro is looking into the New World Order,
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:31.080]  because it really is the real politics,
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.080]  whether you like Castro or hate him or are indifferent.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.080]  The fact is, this is real, there are shadowy banking cartels
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.080]  that are trying to govern our planet.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.080]  They're trying to get a total world government.
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.080]  The question is, will we let them?
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:48.080]  Because of all the ideologies, the globalists are the worst.
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.080]  They want global government, the end of the family,
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:53.080]  and mass extermination.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:58.080]  They are like aliens from another planet come to kill us.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.080]  Well, you know, if we're going to take our country, our country is back.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:04.080]  We have to do it now before any more rights are taken
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.080]  and any more people disappear and before we lose all control.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.080]  So we have to stand up, understand that this is real,
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  understand that this isn't some figment of imagination
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.080]  of some guy who writes a book or a radio personality
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:19.080]  who sells something on the radio.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.080]  This is real, folks, who at Wall Street Italy talks about it.
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:26.080]  I mean, also, not only did I see Castro,
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:29.080]  but I also gave him two speeches at the European Parliament,
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:32.080]  which is an equivalent of the United States Congress.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.080]  And in these speeches, very well attended by international media
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:39.080]  and he was to say, not reported at all in the American press, but widely.
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.080]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.080]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:57.080]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:33.080]  This is what my family uses.

[01:59:53.080 --> 02:00:15.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:23.080]  On the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.080]  All right, we're doing five more minutes with Daniel Estolin
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:28.080]  left over from the last hour finishing up.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.080]  He's written nonfiction books that are best sellers.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  He's got a fiction, but he can put more reality in that
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080]  than a regular book and get away with it.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080]  The octopus conspiracy is coming out in the U.S. in September.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.080]  We're going to get him on about that in September.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.080]  Look forward to carrying it at info warshop.com.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.080]  But Daniel, finishing up the point you were making out.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080]  You're speaking to the EU Parliament.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:51.080]  You're not just going to visit it with Phil Castro.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  This information is really breaking through.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  That's why they never wanted to admit it existed.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.080]  Because once you admit there's cabals running things
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.080]  and that presidents and prime ministers are puppets in the West,
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.080]  we could begin to have a real political debate
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.080]  and maybe get our power back, get our countries back.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.080]  Well, this is exactly what's happening.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.080]  The thing is that a lot of the Bilderbergs way back when,
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.080]  when I wrote my first book in 2005 on true story of the Bilderberg group,
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.080]  people were taking us for free saying that this is nonsense.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.080]  It doesn't exist.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.080]  Well, of course, okay, it does exist.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.080]  But these people are just a pointless debating society.
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.080]  They don't really do any harm.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.080]  That's what a lot of people were saying.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.080]  And now we're getting mainstream publications
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  such as Badity Fair in Spain.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.080]  They gave me three pages, a couple of weeks ago, Wall Street, Italy,
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.080]  you know, full-page coverage.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.080]  We have Costco, we have European Parliament,
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.080]  Mario Borgesio, one of the most important
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.080]  European parliamentarians.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:53.080]  You know, he's always, you know, promoting me in the European Parliament,
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:55.080]  talking about Bilderberg.
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.080]  You covered that as well on Infowars.com.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.080]  So there's a lot of attention being paid right now
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.080]  by the mainstream press and by the people who know what's going on.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:08.080]  Our sources, as I said to you before, were from a Bilderberg documentary
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:11.080]  which was released in a couple of months worldwide.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:16.080]  And we have, you know, people from, for example, Rothschild Europe
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  who said that they would love to participate.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.080]  They know that everything I'm saying is absolutely true,
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.080]  but they just simply can't because they can't do it as an individual
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:26.080]  and as an entity.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.080]  They're simply afraid to do it.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.080]  Hold on, that's big.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.080]  Hi, Jen, interrupt.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.080]  You're saying Rothschilds have contacted you
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.080]  because I found it interesting.
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.080]  Robert Dalsky confronted the head of the British royal Rothschild
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.080]  and he stopped and came over to Luke almost in a friendly way
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  and then Luke kind of said stuff back to him.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  Luke wishes he would have waited and be nice
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  and then it's a Rothschild walked away, but...
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:53.080]  These people are not the individual I'm talking about.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.080]  Their last name is not Rothschild,
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:03:00.080]  but they're obviously a very high level of Rothschild Corporation in Europe
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.080]  so they understand what's going on.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.080]  He started something, you know, Joe Blower, Joe Sixpack
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.080]  who doesn't know anything at all.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.080]  These people know who runs the world
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  and so they have both plans at all saying you're absolutely right.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.080]  We just can't say it.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:17.080]  You know, we had Martin Wolf, I sent him an email saying,
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.080]  I'm working on a documentary.
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:19.080]  Do you want to participate?
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.080]  And he sent me a reply saying,
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:25.080]  how dare you work on a build-up of a documentary
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.080]  and I will never give you an interview.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.080]  Needless to say, that's going in the film as well.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.080]  So we're actually ruffling a lot of feathers.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:34.080]  Now, I wouldn't be able to do this by myself
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.080]  if I hadn't had access to programs such as yours.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.080]  That's going to be worldwide as soon as, you know,
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:40.080]  this broadcast ends.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080]  It's going to be on your page and my page.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.080]  And people from Japan to South Korea to Australia and Argentina
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.080]  will be able to listen to it and pass it on to their friends.
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:54.080]  So we're actually doing a lot of damage to these people, Alex.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.080]  Final question in the one minute.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.080]  We have Daniel Leslin, DanielLeslin.com
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.080]  and obviously I want to get you back for the film and the book.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.080]  Are there any breaks inside the elite families themselves?
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:09.080]  Are any of them not liking what their families are doing?
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:11.080]  You know, unfortunately, I don't think so
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:13.080]  because, you know, you're talking about a close-knit circle
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:16.080]  of the elite themselves and you have the others
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:18.080]  who come and join these meetings but they're not as important.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:21.080]  It's within these others who come and join on regular,
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.080]  not so regular basis that you're seeing a lot of discontent
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:28.080]  by the elite themselves. It's a small nucleus
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  and they're united. They understand their goals
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.080]  and it's like a close-knit family.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.080]  They have an economic enemy that's us
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  and they're working against us.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.080]  We are their enemy.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  Wow, powerful interview.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  There's the name of the interview right there.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  We posted on the web after it's live today, just aired,
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  the Bilderberg's enemy.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  The Bilderberg has an enemy. It's us or Bilderberg.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.080]  I got to think about that.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.080]  Daniel Leslin, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.080]  Thanks a lot, Alex, to you.

[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:27.080]  having his house taken.

[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.080]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.080]  deep behind enemy lines,
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:08.080]  the information war continues.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:26.200]  radio network okay coming up at the bottom of the hour Stuart Rhodes of
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:31.280]  Oathkeepers is going to be joining us this article is up at info wars.com
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:40.360]  right now World War two war hero has land and home stolen and they are
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:44.600]  coming to take us home they've already announced it's theirs and it again it
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:49.160]  wasn't the mortgage from what the info I have from Stuart Rhodes it is that he's
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:52.880]  bankrupt so now they're gonna take us house don't they have homesteads we're
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.720]  this guy's base we're trying to get him on as well as hearings not good and he's
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:01.440]  on his way to the VA right now but I've just seen how these banks and people
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.960]  prey on old people and it makes me really really really angry you know we bail
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:10.640]  them out with tens of trillions of dollars and then for creditors he's
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:16.040]  saying for medical bills and credit card bills they're taking his house so it
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:21.680]  looks like the it's the trustee of the bankruptcy as soon as you have a talking
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:26.880]  to about this stuff just just amazing to see this kind of stuff happening I
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:32.360]  don't forget I talked about this at the in the first hour I'm launching a

[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:43.240]  again to expose the fact that the presidency is becoming a dictatorship
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:49.640]  and the president right now is Obama and we did another one of these operations
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:55.320]  three years ago and media all over the US implied it was illegal to criticize
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:01.680]  the president and we have clips of those newscast actually in a video posted
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:06.840]  there titled stop dictator Obama now there's $15,000 in prizes by the way I

[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.920]  where oh well you've already won now I'm reading about swim teams even big swim
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.840]  teams where if somebody has keeps winning all the blue ribbons and all the
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:02.160]  all the best at the meat in their age group that they're now not going to let
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:08.360]  you have have it the second time and I'm hearing about people that win spelling
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:12.480]  bees at schools now aren't allowed to win the next time or disqualified this is
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.560]  actually in the news so I guess on swim team my son and my daughter both win the
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:25.120]  blue ribbons almost every time I was a good swimmer as well man about a state
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.720]  and I swam like three seasons it was winning almost every time and I was
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:32.640]  like 12 and looked at my parents and said I don't want to do this anymore and
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:42.520]  they said okay okay you don't have to do this anymore I wish that I would have
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.600]  been made to continue to do it but that's another side issue I am getting
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:52.200]  bleed over and I don't know if I'm getting it from Genesis up in Minnesota
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:59.320]  or I don't know if I'm getting it in here but it is driving me absolutely
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:08.760]  crazy it's probably from Genesis because it's another show but it is
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:14.240]  extremely irritating very irritating okay I mean I don't know how you're supposed
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.800]  to a radio show with so much senior here and if you guys can't hear it I can hear
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:22.280]  it I can I could you know I'm just letting everybody know because we always
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:31.120]  go through that process of you know just went away must be on Genesis 10 thank
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:41.040]  you John wait a minute it's me it's a second delay it's Alex Jones
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:51.200]  echo echo boy nobody's more annoying than me I have to hear myself people have
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.840]  my show on even at night up here listening to it I'll walk around the
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:57.880]  office going turn it off turn it off don't make me listen to that guy anymore
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:05.640]  once is enough I said I'd cover news didn't I well I've already read all
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:11.000]  this news I covered a bunch of before I first got on air but it is all so crazy
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.280]  okay let me just go over this report let's just start somewhere woman arrested
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:22.480]  for groping TSA supervisor federal agency characterizes incident as active
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  violence and it goes on here that the woman is was a former TSA person but
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:36.120]  quit doing it and then she was flying out to go to a funeral and was had her
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.280]  genitals and brass grabbed so when she called a supervisor over and explained
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  to them that they're not supposed to grab them that hard and showed the woman
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.440]  what was happening she was arrested for assault sexual assault so again they're
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.360]  gonna sexually assault you and if a cop did this without it being an emergency
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:59.680]  situation they'd get charged but these people can do it because the federal
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:04.440]  government says so Carol Price herself a former TSA screener was traveling to
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.040]  brothers funeral in Cleveland Ohio by way of Southwest Florida International
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:16.440]  Airport after Price became infuriated at receiving a pat down which included

[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:25.000]  growing gardens and I've seen other areas you've people been arrested before
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.480]  for gardens and then the code inspector shows up and people show them they go
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:35.000]  well it says I can have a garden city ordinance well I say it's objectionable
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.520]  and you notice it says anything that we find objectionable well I guess you're
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:43.160]  God then code inspector I've run into some code inspectors that are the scum
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.120]  of the earth I've run into some others that are real nice people but more and
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.360]  more they want to hire people that hate private property and hate people's
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:57.080]  freedom but maybe I'm an extremist I mean maybe the right for the Amish to
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:01.280]  have milk maybe the right to have your own no privacy in your homes wrong maybe
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:06.800]  I'm wrong look at this NYPD stop and frisk they had 200 plus thousand in the
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.720]  first three months of this year we haven't gotten new numbers this has
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:15.200]  happened to yours truly in England and in London England and in New York where
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.040]  the police search your car search your person and if you say well what about the
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:23.840]  Fourth Amendment they scream at you and threaten to taser you and take you to
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:27.920]  jail if I have some of this on video in martial law I'm walking down the street
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:30.920]  and a cop comes over and says what are you doing with the video camera and I
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:36.000]  said well I'm media because about 400 yards away was the big facility they
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.440]  were holding the protesters out there on pier 57 and he started screaming at me
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:45.160]  saying you shut up you know you filth and all this stuff and it's just like
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.200]  wow you really are a gang member with a badge and gun you were you were like a
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:54.240]  North Korean police officer you're everything wrong with this country and
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.360]  imagine living in New York none of it has anything to do with the staged
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:02.640]  events at 9-11 the cops that breathe the deadly dust treated like garbage they
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.080]  don't care as long as they can bully some people and again we don't want
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.160]  police to become like this everywhere that's why we're criticizing it
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:16.880]  Bloomberg remains firm on stop and frisk policy it's not a law it's a policy
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.280]  it's a policy for the TSA to grow up your daughter your wife your son it's a
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:30.320]  policy to put you in a microwave system it's a policy a policy look at this
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:35.600]  curtain-emo article info wars.com linked to Declan McCullough seen that news this
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:40.520]  is not a joke FBI wants to outlaw new internet technology they say that they
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:44.720]  don't want to force companies to give them back doors everything just outlaw
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:50.160]  new forms of internet communications I'm not joking the FBI wants Congress to
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:57.080]  pass a law that would prevent limitation talk about a Luddite of new and more
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.320]  effective internet communications protocol it proposes IPv6 because it
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:08.960]  is more difficult to trace users IPv5 makes surveillance easier so they want
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:14.320]  IPv6 banned the FBI Drug Enforcement Administration because somebody might
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  commit a crime on the internet somebody might grow pot in their garden so you
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:24.080]  can't have one in Tulsa there's no law but we have guns now there it is on
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:27.400]  screen if you're watching at prisonplanet.tv FBI Drug Enforcement
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.240]  Administration in Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers have told industry
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:36.240]  representatives that IPv6 traceability is necessary to identify people
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:39.600]  suspicious of crimes the FBI has even suggested that the new law may be
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:43.880]  necessary if the private sector doesn't do enough voluntarily the FBI is upset
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:47.520]  about going dark problem in other words it's having difficulty keeping up with
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:50.720]  changes in technology it's from the domestic communications assistant
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.640]  center to keep up with the speed instead of figuring out how to trace the new
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.840]  protocol the FBI wants the federal government to come up with law that
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:02.920]  prevents ISPs the agency describes as lazy from using more efficient
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:08.560]  technology so they want to ban people using one type because they say it's not
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.920]  as easy for them the IP also wants to force ISPs as internet service
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.760]  providers to spend their own money and time keeping records of what IP addresses
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.560]  their customers are assigned Congress approves this burdensome requirement last
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:28.160]  year well I mean IP addresses are public dodo's so I know for websites and
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:32.280]  things why don't you just do it again under the entire I just called my bad

[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:26.960]  that up I mean it fries people this came out earlier this year most of the new
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:31.280]  it was something like 65% of the exact numbers over 60% of the of the whooping
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:36.200]  cough cases in California that they're using as an excuse the increase to try
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.280]  to push vaccination the increase was caused by vaccinated children getting
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:45.960]  it just like 46,000 plus cases of polio that killed over 10,000 from the UN's
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:52.760]  polio program last year in India alone we're on the March the Empire's on the
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:30:02.400]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:06.400]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:10.200]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:14.560]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:18.960]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:23.400]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:28.160]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:31.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:35.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:39.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:43.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:33.760]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live here and this is an amazing report
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:42.400]  we're about to break down here I would like to get our guest on sometime just
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:47.600]  because there are so few world war two vets left out there especially those
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:52.840]  that have seen the type of things that he's seen the gentleman that is having
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:58.520]  his home and his land taken and they want him to exhume his wife is Warren C
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:03.720]  Bodecker 89 year old world war two army airborne combat veteran and war hero
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:07.880]  living in Montana who's being thrown off his own land and thrown out of his own
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:13.800]  house by Montana federal bankruptcy trustee and again the house and land
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:16.760]  from what I know or paid for correct me if I'm wrong we go to Stuart Rhodes of
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:22.360]  Oathkeepers himself a paratrooper of a later era and he's also a constitutional
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:27.320]  lawyer he's also representing Rob doing his suit against the G20 or our
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:32.920]  reporter getting arrested a few years ago that's another issue but Warren C
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:39.800]  Bodecker was one of the people involved in the Los Banos raid is one of the most
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:43.600]  celebrated textbook examples of a perfect rescue operation in military
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:47.720]  history and you can read about it there in the link that's an info wars.com
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:52.360]  World War two war hero is having his land and home stolen over at Oathkeepers
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:58.800]  they also have the article that's where it originates from and it just goes
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:03.280]  over you know all the different things that I mean a real live war hero was
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.600]  part of one of the most famous rescue operations ever parachuting behind
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:11.800]  enemy lines to fight a larger force of Japanese who'd been killing US and
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:16.000]  British troops as they left the POW camps that they had as they were treated so
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.560]  they went in and saved the people before they could kill any of them and he had
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:23.440]  to go to the VA today he's driving down the road he's getting to a better sell
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:27.600]  spot we're gonna call Warren here in a few minutes in fact he's online with us
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.640]  now but I wanted I wanted to bring Stuart Rhodes up first who's gone and
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:35.840]  shot a video interview that's posted at info wars.com we're gonna play part of
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:39.640]  that coming up as well but Stuart because you're a lawyer you've met with him
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.120]  you know the case give us the specifics because you know this is happening to
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.600]  veterans all over the country and not just veterans the citizens and the big
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:51.480]  banks have been caught taking houses that are totally paid for they don't
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:56.920]  even have deeds to in this case though I didn't know that you could take people's
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.440]  houses if they were retired and they were homesteaded their house if it was
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.000]  their only residence and if they were retired at least in Texas and most other
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.440]  states I know you're up in Montana as well so you're you're the one breaking
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:14.760]  the story a constitutional lawyer Stuart Rhodes what do you make of this
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.320]  what's happening and tell us tell us about Warren C. Bodecker well what this
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:25.120]  really is is is elder abuse and what they did is he didn't disclose some silver
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:30.760]  coins that he had that him and his wife have been storing away since 1964 you
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.360]  know they store food their LDS they've stored food all their lives and they
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.840]  also socked away some silver and they never spent it and in his mind this was
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.880]  his retirement and so he didn't disclose it because he didn't disclose that and
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:47.280]  his and he had a relative of his unfortunately rat him out to the court
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:51.520]  his stepson and when they found that out then they dropped a hammer on him and
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.520]  said you didn't disclose this and so we're gonna take everything you own we're
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.640]  gonna do an adversarial procedure that's ridiculous if he had something back in
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:03.480]  the 60s I mean that's his well you know he should have disclosed it even if it's
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.560]  exempt they're supposed to disclose this is the problem here's a man who doesn't
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:10.880]  understand complex legal issues doesn't understand bankruptcy and they get him
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:14.000]  in this position and once they got that once they got something on and they just
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.200]  went after him like a mad dog and they just said you know if you fight us we'll
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.760]  take everything you have you'll end up penniless we'll we'll attack your
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.520]  homestead we'll void your homestead we'll deny you the discharge and so they
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.480]  they pressured him into signing a stipulation that agreed to wave us
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:36.160]  homestead and give up his his his bankruptcy and so they just he wanted
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:38.760]  but nothing in the end he didn't get anything out of it they went ahead and
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:45.800]  denied him the bankruptcy and wiped away over some so over some coins losing a
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:49.920]  house to land everything right and so they pressured me in signing this and
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:53.520]  we're gonna challenge this on his capacity to understand what he was
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:58.480]  signing his lawyer at the time gave him I think horrendous advice there's no way
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:02.160]  they're gonna put an old man like this in prison so it was an empty threat but
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.080]  they pressured and threatened him with prison time and they pressured me into
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:09.000]  signing away his his right to his homestead and as you said earlier when
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.680]  you have a homestead like that creditors can't get it so he didn't better off if
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.360]  he just unplugged his phone and threw all the bills in the trash and ignored that
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.080]  the banks exactly but people don't know this in fact I mean they have the
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.760]  Department of Education swat team people over unpaid bills to create a
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:31.640]  national fear that you can be arrested if you don't pay tuition which is a
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:36.720]  fraud there is no law we don't have debtors prison that's what 1776 was all
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:42.640]  about while the bankers steal billions but continuing here this is amazing so
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:46.800]  obviously somebody wanted that house somebody wanted to be able to sell it
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:52.760]  and so over yeah exactly and this is this is the problem is is that from what I
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.840]  know bankruptcy and after calling I'm not a bank lawyer but I called several and
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.360]  they said well that the trustee gets a percentage of whatever she can bring into
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:04.880]  the estate and so if she can attack successfully attack his homestead and
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:10.080]  bring the home into the estate for the creditors then she gets a cut and and
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:14.520]  this is the other thing is this trustee hired herself as the lawyer for the
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:19.680]  estate and as the lawyer for the trustee so she's her own lawyer and so she's
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:24.560]  charging legal fees to advise herself and to advise the estate and then she's
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:28.160]  being paid a percentage apparently a percentage of the take the whole thing
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.360]  oh well I tell you so this is a whole ball of worms here Stuart as a
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.080]  constitutional lawyer I know top of your class but what was I mean this is a
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:40.520]  whole nother legal hat to wear here but I'm not a lawyer but this looks like
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:43.920]  somebody's gonna be in some big trouble unless the local judge and everybody
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:48.680]  are in on it here's the problem this guy is a famous war hero tell us about that
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:52.360]  and then we're gonna bring a warren C. Bodecker up well he said earlier he's
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.960]  part of one of the most famous rescues he along with 121 other paratroopers
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:02.760]  they parachuted in at seven o'clock in the morning first thing in the morning
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.320]  when they knew the Japanese guards about exercising and they caught him with
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:12.120]  their pants down they rescued 2,000 over 2,000 civilians and also military
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:15.360]  including men women and children and they knew that the Japanese were gonna
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:18.720]  slaughter them all and they knew that that's why they did this they went in
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.040]  behind enemy lines got them out and and when they came back and the Japanese
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:28.040]  retook the area they took revenge on a local population and and kill 1,500
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.960]  Filipino men women and children villagers to get revenge on them for
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:36.360]  aiding for aiding the raid and so this is this is a good example I mean if
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.160]  warren hadn't done this and him and his fellow paratroopers had not done this
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.840]  all 2,200 of those prisoners would have been slaughtered and then they would
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.560]  never have had children and grandchildren you can probably figure
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.600]  about 50,000 people wouldn't exist on this by the way I'm I've never been in
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:55.000]  the military I'm not even a history buff when it comes to military I knew
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:58.840]  about this raid as I remember over the decade ago seeing a show on it on I
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.960]  think it was history channel about this this is a very famous so I mean this
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.760]  guy really is part of a serious war hero operation now here he is they're gonna
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:11.280]  have to dig up his wife I want to bring him up he's on the road having to go to
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:16.160]  the VA right now war and he goes by Ren C. Bodecker a nine-year-old World War
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:23.160]  2 Army airborne combat veteran of a whole bunch of combat jumps a ren if you
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:28.320]  can hear me you're speaking to several million people what would you like to
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:35.440]  say about what's happening to you I can't believe it I can't believe what

[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:09.920]  buried on the property she died July 3rd of last year with cancer and I buried
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:14.880]  her now they tell me I've got to dig her up and move her in 30 days time that is
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:19.880]  cruel and very abusive I'm just interrupting stir it roads up stirred I
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.840]  mean aren't this a lawsuit waiting to happen I mean at this type of cruel
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:27.400]  behavior towards somebody well unfortunately they've they'd like to
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.680]  not cease legalize everything they did apparently this is now legal they've
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:37.160]  made it legal in fact he was in the hospital last week being tested for
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:40.680]  prostate cancer he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer and they had a
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.440]  hearing on this and he was not able to attend he from this hospital bed he
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.880]  sent he faxed in a motion to continue and the judge denied it so there's no
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:53.520]  excuse for him not being there my god who is okay I'm gonna go back to him we
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:57.160]  obviously need to get on this judge with the public in Montana if you don't go
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:01.440]  stand up for this guy you get what you deserve the rest of America I'm sick of
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:05.640]  watching them pick on old people this is how I got started on air 17 years ago
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.480]  as people remember those newscast I did with them taking old people's land for
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:14.560]  three inch grass with the health department claiming that it was a zone
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:18.720]  violation so all so I sort of go into city council people's houses and show
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:22.400]  them they had taller grass and demanding that they get in trouble and they
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:27.200]  backed off where are people standing up for old folks and now now I'm gonna go
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:30.720]  back to rent here in just a minute but Stuart tell us how you got in contact
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:34.920]  with him and then you can ask him the question since you know him well I went
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:39.560]  down to a vfw hall to give an oath keeper presentation in Sanders County in
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:44.160]  Plains where he lives and the other veterans there told me about this and
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:48.560]  then I got in contact right with him we're trying to find him a really good
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:51.840]  bankruptcy lawyer I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer I just don't know that system and
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.640]  so we got to find somebody who's an ace bankruptcy lawyer who will go in there
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:44:00.240]  and fight my lawyer is my mom Eric tab here in town but he's beats the city all
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.240]  the time and in the feds but he I don't think he can practice in Montana well if
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:07.480]  he's admitted to federal bankruptcy court I believe he can he can be admitted
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.840]  pro high VJ so I think he could so please put him in touch with me alright I
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:17.440]  will call my lawyer let's go back to ran I mean why don't you ask him some of
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:21.560]  the questions here Stuart since you know him well ran I'm just give the people
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:25.640]  here a background like you said earlier you planned on on being buried there
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.640]  with your wife you never intended to sell your property isn't that right that's
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:36.160]  correct and and why'd you sign this stipulation did you feel I mean did they
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:39.560]  threaten you with prison and we're taking everything away from you leaving
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:45.960]  you penniless yes they said I could face federal prison under the fraud act and
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:52.000]  that I could end up in prison if I didn't do make some changes I don't
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.560]  remember exactly how they worded it or anything else but they had me sign a
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:01.960]  waiver on the bankruptcy that I went along with not they've not loaned my
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:07.280]  bankruptcy and I don't remember the details exactly how it was they put it
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:13.640]  to me to release my homestead which I ended up signing off on my home that
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:18.520]  doesn't they could pay the creditors right I do remember the details this
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:23.720]  stipulation says that in exchange for them not doing it through an adversarial
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:29.120]  process waving your homestead or avoiding your homestead and denying the
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:34.120]  discharge that you agree to do those two things you agree to wave your homestead
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:38.360]  and not the discharge and sell your home and so you really got nothing out of it
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:42.520]  except they told you well if you don't do it this way we'll eat up all of it with
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:46.520]  with attorney's fees and costs and in the end you want to penniless let me ask
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.720]  Ren this Ren are they praying on other elderly folks in your area because I've
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:55.880]  seen a pattern nationwide of shaking down and and and getting people to sign
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:00.760]  documents they don't understand here in this the sickening country we live in
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:04.920]  where they where they you know Time Magazine and Newsweek glorify euthanizing
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:08.480]  people like you do you know other veterans or folks in your area being
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:15.280]  prayed on no I don't not as such I've heard as I've watched it different
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:19.040]  things on the computer I've read different things like in Florida and
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.240]  other places where they're doing not the exact same thing but they are taking
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:28.400]  homes away from the veterans and putting them out on the street I don't
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:34.920]  know what's going on terrible you know all over the United States how long do
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:40.880]  you have till they make you exhum your wife and move off your property they
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:45.080]  have not sent me a notice in the mail but at that hearing on the 12th that I
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:50.720]  couldn't beat you they said I had to move her off and 30 days time so you're in
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.560]  the hospital and you sent that into the judge who is this judge do we know
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:59.800]  stirred who this judge is yes his last name is kershter he's the federal judge
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:08.320]  for Montana for bankruptcy the doctor said in an affidavit to the judge that
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:13.240]  it was impossible for me to leave the hospital and I believe the way I heard
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:18.440]  that the attorney for the veteran there and for Harrison also contacted the
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:23.760]  judge had told him I couldn't be there the judge says it doesn't matter it just
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.680]  went ahead with the trial without me there I had this lady that's really been
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:33.760]  helping me rock sad Ryan and I gave her power of attorney to act for me and they
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.560]  would pay attention about she said and they ended up that ended up giving the
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.440]  property selling the property that's worth between three fifty four hundred
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:48.360]  thousand dollars for a hundred fifty five thousand dollars to this party they
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:52.760]  gave us till last night it was actually was Sunday night to be out of my home
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:58.080]  with all my stuff and it's three o'clock yesterday they were gonna send the
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:03.480]  sheriff or deputy and a locksmith to change the locks on my door so I could
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:06.880]  no longer get in yeah I should have added how immediate this is you're going
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:11.080]  to the VA right now you've pulled over just to this interview for treatment for
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:15.160]  cancer I mean this is out this is insane
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.240]  correct me if I'm wrong Stuart but you told me off air you told do off air is
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:23.720]  it true the sheriff refused yesterday to go throw him out and told the feds they
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:28.400]  can just do it themselves that's right the sheriff of Sanders County Tom
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:34.060]  Rommel I met him down at Sheriff Max Sheriff's Conference and he called the
[02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:38.080]  trustee yesterday and let her know that he believes that Wren his due process
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.320]  rights were denied when he wasn't allowed to be it he couldn't be at the
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:45.240]  hearing wasn't allowed to continue the hearing they went without him so he
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:48.640]  said I'm not gonna not gonna give you a deputy to do a standby and so they
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:52.000]  usually do is it's in a deputy along whenever they elect somebody he said
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.640]  not gonna send a deputy you have to do it on your own go find somebody else to
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:58.960]  be your muscle so I think that's a really you know it's one silver lining in
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:04.520]  this horrible story she did not show up in fact the bank the locksmith did not
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:07.480]  show up neither did the buyer no one showed up yesterday they all stayed
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:10.800]  away I think they're you know like cockroaches scurrying from the light
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.800]  they don't want to confront us angry veterans they don't want to confront the
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.720]  news media we call the local media out there well you know we sent reporters up
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.880]  to Georgia where that man who had chickens for decades in the edge of town
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:30.360]  they were trying to take his house and we we found out the sheriff's department
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:34.480]  the police none of them were there my intel is they had army from brigade
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:39.600]  homeland dressed up to carry out the eviction and that that's what happened
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:43.840]  and I've confirmed Stuart they have military dressed up all over the country
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:50.080]  now helping carry out federal takeovers of property have you got any info on
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:54.720]  that no not here in Montana and there was nobody there only the volunteers
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:58.160]  that's veterans who were there to help him get his stuff oh that's why they
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:02.560]  didn't show up no I'm just saying around the country we've confirmed that
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:05.760]  they're trying to I'm sure you saw the head of the army two weeks ago in the
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.600]  CFR called for garrisoning regular troops in every city yes I did yeah I saw
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:15.480]  that just amazing times to be alive ran as a I mean I like to get shown some
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:19.560]  time just to talk about that rescue operation but you know way back then in
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:24.760]  1945 rescuing those thousands of people could you ever have imagined that that
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:34.640]  they'd be trying to take your homestead no way I was fighting for people to
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:41.160]  save their lives and for this country and the freedom of the Constitution and
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:47.640]  it's been totally reversed on me well that's why we had laws against taking
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:51.680]  people's homestead because of these criminal carpet baggers I'm sorry go
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:55.520]  ahead but now we're a nation we are a nation ruled by carpet bagging
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:00.160]  banksters I'm sorry go ahead to start lots of good point I mean the founders
[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:03.840]  put bankruptcy in place to help people who were in financial trouble and now
[02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:07.640]  it's being turned into a weapon and these banks are like a bunch of pirates and
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:12.600]  these trustees are the same way they get bailed out but but ran gets no mercy and
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:17.320]  why I wanted to ask rent ran if you had been captured by the Japanese you know
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:21.080]  what they did to POWs let me ask would you rather be captured by the Japanese
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:25.120]  and tortured and starved or would you rather have happened to you what just
[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:29.000]  happened to you just now being forced to dig your wife's body up which one do you
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.200]  think is worse I miss part of what you said I guess we're let me ask you this
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:39.560]  oh wait wait have you already had to dig your wife up sir no I have not yet
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:43.440]  let me I he was asking you would you rather have been captured by the
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:47.880]  Japanese when you saved those thousands of people or would you what's worse
[02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:52.440]  being captured by the Japanese or having to dig your wife up well I would
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:57.280]  understand if I'd have been captured by the Japanese because we were in war I
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:02.520]  would understand understood what I was facing I do not understand what I'm
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:09.520]  facing here with my home paid for and built by my wife and myself that we I
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:13.120]  was kicked out and had to get everything and lost almost everything I
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:18.320]  said well see here's the big lie they hound you and push you to pay off medical
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:21.960]  bills I was told is what a lot of it is well you can't I mean medical bills are
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:25.680]  not supposed to hound you for those to begin with and you know here you are
[02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:29.080]  people locally make a business all over the country out of taking all folks
[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:34.000]  homes I've seen it myself and then you get manipulated into this and now
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:37.960]  because you had some silver coins set aside as your emergency backup and you
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:41.760]  live in a modest home of a modest piece of property they're trying now
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:46.440]  threatening you with prison to induce you to waive your rights to get the
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:49.760]  property I mean if that isn't racketeering right there from just what
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:55.840]  I've seen I don't know what is Stuart Rhodes well I think it is I think it's
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.640]  I think it's a it's like I said it's elder abuse it's a systematic pressuring
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:05.160]  I mean this is not this is not justice a government lawyer under the under the
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:10.760]  ethics rules for lawyers the first obligation is to do justice if he did
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:13.960]  something that he should not have done if you should have disclosed assets
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:18.560]  fine then don't give him the bankruptcy have him pay his creditors out of that
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:23.720]  money out of those coins that is justice to go from that and go forward and then
[02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:29.160]  take his home take his land force him to dig up his wife's body so he can be
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:33.280]  buried next to her someplace else that is not justice that's brutality let me
[02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:38.160]  ask you this question I'm sorry go ahead oh go ahead how many coins did you
[02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:50.120]  have when I don't think you can hear me ran can you hear me we'll call him back
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:52.840]  yeah he's out there in the middle of nowhere in Montana we'll call him back
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:55.720]  stirred you know how many coins there were cuz like you said they should have
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:59.840]  just said use these to pay off creditors I mean I think he had I think he had a
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:05.120]  pretty good pretty good stack he had like a blue is like 600 coins 600 ounces so
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:08.760]  yeah he had a pretty good I'm not sure though but one thing that wasn't about it
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:14.320]  is the person that that was helping him store the coins I believe it turns out
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:19.160]  that he also went to the court and says I know where his coins are and I'm
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:23.480]  pretty sure it's his girlfriend or fiance that's wanting it by the property so
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:26.680]  basically they're selling it to the informant that's what's happening here
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:33.080]  you're kidding no serious oh my god well what is that I mean that is on this
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:38.400]  country is just and ran and ran but and rent a search that this man also stole I
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:41.960]  believe about 60 ounces of silver from you know so that I don't think of the
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:45.520]  exact figure from ran but he thinks the guy you know it came back lighter than
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:50.520]  what when he gave him so oh my gosh there's a trusting old trusting old
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:55.080]  veteran man who are these people that prey on old people I just and I'm sure
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:58.160]  you've seen all the Time Magazine and Newsweek's talking about old people and
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.680]  how how they're you know need to be done away with I mean this this country is
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:07.160]  run by a bunch of demonic snaggle tooth snot nose yuppies I'm telling you right
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:11.800]  now well that's like ghouls that's what really upsets me is that this shouldn't
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:17.840]  be done to anybody first of all any any elderly person but to do this to a more
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:21.920]  hero like this a guy who gave up everything to go fight for his country
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:28.400]  and saw good friends die it's disgusting well the whole system is primed is
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:33.560]  prime for these ghouls to work it we've got ran back his phone cut out ran anything
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:37.400]  else you'd like to add sir anything we can do for you and I know the veterans
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:40.480]  are trying to hang out there and you know be with you but I mean I guess they
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.920]  could come at any time we need to give you the name of the town I mean is there
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:51.280]  anything anybody can do any ideas ran well we've got proof we're totally picked
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:55.120]  out of our home but everything you're almost everything was a few other items
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:02.360]  we did not get it was outside as of last night it's the biggest thing that we all
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:07.360]  need to stand up for our freedom and for the Constitution of this country if we
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:12.520]  don't stand up and start standing up now en masse we'll all be treated like I
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:16.920]  have been treated in the last few months and the guy that reportedly ratted you
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.640]  out and obviously you didn't even know what you were doing you've said that on
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:23.720]  record a steward didn't understand that you thought you keep that he it's his
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:29.480]  girlfriend getting the house no it is no no connection with the people that are
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:34.800]  getting the house at all he's my former stepson no rent that the other guy
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:39.200]  Richard that was helping you with the silver wasn't it his girlfriend that's
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:43.280]  buying the house yes girlfriend or wife I don't know what it is he's told me
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:46.920]  they were married but he's told us that part I believe that he was single that
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:52.600]  she's a single woman so I don't know what happened was his stepson first sent
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:56.880]  a letter to the bankruptcy court that was the first you know the first person
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:01.280]  that ratty what a nice fellow yeah and then his other guy that was helping him
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:05.100]  helping with the silver he also went to the court and said I know where the
[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:11.320]  silver is and let me tell you wow as this country unravels it's gonna get bad
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:15.880]  can you imagine all the rats running around out there start yeah it's a
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.920]  problem is no there's no more honor in this country and no more sense of
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:22.680]  justice and people just do I mean not everybody but that there's so many like
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:26.560]  this who just do whatever it takes to get something for themselves and act like
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:30.200]  pirate yeah it'd be one thing if you ratted somebody out an old man because
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:32.680]  you thought they were supposed to turn in some silver that I wouldn't do that
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:37.960]  that's dirty but to do it for yourself but those folks are buying so much bad
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:42.360]  luck with what they've done they might as well be Judas Iscariot that's right
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:45.840]  and ran how many how many ounces of silver do you believe this man stole from
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:52.920]  you how many ounces of silver did he see that he took I've had a total of
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:58:01.560]  1,300 ounces stolen from me I had a total of 2,600 ounces of silver and one part
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:05.680]  of this last party that was supposed to been a friend and that husband or
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:11.440]  whatever the gal is buying the property they stole 360 ounces of silver while it
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:16.480]  was in their hands before it went to the court and they my stepson that was in
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:22.240]  they took care of my house when I took my wife to the clinic when she had the
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:28.120]  cancer that was the first silver that was missing it was in his unbelievable I

[02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:57.360]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:07.880]  broadcasting network the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex
[03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:15.560]  Jones show all right coming up we're gonna be breaking down Obama saying he is
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:20.200]  a dictator basically can do whatever he wants whenever he wants wars legalizing
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:27.400]  illegals warren she boat occur goes by rent world war two war hero rescue more
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:33.680]  than 2,000 people in the Los Benos raid he's out in Montana and this stuff's
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:38.600]  going on everywhere and they're claiming as he kept some silver in a bankruptcy
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:43.040]  that they're taking his property everything because they got him to wave it
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:47.920]  with threats of jail time rent just to be clear you didn't understand that you
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:53.840]  couldn't keep that silver no I didn't in that and that silver and gold that we
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:58.800]  collected over all those years we never spent one dime for buying anything but
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:05.000]  we needed a car I let my teeth go everything for our future when we got
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.320]  old age the home was built for that with no steps or anything it was built
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:15.480]  strictly for our retirement and old age yeah I know there's been some federal
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:18.720]  rulings you could calculate the value of that of what you bought it in at the
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.840]  time too so it's probably a lot reduced but point is you didn't know Stuart where
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:26.880]  do we go from here I would think that we need the local police if they've got
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:31.680]  any honor this is the feds doing this they they should dig into these other
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:37.760]  people get warrants look at deposits silver sold I would go around the local
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:41.680]  places even in towns a hundred miles away and get records of the silver sold
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:45.680]  with warrants to see if they were indeed selling his silver and then you could
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:50.400]  build a case backing up what he's saying this was an organized deception the
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:53.720]  whole time playing to get him into bankruptcy to do this yet I don't know
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:57.880]  all this but that's what my gut hound dog tells me to look into what do you say
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.760]  to that right there well there's two different strategies of attack on this
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:05.360]  though on the one hand he needs a really good bankruptcy lawyer we've got an
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:08.840]  appointment set with him to go see a psychologist who's going to do an
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:14.160]  assessment of his of his a capacity to see whether he could understand what he
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:18.200]  was agreeing to so we'll attack the stipulation and try to wipe that out and
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:22.200]  then putting back where he was back with his homestead and then they can they can
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:24.720]  then try to go ahead and do an adversarial proceeding we'll fight them
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:27.880]  all the way but the other strategy I mean it'd be nice to have somebody look
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:31.960]  into the theft of his silver but I think that's a second issue so we need a two
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:36.240]  prompt strategy there and we also had folks contact us friends of mine
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:39.920]  through Oathkeepers who were trying to raise the money to buy his house back
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:43.760]  and so I really hope they're successful to reach people that have money and can
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:46.920]  do that but I encourage folks to go there's on our on our website of the
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:51.280]  link that can donate directly to his legal defense fund yeah that's all great
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:55.040]  but I mean if we try to always buy people out of their trouble it you know
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:58.600]  it's a losing battle it's important in this case to help him I think bringing
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:03.080]  the people involved in this to justice if they've done something wrong I think
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:07.120]  that's what's important well sure if you can but this is you know this is why I
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:11.720]  don't mess with the law much it's it's such a such a corrupt system and it's
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:17.360]  already so far gone I mean the court let this trustee hire herself as the lawyer
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:22.200]  for the trustee and for the estate and said in its in its order allowing this
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:25.880]  that she's not biased that she has no no conflict of interest is it
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:30.920]  ridiculous so the law in this country is deteriorated into being a weapon and so
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:34.160]  I don't think as well you know in the big picture I don't think anybody
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:38.120]  involved in this is going to be you know prosecuted for anything but we can
[03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:42.400]  restore his homestead I think that's possible you know it was Montana with
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:46.160]  that weird hardened stuff a lot of weirdness going on up there I know it's
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:50.920]  a lot of good people but also has that weird old mining mining thing going on
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:56.720]  in closing ran anything else you'd like to add sir well I was just thinking as
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:04:03.160]  you was talking there you know you and Stuart Rhodes and the old keepers all
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:08.120]  of you that's taking a hand and helping me here whether you realize that or not
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:13.680]  you're making a combat jump into enemy territory just like I did now oh no
[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:18.480]  or not listen we just know that people are feeding on old folks none of us are
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:24.960]  safe so it's real simple okay I thank you for the time that you spent with me
