[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.320]  well we've learned a lot more about the tragic shooting that happened Saturday in
[00:30.320 --> 00:35.720]  Tucson Arizona Sarah Palin has responded I have to say I really wholeheartedly
[00:35.720 --> 00:41.600]  agree with the way she has responded we're really getting a bird's-eye view a
[00:41.600 --> 00:49.920]  serious indicator now of exactly just how authoritarian the Democrats are and
[00:49.920 --> 00:55.340]  just how much tyranny they want to bring into this nation including massive
[00:55.340 --> 01:00.080]  free speech restrictions massive Second Amendment restrictions despite the fact
[01:00.080 --> 01:04.760]  we have Democratic House members saying things like line up Republican
[01:04.760 --> 01:11.240]  governors and shoot them and Obama saying bring a gun to Republican meetings
[01:11.240 --> 01:15.520]  they bring a knife we bring a gun despite the fact we've got all this
[01:15.520 --> 01:24.080]  Democratic violence by unions against people across the nation the media MSNBC
[01:24.080 --> 01:29.280]  CNN and others hype it up you know when a Rand Paul supporter steps on some
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.880]  ladies head they act like it's the end of the world but when the Democrats are
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.960]  doing things many fold more aggressive and a lot more frequent they try to
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.120]  sweep it under the rug but here's the issue that Chris Matthews and others are
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.560]  finally figuring out I saw Matthews yesterday I go oh it's horrible what
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.120]  Michael Savage and others are doing we check to see if they have audiences and
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.200]  they have big audiences as if Chris Matthews doesn't know that on his
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.400]  biggest night he might have a half million viewers and that somebody like
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.400]  Michael Savage has several million people tuning in to every 15 minute
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.440]  quarter hour this radio show is approaching a million people every
[02:12.440 --> 02:21.200]  quarter hour see that's the big illusion is that CNN is big and that MSNBC is
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.280]  big and that CNBC is big they're not big they're paper tigers it's a joke and
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.840]  they realize that so they can get up there all day and blame Rush Limbaugh
[02:32.840 --> 02:37.560]  with 20 plus million listeners conservatively every day they can sit
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.840]  there and blame Alex Jones with over two million conservative listeners a day
[02:42.840 --> 02:49.520]  they can try to blame the real media that doesn't mean I agree with everything
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.480]  Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage say the point is that's real media it has real
[02:53.480 --> 03:00.360]  audiences Glenn Beck has real audiences between radio TV the rest of it he's
[03:00.360 --> 03:07.160]  reaching 20 million people a week nothing's as big as Limbaugh those are
[03:07.160 --> 03:13.240]  real audiences so of course Chris Matthews who literally has about the same
[03:13.240 --> 03:21.760]  members of listeners or viewers as a big cities local weather channel has at
[03:21.760 --> 03:27.440]  any one time I mean it's a joke there are big talk shows in major cities that
[03:27.440 --> 03:35.000]  have more than a half million listeners every day Chris Matthews is a joke he is
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.480]  a ghost he is a fraud he is a hoax CNN is a fraud and a hoax it's all a joke
[03:43.480 --> 03:48.560]  except still people surfing through the channels if they see you on Larry King
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.560]  live if they see you on hardball they think ooh you're on national television
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.320]  oh it's so prestigious they've got ten million dollar sets and Alex Jones has
[04:01.320 --> 04:11.480]  got a $10,000 set really a $3,000 TV screen behind me $5,000 desk I don't
[04:11.480 --> 04:17.000]  know maybe the stuff in here maybe $15,000 I'm sitting here you know I'm
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.920]  wearing a $400 sports jacket and somebody like Chris Matthews would be
[04:22.920 --> 04:31.200]  wearing a two $3,000 one see it's all nothing but glaze pixie dust it's all
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.480]  a bunch of smoke and mirrors okay I'm gonna reset here with all the info come
[04:35.480 --> 04:40.400]  back get into what's happening but of course these failures no one buys their
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.200]  fake ideology of course these people can't get an audience so of course they're
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.360]  out promoting the government shutting down my free speech
[04:49.360 --> 04:55.240]  Linvex free speech Rush Limbaugh's free speech Sarah Palin's free speech because
[04:55.240 --> 05:01.120]  hardly anyone buys their baloney and their pesadas and floating Alex told you
[05:01.120 --> 05:04.880]  the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June
[05:04.880 --> 05:10.200]  of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[05:10.200 --> 05:13.560]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[05:13.560 --> 05:17.200]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.440]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.000]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.200]  food savings account from e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.360]  food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any

[06:42.360 --> 07:02.640]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[07:02.640 --> 07:06.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:06.960 --> 07:11.160]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.200 --> 07:19.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.080 --> 07:23.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.520 --> 07:31.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:31.800 --> 07:35.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:39.720 --> 07:43.080]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[07:43.080 --> 07:46.800]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[07:46.800 --> 07:52.360]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[07:52.360 --> 07:59.720]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[07:59.720 --> 08:17.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:17.280 --> 08:22.600]  Rush Limbaugh has accurately said the last few days the top radio was under
[08:22.600 --> 08:29.080]  siege but if we don't all hang together we will surely hang separate it is not
[08:29.080 --> 08:36.400]  just talk radio that is under siege it is free speech in this country it's
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.160]  every man woman and child's right to speak their mind we are being indoctrinated
[08:42.160 --> 08:47.880]  into a collectivist mindset that anytime someone commits a crime it is
[08:47.880 --> 08:53.080]  collectively everyone else's fault and then everyone else is punished that is
[08:53.080 --> 08:57.720]  not just a hallmark of communism or socialism or fascism or other
[08:57.720 --> 09:07.680]  collectivist systems it is a hallmark of a very extreme tyranny and so I wanted
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.960]  to play this clip of first a very short clip of Chris Matthews citing Mark
[09:13.960 --> 09:19.640]  Levin Michael Savage and others being complicit in causing the shooting when
[09:19.640 --> 09:26.040]  we've now had almost five days to deeply research this and we have a very clear
[09:26.040 --> 09:31.800]  image now of exactly what happened and now we know why the police department and
[09:31.800 --> 09:41.120]  that anti-liberty dupe Nick Sheriff he certainly is a dupe to tyranny now we
[09:41.120 --> 09:44.200]  know why they don't want all this guy's writings and literature out there
[09:44.200 --> 09:49.680]  because all the public writings of him now make it very clear rejected by
[09:49.680 --> 09:57.720]  women into voodoo now it's confirmed voodoo I see a skull and oranges around
[09:57.720 --> 10:01.560]  it and candles doesn't take a rocket scientist that's voodoo black magic
[10:01.560 --> 10:07.800]  variant of it and now we've discovered from neighbors friends and others that
[10:07.800 --> 10:15.720]  he was quote almost every day almost every day we're gonna play a clip of
[10:15.720 --> 10:23.080]  this Associated Press interview coming up almost every day taking a very serious
[10:23.080 --> 10:26.880]  hallucinogen I mean this is a type that's so high-powered you literally see
[10:26.880 --> 10:35.240]  pink elephants and leprechauns salvia divinarium or divination and it's a
[10:35.240 --> 10:40.920]  super high-powered Mayan or Aztec plant a plant used by them and he
[10:40.920 --> 10:45.520]  reportedly took this almost every day smoked it ate it you name it I mean
[10:45.520 --> 10:48.760]  obviously he was completely out of his gourd you can take one look at the guy
[10:48.760 --> 10:54.640]  and hallucinogens you know for 99% of people are fine if they're only taking
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.200]  ever once in a while from the studies I've researched but people that already
[10:59.200 --> 11:03.160]  have mental problems and take a lot of it or maybe take it one time and you go
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.920]  jump off of high-rise tower thinking you can fly and you can better believe
[11:08.920 --> 11:15.240]  ladies and gentlemen that that's a big part of this now now Paul Watson has a
[11:15.240 --> 11:20.880]  big report out today that is so important to get out to everyone and
[11:20.880 --> 11:26.480]  studying his criminology studying his psychology studying his MO his trappings
[11:26.480 --> 11:34.800]  his music the drowning pool are the things that he was into was Waffner in
[11:34.800 --> 11:43.320]  love with Congresswoman Giffords we know he was obsessed letters back from
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.160]  her you write a letter to a congressperson you get a form letter back
[11:48.160 --> 11:56.520]  he put him in a safe he was called very liberal in 2007 2008 2009 by a score of
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.920]  different friends family locals classmates he was a supporter of her we
[12:02.920 --> 12:11.400]  know that now and obviously was attracted to her we now know he had been
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.520]  rejected by women as I said Sunday on radio into the occult rejected by women
[12:16.520 --> 12:22.920]  I called him as a nihilistic wannabe devil worshiper rejected by women so he
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.200]  tried to do the most nihilistic shocking thing he could communism Nazism
[12:27.200 --> 12:33.160]  devil worship hardcore drugs just an absolutely scrambled individual and
[12:33.160 --> 12:37.440]  this is what the media doesn't want you to know this is why they don't want you
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.000]  to know what's in that safe this is why because we're now learning in the Wall
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.400]  Street journals reporting he was angry at women because they rejected him because
[12:45.400 --> 12:50.840]  he was an insecure creep women like one thing they like confidence real
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.320]  confidence not false confidence and they certainly don't like creepy people so
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.520]  the question is was Loeffner in love with Congresswoman Giffords I can tell
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.520]  you studying him just like I told you he was a devil worshiper Sunday night long
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.200]  before it came out the next day in the news there was no inkling of that other
[13:08.200 --> 13:11.720]  than his the music he was into that's been associated with people killing
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.520]  themselves and family members because he glorifies it let the bodies at the
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.560]  ground let the bodies at the ground your stuff 14-year-old kids are endings I
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.560]  think it's powerful if you're 22 and still end of stuff like that and taking
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.800]  hardcore hallucinogens quote almost every day you've got a problem and I'm
[13:30.800 --> 13:38.400]  telling you now he had a thing for the Congress lady and she is good-looking
[13:38.400 --> 13:44.920]  okay and he had a thing for her as a liberal back when he was the long-haired
[13:44.920 --> 13:49.360]  liberal who thought he might be a woman and he was very confused and the
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.520]  hallucinogens pushed him over the edge they've not outlawed this drug yet and
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.680]  I'm not even calling for it to be outlawed ladies and gentlemen I can take
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.080]  you to anywhere in Texas out in the field and if I've got enough acres to go
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.160]  over I can find you scores of things that'll get you hired in the kite why
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.960]  did witches in Europe quote fly a broom well they would run around with the
[14:13.960 --> 14:20.200]  broom between their legs in a sexual ritual you can figure it out
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.600]  hallucinating on silver nightshade which grows all over Europe and all over
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.440]  North America now if you eat too much of it will cause your heart to explode
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.600]  but you take that you're gonna you're gonna go to the moon without a rocket
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.480]  are we gonna ban silver nightshade there are hundreds of plants depending on
[14:40.480 --> 14:46.040]  your geographic area that will send you to la la land very very quickly so
[14:46.040 --> 14:50.760]  obviously now that this has been super hot for years he's been smoking it and
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.680]  gobbling it record reportedly for years and so there's your issue a whacked out
[14:55.680 --> 15:01.840]  hallucinogen addict who already had underlying mental problems and there
[15:01.840 --> 15:04.080]  may be some mind control in there because he thought it was under mind
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.400]  control and we certainly know those are real programs and they'll pick somebody
[15:08.400 --> 15:14.080]  who's already unstable and create a psychological compulsion but you got a
[15:14.080 --> 15:20.200]  guy who is a confirmed quote very liberal we've got it from all these
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.840]  different angles just literally it's got to be more than 30 plus people I haven't
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.160]  even counted who said yeah he was real liberal he was involved in animal rights
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.000]  he was a nice guy he was for you know marijuana decriminalization and then he
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.480]  starts taking hallucinogens then he starts listening to really whacked out
[15:37.480 --> 15:44.560]  music and he just his whole personality changed he took on that aura of
[15:44.560 --> 15:50.680]  darkness that nerds tend to think is powerful and I'm just again giving you
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.400]  the MO of the average person that likes to imagine that they're a devil or a
[15:54.400 --> 16:01.000]  vampire anybody who studies culture knows that's one of the most popular
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.120]  cultures out there right now and most people you know if your 15 year old
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.400]  daughter likes to dress up like a like a vampire and have black fingernails and
[16:09.400 --> 16:13.200]  and thinks it's cute as in the vampire books most the time it's not gonna be a
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.680]  problem but a lot of times they start cutting themselves they start committing
[16:16.680 --> 16:25.760]  suicide it's very very dangerous when people start going down this road and I
[16:25.760 --> 16:29.000]  just want to tell all the nerds out there if you want to find real power find
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.640]  God find creativity you want to find real power go down to a soup kitchen and
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.920]  help homeless people and obviously he tried to find himself going out and
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.480]  helping at the local animal shelter but that was two years ago he got sucked
[16:44.480 --> 16:49.400]  into the whole devil culture whether you believe in the devil or not his mind
[16:49.400 --> 16:57.040]  manifested that in this type of cold-blooded murder he manifested that
[16:57.040 --> 17:03.760]  archetype that is in all of us that's why what you are into and what you focus
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.400]  on that's what idols were all about you think the ancients just worship idols
[17:07.400 --> 17:11.760]  because they were a bunch of idiots they worship idols as they were building
[17:11.760 --> 17:19.680]  that image in their minds eye to to then basically project their will that's
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.600]  what all of this is that's what a talisman is that's what magic is that's
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.480]  what focusing is your will is incredibly powerful we are creators we build
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.320]  things we construct things and we first construct things in our minds before we
[17:34.320 --> 17:41.680]  physically manifest them that isn't magic magic is simply a way to
[17:41.680 --> 17:48.960]  compartmentalize that in the subconscious to the conscious in the ancient mind
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.560]  before we understood science now we understand the human mind and and more
[17:54.560 --> 18:00.160]  and what we're capable of and if max plank 110 years ago the physicists could
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.000]  envision atomic theory and on a chalkboard write out equations with uranium
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.880]  that could power giant reactors and cities or destroy them
[18:09.880 --> 18:16.560]  Nikola Tesla could envision what is harp weather control today over 120 years
[18:16.560 --> 18:26.120]  ago so this guy focused on death and destruction and he manifested it a
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.960]  cocktail of women what did I say Sunday this will be women refusing him then he
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.960]  gets into darkness looking for power and what does the archetype of Satan
[18:38.960 --> 18:47.960]  offer black power dark mysterious power the weak see evil as powerful it's
[18:47.960 --> 18:53.480]  sold as sexy as alluring how many times we discuss this but it leads to burning
[18:53.480 --> 18:59.160]  cities and piles of dead bodies covered in maggots its fruits stink to high
[18:59.160 --> 19:03.040]  heaven if you think that's beautiful that's because you've been turned over
[19:03.040 --> 19:10.000]  to this and if you've got any tingle in your spine left any tingle on your skin

[24:30.720 --> 24:36.080]  everything they lose it when they lose their minds they've obviously lost it
[24:36.080 --> 24:40.400]  and will they be able to use this to erect a police state they are certainly
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.720]  trying and a society unravels you're gonna see more of this type stuff
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.760]  happen and we have to fully not just defend ourselves but get on the offensive
[24:49.760 --> 24:56.880]  and say how dare you blood libel how dare you pin scarlet letters to people
[24:56.880 --> 25:02.280]  how dare you say we need to shut up and give up our speech to you tyrants
[25:02.280 --> 25:07.480]  because somebody was whacked out of their mind on drugs and was obsessed
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.080]  with this woman and shot her and others how dare you the father and the mother
[25:12.080 --> 25:16.200]  of the little girl the little green girl who was killed have said that and do
[25:16.200 --> 25:22.120]  they stop no they have no shame because they hate our liberties what is Jay
[25:22.120 --> 25:25.360]  Rockefeller said in the last month he said we would have been better off
[25:25.360 --> 25:31.040]  without ever having an internet I want to shut down Fox and MSNBC and if they
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.520]  can shut down their speech on those channels and imply that speech is bad
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.600]  well you see where we're going the Second Amendment and free speech along
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.800]  with property rights are the last pillars to go and I'm looking at Illinois
[25:44.800 --> 25:52.720]  where they've raised taxes by 66% in one swing on state income taxes I mean I'm
[25:52.720 --> 25:57.200]  seeing other states some states are passing over a hundred taxes when you
[25:57.200 --> 26:03.200]  add all the fines and fees in I mean New York state's doing that the city's I
[26:03.200 --> 26:10.160]  mean it's off the charts and it's all going to offshore banks talk radio isn't
[26:10.160 --> 26:16.120]  just under attack America is under attack if we lose the free speech and the
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.860]  Second Amendment and the property rights which you all see now under attack the
[26:20.860 --> 26:26.440]  FCC announced they're taking over the internet two weeks ago they don't have
[26:26.440 --> 26:29.640]  jurisdiction they're just declaring it kind of like Hitler declared hey pole
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.160]  in his mind or kind of like the Russians declared Czechoslovakia was
[26:35.160 --> 26:40.280]  theirs or kind of like the French declared Vietnam was theirs it's just
[26:40.280 --> 26:46.520]  hey internet's ours we're gonna start restricting and then while they were
[26:46.520 --> 26:49.400]  gearing up all this legislation they'd say no no we don't want to take all your
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.880]  speech just some of it oh we don't take all your guns just some of it so here's
[26:53.880 --> 26:59.040]  limbaugh well first I'm gonna get to the MSNBC here's MSNBC blaming it on Michael
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.440]  Savage it's all his fault he's Stephen I have to tell you that what I'll mention a
[27:03.440 --> 27:07.360]  couple names are not getting into too many fights people like Mark Levin or
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.800]  Michael Savage for example who every time you listen to them are furious
[27:11.800 --> 27:18.160]  furious at the left with anger that's just builds and builds in their voice
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.200]  and by the time they go to commercial they're just in some rage every night
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.600]  with ugly talk ugly sounding talk and it never changes it never modulates they
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.280]  must have an audience I looked at the numbers today they have big audiences and
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.200]  I guess that's the question why and is there ever going to stop if it keeps
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.920]  working is it ever going to stop if it keeps working if it keeps working he's
[27:41.920 --> 27:47.520]  not a pretty angry right there he's calling an ugly talk hateful I mean
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.120]  what about all these hypocritical statements by Democrats about lining
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.800]  Republican governors up and shooting them all their statements about locking
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.720]  and loading the West Virginia governor shooting bullets through the cap and
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.960]  trade bill that's just political nomenclature that that's always been
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.440]  done and I love what Sarah Palin had to say on this we've got it up at
[28:07.440 --> 28:13.920]  prisonplanet.com when was it less heated back in those calm days when
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.760]  politicians and political figures literally settled their differences by
[28:19.760 --> 28:26.920]  dueling pistols that's right but the world has never been tamed and it's
[28:26.920 --> 28:32.000]  never going to be tamed and now we learned the police had been not once not
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.280]  twice not three times and they're keeping it sealed that's in the New York
[28:36.280 --> 28:42.240]  Times today but they had been over and over again to Loughner's house he'd
[28:42.240 --> 28:47.720]  been death-threading people all over the place now I'm glad to see they're
[28:47.720 --> 28:53.160]  starting to arrest people that call ups mayor's offices citizens offices
[28:53.160 --> 28:58.440]  governor's offices and death threat them I've had enough of people on record
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.960]  death-threatening and using their name and doing it publicly I had a guy 14
[29:03.960 --> 29:07.880]  years ago on air saying where my sister went to school and saying go kill her
[29:07.880 --> 29:15.080]  when she was in high school and nothing was done the police wouldn't do it I
[29:15.080 --> 29:19.200]  had the videotape the guy had an access TV show I took it to the police and they
[29:19.200 --> 29:25.920]  laughed at me see they won't actually go after the real bona fide people it's
[29:25.920 --> 29:38.560]  illegal to say I'm gonna kill you and to be serious about it so here is this
[29:38.560 --> 29:43.480]  sheriff and this police chief and others getting all this political hay out of
[29:43.480 --> 29:49.760]  this when they didn't do their stinking job when a crime had been committed

[33:12.600 --> 33:26.840]  okay let's go ahead and go to this clip of Rush Limbaugh yesterday saying talk
[33:26.840 --> 33:32.160]  radio is under siege well if they can shoot down talk radio they can bring
[33:32.160 --> 33:35.760]  down anything I mean this is frightening that they would brazenly be
[33:35.760 --> 33:40.800]  saying you cannot criticize government if you say something that puts a
[33:40.800 --> 33:47.480]  politician in a bad light that may lead to someone attacking them so you can't
[33:47.480 --> 33:55.160]  have aggressive speech I can't say Obama is a criminal he has a Chicago mob
[33:55.160 --> 33:59.360]  operation up there at the White House he is involved in all sorts of
[33:59.360 --> 34:04.480]  criminality according to them I can't say that in fact we need to pull up the
[34:04.480 --> 34:11.080]  video from two years ago it's in the Obama deception of news in Missouri
[34:11.080 --> 34:16.280]  where the police and they have the district attorneys on TV saying if you
[34:16.280 --> 34:23.760]  say he's not a Christian we're going to have you arrested if you run an ad that
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.040]  we think isn't truthful we're going to arrest you normally you'd have to have
[34:28.040 --> 34:35.600]  a civil action to go prove that something wasn't true and there'd be no
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.000]  criminal charges it's just made up remember remember when Obama's people
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.920]  when they thought he was riding high and had that 80 plus percent approval
[34:42.920 --> 34:46.160]  rating right before he got elected and there would be no way to stop him and
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.560]  he would be our messianic leader and they were openly in Missouri and other
[34:50.560 --> 34:57.840]  states saying will arrest you if you talk bad about Obama and the crazy thing
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.160]  is I see so many Democrats on websites vitriolically saying yes ban their
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.120]  speech take their guns and you almost think they're joking and on YouTube you
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.640]  click on their handles and you go to their websites on YouTube and it's
[35:09.640 --> 35:15.120]  communist flags and communist marches and Hugo Chavez I mean there are really a
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.600]  lot of people in this country who hate freedom and again when there were mild
[35:21.600 --> 35:27.120]  calls under Bush to restrict free speech I attacked I defended free speech this
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.680]  isn't about liberal and conservative it's about the First Amendment I mean
[35:30.680 --> 35:34.360]  their attack on the First Amendment is even more brazen than this attack on the
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.800]  second and it's the most brazen we've ever seen because the corrupt system is
[35:38.800 --> 35:45.440]  scared they know you're awake they know that liberty is is swinging back on the
[35:45.440 --> 35:49.680]  pendulum let's go ahead and play limbaugh and continuing this template and
[35:49.680 --> 35:56.520]  narrative that the Tea Party that's Sarah Palin that talk radio that Fox News
[35:56.520 --> 36:06.400]  is inspiring violence they forget that in the process of so doing they are
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.680]  attacking what is now a majority of Americans they're accusing a majority of
[36:12.680 --> 36:19.680]  Americans of being accomplices to murder he's Stephen I have to tell you that
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.920]  what I'm okay so that's the clip of them playing limbaugh and then going back to
[36:24.920 --> 36:32.320]  attacking but this is more than just talk radio being under siege this is free
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.920]  speech under siege and as if that's not bad enough we've got a guy from
[36:38.920 --> 36:44.240]  neighbors friends classmates people that hung out with him who was on all sorts

[37:19.080 --> 37:26.840]  hallucinary experiences its native habitat is within cloud forest in the
[37:26.840 --> 37:35.800]  isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oxycona Mexico growing in shady and moist

[38:08.880 --> 38:13.840]  know from the Wall Street Journal from from his writings on online video game
[38:13.840 --> 38:18.400]  forums that are confirmed to be Jared Lee lofner that he was angry at women he
[38:18.400 --> 38:22.320]  couldn't get women and that he was outraged now we know he was obsessed
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.240]  with this congresswoman we know that he was a liberal quote very liberal from
[38:26.240 --> 38:30.480]  all his friends in 2007 2008 we know that he went to her events he took
[38:30.480 --> 38:33.920]  letters from her and put them in the safety deposit box you locked him up in
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.600]  his safe at his house he was obsessed with her and that's why we have the
[38:38.600 --> 38:43.000]  article today at prison planet dot com was lofner in love with congresswoman
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.960]  Giffords and the answer was he was bare bare minimum obsessed fan and as I
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.840]  predicted into the occult Sunday rejected by women trying to be shocking
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.040]  starts taking hardcore hallucinogens quote almost every day neighbors that
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.680]  knew him and hung out with him he flew over the cuckoo's nest joining us is
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.880]  Eric man cow Muller a nationwide syndicated radio host on talk radio
[39:06.880 --> 39:11.680]  networks he's on stations like W ABC in New York good to have him with us for
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.920]  the next 10 minutes to break this down he was one of the only guys I was on his
[39:15.920 --> 39:21.160]  show Sunday he got it no one else got it but man cow myself I have to say we
[39:21.160 --> 39:26.840]  called it as loner devil worshipper on drugs who couldn't get women obsessed
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.400]  with the congresswoman and now that picture is becoming crystal clear man
[39:31.400 --> 39:35.400]  cow how does this get blamed on Sarah Palin the First Amendment the Second
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.520]  Amendment Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones they're also blaming it on me well in
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.960]  there they're blaming a very good friend of mine I'm Mark Levin and and the guy
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.080]  that works for my company which is Michael Savage they're blaming everybody
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.640]  and the fact is it's at the beginning of time they're maybe even don't eat the
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.360]  apple don't eat the apple you can have everything just not the apple you know
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.480]  people do the wrong thing sometimes and this guy was was unstable he was a
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.920]  he was a cook look I have been to many parties you know I go to all the hit
[40:04.920 --> 40:11.920]  parties Alex and I went on a canoe trip and the salvia was rage about a year
[40:11.920 --> 40:17.080]  ago and all the hit people were doing it you can get it off the internet it's a
[40:17.080 --> 40:21.120]  book by Pinchot is the writer's name called breaking open the head it's one
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.280]  of the greatest books I love the book and it's kind of cast in that I was at the
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.280]  guy cast a native that wrote all this stuff in the 60s and anyway you know
[40:29.280 --> 40:34.520]  talks about shamanism and a lot of people at his age are into this we also
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.800]  see that with the voodoo skull and rotten oranges and all of this in his
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.920]  backyard this guy was doing salvia I've been around people who have done it it's
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.340]  what Miley Cyrus was doing that's the internet sensation right now I have two
[40:47.340 --> 40:49.680]  young daughters and I'm doing everything I can to keep them away from
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.720]  Hannah Montana and then that whole you know that whole group of women the
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.420]  Kardashians and Lindsay Lohan these people that are celebrated but in that in
[41:00.420 --> 41:06.280]  that the late you know 18 19 and then into the 20s into that crowd that salvia
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.680]  is hot and in many states you can get it legal and I've been around people that
[41:10.680 --> 41:15.120]  do it you take a couple of pops and instantly you know you are you talk about
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.120]  pink elephants all this but you're certainly seeing the trees come alive
[41:18.120 --> 41:23.240]  and the walls talk to you depending on the stream that you get and this guy was
[41:23.240 --> 41:31.120]  doing this on a daily basis and then so this this link to the pale and and you
[41:31.120 --> 41:36.840]  know look back and back in his fake crying yeah it's a little creepy to me
[41:36.840 --> 41:42.000]  I've teased Glenn about that but to blame any of these people are rush the
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.400]  sheriff came out and blamed rush yesterday I don't understand why the sheriff
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.280]  Alex in Arizona first of all why didn't have one of their policemen there so
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.280]  he's partially to blame but then to blame and you know everybody but the man
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.680]  and then I can go on and I look at hold on let me expand on that man Cal let me
[42:00.680 --> 42:04.680]  expand on that because the New York Times is now reporting that they didn't
[42:04.680 --> 42:08.040]  go once they didn't go twice it didn't go three times they're admitting they've
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.360]  been to his house over and over again but that's staying sealed they're
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.360]  covering their rear end right now it turns out he'd made death threats to
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.120]  all sorts of people he'd been kicked out of college in September just four
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.720]  months ago for threatening people all he talked about was mind control in person
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.360]  saying he was under mind control we don't know if that's true or not but
[42:29.360 --> 42:32.400]  they do scramble people that are under my control from the declassified documents
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.760]  so badly that they don't even know really who they are anymore and now the
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.520]  Associated Press reports officer stop suspect on day of Arizona shooting a
[42:41.520 --> 42:44.840]  wildlife officer pulled over the suspect in the assassination attempt against
[42:44.840 --> 42:47.600]  Arizona Congresswoman less than three hours before the deadly attack
[42:47.600 --> 42:51.080]  authorities said Wednesday as they pieced together more details of the
[42:51.080 --> 42:57.160]  frenzied mourning Jared Lofner ran a red light but was let off with a warning
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.800]  at 7 30 a.m. Saturday the Arizona Game and Fish Department said so this guy was
[43:01.800 --> 43:05.680]  so out of control the cops read his house over and over again he's got
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.640]  letters from the Congresswoman in his safe he's called very liberal he's
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.040]  obviously a liberal kid who got into hallucinogens and in devil music went
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.480]  crazy and now they're blaming me on democracy now and I hope Sarah Palin
[43:20.480 --> 43:25.480]  and others start suing these people this is blood libel here man cow when is
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.520]  enough enough that every time something happens people that love America get
[43:29.520 --> 43:34.600]  blamed for it I'm sick of it well Alex it reminds me of the Times Square bomber
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.440]  I took my children you know I'm in New York for WABC I took my children to see
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.160]  Lion King and this terrorist wanted to blow up the Lion King he wanted to have
[43:44.160 --> 43:47.960]  you know he had all these bombs packed with with ball bearings so that they
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.400]  would explode and go through everybody who was leaving this family musical
[43:51.400 --> 43:54.880]  Disney's Lion King and the first thing that Bloomberg said and the rest was
[43:54.880 --> 44:01.400]  well it's probably a tea party person and the sad reality and of course you and
[44:01.400 --> 44:04.480]  I using this very dangerous thing that we mustn't use in America right now
[44:04.480 --> 44:13.240]  of common sense the the really you know I hate to admit it I really hate to
[44:13.240 --> 44:16.440]  admit it because I wish this wasn't true what I'm about to say but you don't
[44:16.440 --> 44:21.920]  really see many people at these tea party events that are under 50 I wish I
[44:21.920 --> 44:25.840]  wish they would sex it up I wish the young people were more into the tea
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.320]  party and we're talking about radio so you know a guy that's 22 years old rush
[44:31.320 --> 44:36.920]  God love him is turning 60 years old today a 22 year old pot-smoking atheist
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.200]  isn't listening to rush and isn't part of the tea party tea party folks are you
[44:41.200 --> 44:46.400]  know God guns and guts so you and I knew immediately because again we're not
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.280]  stupid asses we're not stupid we knew immediately that this guy was not going
[44:51.280 --> 44:54.720]  to be a tea partier you just have to look at the makeup of the tea party
[44:54.720 --> 45:00.080]  crowd so it's all nonsense but you know look Alex feel good about this you and I
[45:00.080 --> 45:07.040]  get to talk about it once again America gets to see how this lamestream media is
[45:07.040 --> 45:12.120]  nothing but the propaganda wing of government well that's my next point
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.640]  you're absolutely right they have national polls out and it shows that
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.960]  the vast majority of Americans in fact here's the headline poll Americans
[45:20.960 --> 45:29.040]  reject media hoax on Arizona shootings over 70 percent now do not want more
[45:29.040 --> 45:34.800]  gun control and reject this as a political stunt I've got a whole bunch of
[45:34.800 --> 45:41.520]  different polls showing this so this is really blown up in their face as we all
[45:41.520 --> 45:47.440]  discover who this misguided schizophrenic really was but they don't care the
[45:47.440 --> 45:51.480]  Democrats still even though they're out of bullets politically with their you
[45:51.480 --> 45:54.520]  know half million viewers on Chris Matthews I mean that's ridiculous Mac
[45:54.520 --> 45:58.000]  how you have that many you know listeners every 15 minutes so do I I mean
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.120]  these people really are them the mouse that tried to roar and couldn't their
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.760]  paper tigers but there's but they do have people in Congress like Jay Rockefeller
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.720]  that says in the internet have the FCC takeover free speech don't let people
[46:12.720 --> 46:16.720]  say things that could quote stir folks up bring the fairness doctrine back in I
[46:16.720 --> 46:24.560]  mean they are really showing their hand right now well I love this you know yeah
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.000]  I love now they're saying well okay okay so he's not a right winger but maybe
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.600]  next time and I believe they're they're creating this they I hate to say this
[46:35.600 --> 46:39.920]  but let me ask you something Alex do you remember the whole time during George
[46:39.920 --> 46:44.240]  W. Bush the media night and day went on and on about how they couldn't show body
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.640]  bags coming back from Afghanistan yes Alex are you still there yes I'm there
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.880]  I remember it okay you remember the media the George W. Bush and and you know
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.720]  I'm no fan of his either but you know the Afghanistan why can't we show body bags
[47:00.720 --> 47:07.360]  Iraq why can't we show body bags and then Obama comes in it goes okay you show
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.600]  body bags and they don't it reminds me and I'm old enough to admit to admit I
[47:11.600 --> 47:17.960]  remember this every night the homeless people on TV with Ronald Reagan every
[47:17.960 --> 47:21.000]  night homeless people he doesn't care about the homeless people he doesn't care
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.120]  about people with AIDS every thing and the minute they got the media the minute
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.920]  they got the guy and they wanted you don't see these things anymore it's all
[47:28.920 --> 47:34.240]  propaganda they're planning this stuff I hate to say it I really hate I hate to
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.960]  think it but look I know a lot of these people this is good news this is
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.400]  ratings for them I love the guy last night on Ed Schultz the hero that
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.880]  tackled the shooter he had a gun on him and he said look I'm glad I didn't get
[47:48.880 --> 47:57.240]  to kill him I'm glad but I wish he had I really wish Walker had been shot but no
[47:57.240 --> 48:00.160]  I mean this guy made the point and Ed Schultz didn't like it because he sees
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.200]  way way way well they also hate the fact that the father has said don't use my
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.840]  nine-year-old daughter's death to take more liberties and he took a shot at the
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.360]  TSA saying look at what's happened with airport security and how horrible it
[48:14.360 --> 48:18.800]  is since then this is clearly not going the way they want but they have the old
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.440]  memory of 10 15 20 years ago when they were the only dominant media now they
[48:24.440 --> 48:30.400]  don't realize that that no one is listening to them no one is buying in to
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.360]  their brainwashing to their programming anymore so what do you expect them to do
[48:34.360 --> 48:39.800]  next well Alex listen let me tell you something brother here's the deal okay
[48:39.800 --> 48:46.800]  these are good times these are good times folks we were on the right path some
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.560]  people feel that this was a setup but it doesn't matter look it doesn't matter
[48:51.560 --> 48:56.520]  what it was the fact is we're on the right path we have checks and balances we
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.120]  have Republicans in there I'm not a big fan of the way they spend either I want
[49:00.120 --> 49:03.160]  to keep my money there's nothing noble about you giving up your money you work
[49:03.160 --> 49:08.720]  so hard for so others can sit around but look this this Congress started with
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.400]  the reading of the Constitution the Republicans and the Democrats and I
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.160]  know a lot of it's like WWE it's a lot of a lot of fake fighting but let them
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.320]  fight and hopefully we'll get back some of our freedoms I do think we're on the
[49:20.320 --> 49:25.160]  right path I think that both parties realize that Americans are sick of of
[49:25.160 --> 49:30.680]  doing all the work it's like that 1927 Fritz Lang Masterpiece Metropolis you
[49:30.680 --> 49:33.000]  know we're down here doing all the work well while they're up there in
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.520]  Washington DC up on the Hill partying and I think they're really starting to get
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.240]  that we're fed up I think the Tea Party movement was an abomination to them they
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.080]  didn't expect it so I think we're on the right path I think this is a bump in the
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.960]  road I think this guy is a freak you know Alex you and I I'll tell you we were
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.960]  the only ones we were so ahead on this John Lennon's killer loved him loved
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.320]  John Lennon Salinas killer was was head of her fan club and so on and so on you
[50:00.320 --> 50:05.640]  and I suspected that this guy was gonna be somebody that loved her not a not a
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.960]  palin fan but the exact opposite somebody that was in love with Gabby's
[50:09.960 --> 50:16.120]  attractive woman great American success rate hey it's also great to note that
[50:16.120 --> 50:19.840]  when these people are talking about more gun laws and grabbing our guns they're
[50:19.840 --> 50:24.720]  going against Gabby because Gabby the woman sitting there recovering with a
[50:24.720 --> 50:30.280]  bullet that went through her head Gabby is just pro gunner she's pro gun you know
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.040]  that right absolutely and pro national security on the border man cow I know

[54:02.160 --> 54:06.240]  okay Eric Mancow Muller will be joining us five minutes the next hour then we've
[54:06.240 --> 54:12.000]  got Gerald Salente on the shooting the police state the incredible economic
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.200]  developments as more and more countries go down to the central banks it's called
[54:16.200 --> 54:19.080]  a bailout when you actually read the internal documents those countries are
[54:19.080 --> 54:24.720]  being taken down by design so a lot of things are happening while we're busy
[54:24.720 --> 54:30.800]  focused on this shooting situation but to see the quote of Brad Sherman that
[54:30.800 --> 54:37.160]  Mancow mentioned earlier we played the clip yesterday he actually said on Fox
[54:37.160 --> 54:41.280]  News that well even if this wasn't politically motivated because now they're
[54:41.280 --> 54:44.920]  having to start admitting that the sheriff isn't stopping and Bill Clinton
[54:44.920 --> 54:50.160]  and Hillary aren't stopping but those that are smarter back and off Sherman who
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.840]  we've had on the show says well even if this wasn't politically motivated the
[54:54.840 --> 54:59.480]  next one will be and that's the other big issue here Mancow is that I understand
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.160]  how media works you understand how it works this model of Glock sales have
[55:04.160 --> 55:07.200]  exploded they're selling off-store shelves people hear about it hey looks
[55:07.200 --> 55:10.800]  like a good gun they might try to ban that gun I'm gonna go buy one somebody
[55:10.800 --> 55:14.960]  jumps off a big building in a major city like Chicago New York cops know to go
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.160]  put guards on at the next two days because nine times out of ten some other
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.080]  lunatics gonna go that's a good idea it turns out that they kept asking this
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.560]  congresswoman on TV nationally and locally are you afraid that Sarah Palin
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.960]  putting crosshairs on your district means you're gonna be killed and
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.880]  literally introducing that idea then you've got a lunatic like Loftner they're
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.480]  watching that who's on hallucinogens almost every day and then he wants to
[55:39.480 --> 55:42.720]  commit suicide so he thinks he'll go out in the blaze of glory they're
[55:42.720 --> 55:47.280]  advertising just like we have the statistics of death education is
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.800]  starting the 1990s in schools public schools and then and then the kids get
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.200]  taught how to commit suicide and suicide explodes they know exactly what they're
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.560]  doing and Sherman let that slip even if this isn't political the next one will
[56:00.560 --> 56:04.520]  be because all this hype you know there's thousands of nutcases out there
[56:04.520 --> 56:09.480]  locking and loading right now well reminds me of that that Duke story you
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.360]  know the girl that was raped and she lied and Jesse Jackson said well it
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.160]  doesn't matter if he was raped other black women have been raped for hundreds
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.040]  of years in America wait wait wait so these guys have to go to jail and have
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.520]  to have their lives destroyed what what is this madness and if you're part of a
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.520]  certain group you can sit around on your fanny and collect the cash but just
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.320]  this certain words we can't say certain groups you can't tease you can't think
[56:38.320 --> 56:43.520]  like this you can't I what where where is my free country and for this that
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.680]  sheriff is really something boy that sheriff out of Arizona what what police
[56:48.680 --> 56:52.320]  book is is he learning all this stuff how about going out and solving the crime
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.240]  what about the self-fulfilling prophecy though how they've been hyping out
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.760]  somebody's gonna shoot a politician somebody's gonna shoot them they're
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.080]  gonna shoot them I mean they are literally putting the idea out there
[57:03.080 --> 57:08.240]  they're the ones generating it well look you have kids I have kids and you know
[57:08.240 --> 57:11.440]  you can see even a little kids you put them in front of the TV it doesn't it
[57:11.440 --> 57:15.840]  doesn't matter what's on and it flickers at just the right rate that syncs up
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.760]  with their brain and they're drawn into it and you know I can yell and my kids
[57:19.760 --> 57:23.040]  can't hear me literally I mean they're not just being rude they can't hear me
[57:23.040 --> 57:28.440]  there that TV syncs up with our mind and and smart people are able to tell the
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.960]  difference between that and their reality they're hypnotized guy absolutely
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.440]  you know as letterman you just haven't hypnotized and you know all these first
[57:38.440 --> 57:43.120]  person shooter games that that generation loves so much and you know
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.720]  he's right look he's right of that age group man they're into the salvia he was
[57:46.720 --> 57:51.800]  smoking the smoking the salvia and and you had a little voodoo altar in the
[57:51.800 --> 57:56.160]  backyard and he was making his little and we now know he was a first person
[57:56.160 --> 58:00.960]  shooter obsessed and this is a disassociative drug where reality and
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.240]  dream become one he was literally that's what a mind control guy does they
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.440]  artificially make you sleepwalk in and kill people he may have just done this
[58:09.440 --> 58:13.640]  to himself well sure and he talked about I've read all of his writings and I'm
[58:13.640 --> 58:18.720]  sure you have and look it's a case of topper on the internet everybody's got
[58:18.720 --> 58:22.480]  to top each other and he was playing topper so he wanted to be more and more
[58:22.480 --> 58:26.400]  extreme and there he was dressed as the grim reaper and he's smoking his salvia
[58:26.400 --> 58:31.960]  and then playing the video games and I mean look that guy's about as far away
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.280]  from a Sarah Palin fan and I'm not a huge Sarah Palin fan I understand back in
[58:36.280 --> 58:41.200]  60 seconds man Cal stay there well he's going to a supermax prison now the GCN

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:27.240]  Alex Jones okay we're talking to Eric Mancow Muller of Mancow comms and to
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.840]  get it ready to host I'm on with him every Wednesday always honored to be
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.760]  there with him in the 8 o'clock Central Hour I wanted to get you on to talk a
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:41.560]  little bit more man cow here about this report out of Chicago Tribune there's
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.840]  another one of the news Gazette last night the house went 60 to 57 the Senate
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.480]  30 to 29 it's going to the governor now the biggest tax increase in Illinois
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.880]  history maybe nationwide your income tax already one of the highest in the
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.320]  country for state income tax is going up 66% and other states are passing all
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.000]  these taxes but we're not supposed to get up and get angry it came out a few
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.120]  months ago that in Philadelphia Homeland Security in Pennsylvania was spying on
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.240]  members of the legislature who were in the Tea Party for protesting higher
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.680]  taxes the government said that that was a national security threat that if we
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.840]  take our government back and cut taxes that cuts off government money so we're
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.560]  now a threat so I guess we should need to sit out and say thank you for the 66
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.600]  percent tax increase you live in Illinois I was on your show today I heard
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.960]  you saying you're going to leave the state I am going to leave I've lived here
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.960]  for 10 years more than 10 years look look here's the deal you can look at
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.720]  Detroit you can look at New York I mean Como has come around in New York but I
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.040]  Alex here's the deal these these and I'm a nonpartisan guy I'm an independent
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.680]  guy I'm a Jeffersonian guy I'm a constitution guy but listen here's
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.440]  what happens in the big city you live in Austin let me school you on the big
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.560]  cities okay you have the the dummy crafts that promise everything to the
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.560]  people that don't work they promise everything and so therefore more and
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.600]  more move to that city Detroit New York Chicago more and more and more and they
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.880]  need more and more and more services more and more and so they have to keep
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.960]  jacking up taxes all the businesses flee so now they need more money so they
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.520]  jack up the taxes more more people leave people like me and finally you have a
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.720]  burnt-out shell that looks like Beirut downtown St. Louis is another one you
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.960]  can't live downtown so you just have a bunch of people that don't work look hey
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.480]  I was there 50 feet away from obla-blah when he walked out in Grant Park
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.040]  Chicago after he was elected remember that big Roman Coliseum they built for
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.720]  him and I was with a group of people and they were saying we don't have to work
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.280]  anymore we don't have to work and I was laughing thinking wow how stupid is that
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.760]  what do you mean you don't have to work well guess what Alex I was wrong they
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.600]  don't have to work anymore I just have to work harder and I and Rand was right
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.120]  you know the problem with this the problem with this socialism is
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.520]  eventually you're right out of the workers money they've taken enough they've
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.160]  taken up blood from this stone and I'm moving to a different beach 66% income
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.920]  tax raised and I never got the vote on it and that's it they just steal and
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.760]  steal and somehow if you say I don't want to give you more money well that
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.080]  you're not considered noble that it's noble for me to work while another man
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:41.080]  sits around I'm fed up well what's amazing about it man Cal as you know is
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.680]  that's what world government's about the UN actually says they want a world
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:50.120]  government so there's nowhere to run and they can just raise taxes raise taxes
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.520]  and you've got these cities competing with each other for how many armies of
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.240]  welfare people they can get into them to give them more services yeah and now
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.120]  they want our guns they want our free speech but as you said earlier people
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.120]  are really waking up and the system is in trouble and they're scared and they
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.840]  know it well and then you have a situation like this and you see how the
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.720]  media incorrectly is playing it I'm sorry me and you talking about them
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  taking 66% more without a vote without me wanting to be part of this it's
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.240]  fevery and there's nothing wrong in fact I think it's very patriotic what you
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.960]  and I and others are doing they're they're spending our money well look
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.400]  look a billion dollars to rebuild Gaza why are we rebuilding Gaza so that
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.160]  radicalized Muslims can shoot rockets into school buses build with Jewish
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.000]  children wait why do I have to rebuild Gaza after they destroyed it Eric man
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.520]  Cal Muller without a time look forward to speaking to you again very soon take
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.320]  care buddy Gerald Salente coming up straight ahead we'll cover what's
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.680]  happening across the board
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.440]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.800]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turning
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.440]  menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.720]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.280]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.960]  off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.000]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.360]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.440]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.600]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.640]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.520]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.800]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.960]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.280]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.160]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:07.520]  radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.200]  your mind
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:30.560]  we are now eight minutes into the second hour of this live broadcast it is the
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:39.120]  12th day of January 2011 top trends forecaster joined us late last year in
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:46.240]  December and now it's his first visit with us in 2011 Gerald Salente founder of
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.560]  the trends research Institute in 1980 Gerald is a pioneer trend strategist
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.480]  he's the author of several national bestsellers and the websites trends
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:01.200]  research dot com obviously Gerald you know what the big story the big issue is
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.440]  it's not just the federal judge a pro-second amendment judge roll being
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:12.400]  shot in the face and killed or this poor congresswoman Giffords being shot to
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.200]  the brain but surviving and it looks like may recover with most of her
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.680]  functions intact and this little poor nine-year-old girl the father has said
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.720]  don't use this for political gain don't use this to take more liberties and he
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.200]  went on to criticize the TSA and we now know the guy reportedly from multiple
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:36.440]  neighbors was taking a powerful hallucinogen almost on a daily basis it
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.160]  appears that the best MO we've got is he was obsessed with the congresswoman and
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.920]  so so not only what happened with the shooting but now this move to restrict
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:54.120]  free speech right on the heels of the FCC announcing internet controls right on
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:58.120]  the heels of all these calls to restrict free speech second amendment it
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.320]  looks like the system really wants to use this to clamp down but I've got the
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.880]  national polls out no one is buying it in fact the polls are showing that people
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.640]  are becoming even more pro-second amendment after watching this it seems
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.560]  like anything the mainstream media touches is turning the dust instead of
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.760]  having the Midas touch they've got the you know just you know the touch of death
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:28.120]  here the system is is it appears really in trouble give us your breakdown on the
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:34.240]  whole situation I think you've summed it up accurately as we also know this kid
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.880]  from the reports you know he didn't we wasn't watching news or listening to
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:46.000]  talk radio just as they did with 9-11 Alex they'll use any excuse they can to
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.160]  clamp down on freedom it's one of the top trends that we're looking at loss of
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:57.440]  liberty in 2011 and the piece by the way is the trends journal will be out in a
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.280]  week or so and the piece is written by Paul Craig Roberts on this very issue so
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.800]  the trend to to take our freedoms away from us has long been in the making and
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.960]  they're going to use this excuse from this sick kid as an excuse to take more
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  away from us so if the other important thing to to understand however is that
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:27.680]  what the people want doesn't count you look at poll after poll they do what
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.760]  they want whether it was a tarp bailouts or abrogating our constitutional
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.920]  rights so it's going to be a fight for freedom to the end continue along that
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:46.280]  line well they're not going to stop well as we saw with this a piece of
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:50.160]  legislation they're trying to push through with what they call net
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.800]  neutrality or well couldn't have come up with a better name and then we'll look
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.000]  what's going on on the other aspects we have they've brought Afghanistan and
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.240]  Pakistan to the good old USA with drones flying over our cities in Miami and in
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.880]  Houston peering in your windows following us to see who's good in whose
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:23.080]  bed we saw our esteemed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano the
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.920]  czaret making a deal with Walmart to follow where we're every move and have
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:37.720]  people rat us out I encourage everyone to go and look up that video on YouTube
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:44.160]  of Janet Napolitano beginning it by saying that Homeland Security starts in
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.480]  your hometown and that if you see anything in the Walmart store or Walmart
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:56.480]  parking lot to contact your authorities or your Walmart manager yes some guy
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.120]  making sixty to fifty a week in our area I mean yeah like he's gonna help solve
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:08.480]  the big problem that not withstanding when you watch the video the only thing
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:15.400]  missing is a heavy German accent from World War two era because that's
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.560]  exactly what it sounds like and then I the other question becomes all of this
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.960]  security to watch us who's watching these people that are watching us what
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:35.080]  twisted brains out there are peering in our windows and see whether or not we're
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.360]  abiding by the law so the fact of the matter is Alex this is the way it goes
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:48.240]  it's old news to us we put it in chapter and verse in earlier trend alerts and
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:55.960]  trends journals as the economy continues to decline as they continue to lose
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:03.080]  more and more control America takes on the aspects of a third world nation they
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.600]  take the lowest common denominator of society the people that couldn't get
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.840]  jobs flipping hamburgers at McDonald's these are the people they put out there
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.160]  for the goon squad you see them when you go to the airport these aren't the best
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.520]  in the brightest let's get this really straight all of a sudden now they become
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:29.480]  the people to fill you up and they become the people have no lives of their
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.600]  own to exert control over you well Gerald that's what I've noticed coming in and
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.760]  out of the country or flying a lot of these people it's like they're trying
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.800]  to act thuggish they're trying to intimidate you they're trying to bug
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.200]  their eyes out at old women and people with kids most of them can hardly speak
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.680]  English I noticed they're you know hiring people from police state nations
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.160]  that this is their status now they came from places with sewage running down
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.840]  the streets and I've been all over the world you are very well traveled and
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.080]  and growing up we knew third world countries had cops that acted thuggish
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.760]  and guys with machine guns on corners and now that's coming to America but with
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.600]  high-tech telescreens saying watch your neighbor and now they're on the news
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.680]  saying we want to pass laws that if anything you say might upset other
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:27.360]  people you're gonna be arrested and by the way we want your guns and by the
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.120]  way we're gonna blame this on anybody that's criticizing the Federal Reserve
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.280]  I mean they've named Ron Paul and myself on multiple programs all over print
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:42.400]  media TV say I mean this is blood libel I mean Sarah Palin you know she's no
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.520]  you know Angel she doesn't you know that North Korea is the enemy and South
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:53.560]  Korea is the ally but but but still she got this right so a blind hog is you
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.480]  know able to find a currents I mean I'll sure take her over a Barack Obama but
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:04.080]  here it is she said when was it less heated back in those calm days when
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.060]  political figures literally settle their differences with dueling pistols
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:13.760]  since when are we collectively guilty and have to give up our rights and and
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.920]  and and not criticize government when some guy who had literally took a
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.000]  hallucinogen quote almost every day and was quote a liberal and quote obsessed
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.960]  with her and put letters from her to him in his safe I mean this guy was you
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.960]  know missing every knife in the drawer his elevator didn't even go up one floor
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:40.200]  and then I get to take the blame for this and and look at Illinois a 66%
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:45.480]  income tax increase they just passed it last night everybody's fleeing that
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.040]  place it's gonna look like Detroit if they keep it up I mean where is this
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:55.080]  going it's insanity Gerald it's as I said we're moving into third world
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.800]  status there are a lot of indicators this isn't rhetoric when I say this you
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.640]  have it you for example the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.080]  the United States of any of the industrialized nations you just mentioned
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:15.840]  Chicago Illinois that's the highest corporate tax rate by the way when you
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.200]  put state and federal on it probably in the world so this is what they're doing
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.320]  and we're seeing the results of it maybe you're going to start seeing more and
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.840]  more outbreaks of violence whether it's somebody out of their mind like this
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:39.560]  guy or people just fed up by the way right up here in good old Kingston New
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.560]  York you know I used to talk about that bank the key bank I had trouble getting
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.080]  my money out of when they wouldn't give it to me because I wanted to keep it
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.760]  but for myself it didn't want them to hold it and I mentioned that they got
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:03.400]  robbed twice bingo three times in two years they had another one this week I
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:10.360]  could literally throw a stone and hit this bank that's how close it is you're
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:15.960]  gonna see more and more of a breakdown and as the breakdown gets worse they're
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:22.240]  gonna clamp down harder because they're going to say we have to stop it's gonna
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:28.000]  be the it's gonna be the campaign slogan walk my words of 2012 we got to get
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.760]  tough on crime so as the system breaks down more they're gonna bring in more
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.560]  of the goon squads to keep us in check well you notice what they've been
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:44.200]  politically building is it's a paramilitary army designed for the milk
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.480]  cows those of us that are law-abiding pay the taxes they're actually hiring a lot
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.960]  of the criminals now just like the Nazis and the Soviets did that's coming out
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:59.280]  to fill their ranks and I've seen all over the country will lay off 20% 40 over
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.440]  60 in some counties of the sheriff's deputies and then announced but the
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  sheriff's deputies were keeping they're gonna be revenue generation they're not
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.840]  gonna come respond to serious crimes like armed robbery now even the Oakland
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.400]  police chief last year was talking about that so they're telling you the cops
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.320]  are there to get your money not to help you well of course as I've said and we'll
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.280]  be writing about it more in the transjournal the police have become the
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:30.000]  enforcers for the crime bosses the big guys are off limits have you seen any
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.960]  heads roll from Wall Street and all these criminal bank scams and I love the
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.920]  white shoe boy language they use robo signers stay there stay there Gerald
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.280]  got a hate to interrupt got a break for a comeback let's start off there with the

[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.000]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:25.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.480]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.440]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.960]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.680]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:22:00.400]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV have
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.120]  you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.320]  financial affairs I continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:16.240]  after the shooting but now CNN, MSNBC and others are reporting talking to
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.560]  friends and family he hated politics saw himself as apolitical and was
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:29.960]  basically obsessed with her and that's what our article up on prisonplanet.com
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:36.320]  says on Sunday I called him as a nihilistic guy rejected by women into
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:42.640]  the occult to shock people just like Eric Muller said earlier it's a game
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.920]  called topper they're trying to top each other and how radical they are and
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.680]  started taking a high-powered hallucinogen quote almost every day
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.320]  that's his neighbors his friends his family the Associated Press reporting
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:03.120]  and it goes on report was the shooter in love with Congresswoman Giffords now the
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.040]  new head lineup at Drudge he did not watch TV he disliked the news he didn't
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:14.880]  listen to political radio that is being reported here and then I want to get
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.280]  back into the economy this is a short segment but you got cut off by the break
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.520]  Gerald Salente you were starting to get into the things that are happening but
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:29.320]  it's so incredible to actually see them from within hours of this happening
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.400]  trying to blame anybody who is seen as promoting lower taxes smaller government
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.120]  and the Tea Party movement which the Republicans have tried to take over but
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.560]  unsuccessfully I mean these really are authoritarians they really are trying to
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.800]  in free speech do you think they're going to be successful well they are
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.520]  successful look at the mainstream media that nothing more than than shills for
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.560]  Washington but they're not going to be successful in the long term again it's
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.120]  it's a give-and-take what as you know one of the top trends for 2011 is
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.600]  journalism 2.0 and you are it and I'm it and it's all of these other it's out
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.760]  there that are putting out a different message so as the message gets out there
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:19.840]  more and more they clamp down on it more and more so it's going to be a fight in
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.120]  the end we believe however that the voices such as yours and mine and many
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.560]  others is going to ring much louder than theirs because when you look at all of
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.960]  the polls coming in people are losing their faith in the mainstream media and
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:42.120]  again they're going to use any excuse they can to clamp down on any message
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:47.320]  that they don't want to hear and then here's the deal with with true TV time
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.640]  Warner we've now confirmed they did kill that episode on police state under
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.120]  Homeland Security threats behind the scenes the government didn't want this
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.920]  out in the open they're threatening people to keep it secret now they've
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.360]  ordered all the DVR distributors to erase all the seasons last year and
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.560]  this year and they're starting to not air the old episodes as much I mean if
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.000]  they can get away with killing Ventura's TV show and there's not any
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.640]  mainstream media coverage on it why not kill all of the alternative media or
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.520]  alternative information that gets on mainstream media I mean this is really
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.240]  happening it is happening and it's going to continue as I said the more the
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.440]  economy declines you would just at the break you mentioned a piece that just
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:38.160]  came out on CNBC yes what was it oh housing oh absolutely in fact that's
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.520]  what we're gonna get to next and then I digressed its housing market slips into
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.960]  depression territory and it says as the economy revs back to life I thought the
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:51.840]  recession ended a year and a half ago with signs of hiring on the horizon the
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.480]  housing market is being left behind and it goes on to say in the past few years
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.040]  we've been careful to choose the words carefully not calling it a recession
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.520]  until it fit the technical definition and avoiding any inappropriate use of the
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.360]  d-word depression and then they go on to say but now looking at the numbers we
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:14.160]  have to report that this is a a depressionary situation and that's that's
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.240]  them saying that's them saying depression with cooked numbers Gerald I know
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:25.000]  and let's get a couple of things straight here number one all the money the
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.800]  federal government has put on our shoulders to boost up this phony housing
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:37.320]  market to begin with number two remember all the tax breaks they gave the people
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:43.800]  to buy those homes to sucker them into the market a Ponzi scheme that we paid
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:50.600]  for number three as you read that propaganda that you just read as the
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:58.200]  as our employment numbers rev up let's get this straight when they began this
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.720]  stimulus package on the old bomber they said they were going to create four
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:14.840]  million jobs last year 1.1 million jobs were created at that rate accounting
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:21.240]  for the new people moving into the system it would take until 2030 just to
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:30.320]  get back to levels before the recession began number four Obama said and his
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:37.760]  brilliant Larry Summers and others that with the stimulus program that in 2010
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:43.440]  we'd be looking at an unemployment rate of seven point five percent another lie
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.120]  stay there

[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.040]  they're scared they're trying to intimidate us to shut up because they
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.680]  know that they are not invincible in fact they're weak because they've engaged
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.600]  in so many crimes it's also important to support local station sponsors
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.160]  it's important to support the people we bring on here whether it's Ron Paul

[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:22.080]  dot com and subscribe to that important journal as we grow the alternative real
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:28.440]  media 2.0 as Gerald puts it now now Gerald you were getting into so please
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.320]  recap all their lies you'd gotten up to point for I was reading out of this MSNBC
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.080]  excuse me CNBC report housing market slips into depression territory you've
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.840]  been saying that for two plus years every other economist or trends forecaster
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.000]  we have on we know real unemployment's above 22 percent they're saying it's
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.400]  9.7 and then they have this Orwellian statement here as the economy revs back
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.200]  into life with signs of hiring on the horizon on the horizon the housing
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.240]  market is being left behind what are they talking about please continue well
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.120]  first of all I like to say that in what you're saying about supporting your
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:13.400]  your your the people to keep your show running as you well know the folks here
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:21.680]  where diamond gusset jeans and and we we also have our supplies of e-foods dot
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:30.200]  com and it's very important also to re look at if you haven't gotten it yet the
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:36.080]  Obama deception and the fall of the Republic and it particularly give it
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:42.440]  to your Wimpo Krat friends who believed in change you could believe in and
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:50.480]  believed in hope because as you have done so brilliantly in those productions by
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.360]  bringing the people that you did on to to outline what was going to happen it's
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:03.280]  falling out exactly as predicted and if you need any more proof of who's
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:10.800]  running the White House look who Obama just brought in as his new chief of
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:19.360]  staff another daily from Chicago and where did he come from oh he was the
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  chief lobbyist for JP Morgan Chase there's some more change you can believe
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.960]  in and you look at the other guy who he just brought in to take over the place
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:39.480]  of the brilliant Larry Summers Jean Spurling and what was he famous for huh
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:47.120]  I think it was helping to deregulate the Glass-Steagall Act under the Clinton
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.760]  administration and isn't he a lot of great change because he had the same
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:59.240]  position under the Clinton administration that he now has with the
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.880]  Obama administration we have the architects of Glass-Steagall and the
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:09.160]  tens of trillions in derivatives 1.5 quadrillion total impossible to pay
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:14.920]  back the dailies are admittedly the kings of the Irish Mafia going back
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:21.120]  almost a hundred years you've got I mean all these other mafias the Ramamanual
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.680]  Mafia and others running around I mean this is so brazen and when you got cut
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.200]  off by the break you were bringing up in the last two three years how we were
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.560]  told after the stimulus after the bailout it's all gonna turn around and
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:38.560]  oh we never entered a recession or we left the recession in June of 09 I mean
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.400]  they literally can't even get their lives straight and they're in there
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.960]  stealing with both hands and Obama's out saying I'm not gonna hire some Wall
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.720]  Street insiders when that's all he's doing I know again you know everyone
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:59.040]  should everyone should get copies of the Obama deception and fall of the
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:05.520]  Republic and distribute him to everyone that you know because the facts are there
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:13.000]  how they began to lie and continue to lie so as we go forward here and you know
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.880]  I've been criticized I want to make this really clear we never said there would
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:23.840]  be a stock market crash in 2010 I said that there would be a global financial
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:29.200]  crash of some sort and we're seeing with the European Monetary Union number two
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:35.680]  when we made the forecast we said we don't know what schemes undreamed of
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:41.520]  they're going to come out with here it is they shuffled under the table and
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:49.080]  funneled to their friends as you well know over 13 between 13 to 20 trillion
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.600]  dollars in low interest or no interest loans to banks around the world to hedge
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:02.320]  funds to General Electric to Holly Davidson to Verizon to the Bank of Japan
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:11.680]  the banks of South Korea in Ireland in Spain in France in England they were
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.440]  funding thousands of companies the details are still secret and the truth
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.800]  is they tell us we never had a recession it's all lies we're in a depression for
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:26.560]  the average person every economic number is there and so what you're dealing
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:33.040]  with is people that are in a delusion we see Portugal going under we see Ireland
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.720]  we see Greece Obama deception shot two years ago right as Obama was being
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:46.040]  sworn in released a month after he got in Webster Tarpley economist George
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.200]  Humphrey yourself all of our guests in there and in my own analysis with
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.840]  total precision layout who they work for what they were going to do what
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:03.760]  countries would go down first Greece Ireland Portugal then we said it would
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.480]  spread and then finally into the rest of Europe the United States and now all
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.520]  of the financial news they admit it's inevitable and then we we predicted
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:18.480]  absolutely correctly and then they spent it and say depression recession what
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.320]  does that mean all they do is play this mind game it's all hoaxes just like they
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.920]  say Rush Limbaugh made this guy shoot this woman turns out he doesn't even
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.440]  listen to Limbaugh he was a liberal drug addict and love with her I mean it's
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:38.280]  hoax after hoax after hoax but the good news is nobody's buying it and here's
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.360]  some more you I mean they did they they never stop with this look how they're
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.960]  cooking the inflation numbers so people that need their cost of living
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:52.320]  increase on the cola aren't getting anything they're saying that food and
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:58.560]  fuel shouldn't be into the core inflation index this is perfect Soviet Union
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:04.880]  era twisting oh and here's a good one Alex today the stock market rebounded
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:13.120]  because the bond sales in Portugal they were very good China and Japan are
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.560]  pumping money into Europe to keep this Ponzi scheme afloat so yes it's
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:25.880]  collapsing it will collapse there's no stopping it and here's the real bad
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:33.520]  news it's going to be followed by war add it up you hear the minister foreign
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:40.440]  minister economic minister of Brazil Mentega week after week month after
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:45.200]  month screaming there's a currency war all of the nations are trying to
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:50.360]  intervene to keep their currencies from not increasing too much because the
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:56.240]  United States and China are devaluating theirs so they can't export then you
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.360]  hear from Merkel the Chancellor of Germany saying a trade war is beginning
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:08.360]  add them up currency wars plus trade wars equal real war now China is
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.840]  becoming extremely threatening openly talking about war test firing missiles
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.400]  now at the coast of Texas and California and what's insane about this is is
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.480]  Dr. Robert described many years ago here in countless other economists as this
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.600]  starts falling apart as the dollar plunges the Chinese the EU everybody the
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.440]  Arabs they rush in to try to prop it up because they're so invested in it then
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.640]  the euro starts going under they run in pumping their currencies in there but
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:40.120]  then that devalues their currencies so you have a concerted devaluation but how
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.720]  do you know the implosions about to become accelerated and really evident
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.600]  where they have trouble hiding it that's what once people have to pump up the
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.600]  dollar and the euro they then stop buying as much of it so they're still
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.880]  trying to prop it up because they're heavily invested from the old days but
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.800]  they stopped buying it now they're openly moving away from the dollar
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.520]  openly moving away from the euro where are the Arabs and the Chinese and the
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.160]  Russians and the Brazilians investing in the Chinese currency for the first time
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.800]  ever it's being traded worldwide the replacement of the dollar as the world
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.600]  reserve currency has now gone into high gear and everybody in New York and DC
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.800]  running this criminal operation and over in England and the rest of it they know
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.720]  full well what's happening all the rich people I know and people I know some
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.360]  billionaires and others I know a lot of other people that know them they've all
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.560]  left the country they've got armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere all
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:36.400]  over the world they're scared to death they know what's going on and they're
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.160]  mad that we're here warning people about what they've done Gerald that's right
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.320]  but look what's going on again current events form future trends first of all
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.000]  with China we just saw a secretary gates over there yesterday warning the
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:59.400]  Chinese not to underestimate the power of the American military let's save it for
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:05.880]  the kitties they're losing over in Afghanistan they can't win in Iraq now
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:11.520]  they're going into Pakistan and just for a little bit of history it was the
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:17.640]  Chinese that with the North Koreans that brought the armistice the United States
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:22.240]  and South Korea couldn't defeat them just a little bit of history it was the
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.760]  Chinese supporting the Vietnamese that made the United States withdraw from
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:35.760]  Vietnam as losers and now they're going to say that the Chinese are underestimating
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:42.520]  our military strength as they show off by no mistake their new stealth fighter
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.440]  jets but they now had their new weaponry these missiles that could take out
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:54.120]  aircraft carriers and fleets of ships our trains can't even go above 50 the
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.440]  rail lines are so old China isn't just building 250 mile an hour train lines
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:03.680]  over there they're now building them in the US they own everything yeah yeah
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.360]  they're bidding in California they're bidding in California and now they're in
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:13.040]  the process of buying up Europe what do you think they're bailing out the banks
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.520]  for they're taking over the industries one after another it's the golden rule
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.560]  those who have the gold rule the banks completely sold us out through pure
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.520]  treachery and you notice the CFR a decade ago said the next century will be
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.840]  the Chinese century they geared this whole thing up Maury strong and all of
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.440]  them have moved to China they set us up they sucked us dry they blew us away
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  Gerald and look who and look who the guy is as you just mentioned the daily
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:47.120]  family who just moved in you know what he was known for under the Clinton
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.920]  administration when he was Commerce Secretary he was known as the Nath
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:59.240]  Dazaar he's the guy that was the brains behind pushing it through incredible

[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:24.800]  This mass is of vital news and information. The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:39.800]  You know, Gerald, I love this modern media spin that we're being negative. We're hurting confidence with our, as the New York Times called you, a purveyor of pessimism porn.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:46.800]  And they've called me a purveyor of conspiracy porn all over the news, Newsweek, Time Magazine, and others.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:57.800]  When all we're doing is reporting on the spectacle of foreign banks stealing tens of trillions, NAFTA and GATT destroying our industrial base,
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:05.800]  China buying up the ports, the roads, taxes exploding, and then we're here saying, hey, this is a bad idea,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:11.800]  and the government's answer is, shut up, don't upset people, we need to take your free speech away.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.800]  I mean, if that's not bona fide, tyranny, what is?
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.800]  Well, it's again, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.800]  And as I've said many times, think of the word confidence. We're hurting the confidence.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.800]  It's a con game, confidence, con man. That's all they are.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:36.800]  And again, when I came out and said, listen, this real estate market is not going to correct itself.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  They're taking our money to pump it up. Oh, you're a gloom and doomer. You're hurting confidence.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.800]  No, we're stopping the con game, and they don't like it. You want to hear one for the books?
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.800]  Remember Judith Miller with the New York Times, the toilet paper of record?
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:00.800]  She was the one that pushed off the propaganda center from the Bush administration, the Cheney Neocons,
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.800]  that Saddam Hussein was acquiring materials to build nuclear weaponry.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:12.800]  She came out recently and said that WikiLeaks is bad journalism.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.800]  Can you imagine this coming from her mouth? They can't stand us, Alex,
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:23.800]  because we're exposing the game and we don't suck up and bow down.
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.800]  It's incredible. She also came out and called for civility and media,
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  but her lies and her publishing of those government lies knowingly helped cause all our dead troops
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.800]  and all those dead people overseas and the goodwill of the U.S. has done so much trouble
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.800]  and these failed wars. It's fine when they lie about WMDs.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.800]  It's fine when government does things like that to kill people
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.800]  because they're not going to show us all the dead Iraqi kids on the news.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  They're just going to try to use this dead nine-year-old to take our liberties domestically.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.800]  They know what they're doing.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:03.800]  Oh, yeah. You look at the front page coverage whenever it's a Veterans Day or whatever
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:06.800]  in the New York Times. It's pure propaganda.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  I was mentioning before about current events forming future trends.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  I mentioned China. Two things before I go on.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  One is that as the American media is so focused on this Arizona tragedy,
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.800]  as a trend-tracking tip, watch the rest of the news going on around the world
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.800]  because there are big things happening that are going to change the direction of things.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:31.800]  One of them being what's going on in Tunisia.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:36.800]  It's going on and it happened in England. It's when happening in Italy.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.800]  The youth of the world are uniting against what's going on.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.800]  The students of the world, they're angry and they're mad as hell
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.800]  and they're not taking it anymore. They're rioting in the streets.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.800]  You predicted this two and a half years ago on air.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.800]  You said that the education bubble would pop worldwide
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.800]  because there are no jobs for these degrees.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:05.800]  Exactly. And they know the levels of corruption, what they call austerity measures.
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.800]  What are you talking about before?
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:15.800]  Raising taxes, lowering the minimum wage, losing jobs, losing pensions,
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.800]  losing benefits, add it up.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:27.800]  Students in the streets in France, in Italy, in Greece, in England, in Tunisia, in Turkey.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:33.800]  It's happening in front of our eyes. Why did it happen in the U.S. during the 60s?
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.800]  Final five minutes. Answer that question back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:39.800]  Third hour coming up with Journal San Lente.

[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:43.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:49.800]  Gerald, you were making a point again when the break cut you off. Go ahead.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:01:00.800]  Well, go back to the 1960s. I was there. I'm 64 years old, so I was prime draft meeting those days.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.800]  Why were the students out in the streets? It was very simple.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.800]  They were getting drafted and they didn't want to go to Vietnam.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:11.800]  Why isn't anybody protesting these Afghan and Iraq wars?
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:18.800]  And by the way, in this midterm elections, not a peep about cutting the military budget or rending the wars.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:22.800]  Why aren't they there because their necks aren't on the line?
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:28.800]  Why are they protesting in Europe because their necks are on the line in a different way?
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.800]  They have a futureless future. They're in debt. They have no money coming in.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:37.800]  The same thing is going to start to happen in the U.S.
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:44.800]  Because these kids are facing mountains of debt. They have these university degrees in worthlessness.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:49.800]  They're stuck home living with mommy and daddy. They're smart enough to know.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.800]  It's just like the days of, it's neo feudalism.
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:58.800]  Now we have the kings and queens of commerce that are robbing us blind.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:06.800]  But the difference is, back in the feudal days, they didn't have the kind of information that you're putting out there.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.800]  They didn't have information from the trends journal. They didn't have all of this knowledge.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:14.800]  They see what's going on and they're angry.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.800]  So the revolution is going to happen from the students.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.800]  Because let's face it, when you're 18 to 30 years old, 28 years old,
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:28.800]  you know, you have these hormones raging through your body.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.800]  You don't know any limits and you're angry.
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.800]  You think they're going to be taking to the streets in protest.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.800]  They have nothing to lose by doing it.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.800]  They have everything to lose by not doing it.
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.800]  And I want to add one more point into it.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:51.800]  As we're looking at these phony employment numbers,
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:58.800]  they're not accounting for all the young people that haven't gotten into the employment sector
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:02.800]  and they can't find any jobs. When you add that number in,
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:10.800]  you're looking at another three to four million that have never been put into the system.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.800]  Well, it's a recipe for disaster.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.800]  And then you've got so many other people who their parents cook the dinner for them,
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.800]  never make them wash the plates, never make them do laundry, never make them do any work.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.800]  And then they get into the workforce.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.800]  Not only that, you know, are the globalists cheating us, there's a lot of lazy,
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.800]  entitled people in this country and now as reality dawns on them,
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.800]  government hopes to organize them into some type of political mob to, you know,
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:41.800]  be the jackboots to rob those of us that do work.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.800]  But I just don't see that happening.
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:51.800]  I mean, an army of entitled slobs, you know, does not make an effective Gestapo.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.800]  But you might find them at the TSA, you know.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.800]  No, you're right. No, they won't be able to stop it.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  It's happening. It's happening.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.800]  Again, only look at the news.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.800]  And that's what I'm saying and I want to make that point again as a trend forecaster.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:12.800]  We're looking at the other news going on around the world.
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:17.800]  Again, Turkey, Tunisia, Greece, Italy, England, France.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:25.800]  The students are up in arms. The tuition rates increased 200% in the U.K.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.800]  as they're cutting back on everything.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.800]  Oh, and by the way, we're going to raise the value added taxes.
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.800]  Oh, and your property taxes, they're going to go up too.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.800]  We're going to squeeze every nickel and dime out of you.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:45.800]  All of a sudden, Alex, he's dim-witted bureaucrats
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:47.800]  who never come up with a bright idea.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  They know that they have to have the money coming in so they can keep their job.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  And now they want to cow us to not have political free speech.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:17.800]  Thank you for joining us so much. We'll be right back.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:35.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.800]  Call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:05.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:08.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:10.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:13.800]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.800]  I've termed numerous influence on our president in Congress,
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.800]  and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:24.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.800]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:38.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:41.800]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.800]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.800]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:40.800]  I wonder if that's the law, like a six-foot-eight-guy with a build like an NFL linebacker
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:45.800]  who, whenever MSNBC attacked my bullhorn when I was bullhornin' Chris Matthews,
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.800]  they cut it with a knife.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:50.800]  We call law up, who was in a nearby area with another bullhorn.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.800]  He pulled up, he put Luke Radowski up on his shoulders away from their knives.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:59.800]  That's actually the extra on my film, The Obama Deception.
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:04.800]  I wonder if that's the law from Colorado or somebody else known as the law.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.800]  We'll see coming up in the next segment with calls.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:11.800]  We don't screen your calls, so I don't know if that's law or not.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:14.800]  You can again see him in the extra of The Obama Deception
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:19.800]  or Alex Jones' Bullhorn's Chris Matthews, and you can see it in that video as well.
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.800]  They got so mad when I was bullhornin' their live broadcasts,
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.800]  because they were outside, it's free speech, and they attacked me, they hit me, they punched me,
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:30.800]  and they cut the wire, tried to pull the bullhorn away.
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:34.800]  I call Luke and law up, they pull up, they got two more bullhorns.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.800]  I start bullhorning, Luke climbs up, and he's not a little guy, up on lost shoulders,
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:41.800]  and that was some classic.
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.800]  And I said, go ahead and break these bullhorns, we'll bring four back.
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:49.800]  See, that's the fighting spirit.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.800]  Okay, let's get into the serious news here.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:59.800]  Years ago, I interviewed these people, and they will not come on the show now.
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:03.800]  And whereas they do get their First Amendment,
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:09.800]  people do deserve privacy at their events on private property.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:15.800]  And I have no doubt watching these people and researching them,
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:19.800]  I believe, it's my opinion, that they're being financed by the government
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:22.800]  to create a pretext to shut down free speech.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.800]  There's no way, and I've watched them on television, they giggle, they snicker.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:31.800]  That demonic, that very, very demonic, and I challenge them to come on this show.
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.800]  They're very, very demonic, and just my sixth sense,
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:40.800]  when I look at them, I think these are demonic people.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.800]  These are goblin-like, giggling, snickering creatures.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:45.800]  I mean, if you were to go to a funeral and say,
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.800]  America's been judged while we have dead troops, that would be bad enough.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:52.800]  But it's your First Amendment, and I'll defend that right.
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:59.800]  But to then giggle and snicker and enjoy it, I mean, it's filthy.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:04.800]  And now, the Westboro Baptist Church to face angel wings, bikers,
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.800]  and legislation at nine-year-old Tucson Funeral.
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:14.800]  And, you know, I wonder how these people would like it
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.800]  if folks were bullhornin' their house every day.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.800]  I wonder how they would like it.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.800]  Again, these are extreme tests for the First Amendment.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.800]  It's done either out of complete craziness or, I believe, it's staged.
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:33.800]  And, again, it's comments like this, and I've seen it on video.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.800]  I don't just trust the news when I see stuff.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.800]  I've seen similar quotes by this guy.
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:39.800]  Speaking in a video about the shooting in Arizona,
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:41.800]  Westboro leader Fred Phelps said,
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:44.800]  Thank God for the violent shooter.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.800]  A guy in a grim reaper outfit.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:53.800]  You know, a guy who is on psychotropic hallucinogens.
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:54.800]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:58.800]  That little nine-year-old girl, I'm telling you right now,
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.800]  I believe in the First Amendment.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.800]  But we had a First Amendment back in the old days
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.800]  when if you said to somebody your wife is a whore,
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:11.800]  if the person thought it wasn't true and had honor,
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:13.800]  they would punch you in the face, basically slap you,
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.800]  and say, I will meet you in one hour at this public park,
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.800]  and you better come with your musket.
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:28.800]  Or you can pick a handgun, or you can pick a sword.
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:32.800]  And the tail end of that is the archetypal 1860s,
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:34.800]  70s, you know, guys in a bar, and they say,
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.800]  let's go out and settle this, and then they
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.800]  paste 20 paces off and then draw.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.800]  Then they made that stuff illegal.
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  You know, in the old days, I mean,
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:45.800]  even when I was a teenager most of the time,
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:47.800]  cops pull up and there's a fight going on.
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.800]  If people aren't stabbing each other and stuff,
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.800]  they just break it up.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:52.800]  Nowadays, they send you to jail for that.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:55.800]  But I've got to tell you, sitting there saying,
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.800]  thank God, this little girl getting shot.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:02.800]  And they've got an obsession with homosexuality.
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:04.800]  You know, I can see America being judged for abortion,
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:07.800]  but it's this watching weirdos get all giggly-faced
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.800]  and all excited and lick their lips.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:14.800]  I mean, they just look like every other demon-possessed
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:15.800]  person I've seen, basically.
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.800]  They've got that, you know, in my gut and my spirit,
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.800]  these are bad people.
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:24.800]  These are bad, bad, bad, bad, bad people.
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.800]  And it's my first amendment to say it about them.
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:29.800]  Make me sick.
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.800]  And their whole cause isn't about teaching people
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.800]  that a lifestyle, you know, is unhealthy
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.800]  or that it's destructive or robs you the joy of children.
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.800]  It's not a loving message to these people.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:45.800]  It is a message that will only make all of those people's
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  lifestyles seem that much better and good
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:52.800]  compared to you saying how great it is
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:55.800]  that a nine-year-old is dead.
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.800]  You make me want to throw up,
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.800]  and I would never go to any of these demonstrations
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.800]  to cover this because I don't think I could control myself.
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:06.800]  I mean, it's one thing to go out and protest dead troops.
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:07.800]  That's bad enough.
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:10.800]  But when you start getting all happy and giggling
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.800]  and smirking and hopping up and down like a demon,
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:14.800]  all right, I'm going to be quiet.
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:23.800]  I'm going to stop right there before I start saying more stuff.
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:25.800]  I'll tell you something about this family.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.800]  I think they protest too much.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:31.800]  Looking at them, I'm not even going to get into it.
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:38.800]  These people make me want to throw up.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:41.800]  Speaking in a video about the shooting in Arizona,
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:48.800]  the pastor said, thank God for the violent shooter.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:51.800]  And you've got a big Democrat writer.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:54.800]  We covered it yesterday saying that since this family doesn't want
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.800]  to use their daughter's death to get guns or free speech,
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:02.800]  that they should have their child taken from them.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:03.800]  But that's their free speech.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:07.800]  But you're not going to take my free speech away
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:13.800]  to say you're scum, you're trash, you're filth.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:16.800]  That freakazoid Westboro church is,
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:20.800]  and that freakazoid syndicate of columnists say,
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:21.800]  and take their kid.
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:23.800]  And that's why we've got the Republic,
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:26.800]  is to protect ourselves from freaks like you.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:29.800]  Because in a democracy, they could get 51% of the gibbering
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.800]  public to go along with them and actually take our rights away.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:43.800]  I've tried to not talk about the Westboro church.
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:45.800]  They're there to give Christians a bad name.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:47.800]  They're there to give family values,
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:48.800]  grips a bad name.
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:51.800]  They're there to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:54.800]  And if the government didn't pull on the strings,
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:56.800]  the old devil is.
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:59.800]  I ought to show some video of them.
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:04.800]  These are, all right, I'm going to shut up.
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.800]  What's happening, I kind of got stuck in a little eddy pool here.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:11.800]  Kind of a back to the future groundhog day,
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.800]  because I just keep imaging videos.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.800]  I've seen these people over the years and how they enjoy
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:20.800]  when the families are crying over their dead sons or daughters
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:23.800]  in the war, or now this family with their dead little girl.
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:26.800]  And I've seen that where they like demons suck up the pain,
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:29.800]  the enjoyment, and get all these little nally looking looks
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:30.800]  on their faces.
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.800]  It makes me want to throw up.
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:36.800]  You know, just the gibbering,
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.800]  nallying in the pain is really bad.
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:41.800]  All right, I'm done.
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:42.800]  I'm done.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:45.800]  I'm done talking about them.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:48.800]  And then to watch all this trash using people like them
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:50.800]  to go after our First Amendment.
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.800]  Okay, continuing here with this information.
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.800]  Here's another really great piece of evil at AliveNews.com.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:00.800]  You know, I live in the only county in Texas,
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.800]  and that's why I've now officially moved out of the county.
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:08.800]  So I don't have to pay money for it.
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:11.800]  I mean, you've got to make a stand at some point.
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:14.800]  They conduct thousands of abortions a year,
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.800]  and they take my money in Travis County Taxes,
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:20.800]  only county in Texas to do it, many other states
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:23.800]  and statewide to pay for even partial birth abortion.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.800]  There's people lined up around the block to adopt that baby,
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.800]  but they kill them.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:31.800]  But Vanderbilt University requires nursing students
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.800]  to do abortions.
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:34.800]  That's right.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:36.800]  You want to get your nursing degree?
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:40.800]  Well, you got to help kill children.
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:41.800]  You got to pay for it.
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:43.800]  You got to help kill them.
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:46.800]  They want you to be part of their evil.
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:48.800]  That's the problem with the world government.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:49.800]  If this goes nationwide,
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:51.800]  they want to make me pay for abortions.
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:52.800]  That's what national health care does.
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.800]  I'm almost forced to leave the country.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.800]  But where is there to go?
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:58.800]  They're doing this worldwide.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.800]  I'm sick of it.
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.800]  They're all freaking out over this nine-year-old dead girl,
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:04.800]  but she achieved consciousness.
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.800]  She achieved a great nine years in a loving family.
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:11.800]  She didn't get caught up before she ever left the womb.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:14.800]  She got, oh, man.
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:16.800]  Vanderbilt University is the subject
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.800]  of a federal complaint filed today by officials
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.800]  with the Alliance Defense Fund
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:25.800]  over requiring nursing students to participate in abortions.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:26.800]  Absolutely.
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.800]  That is so immoral.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.800]  And, of course, the liberal groups all support nurses
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.800]  saying no to circumcision, which is fine.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:35.800]  You think that's immoral, sexual mutilation?
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:36.800]  That's fine.
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:38.800]  You shouldn't have to participate in it.
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:39.800]  People go, well, it's your job.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.800]  Participate.
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:44.800]  Really, if some folks come in
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:46.800]  and want you to sexually mutilate their daughter
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:48.800]  because they're from a country that does that,
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:50.800]  should a nurse have to do it?
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.800]  Well, what about chopping a baby up?
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:56.800]  What about that?
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:57.800]  You don't have to be part of that.
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:59.800]  You don't have to see its little arms and legs and head.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  And every time I talk like this, some people freak out.
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:03.800]  What? It's going on.
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:05.800]  Don't you want to know what's going on?
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.800]  Don't you want to understand what's going on?
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:10.800]  And, by the way, it's working.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:13.800]  Abortion is down over on.
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:16.800]  In the polls, the vast majority are now against it.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:22.800]  When the majority was for it, just by hair back in the 1970s,
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.800]  people are more pro-gun than they ever were
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.800]  in the face of the propaganda.
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:27.800]  They're more anti-abortion.
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:29.800]  They're anti-fetal reserve.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.800]  Do you get it?
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.800]  The awakening is happening.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:38.800]  And so they want to have their goons run around
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:40.800]  in protest funerals so that laws get passed
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:44.800]  shutting down free speech.
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:47.800]  And it goes on with a fourth-year nursing student
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:50.800]  who they're trying to force be part of killing the baby.
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.800]  You know how traumatizing it is to see little arms and legs?
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.800]  I mean, a lot of you don't want to hear it,
[02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:57.800]  especially you abortion supporters.
[02:19:57.800 --> 02:19:59.800]  You don't want to be forced to look at the dead
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:00.800]  concentration camp victim.
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.800]  If you own a septic system,
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:04.800]  or if you're facing costly septic system replacement,

[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:03.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:05.800]  in the last century alone.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:08.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:10.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:12.800]  we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:14.800]  the Americans at home.
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:16.800]  I have tremendous influence on our president
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:18.800]  in Congress, and they really
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.800]  are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.800]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:26.800]  For the Republic identifies
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:28.800]  the enemies of our nation,
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:30.800]  the criminal offshore cartel
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.800]  and on its ashes constructing world
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.800]  government.
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:37.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists,
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:39.800]  they're asking for more matches,
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.800]  and the Congress is saying,
[02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:43.800]  who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.800]  Today seems like nobody does care,
[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.800]  and right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:49.800]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.800]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.800]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:55.800]  barter item. This is Alex Jones
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:24.800]  for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:30.800]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric,
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:32.800]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:34.800]  to protect from counterfeit and carting
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:36.800]  to a private bank, having it led back
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.800]  at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:40.800]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:41.800]  when stating a central bank
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:43.800]  issuing the public currency as a greater menace
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:45.800]  to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:47.800]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:49.800]  in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:52.800]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:54.800]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:56.800]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:04.800]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.800]  Well, the Westboro Demons,
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:08.800]  a new development, they have canceled
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:10.800]  protesting a nine-year-old dead girl
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:12.800]  for moving on to Judge Rohl,
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.800]  who was ruled against Bill Clinton's
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:16.800]  gun grabbing, so they're going to go on
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:19.800]  and celebrate his death
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:23.800]  so they can demonize the First Amendment.
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:25.800]  I was trying to get them on last year
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.800]  and Jaren talked about it.
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:29.800]  They would send back emails that were like
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:30.800]  unintelligible gibberish.
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:32.800]  Maybe they're just completely crazy.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:34.800]  I don't know what they are, but I'm done talking about them.
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:36.800]  And I want to get back into the shooting.
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:39.800]  I want to get back into the economy.
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:42.800]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get into.
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.800]  Of course, it's coming out that he was, quote,
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.800]  shooting at the world, hated everyone,
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.800]  liberals, conservatives, didn't like anybody,
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:52.800]  and didn't watch TV, didn't listen to talk radio,
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.800]  but was obsessed with the Congresswoman.
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:59.800]  As we wrote, he was sweet on her,
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:01.800]  and he felt rejected by women,
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.800]  and so he went down there to kill her.
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.800]  And there you go.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.800]  Will you hear apologies from the sheriff?
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:12.800]  Dupnick, will you hear apologies from Bill Clinton?
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:14.800]  Will you hear apologies from any of them?
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:16.800]  No, they knew full well.
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:18.800]  They're attacking the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.800]  They're attacking what makes America America,
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:23.800]  and they're going to continue to do it
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:27.800]  with every tragedy they can out of 310 million Americans.
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.800]  They're going to milk it every time, every time they can,
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.800]  because they're tyrants, they're crooks,
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:35.800]  they're stealing us blind.
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:37.800]  They know what they're doing.
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:39.800]  They want to cow you.
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:41.800]  But the good news is we're not sitting down
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:43.800]  and shutting up anymore.
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:46.800]  Law in Colorado. You're on the air, Law.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.800]  Hello, Alex. Man, great to talk to you again.
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.800]  Hey, I recognize your voice.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:53.800]  It's the guy that was protested with us in Denver, right?
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:55.800]  I'm that guy.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.800]  How you doing, man?
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:59.800]  You know, I'm doing pretty good, Alex.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.800]  This has been a banner year, amazing year for We Are Changed Colorado.
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:06.800]  You know, one of the things I really wanted to talk about is,
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.800]  you know, how everybody says that, you know,
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:11.800]  what you're doing and the work we're doing is negative.
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:13.800]  But what I keep seeing is that the work we're doing
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:16.800]  is so incredibly positive.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.800]  We just had an action yesterday, actually, at the DIA airport again.
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.800]  And they couched out to us and gave us permits.
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:26.800]  And, you know, I was amazed at how many people,
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:29.800]  and I've seen this change over time, are coming up to us.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.800]  They're actually coming out of the crowd to us.
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  And they go, you know, Alex Jones, you know,
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:36.800]  are you part of the truth movement?
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:40.800]  And it's just really inspiring, and it's really, really moving.
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:43.800]  And I've seen the change, you know, over the last few years we've been doing this.
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:45.800]  I've seen the change in people.
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:48.800]  And so I just got to say, you know, they want this shooter thing
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:51.800]  to keep us in the fear, keep us in the negativity,
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.800]  but it is so valuable to focus on the positive things that we're doing
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:58.800]  because it's amazing the effects that we're having on the world.
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:00.800]  It's just amazing.
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:03.800]  Exactly. And that's why the system is going to provocateur events.
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:05.800]  They're going to stage events.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:07.800]  They're going to finance events.
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.800]  They're going to do whatever they can to, again,
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:13.800]  get us tattling on each other 9,000 tattletale screens
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:16.800]  saying, watch your neighbor, watch other shoppers.
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:18.800]  They don't want us getting together.
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:21.800]  And they're desperately trying to make us not trust each other
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.800]  and to hate each other and kind of re-energize this whole left-right paradigm.
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:28.800]  And they force you to get into the left-right paradigm
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:31.800]  because when they attack the First Amendment
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:33.800]  and then make it about Republicans,
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:35.800]  it makes you come in and defend
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.800]  because you're having to defend everybody's rights.
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:41.800]  And back when I would defend Democrats' rights to speak under Bush,
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:43.800]  I was called a liberal.
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:45.800]  Now that I defend conservatives' rights,
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.800]  I'm called a right-winger.
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:50.800]  No, I'm a constitutionalist and my job's easy.
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:53.800]  All I got to do is go with common sense and the Bill of Rights.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:56.800]  But Law, you say you're seeing a big awakening.
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:58.800]  Definitely. I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:00.800]  We've been doing this for several years
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:02.800]  and it used to be when we got started,
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:05.800]  nobody would talk to us. No one would come up.
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:08.800]  And we're always passing out information and DVDs
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:11.800]  and now people are actually seeking us out
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:13.800]  and they're asking, you know, what do you got?
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:15.800]  What kind of guy? What videos you got, you know?
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:18.800]  And so we load them up, we give them the information,
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:20.800]  and when we tell them, you know, be positive.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:22.800]  Don't let this fear get you down.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:24.800]  I mean, this is how they control us.
[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:27.800]  Well, let's go back two and a half years ago in October
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.800]  when we were at the DNC event in Denver
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:33.800]  and other people were attacking us.
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:36.800]  They worked for MSNBC when they had an outside event going on.
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:38.800]  Here are our views.
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:42.800]  Back then, you know, he had a million viewers on his show.
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.800]  Now it's less than half that.
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.800]  It just shows how the blood is running out of these people.
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:50.800]  They are losing their support.
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:52.800]  People are seeing through them.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:55.800]  Definitely. There is no doubt about it.
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:58.800]  I mean, it is tangible. You can definitely see it.
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.800]  And I think one of the things that we do
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:02.800]  is we inspire so many people.
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.800]  I mean, we are changing the work that we do,
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.800]  you know, inspires people, the videos that we have up,
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:10.800]  inspire people, and that's really why we do it.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:12.800]  In fact, I would like to tell people
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.800]  to go out to WACC TV on YouTube
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.800]  and check out some of these videos
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:19.800]  because, like I said, this year was a banner year.
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:21.800]  We went to Colorado Springs on the 9th anniversary
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:23.800]  to yell at Alley North a little bit.
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:25.800]  Two of our guys got arrested,
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:27.800]  and it was just quite a crazy scene.
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:29.800]  And then two weeks later,
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:32.800]  we snuck into the hive while Newt Gingrich was in town
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:37.800]  with 2,500 neocon military industrial complexors,
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:39.800]  and we disrupted that whole event,
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:41.800]  and it was just fantastic.
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:43.800]  And out of this interesting thing, we have...
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:44.800]  Stay there and finish up.
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:45.800]  Law on the other side.
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:48.800]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and more news.
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:54.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:30:03.800]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:06.800]  we will witness the most important day in America
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:08.800]  in more than 50 years.
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.800]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:13.800]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:16.800]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:19.800]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:21.800]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:25.800]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:27.800]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:31.800]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:34.800]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:36.800]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:38.800]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:39.800]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.800]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.800]  He explains everything you need to know,
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:46.800]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:51.800]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.800]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:57.800]  Watch the free video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:20.800]  That's End of America, 3.com.
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:29.800]  Thank you very much for watching this video.
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:01.800]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:03.800]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:04.800]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:07.800]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:08.800]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:13.800]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:14.800]  It's true.
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.800]  Total government control of electricity
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:19.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:20.800]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:23.800]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:27.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:28.800]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:31.800]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:35.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:36.800]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:40.800]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:43.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.800]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:49.800]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com.
[02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.800]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:55.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com
[02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:59.800]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:05.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:12.800]  Okay, I said I'd get to your calls when we've only been talking to one guy the last five minutes.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:15.800]  I want to get to Patrick, Jeremy, Heather, Bob, and many others.
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:19.800]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:22.800]  I've got a lot of other news. I want to cram in here as well.
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.800]  We had Gerald Salente, obviously, on last hour, getting into the economy.
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:32.800]  Now CNBC admits, okay, housing market is flipping into depression territory.
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:36.800]  Well, according to all old-fashioned yardsticks, we're in a depression.
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.800]  And people say, well, be positive.
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:41.800]  Say we're not, and that'll bring confidence.
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:47.800]  When you've been deindustrialized, when 1.5-quadrillion in fake derivatives have been created
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:56.800]  by bipartisan criminals in both parties, and accelerated under Clinton, then Bush, now Obama,
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:02.800]  when you've got all this going on, nothing's going to get better until you reverse those policies.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:10.800]  Not more of the same with now the daily JPMorgan Chase mob boss running the whole White House.
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.800]  But law-finishing up, people should join We Are Changed chapters all over the country.
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:22.800]  They're anti-terror, pro-liberty, nonpartisan, exposing the fake global warming, 9-11 inside job, you name it.
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:26.800]  You guys are out there finishing up with the point you were making.
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.800]  The point I wanted to make is our two guys got arrested.
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:35.800]  We've been fighting this court case now for three months, and we went in there to a maritime admiralty court.
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.800]  We defended ourselves, and we actually beat them.
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:42.800]  And it was just an incredible feeling, and you can represent yourself.
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.800]  You can stand up against these guys, and you can win.
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:49.800]  And it was just inspiring and an amazing thing to see.
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:52.800]  My guys crossed, examined the officers, worked the DA.
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:54.800]  It was just incredible stuff.
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.800]  And like I was saying, the work we do is to inspire people.
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:01.800]  It's really to inspire them to get that spirit in their heart.
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.800]  Get them out there on the streets, join a We Are Changed chapter.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:06.800]  I mean, we are making a huge difference.
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:09.800]  This is historical stuff that we are involved in here, Alex.
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.800]  Law, I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you again.
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:14.800]  It is historical what's happening.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:22.800]  And there are certain times in history when the future destiny is really being set.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:29.800]  Of course, Lenin talked about there are times when war happens in a month and happened in the last 100 years.
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:34.800]  And the political scientists talk about how normally society is frozen.
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:39.800]  But then certain societal or cultural geopolitical events come together,
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:45.800]  and that triggers what they call a unfreezing or a liquefaction of the political system.
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:50.800]  And it's during those periods that realignments happen, political shifts.
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:56.800]  And the system was trying to go into a liquefied phase to openly announce the world government,
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:58.800]  the global carbon taxes, the VAT.
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.800]  And they are successful to a certain extent, taken over Ireland, taken over Greece,
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:07.800]  now taken over Portugal, then England, Germany, France, the U.S.
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:09.800]  But it's all being called.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:14.800]  So just because they are engaging in financial terrorism and financial warfare
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:19.800]  and consolidating power and scorched earth policy, the people are waking up in the process.
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:22.800]  And so that's the beginning of the end of this.
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:24.800]  We know what these big central banks do.
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:29.800]  They just rape and rob and pillage and destroy economies over and over again.
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:31.800]  There's never enough for them.
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:34.800]  They will suck your country dry.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:35.800]  They will not quit.
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:39.800]  They want you to be bankrupt and poor so that you can't resist them.
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:40.800]  That's their policy.
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:43.800]  They want a post-industrial world.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.800]  And they think they're going to sell Westerners on giving up our way of life,
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.800]  giving up our basic freedoms, giving up our industries,
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:55.800]  not because of the depression they've engineered, but for the earth.
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:59.800]  Notice that's all being rolled out at the same time of how chic it is to be poor,
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:07.800]  how chic it is to have austerity, all the trendy grocery stores and stuff here in Austin.
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:09.800]  And you see chic.
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:10.800]  It's chic to be poor.
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:12.800]  It's chic to have nothing.
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:15.800]  It's chic to pay lots of taxes.
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:17.800]  They're training you to love your enslavement.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:20.800]  Patrick in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:21.800]  Hello, Alex. Can you hear me?
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:22.800]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:23.800]  All right. Excellent.
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:28.800]  Your call operator said my phone's gotten out, so I'm hoping you can hear me.
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:29.800]  All right.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:30.800]  I have a couple of questions here.
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:32.800]  I'm going to be real quick.
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:37.800]  First one, what do you think about Jared, the Arizona shooters,
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:40.800]  YouTube videos being all in text?
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.800]  If I'm to understand correctly, they are all in text, correct?
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:45.800]  Yes, that could be a setup.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:47.800]  He could be being framed.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:50.800]  Yeah, because I thought that's what jumped out at me,
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:53.800]  and a lot of your posters on your website, we were talking.
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.800]  Yeah, we just have a wide spectrum of neighbors, witnesses and others.
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.800]  And unless they're all government, all putting out a disinfo story,
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:03.800]  which has happened before on 9-11,
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.800]  they had all these suspicious guys with scripts on different news channels
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:11.800]  on the street posing as citizens that we have identified was fake.
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.800]  But on this case, we don't know.
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:17.800]  But go ahead.
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:21.800]  The other point I was going to make about that was it seems like,
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:25.800]  because if it was, it is fake in some way, those text YouTube videos,
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:28.800]  it would really blow the lid off this whole thing in the sense that,
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:31.800]  because it almost seems like in there, when he talks about mind control
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.800]  or being a fan of mind control, with mind control mentioning in those text videos,
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:40.800]  it's almost like then when one of us, Patriots, tries to expose what is going on
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.800]  and mention mind control, it's almost been conveniently placed in those text videos
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.800]  as like a psychological trigger to, since we're talking about mind control,
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:53.800]  it equates it for people who don't understand what's going on.
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.800]  Absolutely, and I've made that point, and I'm glad that you made it here.
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:59.800]  You know, that's the problem.
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:04.800]  When you have declassified admissions of secret government mind control programs,
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:09.800]  where they put people on so many hallucinogens and give them shock therapy and other things
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:14.800]  that they enter a new reality, then they could implant a psychological compulsion
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:18.800]  to not rest until they've killed their targets.
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:20.800]  And that's what he told friends.
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:23.800]  He said, I cannot rest, I must do this.
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.800]  And it fits the MO of mind control, but being depressed, being ostracized,
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:34.800]  being rejected by women, taking hallucinogens on an almost daily basis,
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:37.800]  that can artificially whack you out.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:39.800]  I mean, there's plenty of people.
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:45.800]  I can't tell you how many cops I know, ambulance drivers, paramedics I know,
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:52.800]  who've driven up on a house with teenagers or people on PCP or other hallucinogens.
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:55.800]  And I mean, they're just out of their minds.
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:02.800]  And so, generally, I go with what the most probable scenario is.
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.800]  And now we know why the cops have tried to, especially the political sheriff,
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:10.800]  keep all these details secret, because they knew day one when they went to his house.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.800]  They knew day one when they got all his materials,
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.800]  that he was obsessed and in love with her, and that he was completely whacked out on drugs.
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:19.800]  And that's not good for them.
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:23.800]  You know, they want to say, freedom did this, America did this.
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:25.800]  So let's get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.800]  Let's get rid of the Second Amendment, because this guy was whacked out of his gourd.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:31.800]  But really good points, Patrick.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.800]  Let's talk to Jeremy in California.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:35.800]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:37.800]  Hey, Alex. Good morning. Can you hear me?
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:38.800]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:42.800]  Hey, I would like to say thank you for the wonderful job you're doing.
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.800]  I also go under to do entertainment myself.
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:47.800]  I feel, Alex, maybe...
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:50.800]  Well, to be clear, I want to be clear. I'm not an entertainment.
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:54.800]  Like Rush Limbaugh says, he's an entertainer, and Glenn Beck says that.
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:57.800]  I eat, drink, and sleep this stuff.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:00.800]  I get up here and get wound up on Aaron and pretty confident.
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:03.800]  Last night, I was kind of freaking out.
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:06.800]  I got home, took a shower, ate dinner, was reading to the kids,
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.800]  and it was just dawning on me how crazy this world really is.
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:13.800]  So with me, it's not entertainment. Go ahead, Jeremy.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.800]  Right, Alex. If you could hear me out just one second.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.800]  The entertainment and that you are feeding into right now,
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.800]  I understand you're emotional on this topic that's been brought up to view on all of us.
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:27.800]  It is a tragedy, the loss of this nine-year-old.
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:31.800]  I, myself, am a father of three here in Northern California.
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:33.800]  I am just calling to let you know...
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:36.800]  Sorry I get choked up talking about my children.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:38.800]  I'm like you, I'm very passionate too.
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:42.800]  But the more we feed into the propaganda that they're feeding
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:45.800]  by bringing your name into the picture, you're getting off.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:48.800]  What's going on right now with the birds?
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:51.800]  What's going on right now with the fish? Harp. Let's look at harp.
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:54.800]  I had an earthquake here in Northern California.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:57.800]  No, you're right. There are floods worldwide.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.800]  It is snowing in Hawaii.
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:02.800]  I've got the article right here. They admit they have weather weapons.
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:05.800]  We know there's giant chemtrailing programs.
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:08.800]  They have declassified a lot of it, and you're right.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.800]  Instead of talking about all this crazy weather stuff that's accelerating,
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:16.800]  we're talking about the shooting and killing of six people, which is terrible.
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:20.800]  But in the scheme of things, seven billion people almost worldwide,
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:23.800]  why do we still let the mainstream media set the agenda?
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:28.800]  They don't have a lot of viewers anymore, but they're still able to set some of the agenda.
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:32.800]  Alex, if I may have just five minutes of your time without you budding in,
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.800]  let me present what I have.
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:40.800]  Okay, on the 8th in Northern California, we had Dead Birds Drop here in Guizerville, California.
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:44.800]  Northern California, Guizerville is an active volcano.
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:49.800]  Harp, I've done my research. You could go on Harp's website, look up the history.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:51.800]  You could look at the bandwidths.
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:56.800]  On that night, on the Saturday, we did have a peak come down from our northern crest
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.800]  to Harp down through California.
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:02.800]  So, these are the things we have to look at, Alex.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:05.800]  I had an earthquake here last night also, right?
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:09.800]  Harp was activated again last night, same time we're having the earthquake.
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:12.800]  Everywhere these birds are dropping.
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:14.800]  I have papers from FEMA.
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:21.800]  We got contacted from FEMA because we have the plan for NLE 2001.
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:27.800]  Okay, if you'd like to go and look at yourself, I've been trying to call you with all this information.
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:32.800]  FEMA contacted my friend asking where we got these confidential papers.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:38.800]  The guy's thing is Patriot Space, Patriot Space on YouTube.
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:43.800]  His informant is Ginny, who works for Harp, or not for Harp, excuse me,
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:49.800]  for FEMA and other nuclear emergency centers to draw these plans up.
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:57.800]  Well, it states here NEL 2001, Harp, Activities and Drills are scheduled by the White House,
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:04.800]  directed concussionally mandated exercise that includes participants of all appropriate field departments.
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:09.800]  Basically, Alex and May, they're planning to do the same exercise as they did in Haiti,
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.800]  along the New Madrid fault line.
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:18.800]  But, if we had the master plan of 9-11 and we knew it, do you think they would do it?
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:23.800]  No. So, maybe they're going to ship keys from the New Madrid fault line and say,
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:28.800]  hey, no, California, you're not safe. Maybe we're going to come take you out.
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:33.800]  But, what I'm saying, Alex, there's a huge picture and you're getting blown over by the smoke,
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.800]  so you are entertaining right now. You're not doing the job of reporting.
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:42.800]  Well, I'm evil and I'm bad, Jeremy, and I appreciate you instructing me. Thank you.
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:48.800]  We have covered Harp. We have had Dr. Nick Baggachan, and when we covered the birds extensively
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:52.800]  in Harp and Tesla-type technologies, we were criticized for that.
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:58.800]  And, I mean, it is my radio show. And so, if you take offense that you're saying,
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:02.800]  you know, while you're entertaining, and I say, look, I just want to be clear,
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:07.800]  I don't see my show as entertainment, okay? I don't see it as entertainment.
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.800]  Sometimes I do entertaining things because when you're on the air three, four hours a day,
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:14.800]  sometimes I'm not in as focused a mode.
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:23.800]  But, look, I just suggest, I try to be a platform for other people, organizations, groups.
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.800]  I try my best, but let's just say I'm trash. I'm scum. I'm filth. I'm worthless.
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:30.800]  I'm no good. I apologize for everything I've done.
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.800]  Now, let's move on from there. There are weather weapons.
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:38.800]  There are things going on out there.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:42.800]  I know about national level exercises. FEMA, a lot of times, puts out public things.
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:44.800]  I'll check into what you're saying.
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:48.800]  Why don't you send it over to showtipsandinfowars.com?
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:50.800]  You may have tried to get it to me a couple of times.
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:54.800]  We just get a lot of spam and stuff, so good stuff gets lost in the mix.
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:57.800]  Okay, now, let's move on to the next person.
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:01.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to Heather in Indiana.
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:03.800]  Heather, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.800]  Hi, Alex. I was listening to your live caller while I was on Holden.
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:10.800]  God, people are just crazy, and I want to applaud you.
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:13.800]  No, I'm bad. No, ma'am, I'm bad. I'm bad. Go ahead.
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:16.800]  No, my gosh, but you're excellent. We have all your videos.
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:21.800]  We give them to people, and you have done a fabulous job in waking up so many people
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:23.800]  who have had their eyes shut for so long.
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:27.800]  But I'm calling to ask you a question because I listened to a show previously,
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:30.800]  not too far in the past, about a woman who had called in.
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:35.800]  She was very emotional and crying that they were doing spraying of some type of pesticide,
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:38.800]  aerial spraying, and it was harming her daughter.
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:41.800]  And she was asking for help and things like that.
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:47.800]  And I've been listening to the whole show and about taking a right and your amendments
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:51.800]  and sticking up for yourself, and I'm about to do the same thing in my own town.
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:57.800]  But I was kind of just wondering, instead of going through the approach of an aerial pesticide,
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:00.800]  harming you and harming the animals or harming the crops,
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:04.800]  because I really just don't think they care, you know, petition or no petition,
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:09.800]  is it a good thing to go against them if you have endangered species
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:13.800]  that supposedly chemical maybe couldn't come in contact with?
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:16.800]  Well, here's the problem. You can use their baloney loopholes,
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:22.800]  but a lot of times if it's not them using the loophole, then they'll kind of ignore you.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:26.800]  I mean, you know, the biggest issue is they do spray a lot of experimental things
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:28.800]  to take out different insects and moths,
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.800]  and a lot of times it's really just a kickback to their buddies, you know,
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:35.800]  for the state or county to make purchases of those chemicals,
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:39.800]  and you just got to do a four-year of what type of chemical they're spraying,
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:42.800]  and a lot of times they're not authorized to be doing what they're doing,
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:46.800]  and as soon as you then fax that out to all the newspapers,
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.800]  it's going to end up being in the newspaper,
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.800]  and that program is going to get shut down very, very quickly.
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:54.800]  Anything else?
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:56.800]  No, I just wanted your opinion on that.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:59.800]  We listened to you all the time and listening to previous callers.
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:02.800]  We just wanted your opinion just on how to do the right thing
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:05.800]  and possibly not get shut down right away.
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:07.800]  Sure. Well, I mean, every case is different.
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:09.800]  Every geographic area is different.
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:11.800]  Every, you know, the specifics of it, I don't know,
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:15.800]  but just get your fax pretty much straight and then take action and stand up for yourself.
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  And even if you're not fighting the most important issue,
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.800]  or even if you're not 100% right, getting involved in your government is the answer.
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:23.800]  God bless you.
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:26.800]  And going back to Jeremy, you know, that happens sometimes when I'm taking calls.
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:29.800]  People think, you know, they're going to go for 10 minutes
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:32.800]  and when I'm time to get to other people, and then I do shut up so they can run on,
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:34.800]  and at the end there's the diss that I'm bad,
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  and then I tend to get a little sarcastic about that.
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  Look, we don't need to fight with each other.
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:44.800]  We need to deal with the dollar devaluation.
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:47.800]  We need to deal with the loss of liberty that's happening.
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:51.800]  And, you know, I tried to even nicely agree with Jeremy and say,
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:55.800]  yeah, there is a lot of crazy weather going on,
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:57.800]  but a lot of that is dealing with the moon and sun cycles.
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:59.800]  We've had top meteorologists on with that.
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:01.800]  Yes, there are weather weapons.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:03.800]  Yes, there's chemtrail programs going on.
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.800]  Yes, I've done countless shows about that.
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:08.800]  It's not my fault this is going on.
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  I'm not the bad man.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:12.800]  I know I'm the person that'll take the call.
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:13.800]  Government won't.
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:14.800]  You can talk to me.
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:18.800]  And so if I need to be the bad man, I can be that for you.
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:22.800]  But on a larger issue, just so you understand,
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.800]  I agreed with you that it's a distraction at a certain level
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.800]  to spend a bunch of time talking about the shooting and Tucson
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:33.800]  because there's other bigger things going on.
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:37.800]  But you can't please everybody with what you cover or what you go over.
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:40.800]  And you have to understand, yes, they're overblowing it as bad as it is
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:42.800]  because they personalize it.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:44.800]  They show you who these people are.
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:47.800]  They, they, they humanize it.
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:51.800]  But when they're killing a million plus Iraqis, they don't humanize it.
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:52.800]  Okay.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:54.800]  They don't put a human face on it.
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:50:00.800]  But they're using this to try to pass legislation against the First Amendment
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:04.800]  to take over talk radio and media and the Internet
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:06.800]  and to restrict the Second Amendment.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:09.800]  Now, it doesn't get any bigger than that, Bubba.
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:13.800]  That's your capacity to have a radio show or call into one.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:17.800]  So, yes, in and of itself, it's an overblown diversion,
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.800]  but we have to fight them in the media war and fight their lies.
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:25.800]  And whereas 20 years ago or even 10, we'd lose almost every battle,
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:28.800]  now we're winning almost every battle.
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:31.800]  Three, four days into this, now it's common knowledge
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:35.800]  that he was basically in love with her, obsessed with her and on drugs.
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:37.800]  And it wasn't liberals fault.
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:39.800]  It wasn't conservatives fault.
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:43.800]  So they can't demonize collectively and take all of our liberties.
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:46.800]  So this is a big issue.
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:50.800]  Trying to take our First Amendment, trying to take our Second Amendment,
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:53.800]  they're getting on the news saying, I'm guilty.
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:56.800]  They're saying, I'm behind this little girl's death.
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:59.800]  That's a big deal, buddy. You understand that?
[02:50:59.800 --> 02:51:02.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:06.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:09.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:11.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:14.800]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:18.800]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:20.800]  and they really are calling the shots.
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:25.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:28.800]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:33.800]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:35.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:37.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:39.800]  They're asking for more matches.
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:42.800]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:44.800]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:49.800]  And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:23.800]  I got a lot of folks in my crew now and I've gone around everybody and said, have you ever taken this salvia stuff?
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:28.800]  And I found one person that has and they said, you black out for about 20 minutes.
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:36.800]  And that's what the encyclopedia says of drugs online is that you literally, quote, disassociate.
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:39.800]  I mean, that sounds like mind control 101.
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:43.800]  And this guy was reportedly doing it, quote, almost every day.
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:49.800]  This is what his friends and neighbors said in Rush Limbaugh's To Blame.
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:55.800]  I guess Rush Limbaugh is into Oxy Cotton, but I mean, different strokes for different folks.
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.800]  Man, I would be scared to take something that makes you completely not know who you are.
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:04.800]  I mean, I've heard of hallucinogens that make you see funny stuff and things and I'm scared of that.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.800]  Can you imagine taking something where you don't even know who you are?
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:14.800]  What are you saying at last? Because that's what I read, 20, 30 minutes.
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:16.800]  And you don't know who you are.
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:18.800]  We're not going to say what crew members taking it.
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:22.800]  How many years ago was this?
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:23.800]  Two years ago.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:24.800]  Just at parties now.
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:25.800]  It's just everywhere.
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:27.800]  That's what Eric Mankow-Muller was saying earlier.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:33.800]  He says he just goes to mainline parties and this is, in fact, I've read about this in the paper before.
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:35.800]  I didn't really know what it was because I don't pay attention to drug culture.
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:40.800]  This is sold at, like, tobacco stores, head shops.
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:43.800]  Yeah, where you buy, like, weedhead pipes.
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:47.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, arrest all these people immediately.
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:48.800]  I know.
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:56.800]  I mean, I'm joking around about that, but why do I get blamed for some guy, a liberal smoking, basically, natural PCP?
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:59.800]  Why am I being blamed for this?
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:06.800]  Bill Clinton's back on the news going, I don't care what people say, this was politically motivated, I believe.
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:08.800]  And I did not have sex with that woman, by the way.
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:10.800]  And getting rid of Glass-Steagall's going to be great.
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:12.800]  Ask my commerce secretary.
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:14.800]  Oh, he got shot in the head.
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:17.800]  Then I appointed this guy who's now running the White House daily.
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:19.800]  He comes from a good family.
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.800]  They work with El Capone.
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:24.800]  Your speech is dangerous.
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:26.800]  Shut up.
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:30.800]  Call these headlines. Speech is dangerous. Restrict speech.
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:34.800]  Who's up next here, John?
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:37.800]  Should I go into overdrive or should I not to get to all these calls?
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:38.800]  I am a bad person.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:40.800]  Bob in California.
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:42.800]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:44.800]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:46.800]  There was two points I'd like to make.
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:55.800]  I don't recall the details because the event occurred in the 30s, but President Roosevelt and a mayor of, I believe, Miami were on the platform together.
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:59.800]  And a nutcase shot and killed the mayor.
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:01.800]  Well, that's Rush Limbaugh's fault.
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:04.800]  Well, anyhow, I don't know about that, but let me finish my story.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:12.800]  So anyhow, they arrested the guy immediately, indicted him quickly, tried him promptly, and executed him within 30 days.
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:13.800]  There was no screwing around.
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:16.800]  He was obviously the victim of the culprit.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:18.800]  There was no doubt about who did what.
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.800]  Just as in this case, there's no doubt about who did what.
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:27.800]  And to drag this out for months and months and months at the expense of the taxpayers is ridiculous.
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:30.800]  So that's a precedent that was set in the 30s.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:38.800]  Then the other item I'd like to bring to your attention is this great talk about joblessness and they're going to create jobs and all this foolishness.
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:43.800]  There's only one way to create jobs and that's to eliminate the minimum wage law.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:51.800]  There's a lot of people that would work happily for, say, $7 an hour and there's a lot of employers that would hire them for $7 an hour.
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:57.800]  But both of them would be termed criminals by these people who are on the gravy train with government paychecks.
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:00.800]  Well, you know, you know, it sounds like you've been an employer.
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:05.800]  When somebody's getting $7 an hour or whatever the minimum wage is now, I forget what is it now.
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:10.800]  But you've got to do their social security matching, their FICA and all that.
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:14.800]  So somebody getting $7 an hour is really getting more like $11 or $12.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:16.800]  Somebody getting $15 is getting like $21.
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:18.800]  Somebody getting $20 is getting like $30.
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:20.800]  I mean, that's the big secret here.
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:32.800]  The issue I'm trying to make is your response to advocate of freedom when a man who's adult and in his own senses is willing to work for $7 an hour and an employer is willing to hire him
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:37.800]  and the two of them agree to agree and then to have some third party who has the legal power.
[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:40.800]  Stay there. We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:46.800]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:49.800]  We are the GCN radio network.

[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:51.800]  Thank you.
[02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:54.800]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.800 --> 02:59:58.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:03.800]  Network.
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:30.800]  That's a really good point.
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:34.800]  We've had people killing presidents, killing members of Congress.
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:36.800]  It's always happened.
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:38.800]  And it's going to continue to happen.
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:41.800]  Why should we give up our liberties today?
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:47.800]  Because somebody smoking organic PCP and is in love with the Congresswoman.
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:48.800]  That's not my fault.
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:51.800]  But you were finishing up your point briefly, Bob, about the minimum wage.
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:54.800]  Yes, in a free country, we should be able to pay people whatever we want.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:57.800]  And they should be free to take that job or not.
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:01.800]  The big dirty secret is the illegals will take the lower,
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:03.800]  and that's why people hire the illegals.
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:05.800]  It's all been set up that way, Bob.
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:07.800]  Well, I don't know that background.
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:11.800]  I know the greatest freedom ever was to be able to do what you want
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:15.800]  or whatever you want as long as it wasn't criminal.
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:17.800]  And this is ridiculous here.
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:21.800]  In fact, I think it was the state of Washington and two or three other states
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:26.800]  just raised the minimum wage, which cuts down employment as it goes.
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:31.800]  What we need to do is to return to the open free market and let people see
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:32.800]  what they want to do.
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:34.800]  I agree, and I appreciate your call.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:39.800]  Instead, all they're doing is blaming the unfree market for our downfall
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:41.800]  and saying capitalism did this.
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:44.800]  Folks, this isn't free market, but we're seeing it happen right now.
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:47.800]  A bunch of insider bankers looting everything and writing laws
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:49.800]  to shut down their competition.
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:51.800]  Brian and Iowa, Brian, you're on the air.
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:53.800]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? What's up?
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:55.800]  Good. Worldwide broadcast.
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:57.800]  Yeah, I have a question for you.
[03:01:57.800 --> 03:01:58.800]  Yes.
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.800]  Recently, former politician Tom DeLay was found guilty.
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:05.800]  Three years in prison, yeah.
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:06.800]  Yeah.
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:14.800]  My question is, by the way, he was also let out during the appeal process,
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:15.800]  which is kind of odd.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:20.800]  And my question is, why is it that there's selective law enforcement in this country?
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:26.800]  Well, Austin is, again, very communistic because the citizens don't get involved.
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:29.800]  It's actually very libertarian and free and great people,
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:33.800]  but a hardcore group of crooks calling themselves communists run the city.
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:35.800]  They steal property.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:36.800]  But they pose as liberal.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:38.800]  They make us pay for abortions.
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:40.800]  I have to pay for people's abortions.
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:42.800]  That's why I've moved out of Austin.
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:44.800]  They still get taxes off this office, though.
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:46.800]  It really frustrates me.
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:50.800]  And they are constantly on political witch hunts.
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:53.800]  I'm no fan of Tom DeLay, but I've followed the case.
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:55.800]  And he did what both parties do.
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  I mean, you know, they swap federal for state money.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:01.800]  And that's how the whole thing works.
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:05.800]  And it's a political witch hunt by Ronnie Earl, the former district attorney here.
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:07.800]  So, yeah, that's the bottom line.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.800]  Yeah, I just think it's kind of odd how the judicial system is doing quickly,
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:17.800]  you know, quick action for the Arizona shooter and no, I don't condone any of that violence,
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:19.800]  but they're right on it with him.
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:24.800]  But then they have selective enforcement across the board with George Bush and his war crimes.
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:27.800]  I didn't see not one lawyer file any charges on him.
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:31.800]  So I just find that very unfair and just really not.
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:34.800]  Well, I mean, you know why nobody files against George W. Bush.
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:35.800]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:41.800]  When you're at that high level of government, you know all the secrets and the dirt on everybody.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.800]  You think WikiLeaks is threatening people with the stuff they've got to back off or they'll release stuff on Rupert Murdoch
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:49.800]  and the Chinese and the Israelis and everybody else.
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:53.800]  Can you imagine what a George Bush knows or a Bill Clinton?
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:55.800]  That's why they're seen as untouchable.
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:59.800]  That's why Clinton leaves office, George W. Bush protects him.
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  And then George W. Bush leaves office and Obama protects him.
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:04.800]  They're going to protect each other.
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:06.800]  In fact, I meant to get to that today.
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:10.800]  I mean, have you seen all the news articles about all these top lobbyists?
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:17.800]  The very day of the energy company mergers burning up in their cars, top Bush aides, you know,
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:21.800]  that had up Fortune 500 companies running around with their, you know,
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:27.800]  disheveled and being found dead in trash piles, killed professionally, bombs at the neighbor's house,
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:35.800]  top political operatives in Arizona being killed separately here.
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:40.800]  Ex-Arizona top Senate aide found shot to death.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  Lobbyist Ashley Turton found dead in home in D.C.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:49.800]  I mean, it's, come on, they're killing people left and right.
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:51.800]  There's big moves going on right now.
[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:54.800]  Big moves, big mafia moves going on right now.
