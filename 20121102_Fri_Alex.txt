[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:36.800]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is the second day of November 2012
[00:36.800 --> 00:44.000]  we're less than five days out now from the big election coming up next Tuesday
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.680]  and it is quite a spectacle even if you know by and large it is theater though
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.480]  it is true that Barack Obama wants to make churches pay for insurance that
[00:54.480 --> 00:58.880]  covers abortion whatever happened to separation of church and state I'm gonna
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.840]  break down what separation of church and state is a little bit here today the
[01:02.840 --> 01:06.360]  federal government's trying to threaten Catholic churches saying hey you don't
[01:06.360 --> 01:13.640]  criticize abortion now and you gonna pay for it I mean they have no jurisdiction
[01:13.640 --> 01:19.160]  but they've tricked churches into this I'm gonna expose the giant hoax that is
[01:19.160 --> 01:23.480]  separation of church and state separation church and state is real but
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.200]  the definition that they have publicly sold is a complete fraud so I will be
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.480]  getting to that look talk about a delayed reaction it's kind of like force
[01:32.480 --> 01:37.040]  10 from Navarone where they detonate the dam it doesn't collapse right away it
[01:37.040 --> 01:44.320]  takes a few minutes well Shandy's worse than I thought it was gonna be I thought
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.720]  it was mainly hype and they still did over hype it as the basically this you
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.360]  know the storm of all-time you know Satan incarnate ravaging the east coast
[01:51.360 --> 01:56.880]  but I was talking to David Ortiz just earlier he was talking to friends and
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.800]  family on the east coast and it you know they say it's scary and so we're gonna
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.720]  get maybe get David in here later to you know give us reports of friends and
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.080]  family he's got on the east coast and we also have Dan Badandi out on the east
[02:11.080 --> 02:15.400]  coast and Rhode Island who went back for a week to visit family one of our
[02:15.400 --> 02:19.080]  reporters so perhaps we'll get him to pop in Joel Scalzen is gonna be with us
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.080]  for an hour and a half to give us his research into what really happened in
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.080]  the Benghazi raid he thinks he's got the intel on what what that whole soap
[02:28.080 --> 02:31.320]  operas about we've heard a lot of our conflicting ideas from dr. Steve
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.840]  Pachennick Webster Tarpley many others and I'm not saying their their ideas
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.760]  couldn't be plausible I'm just I don't think we have total proof of exactly
[02:40.760 --> 02:45.240]  what's happened yet but it is important he'll be joining us on that then other
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.680]  geopolitical issues and basic preparedness he was actually on the
[02:49.680 --> 02:58.280]  east coast during the hurricane Joel Scalzen was so so that is that is coming
[02:58.280 --> 03:06.480]  up we are also going to get to X Penn State President charged with perjury in
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.360]  Sandusky case this actually happened while I was on the area stay but I've
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.120]  never got to it but it dovetails a lot of important issues so we're gonna be
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.920]  breaking that down and I saw a story out of Colorado now Kurt Nemo's actually
[03:17.920 --> 03:26.080]  written article about it cops evict homeowner in Colorado and they were in
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.400]  military uniforms and armored vehicles and tanks when they came and it just
[03:30.400 --> 03:35.440]  shows that the difference between police and military is military is is there to
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.280]  go after a enemy and and kill people and break things and the police is
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.120]  supposed to be guardians of the peace and now police will tell you their
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.000]  paramilitary and the more and more the population they're gonna fight are gonna
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.040]  be you as the system raises taxes and regulations to the point of where it's
[03:53.040 --> 03:57.160]  impossible to keep your farm your home any of it and and the police all over
[03:57.160 --> 04:02.400]  the country even show up when the house is fraudulently being taken and courts
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.160]  rule hey the banks can just take houses that aren't theirs there's been a few
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.600]  cases one in Florida famously a few years ago or I think the headline was
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.200]  cops foreclose on Bank of America we ought to pull that video up I think it's
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.800]  still on YouTube guys I'm gonna play that again cops foreclose on on on Bank of
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.720]  America because they took like a million to paid for a decade before in cash it
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.280]  was never a mortgage to any bank or Bank of America was paid in cash and they
[04:29.280 --> 04:32.360]  just came and took it and a year later Bank of America wouldn't give them the
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.360]  house back and wouldn't give them the money so finally a judge said go take
[04:36.360 --> 04:42.640]  the money out of the bank and they sent the marshals over but but the point is
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.440]  is they didn't send guys in military uniforms over so we're gonna be looking
[04:46.440 --> 04:51.520]  at that we're gonna be looking just at the police state on steroids as well
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.600]  today it is all coming up we'll be right back stay with us

[06:12.920 --> 06:16.200]  seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy
[06:16.200 --> 06:19.800]  bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[06:19.800 --> 06:22.560]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[06:22.560 --> 06:25.720]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across

[06:30.040 --> 06:34.560]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[06:34.560 --> 06:37.880]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now
[06:37.880 --> 06:41.120]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and

[09:35.400 --> 09:38.800]  where the looting is increasing we're talking about gas won't be there in
[09:38.800 --> 09:42.840]  many areas another week the power off for another two weeks how are they going
[09:42.840 --> 09:48.280]  to have the election in four days it's Friday Saturday Sunday Monday four days
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.160]  Tuesday how are they going to have the election when large areas of these
[09:53.160 --> 09:56.800]  coasts they're talking about four to six million people still without power and
[09:56.800 --> 10:02.920]  probably without power next week I want to hear from you with your eyewitness
[10:02.920 --> 10:08.400]  reports of what's happening in your area did you think the storm was hype or
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.960]  are we seeing it kind of as a delayed reaction because I had hoped that it
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.880]  wouldn't have been as bad as they were hyping Sandy is starved New Yorkers
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.720]  dumpster dive NBC we reported that yesterday it's intensifying unrest
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.480]  growing among New Jersey New York citizens dumpster diving for food
[10:28.480 --> 10:37.200]  fist fights over fuel tempers flare in Sandy aftermath and it is just a huge
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.800]  chronicle Fox News reporting on that this is a boiled-down article that's
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.480]  excellent by Mike Adams up at info wars.com reasoning from natural news.com
[10:45.480 --> 10:48.760]  we're going to be going over some of that but there's looting there's people
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.600]  getting mugged and beat up and massively increased numbers and the media is
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.240]  trying to play it down anarchy along the Jersey Shore and on Long Island in the
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.040]  aftermath of Hurricane Sandy Michael Schneider its economic collapse blog
[11:02.040 --> 11:09.000]  breaks it down 4.7 million homes and businesses do not have power diving
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.760]  into dumpsters they're saying the power could be off until November 11th that's
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.200]  just some of the information there. Here's CNBC why East Coast gas stations
[11:20.200 --> 11:27.040]  may not or why East Coast gas shortages may not end for a week and it goes over
[11:27.040 --> 11:31.440]  the fact that supply lines are having big problems. Frustration at the pump
[11:31.440 --> 11:37.120]  reaches danger levels with fights and things breaking out. New York, New Jersey
[11:37.120 --> 11:44.160]  gas shortages, mile-long lines, rationing fights, police, draw guns and quite a
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.880]  image of insanity that Breitbart has been able to collate together there.
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.320]  Staten Island borough president don't give money to the Red Cross yeah I've
[11:54.320 --> 12:01.400]  been saying that for a long time I've seen Red Cross United Way just do things
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.720]  that blow your mind more than half the money they just completely keep what
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.080]  they do do is spend on PR they have a lot of well many people that volunteer
[12:09.080 --> 12:14.840]  for them but that's just their front. I remember Oklahoma City after that bombing
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.800]  I think it was American Red Cross it was American Red Cross was what took over
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.280]  for the post office the checks and would take checks that were directly in the
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.280]  name of private individuals they saw in the news and deposited themselves guys
[12:29.280 --> 12:32.120]  world that daily wrote about that but it's sort of the local news we guys talked
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.400]  in because I want to correct it if I'm wrong going from deep memory here I'm
[12:35.400 --> 12:43.120]  like 15 16 years ago search engine American Red Cross kept Oklahoma City
[12:43.120 --> 12:47.240]  money to them or United Way the point is they all have been caught doing all
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.320]  just all sorts of terrible things and you know I've done my own research more
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.960]  than 90% of the money you give to things like salvation army actually goes to the
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.600]  ground to actually help people the Red Cross it is just basically a government
[13:03.600 --> 13:07.280]  globalist intelligence operation that they used to infiltrate countries they
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.480]  use CIA spies within it but we will go over that were you guys able to find
[13:12.480 --> 13:28.560]  that here let me see if I can find it Red Cross kept Oklahoma City bombing money
[13:28.560 --> 13:34.200]  it drives me crazy when something's really really old I can't find it the
[13:34.200 --> 13:40.320]  raw story investigation finds Red Cross agreed to withhold that's from 2005 it's
[13:40.320 --> 13:47.280]  so old it's it's hard to find we'll look into it again I'm not a hundred
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.680]  percent sure on that it's it's it's one of those two the point is is that you
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.240]  find it's the exact headline when it's like 15 years old I'll do it or in the
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.760]  break I obsess kind of obsessive compulsive sometimes over information
[13:59.760 --> 14:05.120]  continuing here New York City looters dressed like con Edison workers to gain
[14:05.120 --> 14:11.160]  access to houses and that's being reported by different East Coast papers
[14:11.160 --> 14:16.040]  Staten Island residents plead for help for Mayor Bloomberg y'all he'll just take
[14:16.040 --> 14:21.520]  your guns folks continuing 72 hours of the grid down starvation supply
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.880]  shortages food lines no clean water no gas transportation are at standstill
[14:25.880 --> 14:31.600]  yeah within three days people start fighting and rioting without adequate
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.600]  food and water within 10 days the Pentagon's done breakdowns in different
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.240]  countries watching this over 90% will start killing for food and water and
[14:41.240 --> 14:46.520]  within 15 days 90 plus percent depending on which study it's right over 90
[14:46.520 --> 14:53.600]  become cannibals within 15 days the nine out of ten plus people will start
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.760]  eating others now I mean it's not going to get to that point obviously but
[14:57.760 --> 15:03.600]  notice this is happening in areas where you have people that are disarmed in
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.120]  these big mega cities that are death traps during disasters I mean if there
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.160]  was ever a big earthquake in LA or New York a really big one I mean the system
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.680]  isn't going to be able to help you and they aren't going to they're going to
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.880]  come and take your guns because that is their goal they'll put you in the
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.840]  Superdome for six days sit on top of giant piles of food and water while you
[15:24.840 --> 15:28.680]  get raped inside they will come to your high and dry home in the hills you know
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.640]  above New Orleans and they will come noticing you have a generator and they
[15:33.640 --> 15:36.920]  will steal it they will take your guns and they will put you in jail and they
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.600]  will knock your teeth out of you if you talk back that's what happened we have
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.440]  and they put it on the news like it was a good thing the government is evil the
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.920]  government is evil are there some National Guard people that despite the
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.040]  corruption you know help some people yeah in some areas of the country are
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.320]  there good police forces that do help people yes but in a disaster the cops
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.720]  go home to take care of their families and I just could not imagine living in
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.320]  a place where they've disarmed the people like some of these mega cities
[16:08.320 --> 16:14.360]  we've got I just can't believe it so if they don't get the aid in and if this
[16:14.360 --> 16:20.720]  continues like what we saw in New Orleans but on a wider scale in the
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.640]  east coast it is going to be hellish I want to give the number out and talk
[16:24.640 --> 16:29.880]  specifically to people that are in the storm ravaged areas to give us your

[16:54.920 --> 17:00.920]  election night coverage during the day on the radio show and then nine
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.120]  well I guess from seven until past midnight we're going to broadcast so if
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.080]  you total it all up together yeah it's about nine hours of broadcast that we're
[17:11.080 --> 17:19.040]  planning on Tuesday three hours during the regular radio broadcast we may even
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.600]  go four hours so satellites transmit four hours of the show and then we're
[17:22.600 --> 17:26.760]  going to do about four or five hours at night so eight nine hours of
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.040]  transmission that we're going to have on the Tuesday of election day and then
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.280]  Wednesday November 7th in the aftermath if there is any civil unrest or
[17:37.280 --> 17:42.320]  anything or any false flags we're going to just be 24 seven covering and that's
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.200]  why I've got six reporters on top of the other three reporters and all the other
[17:46.200 --> 17:55.560]  writers and researchers here at info wars.com but again the toll free number
[17:55.560 --> 18:05.440]  to join us is 1-800-259-9231 and yes Rob do just corrected me I don't have
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.400]  teleprompters or notes in front of me I'm going to be on 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.480]  probably later on the radio and then we're going five to midnight or past
[18:13.480 --> 18:18.120]  that so I guess it's it's more than nine hours I'm just how many hours is that
[18:18.120 --> 18:22.200]  let me see five to midnight or later that's seven hours right there and at
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.320]  least three hours is ten hours so there you go tell all went to public school I
[18:27.320 --> 18:32.520]  can't even probably need just a sheet on that stuff I'm so flabbergasted by what's
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.040]  happening in the world economy and militarily and the federal government
[18:37.040 --> 18:42.240]  telling churches you will pay for abortions the the confirmed fact that

[19:08.440 --> 19:11.840]  explosives they're coming in I mean they're all dressed up and nobody to
[19:11.840 --> 19:15.640]  fight and they're guy they got the tanks and the armored vehicles getting in

[25:25.960 --> 25:31.720]  on what's happening but the subways are still flooded and I just cannot believe
[25:31.720 --> 25:36.400]  that so many people I guess some of them had their houses totally destroyed so I
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.440]  mean what could they do but a lot of people are on the news saying they
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.680]  tried to go to the grocery store that day the day before it was heading to try
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.600]  to get food and toilet paper and weren't able to get it I mean I just do not
[25:47.600 --> 25:53.400]  understand not having you know your garage stuff full of stuff or whatever I
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.080]  mean even if you're poor you can buy a few extra cans of you know food every
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.560]  week and try to pile it up I mean I was looking I saw an article last week I
[26:01.560 --> 26:07.440]  didn't get to I think it was McClatchy but you guys print it for me it was it
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.800]  was associated associated press to I think did one that the average household
[26:12.800 --> 26:21.720]  on welfare gets $60,000 shoot when I started making $60,000 a year I thought
[26:21.720 --> 26:31.040]  I was rich the people on welfare makes $60,000 a year per household holy
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.080]  mackerel anyway side issue let's go to your let's go to your phone calls John
[26:35.080 --> 26:40.000]  in New Jersey where are you calling us from in New Jersey I'm actually up at
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.040]  Northern New Jersey now I evacuated Long Beach Island yesterday I rode the
[26:45.040 --> 26:51.520]  storm out there and reports aren't exaggerated man it is just total devastation
[26:51.520 --> 26:58.000]  Armageddon down there just scary yeah that's where I saw like entire you know
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.200]  it's one solid as you know you live there but I've driven through it one solid
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.280]  tourist deal for everybody from New York and New Jersey it's just solid little
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.960]  hotels and things and they're like tumped over and smash in the photos I've
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.720]  seen yeah I took a lot of photos I like you said it was kind of stupid I was
[27:14.720 --> 27:19.480]  running out of water and food but I had this morbid curiosity just to see what
[27:19.480 --> 27:25.960]  was gonna happen and just to witness this thing you know the cops were there
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.600]  weren't too bad but you could see they were getting off on it you know they were
[27:29.600 --> 27:36.000]  kicking people out of houses they were geared up and they're you know our
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  military gear almost you know they just didn't want to deal with anybody I could
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.160]  kind of understand that but you could tell so many skies were really getting
[27:43.160 --> 27:46.840]  off on it yeah I mean you know what I'm not the toughest guy in the world but I
[27:46.840 --> 27:51.320]  can stand up for myself and I'm pretty confident I would be embarrassed when I've
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.920]  seen police in some of these big cities the way they act and strut around and
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.320]  are mean to people that haven't done anything I mean it's something you're
[27:58.320 --> 28:03.840]  seeing all that that that chicken walk behavior going on yeah I mean there's
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.120]  really not too many people left there on the on I mean there was a mandatory
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.320]  evacuation so well they try to get everybody off I was actually escorted
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.880]  off by a friend who's a police officer and you know he's a good guy but he's
[28:16.880 --> 28:20.920]  just trying to do his job sure I mean that's one thing I'm not I thought you
[28:20.920 --> 28:23.720]  were implying people were you know really getting off on getting in people's
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.040]  faces but I could also see the point of if they're saying mandatory evacuation you
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.440]  know my issue is if people want to stay and shelter in place that should be their
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.240]  issue I mean I understand of a damn breaks they could say it's a mandatory
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.280]  investigation but just government is lost my trust by and large that that's my
[28:42.280 --> 28:47.720]  issue well this is a vacation home and I was taking care of it for my family so
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.160]  I shut the water off shut the gas off power off I did all I could do and then
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.080]  I got out of there and I went up to I'm up in northern New Jersey now and from
[28:58.080 --> 29:05.160]  all the way south Jersey up the Parkway mile-long you know traffic jams just to
[29:05.160 --> 29:10.480]  get gas at every rest stop people walk on the parkway walking across trying to
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.360]  get gas of gas cans I mean if it doesn't get better it's we're talking about
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.640]  bedlam soon up here in some of the urban areas found south it's a little more
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.000]  close to the community where I was just relying on friends you know to just you
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.480]  know to get food to get water and everybody kind of banded together but
[29:29.480 --> 29:35.080]  up here I mean I think it's gonna be you know every man for himself and so
[29:35.080 --> 29:38.440]  that was my next question but we're going to break but I want to briefly ask
[29:38.440 --> 29:41.840]  you this when we come back and we'll go to other calls talking to John in New
[29:41.840 --> 29:47.920]  Jersey how bad is it gonna get when the food and the water runs out and the
[29:47.920 --> 29:54.920]  gas runs out we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:20.440 --> 33:26.920]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen we've got news on the economy news on
[33:26.920 --> 33:31.720]  the Catholic Church and others being told to pay for abortions most churches
[33:31.720 --> 33:35.040]  are saluting and saying well if the government says so we better do it
[33:35.040 --> 33:38.680]  having no idea what the First Amendment is in fact guys will you go get me one
[33:38.680 --> 33:42.120]  of the citizen rule books please that we put free in every order because I want
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.000]  to show people the evil First Amendment and explain what it is this is not a
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.880]  mystery but just like they can have the media announcing world government run
[33:50.880 --> 33:56.280]  by private mega banks all over the news but then separately have the ADL and
[33:56.280 --> 34:03.600]  Southern Poverty Law Center come out and say that it doesn't exist isn't that
[34:03.600 --> 34:11.000]  interesting it exists but it doesn't exist world government's good but if you
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.600]  don't like it you're insane and it doesn't exist it's the same thing with
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.800]  the First Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.600]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof Congress shall make no
[34:24.600 --> 34:30.480]  law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[34:30.480 --> 34:36.840]  exercise thereof that's the separation of church and state the government if
[34:36.840 --> 34:41.640]  not in the realm of the church you can't charge them property taxes you can't
[34:41.640 --> 34:47.080]  charge them taxes you can't charge meaning and until the 50s that was the
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.120]  case in this country and then they had the Rockefeller funded World Council and
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.800]  National Council of Churches have the big denominations say oh we're becoming
[34:55.800 --> 35:00.960]  charitable organizations and stepping into government regulatory control to
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.760]  the point of now they'll send SWAT teams to churches that aren't 501c3
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.800]  sometimes on the news and show preachers being arrested running the hoax it's
[35:08.800 --> 35:11.840]  illegal and the cops are like the general public they can't tie their shoe
[35:11.840 --> 35:16.880]  laces and they really think it's illegal to not be under the government when
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.480]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.120]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof that's why devil worshipers are allowed
[35:26.120 --> 35:31.320]  to chop open and eat goats that's why hoping Indians can take masculine but
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.040]  you as a Christian cannot be against abortion you got that Mac so we're
[35:37.040 --> 35:41.360]  gonna be going over that I'm already starting to go over it but we're gonna
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.000]  get into it more it's very important ahead of Joel Scales and joining us
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.080]  finishing up with John and going to Gordon Steve Bob Don and others a little
[35:48.080 --> 35:50.840]  bit quicker what do you expect to happen you're saying you had to leave your
[35:50.840 --> 35:56.240]  place devastated the mandatory evacuation and you were starting to allude to
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.040]  things breaking down there's already fistfights fuel running out people dumps
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.640]  are diving within 24 hours muggings attacks I mean it's starting to really
[36:04.640 --> 36:09.160]  go south quick it could be absolute belt bedlam by election time what's your
[36:09.160 --> 36:15.640]  view on that oh yeah no doubt you know where I am it's a suburbia community up
[36:15.640 --> 36:18.880]  north here and people are banding together you know they're sharing our
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.200]  resources food and water all of them together you know if you have power or a
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.840]  generator stuff like that you know that's all well and good that's that's to be
[36:28.840 --> 36:34.240]  expected in these type of areas but when you get into Patterson Newark you know
[36:34.240 --> 36:38.920]  things are just gonna go bad sour if you know the major problem is gas
[36:38.920 --> 36:46.880]  no one has gas and you know it's just I know people are siphoning you know gas
[36:46.880 --> 36:49.960]  out of cars and trucks wherever they can you know at night and stuff like that
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.400]  and turn you know other areas we're just gonna see how long it takes to get the
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.680]  power back on and get the pumps running you know and if it takes a week or 10
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.720]  days like they're saying do you think it's gonna explode it could explode like
[37:05.720 --> 37:12.280]  I said in some of the you know premier areas for lack of a better word on the
[37:12.280 --> 37:17.400]  thing is New Jersey has some of the string you know strictest gun laws and
[37:17.400 --> 37:22.120]  for the people I need them it's hard for them to get them and the people that
[37:22.120 --> 37:27.080]  don't need them have them so that's right and they throw the book at law
[37:27.080 --> 37:30.640]  abiding people that break the law and get a gun for themselves to protect their
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.680]  family insane I could not imagine living in a place where I don't have fire
[37:35.680 --> 37:40.000]  arms I mean it's such a secure feeling to have a firearm right here underneath
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.240]  my desk it is so secure at night to go to bed with my family that if anybody
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.360]  tried to attack my house they're dead I mean you know meet meet mr. semi-auto
[37:48.360 --> 37:52.480]  shotgun God bless you sir hope everything turns out up there okay
[37:52.480 --> 37:56.400]  wow Gordon in New Jersey a lot of calls from New Jersey go ahead sir on the
[37:56.400 --> 38:01.200]  air how you doing Alex good sir everything that you're saying at this
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.880]  hurricane I just got my power back about 40 minutes ago good everything they're
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.080]  saying about this is absolutely true I don't know what they're saying on the
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.800]  media because we've had no access to it since Monday when this thing started but
[38:13.800 --> 38:17.720]  I would you heard me you're saying what you just heard me on the radio cover is
[38:17.720 --> 38:23.280]  true yes absolutely absolutely as a matter of fact all the law enforcement
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.240]  you'll see anybody on the street you see them all at the gas stations they got
[38:26.240 --> 38:29.520]  several cars there with the light splashing people standing in line with
[38:29.520 --> 38:33.280]  with gas cans no cars are allowed in there with their gas cans for their
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.000]  generators and they're and it just lined up I mean it's just like a waiting for
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.120]  something to happen with everybody there and they're waiting there for hours
[38:40.120 --> 38:43.480]  three hours my next door neighbor spent three hours trying to get gas yeah
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.400]  they're saying we take depending on the area is two to ten days for gas to get
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.480]  delivered and they're talking about November 11th till the powers back in
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.400]  most areas but I'm glad to glad to hear you got your power back maybe those
[38:55.400 --> 39:01.280]  estimates are wrong well now they're doing like in 200 like 200 houses at a
[39:01.280 --> 39:07.240]  time all the businesses are right now dark there's no there's no way of getting
[39:07.240 --> 39:10.880]  food they're letting you in there one at a time that's also causing lines one of
[39:10.880 --> 39:13.640]  the time you're sitting there marking the prices on the things we don't know if
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.200]  the prices are right or not whether they're gouging you for that they're
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.800]  also well they're only taking cash in these places obviously they don't have
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.360]  the electric the do the credit cards in there so we have to know I went to the
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.720]  bank to get cash they're allowing one one customer at a time they're only
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.320]  giving them $100 of their money and that is it you know so this is going to
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.120]  break down soon because with all the people that are in line and people that
[39:39.120 --> 39:42.600]  are trying to get their money and the food and the water and the gas I mean
[39:42.600 --> 39:46.320]  it's getting down into 30 degrees right now in the evenings and people are
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.880]  freezing in these houses you know with no with no and those there you go every
[39:50.880 --> 39:55.880]  time there's a disaster everybody just basically falls apart in these big
[39:55.880 --> 40:01.360]  cities and then people in the country are fine because well I'm busy right now
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.240]  putting in a gas tank I'm just gonna start having fuel deliveries and gas in
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.680]  my house why not and you know I'm on a well and everything else but I just feel
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.520]  for people that have been brought up totally under welfare or domesticated
[40:14.520 --> 40:18.240]  who are not gonna have any idea what to do as the depression incrementally
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.480]  rots things God bless you sir good to hear from you yeah that is certainly
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.600]  certainly what he's saying is backed up in the news reports I saw where the
[40:27.600 --> 40:30.840]  welfare folks are really freaking out because they don't really have food
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.520]  stamps anymore it's credit cards and they let them get cashbacks then get liquor
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.240]  cigarettes things like that and it's a giant you know the corporations like it
[40:40.240 --> 40:43.560]  because the 50 million people roughly on food stamps they're in there at the
[40:43.560 --> 40:47.280]  grocery stores everywhere else you know buying goods and then everybody else
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.520]  subsidizes it but then those people it's get to where they don't know how to go
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.400]  get a job basically and plus a globalist of the industrialized the country to a
[40:56.400 --> 40:59.600]  great extent so it forces a lot of folks on to it and then they get accustomed
[40:59.600 --> 41:05.200]  to it so what's gonna happen now that we're what three days in to the welfare
[41:05.200 --> 41:09.640]  recipients have a couple articles here mainstream news saying that the welfare
[41:09.640 --> 41:16.080]  recipients cannot get anything because they have they have welfare cards and
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.320]  again they'll let them on average get about $50 out a day on that they
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.400]  normally use you know to buy the things that are prohibited with a a lone star
[41:24.400 --> 41:27.360]  card like we have here in Texas they're called you know different things
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.280]  different parts of the area let me just find that article actually have a
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.880]  couple articles on that so just mentioning and it's it's important to
[41:36.880 --> 41:42.560]  actually find the article itself here's an important one they're sitting in
[41:42.560 --> 41:46.360]  cruise from Alabama and other states up there to try to get the power back on
[41:46.360 --> 41:53.760]  but the unions that run these cities in New Jersey in New York this is how to
[41:53.760 --> 42:02.040]  news form who's 48 WA FF they're being turned back and told you you can't help
[42:02.040 --> 42:06.520]  because you're non-union the hurricane ravaged each coast will be receiving
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.360]  North Alabama help but crews learned they'll be doing work in Long Island
[42:11.360 --> 42:16.360]  New York instead of New Jersey a cruise from Decatur utilities headed up this
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.240]  week but Derek Moore one of the cater workers said they were told by crews in
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.840]  New Jersey that they can't do any work there since they're not union employees
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.240]  they ever heard of getting the power back on people don't freeze the death I
[42:27.240 --> 42:32.280]  mean the the guys that aren't union are gonna leave and they're not gonna be
[42:32.280 --> 42:36.240]  there during the emergency I mean they're not gonna drive down I guess you
[42:36.240 --> 42:45.720]  will get more work and get more pay I guess it's all about money so there you
[42:45.720 --> 42:52.560]  go just unbelievably disgusting local TSA workers headed to East Coast oh
[42:52.560 --> 42:56.640]  they're headed to help with recovery efforts in Northeast including some
[42:56.640 --> 43:03.640]  local federal employees that's out of KSDK television can you imagine when the
[43:03.640 --> 43:08.280]  average TSA worker has their poison they're into a lot of them want to rob
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.360]  drugs out of your suitcase because they're drug addicts schedule three
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.000]  narcotics and painkillers and sleeping pills that's a huge epidemic on record
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.760]  or their pedophiles who like to grab little kids or they're just bullies that
[43:19.760 --> 43:22.920]  like to dominate people or their pervs that like good-looking women and I've
[43:22.920 --> 43:25.560]  seen it you see a good-looking woman coming through you'll see a guy who's
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.200]  into that he'll go they'll all laugh and they'll call them over and it's on
[43:29.200 --> 43:35.040]  these are weird empty powerless people that like to go around thugging all day
[43:35.040 --> 43:43.920]  just absolutely incredible so local TSA workers headed to East Coast unbelievable
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.820]  more more St. Louisians if that's how you say it are headed into the
[43:48.820 --> 43:52.320]  destruction zone to help with recovery efforts in Northeast including some
[43:52.320 --> 43:56.560]  local federal employees TSA workers well they didn't call them agents are leaving
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.160]  Thursday well an article that actually called them what they are TSA workers
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.640]  are leaving Thursday with ours unbonded goons to help sandy survivors
[44:06.640 --> 44:13.320]  they're not only be helping the traveling public but their fellow TSA
[44:13.320 --> 44:17.240]  screeners are dealing with the aftermath of storm and it goes on to say
[44:17.240 --> 44:23.000]  that's happening so look out ladies and gentlemen bacteria sewage and unknown
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.120]  contaminants and sandy let me get to your calls here but I do know that oh here
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.600]  it is yeah without electricity New Yorkers on food stamps can't pay for
[44:32.600 --> 44:36.480]  food it's been more than three days since power went on to many parts of New
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.760]  York including the Lower East Side where multi-story public housing complexes
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.880]  like the La Guardia houses don't have electricity for many of the residents
[44:45.880 --> 44:52.960]  are also without food because their electronic benefit cards aren't working
[44:52.960 --> 44:59.920]  so we're gonna be going over all of that as well but let's hurry back to your
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.520]  calls for folks in storm ravage New York New Jersey other areas calling
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.600]  Steven New York what are you witnessing there in are you in the state or the
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.800]  Big Apple I'm in a Staten Island the forgotten borough the only conservative
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.800]  borough in the city which is why we're neglected yeah I saw that that Bloomberg's
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.080]  not sending help but that's how it is Republican states whenever they had big
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.120]  wildfires Obama won't send out yeah I mean you know we come together here about
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.360]  half a mile away from me just third world conditions it's complete disaster but
[45:29.360 --> 45:32.520]  yeah I mean you know telling everybody listening at you know if you're on
[45:32.520 --> 45:35.080]  Staten Island no one's gonna help you you know you have to help yourself you
[45:35.080 --> 45:38.240]  gotta get yourself together because waiting for the government to come and
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.640]  save you it's not gonna happen so well if it's like Katrina that it's gonna be
[45:43.640 --> 45:47.800]  more than that they might come pill for your wife or rob your house yeah I mean
[45:47.800 --> 45:52.240]  you know we're not allowed firearms here so you know we have the police
[45:52.240 --> 45:55.800]  circling all the neighborhoods and you look at them wrong you're dead so it's
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.480]  it's pretty bad here it's uh well I don't know what to tell you I mean it's
[45:59.480 --> 46:05.080]  you know I have power I'm basically in the middle of the island but the rest of
[46:05.080 --> 46:09.800]  the album most of it is just a complete third world situation it's horrible and
[46:09.800 --> 46:15.880]  my third world we're only three days into this most estimates by folks that
[46:15.880 --> 46:20.600]  studied a demography and the different you know things that happen
[46:20.600 --> 46:24.560]  societally I guess that's like mob psychology say that if the power stays
[46:24.560 --> 46:27.880]  off a few more days and there's not adequate food and water that it's gonna
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.160]  be serious uncontrolled rioting and looting will start as once people get
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.200]  hungry they don't care of the cops are shooting at them exactly if it's you
[46:36.200 --> 46:41.400]  know I'm uh I'm hoping the power comes back but like I said the you know to
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.560]  the rest of the album but it's just a complete you know if the if the looters
[46:45.560 --> 46:48.600]  really get going what they'll do is this is already happened in some areas they'll
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.280]  set fires as distractions and then start looting and the police will just
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.720]  stand down I mean what are the police doing there in Staten Island
[46:56.720 --> 47:00.680]  patrolling all around it's kind of like in power military force you know
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.120]  helicopters and like I said if you look at them the wrong way if you go down to
[47:05.120 --> 47:09.520]  those areas you need to get locked up or you get shot so it's it's you know there's
[47:09.520 --> 47:12.840]  no messing around with the least in the Staten Island police they're pretty
[47:12.840 --> 47:16.600]  pretty uh pretty heavily armed and they're taking care of all the riffraff
[47:16.600 --> 47:21.040]  that that that are crazy enough to try something but like I said you know we
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.800]  can't really defend ourselves we have to rely on them so it's pretty pretty
[47:25.800 --> 47:30.480]  dire straight if it comes to the point where it is rioting and you know more
[47:30.480 --> 47:35.360]  unrest we haven't had that much where I am but you know it's gonna get it's gonna
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.560]  get crazy unless unless they get the electric back up yeah I'm looking at
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.080]  different photos and videos from Staten Island of collapsed houses streets
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.840]  blocked I mean what's it like they're closer to the beach just everything's
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.000]  homes off that foundation you know one home is say a block away now it's five
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.880]  blocks into the into the inland just complete disaster I mean water rose up
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.360]  you know by a half a mile into the into the island around all sides and all the
[48:05.360 --> 48:10.000]  people living there just homeless now and like I said waiting for help waiting
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.560]  for the government to help them but that you know no one's gonna help them I mean
[48:12.560 --> 48:15.520]  you know we're banding together here helping each other but you know just
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.360]  like I said the mentality of trying to rely on government to save you I mean
[48:19.360 --> 48:22.640]  just not gonna happen I mean that this is just a lesson to be learned that you
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.240]  know luckily I've been listening to your show for a long time my prison planet
[48:26.240 --> 48:29.760]  TV subscriber I'm aware of this stuff but the people that are listening if they
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.160]  just maybe not hip to this stuff I mean it's gonna be sorry it was the same thing
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.360]  I'm no rocket scientist but we had but we had the two or three days after 9-11
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.080]  we had medical doctors on saying those are asbestos buildings you know there's
[48:42.080 --> 48:47.880]  five six feet of dust this is deadly they're lying it certainly is bad for
[48:47.880 --> 48:50.800]  people and Christina taught Whitman came out and said it's good for you to
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.320]  breathe and I said look don't give money the Red Cross the United Way give it to
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.640]  local churches and I said male respirators to them I remember Mark
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.760]  cornkey also was the first I heard to point that out and he was here on the
[49:02.760 --> 49:05.920]  Genesis don't work at that time the militia leader and he said we've
[49:05.920 --> 49:11.360]  absolutely got to get respirators and we ran a program on air to try to get
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.120]  respirators up there and again the government knew that if we knew that
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.200]  they knew that they were covering it up they didn't even tell the people hey
[49:19.200 --> 49:23.080]  it's not safe but if you got to come in at least wear a mask they let little kids
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.800]  two days later come back to school in the area I mean again the government is
[49:26.800 --> 49:34.360]  run by the worst of the worst of the worst total and complete sharks and it
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.120]  is just absolutely off the chart what's going on God bless you sir and I hope
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.800]  everything turns out okay they're in New York but I mean if it's bad now what
[49:43.800 --> 49:46.680]  do you think it'll be like in three or four days if there's not food and water
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.280]  and gas and things that's gonna be pretty bad yeah it's gonna be really bad I
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.560]  mean you know it's it's basically you know we have a strong community at least
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.480]  honest in this borrow so you know we're actually helping out each other
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.440]  churches are working together with the community and everyone's helping out
[50:03.440 --> 50:09.280]  each each other but you know I just imagine New Jersey and and you know the
[50:09.280 --> 50:14.680]  the areas the areas really hit hard I mean that's like you know like basically
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.880]  all I can say is third world conditions probably for the next couple years at
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.320]  least where I am and they're not gonna rebuild they're not gonna save you so yeah
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.160]  I've the last hurricane I was down in Galveston a few years ago before the big
[50:27.160 --> 50:30.800]  hurricane hit I forget the name and it tore it all up and I mean I've gone
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.800]  back down there like three years later and it's still tore up in a lot of areas
[50:34.800 --> 50:38.200]  I mean it and that's a big tourist area where there's a ton of money from
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.200]  Houston coming in there you know hotel rooms down there in the middle of the
[50:42.200 --> 50:45.720]  summer like 500 bucks a night for not even a nice one and they can hardly
[50:45.720 --> 50:49.560]  rebuild there can you imagine areas that were already depressed like Staten
[50:49.560 --> 50:53.680]  Island just amazing God bless you sir and people say well why don't you got a
[50:53.680 --> 50:57.120]  Staten Island or New York knowing this well it's where people live for their
[50:57.120 --> 51:01.840]  families have been for hundreds of years in some cases have you ever wanted to

[55:29.200 --> 55:32.360]  put it on access television that's the copy people somebody else taped and put
[55:32.360 --> 55:36.040]  on the internet later about the Franklin cover-up and the and the
[55:36.040 --> 55:43.240]  politicians and the kids and the and the boys town and all the rest of it people

[55:51.160 --> 55:55.760]  the one to put it out but I didn't produce it and I was sent in and saw it
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.280]  and aired it and got death threats over it by the way I'm not bragging I just
[55:59.280 --> 56:02.640]  hope people understand I'm hanging out here folks I'm hanging way out on the
[56:02.640 --> 56:07.080]  edge and there's all sorts of circus stuff going on behind the scenes trying
[56:07.080 --> 56:10.880]  to keep this from reaching you but for every attack the Lord just blesses us
[56:10.880 --> 56:14.720]  when we go through it I mean we are just gaining affiliates everywhere by the
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.640]  grace of God and it feels so good to be able to warn people and let them know
[56:18.640 --> 56:22.840]  that hey flu shots give you the flu here's a document hey read the insert it

[56:31.520 --> 56:37.320]  says it can kill you I mean I want to warn people if I knew somebody was going

[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.160]  getting through Bob you've heard the other folks from New Jersey and New York
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.800]  say it's it's as bad or worse as what we're seeing on television how bad it is
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.400]  in your area well Alex I'm very fortunate I live a bit inland from
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.920]  Atlantic City and my power was out for about 18 hours but restored oh good but
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.840]  what what I'm what I'm observing is that the the height of stupidity as far as
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.360]  I'm concerned is the fact that many of the storage facilities for oil gas and
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.160]  diesel fuel in Pennsylvania as well as in New Jersey don't have backup power in
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.360]  order to be able to pump their products in or out of the the storage
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:01.360]  facilities and in addition many of the problems caused by the shortage of gas
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.360]  saline is not for the shortage of gasoline itself but rather because in the
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.040]  state of New Jersey there's no requirement for gas stations to have
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:20.080]  backup power Wow yeah I saw some reports of that and it looks like it's a chain
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.080]  reaction and we've talked about that in preparedness so much that the supply
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.440]  lines are so long and everything now for to have maximum profit is delivered as
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.080]  needed no one stockpiles anything in corporations businesses that if you have
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.520]  any disruption it can be catastrophic well that's a concept in in business
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.360]  known as JIT just in time yeah just in time inventories are great except if
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.520]  there is any disruption in the supply chain just as you said and the reason
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.160]  that you know there's there's so much problems is because the the product can
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.320]  get distributed in addition you know all of these communities has in recent years
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.840]  set up these offices of emergency management or also known as OEM and
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.960]  quite honestly they don't they don't have the proper protocols in place for
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:19.120]  even notifying the local press or the local radio stations as to what the
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.400]  procedures are in cases of emergency and you know on the island that is called
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.680]  that Seekin Island that consists of Atlantic City and a few other short
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:37.520]  communities along the same island they were allowing some people to leave the
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.840]  residents would leave their their alms on the island that had been you know hit
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.480]  by the by the storm and then the resident turns around and wants to get
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.600]  back in because they went to get a park for their heater or they went to get
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.480]  medication and so on and so forth and then they turn around and go back and
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.760]  they can't get back in because the police are blocking them from entry I
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:06.560]  mean it's just totally absurd what is your view on these prognosis for New
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.480]  Jersey New York and in other hard-hit areas I mean it looks like it's a slow
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.160]  burn but things are starting to degenerate and that power may not be
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.640]  back on in some areas is a laughter election day I mean how is that going
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.040]  to affect the election how is that going to affect other things well obviously
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.960]  there's going to be some places where a power is not restored prior to the
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:33.120]  election and that's obviously going to cause you know a very low turnout in
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.440]  some and in certain areas and it'll most likely be in the more urban centers
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.600]  where it's more difficult for them to restore power yeah that'll hurt Obama
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.040]  but a lot of experts have looked at and said well it overall hurts Romney worse
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.560]  very interesting good thing they're both puppets anyways so it's all academic
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.800]  stay with us we'll be back more calls and the first amendment straight ahead

[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.400]  the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since

[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.880]  when I talk about it they've had George Soros affiliated media groups come out
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.840]  and just say that I'm attacking gay people when the studies were saying that
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.840]  it it confused the sexual organs and sexual endocrine hormone levels in rats

[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.480]  giant gas lines intensifying and if this continues a lot of experts are saying
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.640]  it's going to degenerate the next few days what can you tell us dawn well it
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.880]  was so nice to talk to you Alex thank you I'm in Long Island and it's pretty
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.920]  bad here I mean down the South Shore it's like a total war zone the National
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:15.760]  Guards out there running around in their uniforms and their Humvees I was online
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.720]  for gas last night for about two hours and talk about people de-generating I
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.960]  witnessed it firsthand last night it was pretty scary what type of things did you
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.200]  witness dawn oh just people cutting and screaming and blowing their horns and
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:38.240]  cursing at everyone and it's just was mayhem it's just total mayhem it's
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.200]  crazy I mean I'm fortunate enough to have power I'm a small business owner here
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.920]  on the South Shore so I'm seeing the devastation down along the South Shore
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:52.320]  you know firsthand here so it's unbelievable and then you know they
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.600]  have these charging government funded charging stations where you could bring
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.480]  your cell phone there and charge your cell phone really people can't even
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:06.480]  charge their own cell phones unbelievable where do you think it's
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.040]  going to go if the power stays off and people run out of food and there was
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.600]  dumpster diving within 24 hours so many people it appears did not do any
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.080]  preparation I can't but no pep no preparation it's it's it's mind-boggling
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.520]  to me I don't know I mean from what I witnessed last night at the gas station
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.880]  and this was over gasoline I can't even imagine you know what people are going
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.360]  to be like with with food if it gets to that point well thank you for the call
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:40.400]  and please stay in touch with us Don thank you Josh in New Jersey also Storm
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.640]  Ravage we're getting reports are from listeners we just joined us on how bad
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.880]  it really is eyewitness reports Josh what are you saying hey Alex well about
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.280]  10 miles off the coast in Mom's County which got nailed Belmar as Barry
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.600]  basically the shoreline's gone you know everything's gone as you can imagine all
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.600]  the pictures we're still out of power the whole town basically my whole county's
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.600]  out of power doesn't really make any sense there's no answers for anything
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.760]  and they were telling us ahead of time seven to ten days and they're kind of
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.320]  sticking to that and a lot of areas seem to be shut down at the substation so
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.360]  I'm not sure why they're making the problem worse for themselves doesn't make
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:31.040]  any sense where do you think this whole situation is going well it's obviously
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.000]  gonna get worse and worse and worse I mean we've been out five days and it's
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.120]  interesting because a lot of people feel like it's gonna come back any minute
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.760]  and nobody's given any answers anybody on the radio that's from any kind of
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.280]  organization trying to help they're really just not saying anything there's no
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.480]  priority list what do you think of FEMA as usual saying they're the boss but
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.480]  they're not really coordinating and then trying to block people from coming in to
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.840]  help and then you've also got the unions trying to stop elect electricity repair
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.920]  crews from coming in from other states that's the interesting thing Alex I
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.480]  haven't seen any repair crews for days I mean nowhere they just every lights off
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.760]  you see cops sitting there trying to still write people traffic tickets
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:25.600]  unbelievable of course you know there's another the radar is on it's
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.560]  perfect I mean I mean yeah no I mean I mean the country could be under nuclear
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.200]  attack and the cops would be riding tickets you know to be honest as soon as
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.960]  this happened I wanted to call because I thought not right and really what I'm
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.920]  calling about is what's the big picture here what are they doing what's the
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:48.400]  agenda it's gonna affect the election you know something's going on did you
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.440]  know two months ago Dan Badandi when he was I guess flying back from being down
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.120]  here for a job interview he's not been here this is three months ago but he's
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.680]  been down here now over a month and it's on record on his blog talk show on
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.080]  YouTube and we did a report on it last week he also talked about it during the
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.480]  money bomb two weeks ago before this even started the 48 hour broadcast he was
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.440]  in an airport and a guy recognized him on Alex Jones Lister who was pretty
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:17.200]  senior mid-level FEMA and the guy was showing him caps and saying there's
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.920]  gonna be a big natural disaster a storm is gonna hit during the election and
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.120]  they're telling us get ready for all this and and and Badandi you know was
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.480]  walking around the office telling me about it and I heard him on you know
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.060]  during the 48 hour broadcast talk about it I'm like yeah yeah right even as the
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.320]  storm was forming now maybe they just get FEMA ready every time for a power
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.640]  grab but but but they have them ready for this federal rescue with 20,000
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.840]  buses from other parts of the east coasts going into these areas and we've
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.400]  had all the cops call in saying they should get ready for something huge
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.800]  late October early November it's gonna we well you saw the troops all over the
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.280]  east coasts and doing drills and even in St. Louis and Missouri telling them and
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.120]  and the bullet buying I don't know if this is the case I'm just saying that is
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.960]  really scary that Badandi who doesn't run around saying a bunch of stuff like
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.160]  this be one thing we was saying you know dozens of things but then I mean I
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.000]  believe his story and then it starts to come true and then I mean I hope they get
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  the power back on I hope this is a false alarm is my point yeah well they're
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.400]  saying until next Wednesday and I'll tell you right now if that's true it's
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.840]  gonna be real bad people here are not understanding they're not gonna be able
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.560]  to eat they can't you know heat themselves they have kids it's gonna be a
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.560]  nightmare it's not gonna get any better and when they shut off substations and
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.720]  put entire times towns in the dark I'm not really sure why they're doing those
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.760]  things and they have the cops outriding tickets and then they're just sitting
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.760]  there you know waiting to scan you and see if you know you have a warrant out
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.680]  I mean it's just absurd this is the county see where I live I haven't seen
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.440]  a single electric truck nothing I mean maybe they're out you know where they
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.240]  need to be to make it all happen but if you look at it something's not right
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.760]  something is not right well that's what we're seeing is it looks like it may be
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.280]  a partial stand down kind of like the LA riots for the government invited what
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:12.160]  happened and wow we're gonna continue to track this thank you Josh wow Sarah in

[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.000]  they've disarmed the public in many areas the country so you don't have the
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.520]  normal you know citizens being armed to stop looting and it's kind of like they

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.280]  what's happening but I mean in a way of the National Guard wasn't there it
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.240]  probably be a lot worse but how long are they saying to the powers back on in

[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:54.120]  report.com you can see the article that we put out this morning gun sales surge
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:25:01.080]  in fear of Obama reelection to an all-time all-time new high and I will
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.800]  be getting into some of that with Joel Scalzen that is a Paul Joseph Watson
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.600]  article firearms shop owner labels Obama the best gun salesman we've ever had you
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.640]  know I was having a talk with my wife this morning and she's a really smart
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:21.080]  lady and she said look Obama says he's gonna make churches pay for abortions
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.840]  on their insurance for their employees he says he's gonna ban handguns and
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.200]  rifles he says he's coming after him I know Romney's New World Order but you
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.680]  know maybe was last night I was talking to her but she's like shouldn't you at
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.760]  least admit he's on the surface says he's better because people aren't gonna
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.240]  understand you know the the average public's like well no Romney says he's
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.520]  pro-gun and he's anti-abortion they're not the same they're backed by the same
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.920]  globalist but they are not the same and I just get a bad immoral feeling not
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:57.280]  coming out and saying people should vote for Mitt Romney I always just tell you
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:02.640]  what my gut feels like what my heart feels like nevertheless though then I
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.480]  realize intellectually he's bought and paid for it's the left right paradigm
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.840]  this is the trap where the Democrats just move you quicker towards the
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.600]  tyranny in one respect but Republicans lead you towards tyranny faster in other
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.880]  areas and then I think about how the Democratic Party grips are trying to
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.560]  shut us down with all sorts of dirty tricks that I don't even talk about on
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.040]  air I'm so sick of them and all they're gonna make us do is work harder and
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.960]  expand I'm not gonna let these people shut us down I think that's what Joseph
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:32.800]  Farrah said to me on air and off air he said Alex I know they do stuff to you I
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.160]  know they mess with you he goes they mess with me don't you get it they're
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.600]  coming after you like you are with the Republicans even though you're not and I
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.560]  guess that's kind of what it's like it's like if there's some gang coming after
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.320]  me because they see me as part of another gang and I'm not part of the other
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:54.880]  gang doesn't matter I'm still in the gang that's what the power structure does
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.240]  they just they just put you in a gang and then there's nothing you can do about
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:05.400]  it because I'm anti-abortion ladies and gentlemen and pro-guns that's why they
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.120]  hate me and I'm so sick of the New World Order I am so sick of them and I'm so
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:17.040]  sick of people that are dumbed down and don't know how evil the globalist are I
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.160]  am so tired of it let me tell you something if you're a new listener the
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:27.320]  New World Order is real Jack okay I've had whoever it is listening to my phone
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.440]  lines before many times and call up and death threat me and tell me in a voice
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.680]  right out of a movie that they were just listening to what I was talking about
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.240]  with somebody on the phone they've done to my wife too and again I don't say
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.360]  that to intimidate or scare you I say that's you understand folks this thing
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:50.920]  is real okay the New World Order is real the the additives they put in the food
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.800]  to make our girls go into puberty and to feminize our boys that's all in the
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.360]  government documents eco science and other books white-out science are I
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.320]  mean I understand why people think this some of this stuff couldn't be true
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:12.480]  because reality is over the top we got Joel Scowles and coming up this is a
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.280]  short segment I'll have to get into the First Amendment first but go ahead and
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.040]  get him on Skype and everything and get him lined up we'll be doing Skype
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.240]  video phone audio because Skype doesn't have good audio for whatever reason at
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:29.280]  least last time but always riveting and informative that's coming up but it does
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.720]  shake me to my core that I don't have the oratory communication skills to
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.520]  really get across to people how real this is I mean there's a desperation that
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:48.880]  if I could just teach the general public what I've personally seen what I've
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.200]  personally witnessed from government and the globalist then you would know I
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.840]  mean if you knew what I knew well I guess someone cannot be told about the
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.400]  matrix one must see it for themselves and that's an allegory for life I've
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.600]  chosen the red pill and let me tell you folks taking the red pill is incredible
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.680]  and it is it is a life-changing event to find reality the door to reality open
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.600]  the door and then discover more and more and break through those boundaries and
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.040]  to learn how little you really do know but then you look at the general public
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:28.480]  who has no idea but here's the mind trick if you take the blue pill to live in
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:34.560]  the matrix although all that evil is still there just now you are spiritually
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.040]  physically mentally blind to it but you're so delusional you don't even know
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.760]  when you're being destroyed it's like you never see it coming I want you to see
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:49.320]  it coming we got to beat these people we got to do it

[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.320]  pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in every one of
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.600]  these states most people want to be ready won't be able to get out of town
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.280]  because they'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy

[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.800]  raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.440]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.360]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.480]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.360]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.600]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.240]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.320]  eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.120]  First Amendment we've mentioned it some but now some of the churches are doing
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.920]  the right thing the only thing I'm gonna briefly talk about that but a David

[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.160]  the next hour with Joel scowls and because he's about to join us but we've
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:16.120]  heard people calling in the power out their neighbors you know being looted
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.400]  all sorts of things are going on people dumpster diving large portions the
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.440]  population not getting prepared you've been down here for a few months now as
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.680]  an info wars nightly news reporter David doing a great job and we got some of
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.960]  your reports up on the site right now for just the last few days with Gary
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.520]  Johnson talking about the Bilderberg group in the New World Order libertarian
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.840]  candidate pretty powerful but tell us tell us what your sister has been
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.880]  telling you and the reports you're getting from where just from her neck of
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.800]  the woods where she lives well basically Alex you know people in the New York
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.680]  New Jersey area they really don't cry wolf a lot so when I started to get these
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.600]  texts over the past couple of days they were pretty intense you know my sister
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.360]  sent me a text saying David this is scary with an exclamation you got notes
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.480]  there what she said yeah right she sent me another text and this is over the
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.600]  course of two three days two to three and a half hour wait times she sent me
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.520]  another text saying I couldn't back out without a cop's help meaning that she
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.120]  was getting gas and once she was done filling up the tank things were so
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.160]  chaotic as she was backing out on the public wouldn't even let her reverse so
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.320]  she needed the cops help to really just get out of there she says um no more
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:32.160]  than $30 worth of gas that's the most you can get and you need cash look at
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:38.080]  how look at how self-centered and lazy and the average person is now I mean
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.440]  this is not the the depression generation who were 90% self-sufficient
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:47.240]  roughly and millions ended up starving to death one way or another university
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.880]  study show imagine if we ever have a real depression here what it'll look like
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.280]  that's extremely extremely scary and right now people are at the brink thank
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.240]  God there's little glimmers of hope like lights and electricity are starting to
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:03.440]  um you know be put up now you know some people have electricity but people you
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.200]  can hear it in their voice their tonality it's almost like they're
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.240]  starting to break starting so um I'm happy to hear that a lot of within just
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.920]  three days just takes three days that's what all the studies in every culture
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.400]  show five days massive rioting looting and there's not food and water and power
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.840]  10 days 90 plus percent of people will start killing and actually even
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.760]  invading areas where people are armed to get food and within 15 days over 90
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.600]  percent become cannibals yeah absolutely and another thing she's saying is that
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.040]  there's continual press conferences with governor Chris Christie saying that
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.560]  gas stations can't price gouge almost hinting that some gas stations are
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.240]  flirting with the idea oh it's obviously going on but I've seen some reports of
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.600]  that but that other point about not even triple a will come out and give you
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:55.120]  gas yeah basically triple a whenever your car is in trouble they always give
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.920]  you two gallons of free gasoline so that they can you can pull over to the
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.840]  local strip mall and then they could you know tow you instead of just carrying
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.400]  a small can of your own car yeah yeah they don't even have that triple a you
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.360]  don't get free gas now so the problem is a lot of people are running out of gas
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.600]  waiting for gas on the gas line and so now you've got some call a lot of areas
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.080]  won't even give cars gas they're just giving people cans for generators right
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.880]  so I mean talking to your family this keeps going over three four days is it
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.360]  gonna blow sky high oh my god yeah it's really concerning people are breaking to
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.200]  my father former military guy he hasn't had heat for three four days he's now
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.880]  going to another family member's house because my mother just got a cold the
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.840]  grandchildren are getting colds so people are starting to break emotionally
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:44.800]  because they also don't have heat it's not well incredible incredible David Ortiz
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.040]  thank you so much we'll be covering this on m4 is not only news tonight seven
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:51.160]  o'clock central thank you thank you David look I'm gonna get to the first
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.640]  amendment thing later in the next hour I keep promising to do it but then I just
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.240]  I've got a segue into Joel Scousen because he's an expert on this subject but
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.320]  I need to get into this first amendment thing I'll do it at the bottom of the
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.880]  hour next hour I promise I don't normally you know back things off it's
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.600]  just that so much is happening and this fight with the government takeover of
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.520]  churches saying what they've got to do you've got to pay for health care plans
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.600]  that have abortion it is totally illegal because Congress shall make no
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.480]  law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.200]  exercise thereof that's the beginning of the first amendment so I'll just give
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.040]  you an addendum right now and then shift gears into what's happening on the East
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.800]  Coast but in all orders of books videos the new films strategic relocation with
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:37.240]  Joel Scousen in all of the orders you get a free citizen rulebook with the
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:43.440]  Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence and a lot more going
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.800]  over all this but let me read you the first amendment here Congress shall
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.280]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.920]  exercise thereof whenever you hear about free speech it's about somebody's
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.320]  right to get taxpayer money to put a crucifix in a bowl of urine oh they've
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.440]  got their right but you you you're not gonna criticize abortion in your church
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.440]  they actually tell people in Baptist churches Methodist now when you have
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.600]  your first amendment government has no jurisdiction that's what separation of
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.400]  church and state means it doesn't mean that that government then says churches
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:21.480]  can't have views on the world and it goes on or abridging the freedom of
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:24.400]  speech or the press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.400]  petition the government for redescredences that's the first amendment and
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.360]  the point is is that you know I'm a Protestant myself that's what I've
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.840]  been raised as but I've got to commend the Catholics for the Catholic
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.960]  bishops and people for coming out and saying you don't tell us we've got to
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.360]  hire people who aren't our religion a and b that you know in the churches and
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.840]  that we've got to pay for abortions in their health care we're not doing that
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.200]  and and and Obama is evil okay I mean that's what they've come out I've got
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.400]  the letter right here it's in the classy news and that's what the churches
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.520]  are supposed to do okay this Romans 13 garbage all of it we're the people the
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.760]  Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence that is
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.600]  literally a sacred document based on common law based on the Magna Carta
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:17.040]  based on things that go back to Leviticus before it and it's sacred it's sacred
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:24.280]  and that's what we render unto that's our Caesar but again because just like the
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.000]  separation church safe you Christ says render unto Caesar things that are Caesar
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.160]  things to God that are gods that the government has no jurisdiction in the
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.720]  religion that the two separate things two separate things but then our
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.320]  government is based on that biblical system which says you've got your free
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.400]  will that's why you can go out and be a devil worshipper or an atheist or
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.400]  whatever you're into but I got my right to say killing babies is wrong you
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.080]  understand it now I'm ranting but that's basically it I'll get more into it
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:41:00.320]  later Joel Scows and of course his publisher of a world affairs brief he
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.280]  is also was a fighter pilot in the with the Marines in the Vietnam era he's
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:15.160]  also one of the leading experts on secure homes and preparedness and he of
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.120]  course is the author of several books but I just had them in here oh here they
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:25.240]  are over here had them up on the desk let me get them up here strategic
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:33.680]  relocation the third edition that is the basis of this new film that just came
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.800]  out and it goes over in two hours and 40 some minutes with expanded extras
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.440]  total the whole thing that we're facing the globalist takeover program the
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.320]  three global power blocks from Joel's deep research what he thinks they're
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.600]  up their their program is to fully bring down the US and then turn into the new
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.520]  army of the world government which Obama said our military is under UN NATO
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:03.080]  control all of this is in the new film strategic relocation strategic relocation
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.120]  the film and it's gonna we have it in stock now it starts shipping next week
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.280]  so get your order in now we can pretty much say now shipping for strategic
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.960]  relocation and it integrates with these two books that we sell as well the
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:20.520]  secure home by Joel scowls in the Bible of you know just all the different
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.480]  variants from inexpensive to expensive ways to secure and also hide your home
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.440]  hide the secure areas of your home and strategic relocation which just isn't
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.480]  about running off to the hills I mean that's in there if you want to be in
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.880]  the safest place but also if you live in big cities the escape routes basic
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.760]  preparedness a map of all the countries and with deep research on their scale of
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.480]  liberty and economic freedom truly an amazing book all three of these are
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:52.240]  available discounted at infowarstore.com and again I produced the film
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.280]  strategic relocation with the great crew Rob Jacobson and of course Darren
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.760]  McBrain and many others that helped put this together but amazing graphics
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.720]  amazing research this is invaluable and I think every car should have strategic
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:11.400]  relocation in it because it's full of the water quality nuclear plants areas
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.360]  that can't be passed in bad weather military bases nuclear strike areas
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.840]  and that's not why Joel Scowls is really joining us today we'll talk more
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.600]  about it some about it in the next hour but I just wanted to get that plug in

[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.080]  secure homes and things every time I talk to you you're somewhere else
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.240]  globetrotting you've lived in many of these countries around the world that's
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.560]  how you can speak about them and talk about them but just looking at what
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.320]  we're seeing in New York and New Jersey predominantly where most people just
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:16.120]  didn't even get prepared they're just begging the government to help them
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:22.320]  Staten Island in a collapse type situation it's just incredible to see
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.400]  how domesticated we've gotten and you just heard David Ortiz there sir
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.920]  talking about you know people not having power people suddenly getting sick
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.600]  under stress God forbid we go into a full collapse depression or any type of
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.720]  military attack on this country because I think it's safe to say most this
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.760]  country has now become fully domesticated well I was there Alex in
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:52.000]  the Albany New York area which was inland of the narrow strip of band and
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.560]  band which was subject to the flooding and most of the high winds brought down
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:00.680]  the power in that narrow and around there but it's interesting that even with
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.280]  and because of that narrow band I want to emphasize that there's not a huge area
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:10.240]  like Katrina that was destroyed or had a lot of destruction this is a narrow band
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:15.920]  and there's a widespread power outage because of the power lines going down it
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.720]  was amazing it was like a light show when you see the the transformers
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.480]  explode and you see these blue and white like fireworks going off underneath
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.760]  the clouds as each of these power lines was short out and create the
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.840]  transforming problem one of the biggest problems is the backing up of the sewers
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.400]  in that kind of a flooding where you have a lot of contamination a lot of
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:41.920]  disease could be a problem if people aren't very very careful but the thing
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.880]  that I want to emphasize it's it's kind of like I told you so in strategic
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.480]  relocation I say you know the biggest problem isn't earthquake the biggest
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.600]  problem isn't hurricanes or even nuclear war the biggest problem is high density
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:03.040]  population areas because no matter what comes it's the people that cannot and
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.720]  will not and do not prepare that are gonna get deadly and you may survive the
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.560]  terrorist attack you may survive or not even be in a nuclear target area and yet
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:19.800]  when people panic and go berserk have no food and start to pillage everything
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:24.600]  stops everything gets very very dangerous your life and you know even a
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.360]  handgun isn't going to protect you against huge mobs you just can't go
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:32.080]  around you know defending yourself against those kinds of numbers and
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.920]  that's why I say to people you know don't wait until this thing is bearing
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.200]  down upon you before you seek for relocation and even those the people
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.640]  who can't get out of the New York metro area you can relocate to areas that are
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.960]  less dense that are more inland but not sitting right on the beach where they're
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.080]  you know fine target sure Joel just interrupt again I thought your skype
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.400]  was good enough for radio it's degraded a bit the video is great for Prison
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.680]  Planet TV viewers we're gonna put you on the landline right now so we'll go
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.040]  Skype video phone audio right now with Joel Scals and I want you to repeat
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:09.480]  everything you just said it was pretty audible but I want everybody to listen
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.640]  carefully when you see the trailer for strategic relocation you're only looking
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  at the nuclear war aspect the Joel believes the globalists are gearing up
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.040]  for and and now we hear the Russians talking about nuclear war against this
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.840]  and stuff I mean we're in a more dangerous position now the Pentagon says
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:27.440]  than ever even during the Cold War that's not denied but but most the book
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.600]  is just about other issues and the fact that when society breaks down and we
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.080]  see this slow depression happening and just the crime increases and the media
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:42.760]  just covers it up so as all of this is expanding I want him to repeat that for
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.480]  you because that's the issue it's what comes after it's after the hurricane it's
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:54.920]  after the earthquake it's after the fires and you know as the civilization
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:02.120]  gets you know more and more stressed you're only going to see more of this
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:08.240]  type of thing unfold and again I don't know much compared to say my dad or my
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:15.160]  grandfather when it comes to farming ranching processing game I know more
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:23.720]  than most the public and I am a novice when it comes to old timers and I look
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:31.480]  at the general public I mean they literally literally do not know how to
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:38.320]  tie their shoelaces and and it's getting worse and worse people are really
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:47.360]  good at watching television people are really good at working the system people
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.760]  are really good at all these type of things okay Joel start over where you
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.560]  said it's quite frankly I want to cut a trailer out of this to promote the film
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.600]  because it's so important you're right start over with what you said about you
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.200]  know see you know I told you something break that down what the real danger is
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:11.120]  from disasters yes Alex the what I'm trying to say is that the biggest
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.360]  threat that we have is the the high density population centers that surround
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:24.320]  people who live in large metro areas despite the earthquakes despite even
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.400]  nuclear war if you're outside of a blast zone it's the fact that the people
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.280]  around you cannot sustain themselves in high density population areas without a
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:36.000]  continual stream of food water and government services they're gonna cause
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.120]  them to get into pillaging and that can be hazardous to your health you can't
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:44.920]  even defend yourself with with multiple arms against mobs of people and you
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.960]  wouldn't even want to me these people aren't necessarily evil people simply
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.240]  panic because they haven't prepared and are starving to death and start to look
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.640]  for food or anything else that they can find one of the things that I thought
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:02.360]  was interesting as well Alex is that people who thought that they could
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.760]  prepare in advance because they had warning it you know almost a week of
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.560]  warning the store was going within three days of going out to Home Depot and
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.960]  Lowe's and the other home improvement stores the generators are gone the gas
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.720]  cans were gone the water supplies even though there was still food in the
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:22.800]  supermarket the water supplies were gone from the supermarkets and so are the
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.400]  batteries and so a lot of people just don't think they get narrow minded about
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:32.320]  well batteries are going to be at this location they fail to realize you go to
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.080]  a toy store and they had all kinds of batteries you go to a baby store they had
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:40.760]  all kinds of batteries because nobody thought about going there so you know
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.880]  people aren't very smart about dealing in a panic situation they really there's
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.600]  no substitute for preparation and even when you prepare you're not going to be
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.240]  able to get out there and interact with the people exactly stay there I want to
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:57.480]  get your take Joel Scales and one of the premier experts and prepare this on
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:02.200]  where you see this East Coast degeneration going the worst drought in 50
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:06.240]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:11.160]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:15.960]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:19.560]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.480]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:27.680]  cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.320]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:35.280]  prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.440]  from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.680]  their delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.160]  save money today and because it stores for 25 years they're locking in today's
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:51.560]  prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait call 800-409-5633 or go to
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:57.440]  e-foods direct.com forward slash Alex call 800-409-5633 or e-foods direct.com

[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.280]  hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:19.040]  has fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012 Obama's secret war on
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:23.280]  coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:27.760]  coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be just a matter of time
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.880]  before the lights start going out across America but here's some good news
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:37.280]  there's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.920]  patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.680]  video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:50.280]  media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the

[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.280]  York I want to get to all of you but we got our guest on late but we're gonna
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.840]  get to you Joel Scowze and of World Affairs brief the editor joins us the
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:56.920]  new film strategic relocation well choosing to see the film to start
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:00.800]  thinking about preparedness and thinking about the different elements of it
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.520]  Joel I want to get into geopolitically some of the breaking news you have her
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:07.960]  today with Benghazi and where you see this election going but you have this
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:11.560]  hurricane hit we got another blue northern coming in about four days
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.760]  they're talking about power out to millions until the 11th if things are
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:22.760]  already degenerating what do you expect to see happen because FEMA's already not
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.400]  there bringing food to people and stuff and the Red Cross isn't helping we've
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.920]  got people complaining about that you know my issue is people should be
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.600]  prepared themselves unless they're the elderly or the infirm what do you expect
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.600]  to happen well I want to reinforce what you're saying there's no way that FEMA
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.640]  or the federal government or the state government can ever provide enough
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.640]  supplies to have people maintain a normal lifestyle in a crisis where major
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.200]  cutoff of electricity you see electricity is essentially you can't get gas at the
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:58.880]  stations that don't have electricity you can't you know get around and many of
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.400]  the traffic lights don't work in these areas so that you know the police are
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.480]  overwhelmed with that I mean it's just an incredibly difficult thing even though
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:11.040]  there's there's food and you can truck in food the stores don't have any way to
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.440]  refrigerate the stuff they're putting they're not even taking delivery and
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:17.680]  stuff that they can't keep cold because the generators aren't big enough
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.320]  generally to run the big reefers and other things necessary so if this lasts
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.200]  as long as to the 11th now this isn't the end of the world but it believe me
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:32.400]  there is going to be some you're going to see some desperate people trying to
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.520]  get food and it's going to be a problem if they don't have enough gas if they're
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:41.920]  walking I think you're going to see some pillaging in some areas police will be
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.880]  out in force but this is going to be a real hardship on people and hopefully
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.360]  it'll make believers of them but historically speaking it doesn't usually
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.600]  work that way they forget after a year and then they go back to their normal
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:59.920]  complacence why is that because old-timers statistically I've seen the
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.040]  numbers but I just know about my grandparents especially the ones that
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:06.560]  live out in the country lived out in the country I mean everybody had a few
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:10.480]  months of extra food and stuff put up that's just what you did everybody had
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:15.280]  extra ammo everybody had extra cold weather stuff everybody I mean and
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.760]  everybody had you know things with their neighbors help each other with fires or
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.360]  whatever and then nowadays not only people not do it it's demonized in the
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.040]  popular culture to be a prepper well a lot of people are so used to going
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:32.640]  almost daily shopping to the store and using most of the food out of the
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:36.720]  refrigerator and that food now after three days is going bad and that's the
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.120]  problem they've got a few canned goods but people are not used to making their
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.320]  own food or grinding their own wheat or having a slab of meat hanging in the
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.040]  back pantry like they had in the Depression days and so we've really
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.600]  lost a lot of skills in that regard so it's not going to be pretty for the
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.000]  people without power frankly not all of the same millions without power are
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.800]  going to be without power that's probably the last to pick up power so as
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:08.000]  power fills in to these areas you're going to find it easier for people to
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.080]  go to where there is power to get so they're probably not going to be major
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.520]  social unrest but it should be a wake-up call to everyone that you just don't

[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:40.400]  that the globalists have done quite a lot to try to suppress this
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:45.400]  information over the last 50 years when people like Joel Scousen's uncle wrote
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:49.240]  the naked communists trying to explain that ultra-rich were funding
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:54.440]  communism to shut down their competition that's now of course an open secret that
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:58.480]  our government put Mao Zedong into power that's even on history channel with the
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:04.000]  old CIA section chiefs bragging about it that Lenin and Stalin were in put in
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.920]  power by the banksters in the US and England Kettler was financed by the
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:12.160]  globalist doesn't mean they fully controlled them they just put them into
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:17.600]  power just unbelievable tyranny that we're facing and the globalists wrap
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.160]  themselves in the American flag and try to take all of our liberties again Joel

[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:57.240]  right I visited all the time but I sometimes I got too much data to keep
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:01.120]  in my head or keep focused in the conscious area of the brain Joel
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.760]  geopolitically breakdown your Benghazi breaking news and what you see
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:09.600]  happening in the election give us your your breakdown on all of that right now
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.240]  let me just say before I start there that people can get a free sample copy of
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:21.880]  today's world affairs brief by emailing me at editor at world affairs brief.com
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:25.800]  and it's going to be chock full of what we're talking about today and people
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.840]  will especially want to read my election recommendations as we've talked
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:36.680]  about Alex before on your show I am not a believer that Romney is an insider in
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.040]  fact I'm sure he's not an insider they don't let people on the inside who
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.520]  aren't grossly immoral either heterosexually or homosexual and cheat
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.360]  on their wives to show that they're otherwise blackmailable but Romney has
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:56.200]  got this problem of and it stems from the Mormon background of having a
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.880]  persecution complex that being persecuted for so long have been called
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:05.040]  non-christians in fact you know you had Bill Schnabel and on you know ranning
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.400]  and raving about it evil and Mormons are well as a Mormon you know I take great
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:12.800]  umbrage of that most Mormons are extremely patriotic very conservative
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:19.480]  very dedicated Christians who really believe in that Jesus the Savior and yeah
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.360]  but yeah well just to be clear Joe I don't know Bill Schnabel is we had a 48
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.440]  hour you know broadcast and I don't want to create a big controversy over this
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:31.320]  but I haven't seen what you're talking about but I'll try to look into it I was
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:36.320]  told I was doing a report on the history of Halloween I was what I green lighted
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.040]  for the reporters but go ahead well I just got a lot of complaints for me
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:46.160]  about having this anti-mormon rant on on Alex Jones I said well I know Alex
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:50.120]  doesn't agree with that yeah well I don't try to go around attacking you know
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.960]  you know anybody I mean I'm trying to fight the New World Order but yeah I'll
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:59.000]  but go ahead I understand but I'm saying it's very important to understand
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.720]  this even affects a lot of fundamentalist Christians who feel like
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.560]  they're out of the mainstream and so oftentimes you have big televangelists
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.240]  who are in the Christian community trying to kowtow to the White House and
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.120]  get on the prayer breakfast roll trying to make the establishment recognize them
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:19.240]  and it's just not good for religion this hasn't been good for Mormonism to seek
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:23.480]  for the approval of the world and so Mitt Romney thinks he's doing his church
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:27.480]  of favor he's doing his his family background of favor in the country by
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:32.160]  by seeking to get the establishment to accept him so he bends over backwards he
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.920]  hires Chertoff and associates to bring on the best and the brightest advisors
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.040]  you know it's a typical CEO weakness when you're a big business then you
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:44.760]  hire the best of the brightest you don't do your own thinking for you other than
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:48.840]  your own you know financial business decisions which he's very good at
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:52.200]  making but you know he doesn't know anything about this new world or he
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.160]  doesn't know anything and there's no excuse because there's a lot of Mormons
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:59.480]  to do the conservative constitutionals full of Mormons who really understand
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:03.080]  this conspiracy issue but he does not because he wants to make it in the
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:06.920]  world he doesn't want to know about it and so he surrounds themselves with
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:11.400]  globalist advisors and allows them to control his agenda but the reason the
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.920]  powers the bees tried to stop Romney for so long both in 2008 both in 2012 is
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.440]  because they are afraid of a non insider what they might see in the White House a
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:26.320]  lot of black operations if the Benghazi thing went down the way it went down
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.880]  with the Barack Obama who's a puppet sure Tom Donald who told him at 5 p.m.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:37.040]  that day that that you know the ambassador was danger of being dead and
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.000]  he was dead a couple of hours yeah let's stop right there and go over your
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.760]  report because I've been looking at this and I've seen reports of its a false
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.160]  flag you know to to blame Obama but then I haven't really seen the evidence of
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.920]  that but then now in hindsight you look at it it looks like the al-Qaeda groups
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:59.480]  that they put in charge of of Benghazi who were charged with security overall
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:04.520]  of their subgroup are the ones that attacked and then why Obama would deny
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.280]  help to sabotage himself I mean I've really tried to figure out what was
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.680]  happening from your research what really happened well in the first place
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.280]  Obama had nothing to do with it Obama's a puppet sitting there this was done by
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:21.120]  typical black operations in my opinion now the let's go through the issue first
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:24.280]  of all this was not a consulate this was not an embassy this was a compound
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:29.560]  had a couple of warehouses associated with this compound like a safe house no
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:34.480]  no what not a safe house compound what they would call an emission meaning a
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.280]  small compound temporary building for a substation couple of warehouses
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:45.760]  associated with talk full of weapons that they had collected from Gaddafi when
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:49.120]  they when they took over and a lot of these had been stockpiled not by any
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:54.200]  US troops or they've been stockpiled by various militants militia but what was
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:58.920]  happening is that the US was starting to sell off this stock or give it away to
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:05.680]  yehadas who were involved in the Syrian opposition and they were using Turkey as
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:12.000]  the channel for this well there was obviously a competition between several
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.720]  of these al-Qaeda and yehadas groups Muslim Brotherhood included in the area
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:21.160]  in the Benghazi people you know wanted those weapons and that's why the attack
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:24.960]  went down to take the weapons to keep the United States from shipping them off
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:31.680]  to other groups but in the process you have to this does not explain why the
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:36.080]  ambassador was allowed to be killed this was clearly a stand-down order this was
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:40.960]  not something where as many neocon advisers the president who you know
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.080]  the president isn't talking the media isn't talking about what went on here
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:50.880]  but all to the media of the left and the right and the neocons is exchanging
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.040]  information about this and then the standard story of the neocons supporting
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:05.160]  this operation is that they wanted to simply not antagonize Muslims so they're
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:10.360]  going to let American die rather than directly attack these insurgents which
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.680]  they had been supporting this really doesn't hold water because you could
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:19.240]  have come in and inserted troops and things they had plenty of time this took
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.000]  several hours to go down you could have insurgent you could have driven off the
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.840]  things and held the troops and sorted it out they purposely left this ambassador
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:34.240]  guy and unfortunately three other Americans two Navy SEALs who disobeyed
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:39.720]  orders to go in and save the ambassador plus another techie guy that was there
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:45.600]  but what I also found out is there were five security people with the ambassador
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:50.760]  there and they abandoned him and they all survived now that's against all the
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.640]  protocols of people who are tasked whether it's Marines or CIA and this was
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:19:01.200]  CIA people to protect the ambassador they abandoned him that's the only way
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.440]  that they all survive well that's the thing they say that some say this is a
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.920]  false flag tarply and others and I've heard them out I don't know what the
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.760]  truth is perfectly I'm trying to figure it out they say they say it was a false
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:18.040]  flag to make Obama look bad but Obama and his people you know his apparatus was
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.960]  in command they're the ones that denied the help not the neocons well let me
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:27.840]  put it this way it was the dark side of government in command of this Obama wasn't
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:31.480]  a command Obama didn't give any orders he was simply told what was going down so
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:35.400]  so why did the dark side do this well let me put it the way tarply's wrong on
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:39.640]  this in my opinion this was not meant to take Obama down because the dark side of
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.920]  government has an intrinsic relationship with the media if there was a
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:50.000]  thing to undo Obama to you know take him down make him look bad and accrue to
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.720]  Romney the media would have followed up they sure sure sure no clearly the media
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:57.360]  was on the side of this and their ally of a dark side stay there let's see who
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:02.240]  you think's really behind this and what's at the bottom of it Alex Jones here

[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.120]  newsletter okay good Joel this is short segment long segment coming up but okay
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.400]  as you're breaking down all the facts who do you think was behind it then well
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:54.600]  this was in fact a hit on an elimination of someone who I believe was getting
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:58.960]  cold feet there's a lot of pressure on the government the government didn't
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:04.480]  denial that they are even supplying arms to the Syrian opposition that's a lie
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:09.920]  Christopher Steven the ambassador knew it was a lie I think he was getting
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:13.920]  cold feet and that's what happens look what happened to these two generals who
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.600]  who argued with the Pentagon they did not want to stand down they had live feed
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:23.600]  they knew what was going down at that compound and then an ambassador's life
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:29.360]  was at stake the two Navy SEALs were there trying to fight at 5CA security
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  men were there they wanted to go in with Delta team so the admiral... well that's
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.120]  right let's be clear the SEALs were almost a mile away and ran there when
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:43.040]  nobody would help them they were there attached to CIA and just basically
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:49.280]  refused to stand down that's correct and but what I'm saying is that they had a
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:52.840]  laser designator with them that means that they had an armed drone overhead
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:27:00.800]  according to Claire Lopez former CIA and either that or an AC 130 gunship up there
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.360]  that was going to devastate you know this opposition and they were told to
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.280]  stand down now that standup order had to be heard by General Hall and Admiral
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:14.440]  Goyette who were on these communications wires these satellite
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.280]  communications things and they went hop and mad to the parent Pentagon
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.920]  apparently and they were both relieved on the spot because of fucking what was
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.760]  going on that's right nobody's putting this together but as you put it together
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:29.640]  I've seen all these articles but they never tell you what you're looking at
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.840]  and now they're trying to trump stuff up on them so so again you've got an arms
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.200]  cash for the local al-Qaeda security force that's under that command he gets
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.000]  cold fleet so they send in the al-Qaeda force to kill their own people basically
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.920]  because the ambassador wasn't going to go along with giving missiles to the al-Qaeda
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:52.640]  that's right and it it it wasn't to be you know he had gone along before so I
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:56.880]  have to estimate that this was getting cold feet this is not the first shipment
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:03.760]  that's been made out of Benghazi and to Syria to Syria yeah that's right from
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:10.120]  Benghazi to Syria through Turkey and it was clearly an attempt to to clean out
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.960]  the situation and make it go away that's why the entire warehouses have been
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:18.960]  emptied now the operation is done but you know they didn't just clean out an
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:24.400]  ambassador who knew too much and to silence him in that sense because you
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:30.280]  know they have they you know these people ambassador or different positions who are
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:35.880]  CIA you could proceed as well as CIA you know he was an ambassador at this all
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:41.040]  the time my wife was married to a diplomat and he turned out to be sorry
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.440]  not my wife but my mother and he turned out to be CIA she ended up divorcing
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:50.040]  after finding that out but they use black operations all the time and they
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:53.840]  don't get rid of them unless they get cold feet you read Rodney Stitch's book
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.880]  defrauding americans full of whistleblower accounts of people who got cold feet
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:02.080]  started to buck black operations that they ended up in prison or dead and
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:06.760]  that's what happened here I believe yeah I mean people say like you've said
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:10.280]  once they always say that's not true actually from when I've researched the
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:15.640]  majority finally get given jobs evil enough they say no and they just set
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:20.560]  them up kill them or you know run them to ground and that's why this evil keeps
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:26.400]  winning it could just go through as many cops TSA FBI Army whatever they need
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:31.880]  to find enough dark side operatives to put them into those power ranks that's
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:36.320]  right now to my original segue and it's just the reason they're afraid of
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:40.240]  having somebody like Romney and if you're not an outright puppet like Obama or
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.840]  George Bush was and you're somebody who really thinks he's president if Romney
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:48.120]  wins this election and sees an operation like stay there we gotta go to break tell
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:54.640]  us about that when we come back we're on the march the empires on the run Alex
[02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:59.160]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:04.760]  Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and
[02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:08.680]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:12.280]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sour
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:16.160]  kraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:19.880]  enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.760]  afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:26.040]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.200]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat Miso
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:34.600]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.920]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for Lion

[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.600]  public becomes more and more domesticated things are getting worse and
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:16.520]  worse Joel Scowzen of world affairs brief.com joins us again I'm alex jones
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:21.440]  of info wars.com the new film is out strategic relocation breaking down not
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:26.200]  just where to move but micro regions in your area so impressed with Joel Scowzen
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:30.440]  because you know getting I'm interviewing many times over the last 14-15 years
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:34.680]  I've been interviewing I guess since about 98 or so been on the air since 96
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.520]  but actually reading strategic relocation second edition before the
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:43.800]  third came out because I was looking at where to move outside Austin I'd already
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:47.720]  pretty much chosen to this area of the Hill Country the wasn't perfect it gets
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:52.800]  better further out safety wise but it was still you know a lot better more
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:56.040]  informed people more prepared people a lot of other folks that have moved out
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:02.640]  you know knowing what's going on and then talking to Joel in person but also
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:06.640]  off you know off air and when he came to Austin he just knew so much about the
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:10.720]  Hill Country that I'd grown up in and around I grew up in Dallas fourth area
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:13.920]  but also had family that are Austin so spent a lot of time in the Hill Country
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:17.360]  been here since high school and just amazing and then other spots of the
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:20.640]  country I've been to and know about he knew all about them and things I'd
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.400]  learned about certain cultures and groups in certain areas he knew I mean
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:30.040]  real research and and so he's focused on this I haven't focused on it so he
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:33.320]  knows a lot more than I do I just spot-checked a lot of it and found it
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.680]  to be really accurate information so I hope you get the film because it's got
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.820]  escape routes in your city it's got countries rated on their economic
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:46.920]  freedom political freedom you know if you choose to leave the country Joel
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:49.400]  doesn't really overall recommend that perhaps we can talk some about
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:52.080]  preparedness before he leaves us know there's people been holding a while
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:55.240]  that I guess they've chosen to hold but I'll try to get to them for their
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:58.800]  reports from the East Coast but Joel finishing up with a whole Benghazi
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:04.400]  situation what does it signify that they did this and thought they could get away
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:10.560]  with it I mean I mean I know they can sell you know snow cones to Eskimos the
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:15.920]  way the public's dumbed down but looking at this they publicly run Al Qaeda
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:22.000]  against Libya engage in ethnic cleansing of the blacks call it a peace
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.400]  operation then they start attacking a year ago Syria I'm no fan of it compared
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.200]  Al Qaeda Assad's a really nice guy Saudi Arabia is backing all this they're
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:35.560]  running around like mad men they're trying to get a Shiite Sunni war going
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:41.160]  there's 10,000 missiles missing 2,000 of them heat seeking or radar guided in a
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:44.440]  year of former naval aviator you can break that down for us but I've talked
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.760]  to Air Force folks confirming that but it's been in the news and that's not an
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:53.760]  issue PSA needs to you know grope everybody and make and it teaches
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:57.120]  where Al Qaeda and have highway checkpoints but the government runs
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:01.560]  Al Qaeda and then they admit this was the main security force over Benghazi
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:08.360]  that the west had been put in out of Libya I mean into eastern Libya to first
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.960]  launch the Civil War a year and a half ago and then it was this group that goes
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:15.920]  in and kills him and then they say oh it was just a protest that got out of
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:20.800]  control and I mean what really happened how was it going for him what do you see
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:26.280]  happening on the election well the they have to keep this phony war on
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:31.360]  terror going and that's the reason I believe that the powers that be hired
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:35.880]  really second-rate guys to produce this video hardly got shown in the
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:40.440]  United States it was specifically made to be shipped overseas and given to a
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:44.920]  higher-end Al Qaeda people went around showing it to Muslim groups to get them
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:49.440]  all riled up to go attack various embassies but this is more political
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:53.520]  theater essentially to keep the American people believing this dovetails with
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:58.320]  things like Glenn Beck's the project this is a propaganda outfit that I'm not
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:02.880]  claiming to Glenn Beck understands this but he got this information from a
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.120]  government who said they got it out of Switzerland you know it's just hyping the
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:13.400]  Muslim Brotherhood threat it is hype almost everybody in them who's made
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  anything in the Muslim Muslim Brotherhood or these pro-Islam type of
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:24.440]  foundations in the United States are run by the United States government they're
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.560]  the ones to supply them they're the ones that help them out they do not intend to
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:35.080]  let the Muslim Brotherhood or the Al Qaeda people take over the United States
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.640]  the documentary the project is a lot of fraudulent stuff comparing it to
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:45.000]  infiltration with the Marxist not going to happen they have a cultural and
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.960]  racial different look you cannot infiltrate Caucasian society without
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.720]  being very very noticeable the only way that they're able to even immigrate
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:58.680]  into Europe and the United States because our government lets them in for
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:03.240]  crisis creation for conflict creation purposes but it's not that they allow
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.160]  them to take over it's not going to be an Ottoman Empire threat it's not a
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.080]  threat to our civilization they wanted to simply continue to drive the war on
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.280]  terror it's being very very successful and a lot of dumb conservatives are
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.040]  falling into this trap of promoting this Muslim Brotherhood hype saying that
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:24.600]  this is the issue the issue isn't that it's our own government creating
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.000]  conflict setting us up for wars there's going to be a war in the Middle East the
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.360]  reason that the war on Iran has been postponed almost six months could be
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.920]  anywhere from three to six months specifically because Syria has been a
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:41.840]  hard enough to crack they have to get rid of Syria before they attack Iran in
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.400]  order to diminish the threat of retaliation Syria has far more
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.040]  retaliatory capacity than Iran does on Israel and they're much closer their
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:56.160]  non-guided missiles can make you know play havoc in Israel as well as got
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:00.680]  about a thousand smaller missiles can't do a lot of damage but Syria can and
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:05.000]  that's why Syria has to be removed that's why all the stops were pulled out
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.280]  to be able to move this equipment in and that's why they've hired every al-Qaeda
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.880]  every terrorist they can in the Middle East to go fight against Syria and you
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.440]  know Turkey is taking advantage of what I think are false flagged mortar attacks
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:25.480]  on to the Syrian side of the border so that Syria can double up or triple up on
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:30.080]  the retaliation they're going against to Syria I think they're trying to provoke
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:35.200]  Syria into an armed response to Turkey that will justify NATO coming in
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:39.840]  because frankly the Syrian pre-Syrian army and the other al-Qaeda attacks in
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.000]  there are not making headway they're not going to be able to beat Syria until the
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.800]  until NATO starts a no-fly zone which as you and I know is much more than a no-fly
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:54.080]  zone until they send special forces in there to undermine what's going on well
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.400]  yeah they call a no-fly zone and they start bombing any military equipment I
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.760]  want to get in briefly to the master plan for the Middle East obviously the
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:05.800]  thing to take out Syria as you said before I ran so this does show they are
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:10.240]  planning something militarily at least for the possibility of that is why they
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.840]  admit they want to get rid of that it's what Wesley Clark talked about the
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.000]  eight nations that they want to take down but you know when we say 9-11 is an
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.600]  inside job that's not saying the firefighters were in there with
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.480]  plungers blowing it up or that the average military persons involved it's
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:32.440]  the criminal globalist network that's been caught staging fast and furious
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.720]  it's been caught staging Oklahoma City that's been caught staging so many
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:42.520]  things to radically change our republic into a tyranny in the name of safety but
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:49.120]  if this doesn't prove 9-11 is an inside job that they use al-Qaeda against the
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.640]  Russians in the 80s they use them against the Serbs when the Serbs respond
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.960]  they call them terrorists and go remove them I'm not siding with the Serbs the
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:00.880]  point is that that that's an ethnic you know a religious conflict and the West
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:05.560]  is stirring it up so that NATO and Europe can get rid of those sovereign
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.000]  countries in the Balkans and change it and now here's our criminal government
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.400]  siding with al-Qaeda it shows the ultimate disdain for the public that
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.400]  they're saying with one hand al-Qaeda is the greatest threat give your rights up
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:22.280]  for it while the manuals actually say homeland securities for conservatives and
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:27.760]  gun owners and Amish and Mormons for that matter anybody who wants to be you
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:32.840]  know self-sufficient Christians you know homeschoolers Ron Paul type folks
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:38.000]  patriots I'm at preppers I mean this is so out in the open what is their master
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.040]  plan and how does this tie into al-Qaeda being a tool of the globalist the master
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:49.360]  plan Alex is antagonizing the two major ethnic groups to support or Russia and
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:53.560]  China Russia and China is the ultimate goal to get them to strike the West and
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:58.160]  I'll get into that at the end of this but the two major ethnic groups that are
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:03.880]  responsible or that are undergird Russia and China that they've been interested
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.240]  in are the Muslims and the Serbs and that's why they went in to blast Serbia
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:14.120]  and its civilian infrastructure they wanted to antagonize Serbian people and
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:18.920]  it had a marvelous effect in Russia you know after the the phony fall of the
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:22.160]  Soviet Union the Americans were popular you could go over there and everybody
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.640]  loved you and after the Serbia bombing all the Russians hated the Americans it
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:31.320]  turned them around like crazy now in the Middle East I want to caution that while
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:37.080]  they're trying to antagonize the the Muslims by these constant interventions
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.720]  it is not into and they are intending to attack around it is not going to lead
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:47.600]  to World War three that is the Russian China simply are not ready to get sucked
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:51.200]  into World War three that's why I can guarantee you that Russia will not step
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:56.640]  in and stop the US and NATO from taking down Syria they will not stop Iran from
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:01.520]  being taken down even though I think they're goading Medina Jad into excessive
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:05.080]  confidence there's only one thing to explain why he just rants and raised and
[02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:08.960]  antagonizes the world I mean it's like I'm I'm trying to pick a fight you can't
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:13.480]  take us down he's bragging he must have somebody whispering in his ear and
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.800]  saying you know say what you want we'll protect you well all the numbers show that
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:22.080]  that that the moolas who are unpopular if they get attacked it's going to give
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:27.680]  another 20 years of power yeah and but in any case when they're going to attack
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:32.040]  the problem is what Americans don't know is the US and Israel plan to
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:36.440]  obliterate the infrastructure of Iran so that they don't have to occupy an
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.720]  occupation Iran is not in the cards be very difficult to pull off and get the
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:44.360]  American support very costly I think they're just going to obliterate the
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:49.040]  infrastructure of military not just nuclear facilities it'll start with a
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:53.800]  nuclear facility to attack Iran will retaliate against US troops and Israel
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:59.520]  and the US will then have an excuse to go in and put its full firepower against
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:05.400]  Iran but remember the main reason is to rearrange the entire chess pieces of the
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:09.440]  Middle East and suddenly the only two powers there will be Israel and the
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.880]  United States you have puppet regimes significantly round them I think Israel
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:18.080]  and Libya will continue to be thorns in the side justifying our military
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:23.120]  presence there that's why they put Muslim brotherhood and power in Egypt to
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.800]  have instability not stability and it will continue to be unstable in Libya as
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:33.200]  well but ultimately in the game plan we have to remember the main target of all
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:36.920]  of this intervention is to create an image of the US as the bully of the
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:42.240]  world so that Russia and China can someday be justified in attacking the
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:47.040]  West and obviously they'll be false flag events created by Russia into the
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.040]  Balkans in the former Soviet states against the millions of Russians that
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.480]  they put into those countries specifically so that they have an
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.240]  excuse like Hitler did haven't it's used to come in and save their own Russian
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:03.480]  people from NATO and US intervention but ultimately I think that North Korea is
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:08.280]  being preserved to be the trigger for no for World War 3 I think the US will
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:13.440]  have to use tactic tactical nuclear weapons to stop the huge army of the
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.120]  North Koreans from invading the South and that will justify Russia and China
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:23.160]  from saying US guilty of first use we can nuke and they'll do a preemptive
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:27.600]  strike on America which I believe our own government is prepared to absorb not
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:34.080]  retaliate against and thus create a destruction wave upon us militarily not
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:39.440]  civilian targets but military targets and the globalists are always wanting
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:45.640]  to abort quote minority groups and stuff while posing as liberals I also see
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:50.560]  all the urban centers getting destroyed as a good way for the eugenicist to
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:54.880]  reduce population from your research I mean all my research points towards the
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.840]  Anglo-American establishment being eugenics Luciferian based at its core
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:06.160]  what what is your analysis Joel Scalzen yeah of the overall mindset of the
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:13.440]  technocrats there is a eugenics agenda to be sure there's memo 200 that Kissinger
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:18.320]  and others were involved and about eugenics and they do intend to kill a
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.840]  lot of people in this war but I don't think that they're going to be able to
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:26.000]  induce the Russians and Chinese to strike civilian targets I think that the
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.480]  social unrest you know if you strike military targets which will involve a
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:34.760]  dozen cities at least in the United States such as Seattle Colorado Springs
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:39.200]  San Diego California Norfolk Virginia Washington DC you know we have all these
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.920]  integral military targets for civilian you're gonna have enough destruction
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:48.080]  combined with an EMP strike that it's going to be total social unrest in the
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:53.840]  United States for at least six months and that's enough to cause you know real
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:57.680]  destruction within the cities without being viewed as the bullies themselves
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.360]  sure briefly though briefly you know you talk about the Muslim infiltration
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.800]  that's the boogeyman while the government runs the you know Sunni arm of
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:14.360]  that there's no doubt not so much the Shiite run by Iran but I have dealt with
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.480]  these 21 people for now about 14 years as I discovered that angle people I
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:22.040]  know knew about it before I did but I personally discovered it and when I
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:25.600]  learned is these are not just well-meaning dupes that also make money off
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:33.040]  power grabs these are soldiers the UN is operating inside the US they're taking
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:37.480]  over all the small towns they come in with HUD money they even sit there I've
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.840]  seen them you know with handcodes I've seen them with Delphi technique I mean
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.720]  I know a military or intelligence operation when I see one and people
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.120]  and talk about infiltration it's globalist infiltration of every
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.640]  institution they are everywhere crawling all over everything trying to
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:58.600]  destroy our infrastructure and make us dependent while the government itself
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:02.360]  digs in like you said if you look at the architecture of it for a large
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:06.200]  nuclear attack to then re-emerge with all the high-tech weapons and the rest of
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.160]  it that's right I believe the high-tech weapons are being preserved not to
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:14.440]  defend America against Russian in China but to be brought out later and given to
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.920]  a militarized new world order in order to prosecute the war and I do believe that
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:22.160]  the only way that the West will win the war is they cut a deal with China to
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:27.840]  attack Russia's rear and and the reason that's important strategy-wise is that
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:31.560]  then as the war winds down and Russia is defeated because it's actually got a lot
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:35.440]  of weakness a lot of alcoholism a lot of problems in there it doesn't have an
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:39.320]  economy that can sustain itself without milking you know Europe and other
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:47.600]  countries but when China attacks its rear on there then the new world order
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:52.520]  has an excuse to say we have to maintain our militarized global government
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:57.400]  because we have a new Cold War enemy China so you see they cut a deal just
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:02.080]  like they cut a deal with Russia Russia attacks it helps us defeat Hitler and
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:05.560]  then what happens Russia becomes the new color it's come out a bunch that in the
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:12.600]  50s 60s and 70s there were deals back and forth where where the the Russians
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:16.520]  came and said nuke China with us but the US said no then made the deal in the
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:22.600]  70s with Ambassador Bush and these deals do flip back and forth that's that's
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:27.000]  absolutely right so that's how I view the big scenario that we're headed for a
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.640]  takedown and by the way that was declassified what about a year ago was
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:34.600]  even in the British papers for people to know we're not just saying this the
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:39.600]  United States was approached by Russia and they said let's make a deal in nuke
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:44.280]  China so that shows how these power blocks think and the United States said
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:51.040]  no well the important point to realize is that as we you and I Alex and others
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:55.360]  fight for liberty we have to prepare for a takedown I'm really not sure we're
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:58.720]  gonna beat these boys the way that you know this election is gonna be very
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:03.320]  important stay there let's break it down have you ever wanted to generate your

[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:10.800]  coming disaster and may not survive without as you already know something
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:15.480]  big is about to hit the US and you have got to be prepared did you know that
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:19.400]  your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand so if
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:23.240]  there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:26.960]  crisis then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up

[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:13.440]  yeah there's the London Jellograph USSR planned nuclear attack on China in 1969
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:16.800]  the Soviet Union was on the brink of launching a nuclear war against China
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:20.640]  in 69 only back down there for the US told Moscow such a move would start
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:24.920]  World War 3 according to Chinese historian yeah and they've declassified
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:29.280]  that but it's also come out in our nose and if you read deeper actually the
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:34.320]  Russians came to the US and said make a deal with us but instead the US went into
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:38.800]  a deal with China and he saw this in World War 2 World War 1 this is how
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:44.760]  geopolitical strategy goes on Joel talking about not beating the
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:50.240]  globalist I just hope people realize that governments worldwide are digging in
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:54.880]  like like they're about to have a nuclear war and Russia threatened to use
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:55:01.000]  nukes over the Georgia thing in 2008 and when you actually read Pentagon you
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.120]  know reports they say the world's more dangerous than it's ever been and you
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.080]  know they do talk about China and Russia and of course the fleets have been
[02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:13.320]  massing on the troops and bases you know in the Pacific more and more so
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:19.280]  that's the future and al-Qaeda is a literal cutout but it's religious to
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:23.480]  freak out and get scared of Muslims and you know I'm not saying there isn't
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:26.480]  sometimes some radicals or whatever you know the point is the government if you
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:29.760]  hate Muslims folks is bringing a minute record numbers it is a literal paper
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:34.000]  tiger yeah but I mean here's al-Qaeda working for the government I mean I want
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.840]  my freedom back and they use al-Qaeda as the set piece to take all my freedom and
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:43.720]  it's just an asinine fraud Joel that's right and you can't underestimate how
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:48.440]  they know how to read the Christian mentality they've got a biblical feeling
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:52.080]  for the restoration of Israel and so they get them to support the Israeli
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:58.560]  government which is cares nothing for the biblical Zionism of the Bible of
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:04.040]  rest during the 10 tribes or the 12 tribes to Israel and they're all interested in
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:08.040]  the Israeli government is globalist to Benjamin Netanyahu is the Kissinger
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:12.240]  protege this whole education was paid for and he got his first jobs by the
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:18.320]  Kissinger people and this is not someone who cares about religion and so but you
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:22.200]  know you can sucker a lot of Christians into supporting the war on terror
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:26.520]  because of Israel and you let Israel get a free pass to do anything I mean when
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:30.880]  they attacked Lebanon in the last war they went after civilian infrastructure it
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:35.360]  was just unconscionable well I mean now they say hey have a drone kill 200 people
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:40.200]  to get one bad guy and it's obviously meant to cause a civil war in Pakistan
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:44.640]  I mean it is outrageous and that's why you do the double tap I mean you're not
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:47.960]  gonna get any more terrorists sticking around after you've thrown a weapon in
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:51.880]  there you're gonna hit rescue workers and family members trying to help their
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:58.040]  wounded it's just unconscionable the US is antagonizing and as I say that has a
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:02.520]  globalist projected I mean there are other reasons to capture oil to keep
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:06.760]  that oil away from China that's the same thing they played against Japan I've
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:10.960]  cut off the oil supply to force them to attack Pearl Harbor FDR at a six point
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:14.840]  plan to antagonize Japan they're doing the same thing to China and they're
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:17.480]  trying to induce Russia Russia doesn't need any motivation they've always
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.480]  intended strike the West the fall of the Soviet Union was a carefully crafted
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:26.760]  deception to get the West to give aid and trade and to end holds right Europe
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:31.200]  look at the EU have you seen the new EU symbol that's got the hammer and sickle
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:35.920]  in it I haven't seen that yeah they put out a new star showing all these
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.880]  symbols of Europe and there's hammers and sickles all over it well of course
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:45.960]  Turkey has that too and going back to their you know Marxist aid but believe
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:50.880]  me this is the war isn't imminent it's gonna take at least eight to ten years
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:54.600]  for China to read China and Russia to rebuild the Blue Water Navy which they
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:58.360]  don't dare start a world war unless they've got that capability but we're
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:02.960]  going to see intermediate wars we're going to see Iran as the major world
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.800]  gonna see rearrangement of the Middle East but watch out for North Korea and
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:10.960]  watch out for Russia coming back into the Baltic states than the Soviet states
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:15.360]  and antagonizing and working in it they're always going to continue to build
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:19.280]  the military right now they have huge underground missile factories in the
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:22.960]  Almondo Mountain the US has never inspected there yet we give them a clean
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:27.080]  bill of health health and claim that they are in compliance with all the
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:31.080]  treaties that they made and they complied with none of them Alex it's a
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:34.760]  complete fraud and the other reason to explain this is not that these people
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:38.040]  hold on let's do five more with Joel Scales and get the DVD your street

[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:05.000]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:09.240]  threat they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.400]  to come. Joel Scales and his renown is one of the world's far most experts in
[02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:18.040]  strategic relocation and the securing of your home. What I tell people is that you

[02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:25.840]  talk about pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:29.200]  every one of these states most people want to be ready won't be able to get
[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:33.280]  out of town because there'll be absolute panic. There is no preparedness
[02:59:33.280 --> 02:59:38.280]  without strategy. This Christmas give the gift of preparedness strategic

[03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:15.880]  and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show. You
[03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:20.160]  know I've been running liners like that for 16 years about deep behind globalist
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:24.560]  occupied the United States and people used to think it was a joke now they
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:28.720]  know it's not I mean I'm in FEMA region 6 we're not gonna get our country back if
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:33.560]  we don't admit how much trouble we're in and we've had criminal corporate
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:37.840]  globalist sophisticated groups come in and use our money and our taxes to build
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:42.120]  their world government and now you got three big power blocks for the Anglo
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.960]  American you know EU US England New World Order system trying to fight with
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:50.440]  the Russians the Chinese allied with each other trying to use the Chinese
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:55.240]  labor to leverage out the US I mean it's a very sophisticated model but at its
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:01:00.600]  base it's about sure evil you know Joel I'm interested on your view people can
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:03.960]  get strategic relocation third-edition they get the film strategic relocation
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:07.920]  the secure home I mean people are crazy if they don't some people think well I'm
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.760]  not gonna move to the country so why does it matter well you've got maps of
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:14.560]  each city escape routes I mean it's really a masterful job with the film and
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:19.240]  the book Joel but in closing studying the New World Order I mean I know you
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:21.960]  cover mainly political stuff as you know people can spin things if you talk
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:26.320]  about it but studying Bohemian groves skull and bones when I've studied these
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:32.200]  people they really are lovers of death lovers of raw power haters of innocence
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:36.400]  I mean look at all the pedophile scandals coming out all over the place in
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.440]  the I mean this is like what we see in the Bible and I think good people I'm
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:43.920]  not saying I'm perfect but I mean I would never imagine such things it's not a
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:48.520]  temptation it makes you want to vomit those of us that are not just given to
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:52.000]  evil you know from birth or whatever it is because I see some people where it
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.520]  really is just they are evil inherently we are blind so many of us to the real
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:00.960]  evil we're facing can you close with three-minute comment on that yes it's
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:04.000]  important to understand as I've written in strategic relocation where I give a
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.080]  map of how this conspiracy works how the globals work the ones that are really
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:13.080]  fatally connected and that's very real are at the very top they use a variety
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:20.760]  of incentives to keep other people on board they use predictable minions they
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:26.360]  use predictable leftists and people who are yes men they have an enforcer class
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:31.880]  in the dark side of the TA dark side of the FBI they have the class that's most
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:37.160]  visible I call them the second-level directors and those are people like
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:42.760]  Henry Kissinger, Brunck, Scowcroft, Strobe, Talbot, Zbigniew Brzezinski these are the
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:47.880]  people we see often they talk about globalism but it's important to
[03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:51.560]  understand that there's a wide variety of types of people and not all of them
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.920]  understand and that's part of how they keep the secret they don't tell
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:03:00.600]  everybody compartmentalization that's right compartmentalization but it's a
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:06.040]  very real threat and that's why I have this dual track in my own career I try
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:09.560]  to fight to save our country and alert people to the conspiracies that are
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:13.960]  going on I mean we're not going to save ourselves with electing a Republican
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:18.440]  even if Ron Paul got elected you know they might even kill him it's very
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:22.280]  difficult for someone to get inside and capture the surveillance machinery that
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:25.640]  we would need to prosecute and find out and get evidence on these
[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:29.400]  conspiracies and they're just very very powerful
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:33.160]  that's why we have to be ready for a take that we have to be ready for war
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:37.880]  if we're going to rebuild a society alex afterwards a libertarian society a
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:41.800]  conservative society with real values and I think there's going to be a real
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:45.400]  rearranging I think God is going to drive people out from among the major
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:49.560]  cities through crisis and they'll tend to congregate in further
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:54.440]  into the west places where people are known to be gathering and I think
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:58.440]  people will be inspired to do that I think it's an inevitable process that
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:02.360]  we'll be able to reform refight against this new world order at least
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:06.280]  that's you know the backup plan that I feel I think the
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:10.040]  establishment's going to try to elect Obama they don't want Romney in there
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:13.640]  that's why for the first time I am recommending my subscribers that in
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:17.480]  swing states that they go ahead and vote for Romney
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:22.120]  but in red states solidly red states where Romney is not in
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:25.880]  in danger of losing both for third party we've got to build a third party
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:29.400]  movement sure powerful blue states vote for a third party
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:32.920]  so that we send a message from third parties around the rise we've got to
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:36.120]  break this dude all right Joel Scowzen thank you so much by the way we got
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:39.800]  contacted by Ron Paul yesterday he wants to come on he's on next week
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:43.480]  we'll make that announcement further Joel Scowzen thank you so much great job
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:48.360]  here on the show I hope everyone will get the new film at infowarstore.com
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:51.960]  strategic relocation give it to your family as a gift
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:55.400]  and the magazine wake people up every mind we free
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:05:06.920]  is key in this battle against evil God bless you all
