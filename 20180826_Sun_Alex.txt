[00:00.000 --> 00:20.360]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[00:20.360 --> 00:22.640]  and do nothing.
[00:22.640 --> 00:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.160]  When I say this is the most censored, feared broadcast in the world by globalists, it's
[00:39.160 --> 00:40.760]  because it is.
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.000]  And why is it?
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.320]  Because we are on target.
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.040]  We read the white papers, we read the reports, we read what the big tanks are putting out
[00:49.040 --> 00:52.200]  that actually set policy not just here but worldwide.
[00:52.200 --> 00:56.240]  We know about the plan and we know it's anti-human and very authoritarian and we know how to
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.240]  stop it.
[00:57.240 --> 01:03.800]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live 26th day of August 2018 Sunday Transmission.
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.640]  John McCain is dead, just three days shy of his 82nd birthday.
[01:08.640 --> 01:11.480]  We'll be looking at that some, obviously Roger Stone is going to be joining us with
[01:11.480 --> 01:14.680]  huge developments in the second hour.
[01:14.680 --> 01:20.120]  There has been a tragic shooting, at least four dead and 11 wounded at a video game Madden
[01:20.120 --> 01:26.360]  Mayhem conference in Jacksonville, Florida, reportedly a gentleman who was later shot
[01:26.360 --> 01:28.680]  dead, one of the four dead.
[01:28.680 --> 01:30.800]  Thank God it's not more than that.
[01:30.800 --> 01:32.680]  Thank God he's one of the four dead.
[01:32.680 --> 01:41.400]  Had a laser sight on his handgun, it's believed, and began blasting people after he lost.
[01:41.400 --> 01:49.200]  And again, the association of video games and shooting people is absolutely documented.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.200]  It's well known.
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.080]  I'm not saying band video games, I'm saying in every mass shooting, they're a shoot-em-up,
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.080]  obsessed individual.
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.640]  They're generally into death, into Satanism, into Nazism, into communism, into just dark
[02:00.640 --> 02:01.640]  rebellion.
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.640]  They're generally white.
[02:03.640 --> 02:06.240]  I just go with the crime statistics here.
[02:06.240 --> 02:12.880]  Just like 12 out of 10, 10 out of 1, you know, attacks on, for every time a white person
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.880]  attacks a black person, there's 10 or 12 times a black person attacks a white person.
[02:15.880 --> 02:17.360]  It's just a statistical fact.
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.040]  Well, most mass shooters and most psychopaths that kidnap and kill people are white.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.040]  Some are Hispanic.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  Very few are black.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.440]  These are just numbers.
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.040]  And it's just well known.
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.640]  And you want to know the MO of these guys, goth, and I'm not saying all goths are bad,
[02:31.640 --> 02:35.360]  but goth, drug addict, devil worshiper types.
[02:35.360 --> 02:45.600]  It's like the scum back down in outside Houston had a Satanism pin, a Nazi pin, and a communist
[02:45.600 --> 02:52.240]  pin, then he was an incel and voluntarily celibate and just hated women because he'd
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.240]  been rejected by them.
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.000]  And so he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.320]  These people are very easy to track and guess who they are.
[03:00.320 --> 03:01.840]  Now we'll see if this is different.
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.400]  It's a white guy and we'll have a sad number soon and understand this.
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.160]  But the reason we have a second amendment is to protect us from this type of crazy person.
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.520]  Statistically cars kill 30, 40, 50 times depending on the year what guns do.
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.600]  Most people that get killed by guns are killed when they're in the commission of a crime
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.120]  or invading somebody's house when you cut suicide out of the equation.
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.360]  And whether it's pills or driving your car off a cliff or suicide, that is your decision.
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.360]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:27.360 --> 03:29.800]  It doesn't mean I agree with suicide, but that is your decision.
[03:29.800 --> 03:34.960]  So I shouldn't lose my right to drive a car or have a baseball bat or a bottle of whiskey
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.760]  or a gun or whatever because somebody else misuses it.
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.600]  But our hearts and prayers go out to those that have been shot and killed and injured.
[03:44.600 --> 03:51.000]  And we'll be following that as the latest information unfolds.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.640]  There at the Madden Jacksonville NFL tournament and people I know get really, really upset
[03:56.640 --> 03:57.720]  about these video games.
[03:57.720 --> 04:00.400]  They get really, really obsessed with it.
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.720]  They begin to live in that other world.
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.360]  It's like the woman they said went and shot up YouTube because she worked there and had
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.280]  been kicked off or whatever, had a boyfriend worked there.
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.280]  Turned out that wasn't even true, that it wasn't because she'd been kicked off of YouTube.
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.280]  It was because she was fighting with her boyfriend.
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.760]  So we'll be looking at all of that as well.
[04:16.760 --> 04:20.760]  But here's what we're going to cover when we return.
[04:20.760 --> 04:24.560]  The big news, ladies and gentlemen, the gigantic news.
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.840]  The deep state is moving against Trump with just 72 days out.
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.840]  It's 71 days out now.
[04:31.840 --> 04:32.840]  We'll check.
[04:32.840 --> 04:37.200]  And he's getting ready to move on them.
[04:37.200 --> 04:40.720]  And the word is he's getting ready to fire sessions and we've got massive evidence that's
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.720]  about to unfold plus sources.
[04:42.720 --> 04:47.680]  So things are going to heat up explosively, politically, because they'll say, Joe's going
[04:47.680 --> 04:48.680]  to blow things up.
[04:48.680 --> 04:49.680]  He said explosively.
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.200]  Well, that's what George Soros Media Matters do.
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.000]  I mean, things are politically very, very volatile right now and we're going to break
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.400]  it all down on the other side infowars.com, newswars.com, please spread those links.
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.400]  We knew it was coming.
[05:01.400 --> 05:07.000]  The whole thing was for me like first demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man,
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.280]  then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[05:12.280 --> 05:16.440]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[05:16.440 --> 05:17.440]  And then wallah.
[05:17.440 --> 05:23.320]  Two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we
[05:23.320 --> 05:30.800]  were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds, go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.920]  to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast
[05:34.920 --> 05:37.040]  in, it'll pop up there.
[05:37.040 --> 05:41.600]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your emails
[05:41.600 --> 05:46.280]  so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[05:46.280 --> 05:51.480]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[05:51.480 --> 05:56.200]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[05:56.200 --> 05:57.200]  and coin out.
[05:57.200 --> 05:58.200]  This is the verboten info.
[05:58.200 --> 06:14.600]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[06:14.600 --> 06:17.600]  We're not going to make America great again.
[06:17.600 --> 06:22.440]  It was never that great.
[06:22.440 --> 06:26.640]  We have not reached greatness.
[06:26.640 --> 06:34.640]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[06:34.640 --> 06:43.480]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our
[06:43.480 --> 06:52.600]  population is gone.
[06:52.600 --> 06:56.800]  The total divide and conquer program is in high gear and I wanted to start this Sunday
[06:56.800 --> 07:06.480]  live broadcast on the 26th day of August 2018 with the governor of New York saying America
[07:06.480 --> 07:11.600]  was never great and will never be that great until we do the opposite of what Martin Luther
[07:11.600 --> 07:17.160]  King said and only identify by what color we are or what sex we are and only by working
[07:17.160 --> 07:19.880]  through a group can you ever attain anything.
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.640]  It's called gang mentality because I thought of that clip this morning when I got up at
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.080]  like 7 a.m. I slept in, I just got about 5 a.m. during the week and I learned that John
[07:30.080 --> 07:39.280]  McCain was dead three days short of 82, a brain cancer and I saw the Hollywood tweets
[07:39.280 --> 07:44.800]  going out when Trump said, our condolences go out to you and your family, very sorry
[07:44.800 --> 07:49.720]  for your passing, you're a great guy, you rarely see Trump lie but he told the liar
[07:49.720 --> 07:56.080]  I dare to take the high road and I guess that's okay if it's in death, I mean I've taken
[07:56.080 --> 08:00.000]  the high road saying I hope his soul is in a better place, hope he got right with God
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.520]  but McCain will go over some of his bio, I did a live show earlier today, my stack was
[08:05.520 --> 08:08.600]  actually in there in the podcast room, I went and looked for it, it was gone, maybe somebody
[08:08.600 --> 08:13.600]  can find that stack for me but I went through the Keating 5 and I went through funding and
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.360]  helping create modern ISIS and I went through the Benghazi cover up and I just went through
[08:18.360 --> 08:24.320]  it, really how bad John McCain was, open borders, global government, he was the Democrats'
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.240]  favorite Republican, Senator Keane who of course ran with Hillary for president as
[08:29.240 --> 08:37.360]  VP, she famously, he famously said that John McCain was quote, thank you, John McCain was
[08:37.360 --> 08:46.840]  quote his boss or the Democratic parties, bosses, so it's truly sick and I'll talk more
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.480]  about this with Roger Stone coming up in the second hour but it's really not that important
[08:50.480 --> 08:54.680]  in the final equation, what's important is the governor will appoint out for the rest
[08:54.680 --> 09:02.080]  of his term which is several years McCain's successor so we don't want someone who is
[09:02.080 --> 09:09.140]  like his daughter or his family that are more left than Hillary Clinton, McCain clearly
[09:09.140 --> 09:14.800]  stole multiple elections, he was involved in the theft of $500 billion in the SNL crisis
[09:14.800 --> 09:22.040]  running a thing as a regulator with the regulators, he quartered back the whole deal and the
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.400]  left wants you to have amnesia and not remember that and not know that but a chapter closes
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.040]  with John McCain but you read the article up on InfoWars.com, it's from Breitbart that's
[09:31.040 --> 09:36.480]  got all the clips in it where you've got all these Hollywood stars going FU, Trump, go
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.200]  to hell, you know you're not even worth saying his name so when Trump took the high road
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.680]  and went super high, they went super low and I'm not going to sit here and speak ill of
[09:46.680 --> 09:51.040]  the dead but I'm not going to sit there and say because he was in the military and obviously
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.560]  had courage and got shot down and all the rest of it that he's then perfectly good guy
[09:56.560 --> 10:06.760]  because Adolf Hitler was in the military, Genghis Khan was in the military, Pol Pot
[10:06.760 --> 10:12.280]  was in his military, Kim Jong-un's grandfather was in the military, Mao Zedong was in the
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.760]  military so I love our military, I love what the republic stands for, I don't agree with
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.720]  Governor Cuomo that says that America was never great and will never be great because
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.720]  of our ideals and our stamina and our rugged individualism, we have been great, we will
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.840]  be greater if we rediscover what made us great but to just say he got shot down and was a
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.120]  prisoner of war so he can steal $500 billion for the globalist and he can help fund ISIS
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.760]  to try to overthrow Assad and stabilize things and he can be anti-gun and push open borders
[10:41.760 --> 10:50.280]  and throw the election for Barack Obama the first time, I mean John McCain actively pushed
[10:50.280 --> 10:54.320]  before he left the senate with Obama a year and a half ago, I mean he just left a few
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.480]  months ago to create this whole CIA operation against independent news and to begin deplatforming
[11:00.480 --> 11:08.800]  the American people, I've got articles here today where 96% of Google searches result
[11:08.800 --> 11:16.000]  for Trump, the search Trump news for liberal media outlets, 96% negative and now they're
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.280]  learning that the New York Post, the Washington Times, conservative articles from even the
[11:19.280 --> 11:27.040]  Wall Street Journal are being completely shadow banned where you cannot share them on Facebook,
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.480]  they're worse than Twitter, this is racketeering, they denied a Congress, they've been doing
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.800]  it, they've got major web services that track it, members of Congress have discovered they've
[11:36.800 --> 11:43.080]  been totally shadow banned to manipulate this election, it's not the Russian bots, it's
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.000]  the globalist bots of Facebook and of Google and of Apple and all of them, you know if
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.560]  you look back on the week before I got deplatformed on 26 major platforms, world history, the first
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.440]  thing they did was go in before they even deleted my channel, the day before we noticed
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.340]  that they deleted more than 10 videos the week before they had gone viral with millions
[12:06.340 --> 12:10.040]  of views total, we're going to re-upload them this week where I said Apple has moved to
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.720]  communist China, so has Google, they're helping censor there and they're bringing censorship
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.240]  here with a social credit score to control everything you do and deplatform you from
[12:20.240 --> 12:28.040]  credit cards, from hotels, from travel, from flights, from business, if you don't comply
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.280]  with their social control, they got panicked by that because Congress was already starting
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.400]  hearings, Kim Cook who admittedly met with the heads of those first four companies to
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.440]  ban me Sunday night and they made the decision to ban me, that is total collusion, so I broke
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.160]  this with Paul Watson five years ago, the Chinese social score that actually Google
[12:48.160 --> 12:51.680]  and others were building for the Chinese, now it's Associated Press Reuters, you name
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.440]  it, reporting it like it's no big deal, that they're moving to China and helping censor
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.680]  here and Facebook announced last Monday they're bringing in the social score to everyone on
[13:02.680 --> 13:12.560]  Facebook, that's why I've been shadow banned, that's why I've now been completely deplatformed
[13:12.560 --> 13:18.760]  saying look, conservatives if you don't like being 96% choked, like where you go play a
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.640]  football game and the other team's running downhill and you're running uphill, 96%, one
[13:23.640 --> 13:30.140]  team's got to rock climb up a 96% grade and for the other team it's just like walking
[13:30.140 --> 13:36.480]  down a hill, that's literally the football game, is we're going up a 96% grade, 90% of
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.960]  all communications goes on over the internet now, they're blocking everyone and even mainstream
[13:41.960 --> 13:48.760]  news says oh my god, this is killing everybody's freedom, now suddenly the hill and even the
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.160]  New York Times are like wait a minute, it's dangerous, if we just let the big tech giant
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.440]  censor Alex Jones, they can then censor everyone, it's already too late, you're already done,
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.960]  Zuckerberg said a year ago to executives, I'll hold your hand like hospice as mainstream
[14:01.960 --> 14:11.200]  news dies and mainstream news was so stupid, they went oh, let's get rid of Alex Jones,
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.040]  they'll set the presidency platform, the conservatives and the Christians, the libertarians, let's
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.720]  build up lies about him, let's tell lies about him, use that straw man to set the president
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.000]  to shut him down and what have they done now, ladies and gentlemen, they've done it and
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  now it's Prager University and it's the Washington Times and it's the New York Post and it's
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.040]  all news that's anti-Trump is tagged by Google and put to the top when they're 90% of worldwide
[14:37.040 --> 14:47.120]  web searches and conservative candidates everywhere are trying to even post their own ads to their
[14:47.120 --> 14:51.360]  own Facebook and Twitter and being told you can't and their own Googles but the Democrats
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.800]  can all advertise their money's gold, they can do whatever they want all because Senator
[14:56.800 --> 15:04.080]  Warner, Whiten and Murphy a month ago put out a memo that leaked the day I was kicked
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.800]  off all the platforms saying we're going to ban all conservatives and by the way the internet
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.600]  by next year is going to be all paid like Netflix, what Barry Diller said a year ago,
[15:13.600 --> 15:21.680]  by 2019 it'll all be paid, he's the big Democrat that owns Newsweek and then even four months ago
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.200]  the Wall Street Journal said we're going to ban Alex Jones and WikiLeaks and the whole internet
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.360]  will be paid after that, they'll accept WikiLeaks and Jones going down and then we'll make hundreds

[20:30.320 --> 20:37.120]  was just eighty just 72 days out from the most important election in us history and things are
[20:37.120 --> 20:43.680]  just absolutely starting to go haywire they're starting to go crazy but remember this if we just
[20:43.680 --> 20:47.920]  roll over to the globalist the sky's the limit to what they'll do to us and our families the fact
[20:47.920 --> 20:52.720]  that you're seeing all this turmoil means that we force them and their control systems out into
[20:52.720 --> 20:57.280]  the open and they're very very scared of that now here's the big announcement we just tuned in
[20:58.480 --> 21:04.480]  it is being reported by major computer tech firms even roiders even the wall street journal
[21:05.120 --> 21:11.520]  that the new york post the washington times and other publications are being completely blocked
[21:11.520 --> 21:17.520]  on facebook and other major tech firm platforms from even sharing their articles and now it's
[21:17.520 --> 21:23.440]  being reported 96 of google search results for trump news are from liberal media outlets
[21:25.040 --> 21:31.680]  let me translate that for you 96 of conservative news is blocked that's what that amounts to
[21:33.520 --> 21:40.160]  so that's again like us having to mountain climb at a 96 grade in a football game imagine 11 men
[21:40.160 --> 21:48.000]  are having to mountain climb up a 96 grade on average while the other side
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.240]  is basically sitting there in a motorized wheelchair just la la la la going down a nice easy
[21:54.240 --> 22:00.320]  grade downhill with us and they go oh we're private companies no they're 90 plus percent of all emails
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.560]  of all videos of all communications on most people communicate now and they're censoring
[22:04.560 --> 22:13.680]  it all and then your smartphones force feed you cnn and msnbc and the new york times but despite
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.480]  that it's not working brian stelter on average has about 100 tweets a mark dice has an average of
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.120]  12 000 tweets a paul watson average of thousands of tweets even with them shadow banning me the
[22:23.120 --> 22:27.920]  same thing so they don't know what to do so brian stelter goes up last week and says what can you
[22:27.920 --> 22:34.960]  do to get him totally banned why hasn't it happened yet and oliver darcy sits there and
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.400]  says ban alex jones get him off the air hundreds of articles everywhere big national story and
[22:40.400 --> 22:49.520]  then on friday he puts out a headline president trump is propping up the idea that conservatives
[22:49.520 --> 22:54.640]  are censored it's not true no one's censored because trump's now looking at it congress is
[22:54.640 --> 22:58.480]  looking at it they're getting ready to have hearings zuckerberg's being called back up
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.880]  and they just hope everybody's ignorant in there about what's happening but something
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.320]  happened i've gotten all the documents and all the files to the president and the congress
[23:08.880 --> 23:15.280]  i've done things like pay to have him hand-curried by delivery i've done things like make sure
[23:15.280 --> 23:20.320]  people give it right to the president and he's going to get more this week so get ready for
[23:20.320 --> 23:25.840]  your the executive orders i've got top lawyers on sherman antitrust act section two i've got
[23:25.840 --> 23:34.880]  all of it i mean you guys are absolutely 100 done if the president moves against you period now
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.200]  let's shift gears into the big enchilada we told you last tuesday here that
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.200]  roger stone sources very close to the molar probe because he's being probed himself
[23:49.200 --> 23:53.440]  said there's no doubt donald trump jr is going to be indicted for misleading the fbi
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.280]  not for any legal meeting with the russians none of that uh is the case but for them saying
[23:59.280 --> 24:02.480]  oh they think his senate testimony it's a little different than what he told the fbi
[24:04.480 --> 24:12.000]  so it's all just interpretation i think that's kelly green you think it's mallard green i think
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.720]  that's baby blue you think it's sky blue the fbi says buddy you said baby blue we say sky blue
[24:18.720 --> 24:26.960]  you're going to the huskow you're going to the lockup because the president is his own branch
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.080]  of government he has to be impeached by the other branch of government he has to be indicted by the
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.920]  house tried in the senate bill clinton was never tried in the senate was never technically impeached
[24:38.560 --> 24:45.280]  they indicted him and began the impeach month he was never impeached so
[24:45.280 --> 24:51.520]  so trump now has him going after all of his business associates notice none of its russia
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.520]  it's cab companies trump has nothing to do with her totally legally using his own money to give a
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.120]  girlfriend some cash turns out it's not campaign money they don't know what to do turns out it's
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.040]  12 years ago 13 years ago and so notice there's no russia and so now they're moving away from
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.680]  russia to obstruction of justice we told you a year and a half ago that that was the case
[25:09.680 --> 25:17.680]  well now the story is up on drugs report dot com from right bart that there's a headline
[25:18.560 --> 25:27.840]  roger stone says that they're getting ready to indict donald trump jr and now that
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.880]  trumps being betrayed by all these people around him it says trumps barrier breaks down
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.880]  and boy it's strange to see the wash from post occasionally tell the truth but but they still
[25:36.880 --> 25:44.400]  do an article three months ago about how more than 50 state-run universities state funded are
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.440]  basically chinese kami run now so we're gonna go to break her in a few minutes i'm gonna come back
[25:49.440 --> 25:53.840]  with my official breakdown of this bombshell info when i say bombshell they want to stop the
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.760]  years we can't break this down trumps getting ready to move against him he has no other choice
[25:57.760 --> 26:04.320]  they are the deep state he can declassify everything he can fire uh sessions and it's now about to
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.280]  happen in fact that's my stack from saturday if someone can find a place all the u.s senators
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.320]  now green lighting the firing of sessions this it's about to happen and i made some calls and i
[26:14.320 --> 26:20.240]  said yeah no it's he's made the decision he may change his mind but a lot is about to happen they
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.080]  know it's coming they know it's happening there's moles in the white house they know everything
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.560]  that trumps about to do so i'm not going to tell you anything secret but amid betrayals trumps barrier
[26:28.560 --> 26:34.880]  breaks down what's that mean he's like oh i forgot this print me this they just released the latest
[26:34.880 --> 26:42.160]  numbers it's 4.6 the new york times and krugman and obama said you don't have a magic wand you'll
[26:42.160 --> 26:51.280]  never get the economy up to 3 it's now 4.6 it's been three since he got in just on the exuberance
[26:51.280 --> 27:03.600]  then 3.6 3.84 4.1 4.2 now the numbers 4.6 4.6 china's had 10 percent growth rates for 30 years
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.280]  because it was all being sent there trumps says hey we're gonna have a little bit of business back
[27:07.280 --> 27:15.120]  here and everybody goes we're open for business america's back it's incredible so that's all coming
[27:15.120 --> 27:19.040]  up but if you want this recovery and if you want america back you've got to get the traders of the
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.200]  globalist out they're the ones that constantly tell you trumps a trader trumps his foreign asset
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.120]  because they're the foreign assets what the foreign assets have is crippling russia putting
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.600]  sanctions on them shutting off their oil exports where the u.s is now a net exporter and sows texas
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.320]  and we've got military massing around russia and all these sanctions and they say he's a russian
[27:38.320 --> 27:45.120]  agent when hillary gave him the iranium and muller made the delivery yeah muller made the delivery

[34:17.360 --> 34:26.240]  mexico city groups and individuals are moving for a pro human prosperity filled future not this
[34:26.240 --> 34:37.440]  globalist command and control system president trump is preparing to act against senator sessions
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.840]  who has totally compromised and the fact that rozenstein created a new succession not from
[34:43.840 --> 34:50.480]  the president to the attorney general commanding the attorney general the sub attorney general
[34:50.480 --> 34:59.120]  and the solicitor general but to weird never heard of us attorneys that are democrats and
[34:59.120 --> 35:04.320]  neocons in places like north carolina and texas and they just tricked trump to sign these papers
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.400]  saying it was just routine the first week in office they have allowed all the crimes against
[35:10.400 --> 35:14.400]  trump all the crimes against america all the illegal spying all the illegal warrants all the
[35:14.400 --> 35:18.720]  fake russia gate garbage they've indicted three members of the house to try to win the election
[35:18.720 --> 35:23.760]  for stuff that's not even criminal flying their daughters pet rabbit buying members of the staff
[35:23.760 --> 35:31.680]  dinner on campaign funds totally normal when when when obama laundered 84 million dollars
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.200]  it's all unfolding and notice the globalists are starting to think
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.840]  hayden former head of the cia and the nsa that's been calling for the president to be
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.640]  took taken down suddenly goes on the hill this weekend here's the headline says impeachment's
[35:48.640 --> 35:55.200]  a bad idea don't do it top pollsters come out and say this is gonna backfire but they say more
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.640]  importantly trump is holding all the cards in the next 72 days he has the people behind him
[36:00.640 --> 36:07.440]  they want to see action the economy is it 4.6 now unprecedented they said never hit three
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.640]  and they have looked at the numbers like i've been saying i mean i i just tell it like it is
[36:12.640 --> 36:19.680]  folks i don't do cheerleading when when when stuff's dire i'll tell you it is dire they remove trump
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.000]  tady bar the door because the economy will dump like that the whole world came back here because
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.400]  they know we're voting for business again the globalists had said you don't build here the us
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.320]  is done that was the official globalist plan it's like qualmo says we were never great we'll never
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.440]  be great it's taught all the universities is what globalism is is to move stuff to china
[36:39.440 --> 36:47.040]  and to exploit third-world labor this has been the plan okay and so why is hayden why are top
[36:47.040 --> 36:54.640]  pollsters why are they doing this because they know that the crazies like brennan
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.000]  and obama and hillary and others that think they're invincible hillary thought she can
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.640]  barely walk or barely talk half the time that she could be president they're delusional
[37:04.640 --> 37:15.360]  and so now you've got bloomberg you've got san francisco gate you've got the hill all saying whoa
[37:15.360 --> 37:24.560]  whoa whoa whoa we might be able to get him in the 2019 2020 if the economy goes down which
[37:24.560 --> 37:28.160]  they're trying to plunge and you've got bill mar trying to plunge it they all admit their hatred
[37:28.160 --> 37:34.960]  of america but if they do it now they've looked at the tea leaves and it is super dangerous super
[37:34.960 --> 37:44.320]  out of control super crazy but their own crowds are now in total foaming at the mouth hysterium
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.360]  the word i've invented instead of hysteria you go to a mental institution like a sanatorium it's a
[37:51.360 --> 37:58.800]  hysterium so that's what's going on because they know suddenly and this may be a faint
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.640]  though because they're so arrogant they may do it you got phil mud formerly the cia high level
[38:02.640 --> 38:09.200]  robert moeller's attache protege aid to camp saying we're going to kill this guy you've got
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.800]  brennan and and clapper on tv last year saying he'll be out by christmas we're going to remove
[38:14.800 --> 38:22.080]  by the 25th amendment you've got brennan on bill mars friday night the articles on info wars.com
[38:22.080 --> 38:28.880]  the video saying we're going to remove him via 25th amendment that's having the cabinet do it
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.280]  they put so much pressure on his cabinet on his staff that they threaten to arrest and indict
[38:33.280 --> 38:40.320]  all them who aren't protected like the president under the unitary executive and under the
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.320]  separate but equal clauses so under the massive threat everyone associated with trump myself
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.320]  his family you name it roger stone under total attack to put pressure on us to then roll like
[38:52.320 --> 39:00.720]  cohen has done and make up crap to flip so what does trump do they're bearing down and a lot of
[39:00.720 --> 39:07.120]  their people like clapper and like hayden and others are like whoa whoa whoa and democrats in the
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.280]  house democrats the center like let's not do this let's not do this this is too dangerous because
[39:11.280 --> 39:20.320]  trump for only 72 days be 71 tomorrow holds all the cards they've done illegal investigations
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.320]  they've made up stuff they're the ones in bed with the russians and the chinese they're the ones
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.640]  illegally surveilling them lying to congress he's got all the information he can declassify
[39:28.640 --> 39:34.480]  and notice what he said friday i may have to get involved to get to the bottom of crooked
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.640]  hillary's corruption and her whole cabal he said i'm gonna have to get involved on you censoring
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.680]  millions of americans no it's not alex jones now see it's millions of conservatives and it's all

[40:10.160 --> 40:17.520]  it and drudge said it isn't about alex jones they misrepresented him alex jones to then set the
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.720]  president to bring me down and then they were using the smoke screen for all of you prager you
[40:22.720 --> 40:33.280]  laura loomer have them again it's everybody they went from 80 to 90 shadow bands to 97 98 99

[41:06.880 --> 41:10.800]  from bringing back the fairness doctrine saying we can't even have our own political views period
[41:10.800 --> 41:16.160]  and claiming it's a form of campaign money so the democrats all have their speech cnn has their

[41:35.680 --> 41:43.680]  gentlemen and trump is set to declassify the information he's signaled but more importantly

[47:46.240 --> 47:50.480]  sectors of the deep state have decided to totally move on him beforehand with 25th amendment they
[47:50.480 --> 47:56.320]  announced it on bill marr with the big trader john brennan uh other globalists like hayden
[47:57.040 --> 48:01.600]  and clapper are saying back off don't do it top democrats are saying it the washington post is
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.880]  saying you're only getting trump more aggressive you're only getting trump to uh you'll go with his
[48:06.880 --> 48:13.200]  own gut which has crushed them he's done nothing but empower this country 4.6 growth rates so let's
[48:13.200 --> 48:19.840]  boil down what's happening right now senator sessions has been interviewed by multiple news
[48:19.840 --> 48:28.000]  outlets associated press sarah carter you name it or or uh let's be clear senators
[48:28.560 --> 48:34.160]  graham and grassley have been interviewed on sessions and have all green lighted that it's time
[48:34.720 --> 48:41.920]  for senator sessions now attorney general to leave lindsay graham says trump has the power and
[48:41.920 --> 48:49.920]  should do it so does senator grassley who is the most respected in the senate bipartisanly that totally
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.400]  absolutely green lights it and it's got to happen
[48:58.480 --> 49:05.680]  now what is the big giant thing and i said is the big kahuna of why they're getting ready
[49:05.680 --> 49:14.720]  to do this and why they finally understand that they have no other choice document camshot please
[49:14.720 --> 49:25.280]  for tv viewers info wars dot com in 2016 late 2016 and early 2017 along with zero hedge are the only
[49:25.280 --> 49:37.920]  publications to point out a section of the 611 billion dollar 2017 john warner defense
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.760]  authorization act first article is in december the next article was the next month
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.960]  it establishes a shadow government within the u.s government and the cia and the board of
[49:54.960 --> 50:01.600]  governors of the fcc above the fcc board in the board of governors aboard the actual board
[50:03.440 --> 50:14.160]  and it establishes billions in clandestine funding to stop quote foreign information warfare and then
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.600]  they had hearings a month later and said alex jones bright bart others so they call us russians with
[50:19.600 --> 50:24.400]  no evidence they're the globalist and then they say we will stop these groups now they have silicon
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.440]  valley last week meeting in a secret meeting that leak uh the buzzfeed picked up saying the exact
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.480]  same word that we've got to stop the foreign power stealing the election that's their cover to have a
[50:34.480 --> 50:41.840]  96 block on the wall street journal the washington times conservative writers at the hill who now
[50:41.840 --> 50:47.840]  can go and see how they've been 96 to 99 blocked in some cases 100 blocked so that's the cover for
[50:47.840 --> 50:54.000]  the globalist of the foreign power coming in and doing this and that's what this is and that's why
[50:54.000 --> 51:01.600]  senator warner four weeks ago days before i was officially blacklist of the first person ever in
[51:01.600 --> 51:08.720]  u.s history from 26 platforms in one day met with tim cook and others it's all admitted two weeks
[51:08.720 --> 51:14.640]  before they were secretly circulating it the days before they released it saying all conservatives
[51:14.640 --> 51:19.120]  will be removed then senator murphy said jones is just the beginning the tip of the iceberg i want
[51:19.120 --> 51:25.520]  them all gone i want rush limbaugh gone i want matt rush gone go look at their hearings and they said
[51:25.520 --> 51:30.640]  we're gonna ban them and warner then with murphy and widen you all put out announcements saying quote
[51:30.640 --> 51:34.400]  jones is the first we're gonna ban thousands that's widened last week in a radio interview
[51:35.920 --> 51:38.000]  they are making their move ladies and gentlemen
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.200]  so tim cook there it is on screen has been meeting over and over and over again this year
[51:45.200 --> 51:51.840]  here with mark warner to quarter back the plan they have an executive order they have three
[51:51.840 --> 51:58.000]  billion dollars in clandestine funds from the 611 billion they have people under orders outside of
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.600]  trump's knowing at the cia the nsa and critical infrastructure protection that is google by the
[52:03.600 --> 52:11.360]  way google is the nsa and a nasa combine that's now been declassified so you have a total deep
[52:11.360 --> 52:18.400]  state working against america a rogue government outside of trump waging war against our military
[52:18.400 --> 52:24.000]  our economy everything and these eggheads think you're stupid and you can't figure it out
[52:25.920 --> 52:27.200]  so they chose me
[52:29.600 --> 52:36.320]  as the target who they could take out a context to make me the bad guy so that while they're
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.520]  smoke screening talking about me they're banning you and everybody else ahead of the election and
[52:41.520 --> 52:45.440]  they think by the time you figure it out and these congressional hearings and by the time
[52:45.440 --> 52:50.560]  trump figures it out it's gonna be all over apple google all moved to china they're helping round up
[52:50.560 --> 52:54.560]  political dissidents they are just as bad as the communist chinese they do that here they
[52:54.560 --> 52:59.040]  could get away with it show with the democrats they want to have their foot on our neck they hate
[52:59.040 --> 53:06.480]  the economy at 4.6 they're in full arrogant panic mode and they believe they're operating under law
[53:06.480 --> 53:13.440]  because obama put the executive order in one of the last things he did on january night
[53:14.720 --> 53:25.440]  2017 directing the money from the john warren defense authorization act these two articles
[53:25.440 --> 53:30.080]  from zero hedge are the most critical the first obama quietly signs the congress information
[53:30.080 --> 53:36.080]  the propaganda act in law got all the subsections then go read the implementation a few weeks later

[59:55.920 --> 01:00:10.560]  i've got a good one
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.560]  and you know that's when i fall
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:39.920]  i can't help myself at all and i get whisky bent
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.680]  all right my friends alex jones here on this live sunday transmission let me lay out the biggest
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.480]  issue facing everybody with 72 days left and here it is why are the republicans about to back
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.840]  trump crushing the deep state crushing with democrat cabal crushing the clintons absolutely
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.680]  exposing their russia and chinese collusion even though it's going to hurt the republicans who are
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.840]  involved as well but not as much maybe 10 as much from my research why because the democrats are
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.200]  crazy and then there's been a political realignment they're not sharing power with the blue bloods
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.240]  anymore and in the countering disinformation and propaganda act it's in the john warren defense
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.760]  authorization act that obama signed a year and a half ago right before trump got into office
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.360]  it states they're going to hold new elections that are federally run by the democrats they're
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.080]  going to basically remove the republicans and only make them a ceremonial party and we're
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.800]  going to be like venezuela or north korea a one party state and so now senator grassley
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.680]  now senator graham and all the other key folks are saying remove sessions and remove
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.400]  wherever else you need and go after hillary for all the corruption and what they've done because
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.440]  they've learned that they were getting ready to double cross the old country club republicans
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.760]  and totally sell us out to china and implode the recovery and the recovery is working and people
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.000]  don't like killing a winner all these republicans went along with the globalist plan because they
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.920]  were told us about projecting american power worldwide but then they've learned it was actually
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.680]  about setting us up and bringing us down and the pentagon already knows that everybody else already
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.680]  knows that they're the trader so a lot of folks are jumping ship and now hayden and brennan
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.720]  and all these other minions are in big trouble and hayden and clapper and others are starting
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.000]  to crap their breaches saying oh no no no lordy lordy lordy brennan ought not have done what he
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.880]  did calling trump guilty of treason which means he should be killed and now we're gonna bang heads
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.040]  but trump's got 72 days we can still win even after that if he doesn't win the midterms i think we
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.040]  will i see a big red wave coming and i told you trump would win before but they've got election
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.920]  fraud and he's got a strike now to show confidence in the government he's got a strike now because
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.520]  it's the law and it's what he's supposed to do they've committed all these crimes they've been
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.280]  caught lying the whole pack of them 37 democrats with muller at the core of it and they've got this
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.960]  drag none of corruption they're trying to demoralize the country they're trying to cause race riots
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.800]  they're trying to sell us out to foreign enemies they're the clear and present danger and they set
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.480]  up a system to censor 96 percent of conservatives mainstream news now reporting ahead of an election
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:31.200]  and truly meddling the election by silicon valley the communist chinese president mr president their
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.760]  dictator went to davos as you know last year a year and a half ago and said with with yonker
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.640]  that they defeat america and that china would work with the deep state to stop you these are
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.360]  admissions of treason these are admissions of outrageous fraud and i know i've been penalized
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.400]  and demonizing attack but i don't want to be anywhere else because i know i had to do this
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.240]  and say the things they didn't want said and do the things to draw their fire because i knew
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.800]  they were gonna totally ban me after the election so i didn't want to get banned but i kept saying the
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.560]  things that they had facebook and all of them calling us and you better stop you better stop and
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.000]  i didn't stop and i knew seanna and others were so hungry to get me and get you that if they took
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.080]  me down first that metaphysically that could preggar the chain reaction to expose them and
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.000]  everybody else to look at how they're being censored to see the elephant in the room and by
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.320]  the glory of god it happened ladies and gentlemen it happened and now it's blown sky high in their
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.000]  dirty faces the last 15 minutes i've laid out here is the most important thing i've ever said and
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.040]  you're probably thinking you should say that once a year now you say it every two days because
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.560]  everything's getting more intense everything's getting more keen everything's getting more
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.800]  critical look out for false flags look out for attacks on their own media combines to blame us
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.320]  they're going to pull everything out because they know they're losing but thanks to you
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.320]  and thanks to god above we're going to win this thing critical intel 60 seconds away have you

[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.720]  so here's the bottom line and the 18 trillion dollar question the republican leadership has
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.760]  discovered the democrats are planning to go to a one-party system totally overthrow all free speech
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.880]  rule the country by racial and cultural divisions it's in all the wiki leagues it's in obama's
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.920]  countering disinformation propaganda act that created a three billion dollar stay behind
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:10.960]  network inside our government and the board of governors of the fcc not the fcc board the board
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.320]  of governors and now you've got senator grassley the most respected the senate on both sides
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.520]  senator graham who's been an establishment lapdog and other signaling remove sessions you have to
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.720]  do it before the midterms show you that you're strong they now know they're going for broke now
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.760]  some people like the former ci director and nsa director hayden who've been part of the little
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:38.800]  cabal is now saying impeachment is a bad idea now the democrats are saying and now the washington
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.240]  post and the san francisco chronicle are saying that trump's barrier is breaking down we better
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:51.600]  watch out that's right because if you actually i mean you've got the former fbi director on the
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.560]  tarmac giving him iranium you've got him on russian boards you've got them covering up for hillary
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:04.320]  it's a joke you've got illegal spine and so as all of this comes out and as the headlines are
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.720]  96 of google searches results block all conservative sites and now mainline newspapers are going i'm

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.680]  but the point is i'm not gonna pair myself to braveheart but look we're the biggest story out
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.200]  there because i knew we were already shadow banned 97 percent
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.320]  and so i had to push them all the way into it dorsi said he thinks i wanted to be banned
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.480]  well you notice i didn't follow your psychological warfare of being nudged at facebook and google
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.240]  is what they called it that they kept saying hey we're gonna totally ban you hey we're gonna you
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.720]  can't have your five million subscribers you you know you can't have your 16 million or 19 million
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.240]  people on apple and i'm like dude i'm not gonna become your little lapdog so i stay on you can
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.760]  misrepresent what i've said all day but i'm not gonna stop what i'm saying and what was it that
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.560]  china is helping run this that they're that they're colluding that it's out of control and that
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.440]  trump has to move against this countering disinformation propaganda group that that's the
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.800]  shadow government that's the operatives and they're working with cnn msnbc the new york times officially
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:57.920]  it says the cia works with quote trusted media it's beyond mockingbird it is a trillion times
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.600]  worse than anything we could have ever imagined and i'm not kidding when i say that
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:11.200]  so it's here you have a breakaway shadow government group a cabal in public and
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.360]  calling for the 25th amendment remove the president on bill marr friday brennan
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.000]  you have them with billions of dollars in this group funding it at media matters in the new
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.640]  york times the washington post cnn is the main attack dog and they admit in their own things
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.520]  we work with former opama people and people in the government to de-platform conservatives
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:35.760]  and when my domino went down three weeks ago you're all been vaporized like a fire breathing
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:44.080]  dragon just burning the village whole villages on fire and trumps like we're under attack i'm gonna
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:53.040]  rally millions have been banned and the cnn reporter oliver not darcy darkly what's that
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:00.720]  idiot's name that anti-free speech thug oliver darcy it's like jack darcy but it's not darcy it's
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:08.560]  oliver it's oliver well notice he's everywhere saying ban alex jones ban alex jones it's darcy
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.720]  so it's it he's ban alex jones ban alex jones ban alex jones and then friday he said trumps crazy
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:21.760]  no one's banning conservatives i mean that's beyond tokyo rose when we dropped adam bombs on
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.040]  harashima and nakasaki over two days in 1945 she was still broadcasting on am and shortwave
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.240]  aimed at our fleet saying america is burning your sweetheart is dead we have defeated you
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:38.000]  it's all over for you the america is burning we have killed all your sweethearts they're all dead
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.240]  we invaded japan it was on fire we dropped millions of firebombs on them in 50 mile an hour wind
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.960]  much worse than the atomic bombs that burned everything down millions were killed the entire
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:58.000]  country was vaporized they were on the news saying that they had defeated us like bad dad bob when
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.160]  bombs are going goes we have pushed americans into kawaii we have pushed them into the aci
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.240]  bad dad bob remember him in 2003 i'm gonna we're gonna go to break and roger stone's taken over
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.600]  here was huge breaking news but i and i want to tell the story of a mob chasing him through new
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.280]  york the other night but this this is it folks and so they're literally banning everyone and
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.160]  then oliver darcy is going trump is putting out the conspiracy theory roger i'm going to you right
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.800]  now all i can say is we need your financial support right now we're under attack you get great

[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.080]  us continue on to be that much stronger you don't so rows and all of them are going to win but i'll
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.120]  tell you the biggest thing is the censorship and getting the president to fire sessions and fire
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.760]  for deep and start the indictments of all these people and go after them all and the republicans
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.480]  have signaled it because they know the democrats are coming after them they went too far they broke
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:58.800]  the deal with the blue bloods and that's why they're done but we must move now roger stone take over
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:08.400]  a nice solution. Alex Jones you are on fire tonight man wow i am privileged to be here this has been

[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:32.640]  welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in now for alex jones on the sunday night version of the alex
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:39.520]  jones show this is in many ways an emergency broadcast because i'm sure as many of you have
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:48.160]  seen the deep state is making their move yes right now today the torrent of fake news is
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:55.840]  unlike anything i have ever seen for example uh david french writing for the national review
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:04.240]  uh says uh that um let's see uh rott trump confidant roger stone apparently had advanced
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:11.520]  knowledge that wiki leaks had obtained damaging emails from john pedesta and the democratic national
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:19.120]  committee close quote wrong david french of national review i never said anything of the kind
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:26.240]  bill buckley who i knew well but you didn't would be rolling in his grave if he knew
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:33.840]  that the national review was being used to spread such disinformation in fact it takes a
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:42.720]  bastardization of my iconic tweet regarding john pedesta's uh uh uh time in the barrel which was
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:51.440]  actually the pedesta's time in the barrel referring to both john and tony to make such an irresponsible
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:59.840]  charge i never said anything whatsoever about john pedesta's emails uh also uh a philip ewing
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:07.840]  writing for yet another fake news site says uh roger stone was in touch with russian intelligence
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:17.440]  figures uh according to uh uh court documents well they refer here to the indictment of the
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:25.120]  12 russian intelligence agency agent an indictment that the justice department is well aware will
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:33.520]  never actually go to trial so an indictment that is largely a public relations document they refer
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:41.440]  of course to my completely benign innocuous exchange with someone on twitter claiming to be
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:51.040]  goose fur 2.0 but any reasonable person who will examine that 24 word exchange knows that based on
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:59.760]  content context and timing it is entirely benign most certainly not evidence of collusion or
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:07.360]  collaboration with someone who was alleged but not proven to be a russian hacker now we're at a
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:14.720]  juncture in which the president must take action prior to this occasion i have never been in favor
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:21.360]  of the termination of the muller investigation preferring to have the president clean house at
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:28.320]  the justice department to get the investigation the kind of oversight it needs the fact that mr
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:38.000]  muller is now charging michael cone with a federal election campaign violation which may or may not
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.560]  in fact have been an illegal act based on the facts but seems to have no interest whatsoever
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:53.440]  in the 600 000 that illy paid through a big democratic law firm calling it falsely legal
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:02.720]  fees when in fact it was being paid in a pass through diffusion gps for creation of the phony
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:09.920]  dossier which by the way was compiled with the assistance of russian intelligence agents
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:17.280]  there's the real russian collusion muller and his colleagues have no interest whatsoever in the
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:25.920]  uh abuse of power by the obama administration in which they use this fabricated dossier as the
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:33.520]  underlying rationale for full-fledged state surveillance of donald trump's campaign for
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:41.840]  president that's a crime far worse than watergate in fact it makes watergate look like well a fourth
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:48.560]  rate burglary you're here with me on the alex jones show because tonight we're going to lay out a
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:56.800]  plan for the president to strike back against his critics this is the big event folks this is why
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:05.680]  they took info wars off multiple social media platforms only 10 or 12 days ago in preparation
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:13.120]  for this the rollout of the attempt of a soft coup d'etat to remove donald trump from the
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:20.800]  presidency the first thing the president must do is to order immediately the complete declassification
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:29.120]  and the release of all of the government's information regarding the iso warrants that were
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:37.280]  issued against carter page most likely paul maniforte and myself these of course violate
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:43.920]  federal law under federal law a faisal warrant can only be issued on a united states citizen
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:49.920]  if they are actively involved in espionage against the united states i certainly don't
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.240]  meet that criteria nor did my colleagues from the trump movement so it is clear the obama
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:02.640]  administration was using the power and the authority and the extraordinary capability
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:10.080]  of the state to spy on donald trump's campaign that's the scandal here and the russian collusion
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:18.320]  delusion was constructed as a diversion out to to divert your attention and the attention
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:25.440]  of the american people from the real crimes of the obama administration now you see the
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.400]  beginnings of the splintering of the establishment where john brennan a admitted former member of
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.640]  the communist party a man who admits to supporting the communist party candidate for president as
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:48.480]  late as 1976 a wahhabi convert to radical islam we broke that right here on info wars when fbi
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:55.040]  counterintelligence expert john guadano broke it down for us on the war room only weeks ago
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:02.320]  mr brennan has outlined the coup plan against the president where well on the tv show of my
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:09.920]  friend and sometimes adversary bill mar it's all there folks in fact he even talks about the trump
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:18.080]  cabinet removing the president as we predicted right here on info wars well over six months ago
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:26.000]  you're on the alex jones show and now is a good time to remind you that we are in a battle for
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.600]  our survival as never before that's why it's more important than ever that you go to the info wars
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:41.440]  dot com site right now and look at our terrific specials the info wars dot com site and our
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:48.800]  store there is the lifeblood of info wars you see we don't have any wealthy conservative fat
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:55.360]  cats standing in the wings writing big checks to to supplement the work we do at info wars
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:02.560]  when you come right down to it we can only depend on you and that's why your loyal patronage at the
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:09.280]  info wars dot com store is so important to our survival alex jones and the folks at info wars
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:18.240]  are facing literally millions of dollars worth of phony uh baseless uh lawsuits uh and these are
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.560]  meant to generate negative headlines that are then used as the grist for the argument to shut us down
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.560]  and while you're at it folks go to stone defense fund dot com you see it right there stone defense
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:38.000]  fund dot com robert moeller has targeted me for destruction he seeks to destroy me and my family

[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:18.000]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.360]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.960]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.560]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:40.960]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:46.000]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.400]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:35.840]  welcome back you're on the alex jones show and i'm your sunday night pinch hitter roger stone
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:44.160]  you know anyone who grew up in america in the 70s or 80s or even in the 90s was familiar with
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:51.920]  newsweek magazine newsweek was one of the two most popular news weeklies in the united states
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:59.440]  competing with time magazine to bring a weekly summary of the news and other analysis but at
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:07.120]  some point more recently newsweek magazine went out of business and the name in the graphics
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:15.200]  in the masthead of newsweek was sold to a fake news group who now publish under the name newsweek
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:24.480]  don't be fooled folks this is not your father's newsweek magazine this is a fake news organ
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:32.960]  large now this past week right here on info wars i've reported correctly that robert
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:41.120]  moeller the special counsel is now eyeing an indictment against donald trump jr for a process
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:50.880]  crime most likely lying to the fbi regarding the trump tower meeting now the same source a solid
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:57.920]  source that brings me this information tells me that contained in the michael cone indictment
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:07.040]  is a reference to a second trump organization executive who approved the reimbursements to cone
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:15.360]  for monies he allegedly paid to stormy daniels a transaction by the way that i argue is entirely
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:22.480]  legal my source says that the only people at the trump organization since donald trump left to
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:29.600]  become president and Ivanka trump left to become an executive in the trump white house uh who have
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:38.400]  the authority to approve financial distributions or disbursements are donald trump jr and eric trump
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:46.320]  both strong patriots both good men both deeply devoted not only to their father but to the president's
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:54.640]  reform agenda uh and therefore i believe uh based on this source that mr moeller is eyeing
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.840]  some kind of indictment against the president's son if that doesn't wake the president up i don't
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:09.680]  know what will uh the truth is the way to go now the best way for the president to proceed
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:17.920]  is to clean house he should terminate the employment of sleepy jeff sessions he should terminate rod
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:27.120]  rozenstein who not only uh approved the extension of the phony fisa warrants but who has been in
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:33.920]  the forefront of the effort to keep all the information regarding the obama administration's
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:40.560]  use of those warrants for political purposes in violation of the constitution out of the hands
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:48.000]  of the relevant committees of congress who have legitimate oversight but because rod rozenstein
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.800]  and the president's first chief of staff writes previs pulled a fast one early in the trump
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:01.040]  administration getting control of the president's justice department will be tougher than you might
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:10.880]  think you see prior to the uh a change that was signed into proc uh to practice by president trump
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.520]  the line of succession went from the attorney general to the deputy attorney general uh and
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.840]  then to the solicitor general of the united states so for example when president richard nixon
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:31.920]  ordered the firing of watergate special prosecutor archival cox attorney general elliott richerson
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:37.920]  declined to carry out that law and order and he resigned then deputy attorney general william
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:44.960]  ruckelshaus refused to carry out that order and he also resigned leaving it to solicitor general
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:52.560]  robert bork to carry out the president's order and he fired cox that of course would make him a cox
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:38:00.320]  sacker in any event uh what what rozenstein did was very clever he put the in front of the president
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:07.200]  a document changing the line of succession the authority of power uh at the justice department
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:14.080]  so it goes from sessions to rozenstein it now skips the solicitor general and goes to a u s
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:20.800]  attorney in texas and then a u s attorney in north carolina and finally a u s attorney in the district
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:29.200]  of colombia this is an extraordinary coup d'etat because it means that rozenstein did this prior
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:36.080]  to the appointment of moller meaning that mr rozenstein to his credit anticipated this moment
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:44.000]  the moment in which the president should fire sessions fire rozenstein and now fire as deep as
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.840]  he has to in his own justice department until he gets an attorney general who will carry out his
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:57.920]  orders if he first uh declassifies all of the information regarding the uh the illegal use
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:05.600]  of fice awards then he declassifies the information regarding hillary's emails and he declassifies
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:14.880]  declassifies the 700 000 emails that are on anthony weiner's server forwarded by her uh his
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:22.240]  husband huma abedin a top aide to hillary clinton only 3000 of which it turns out have been read
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:30.480]  and reviewed by the justice department in contrary to what fbi director james comey told the american
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:37.920]  people the people will be shocked by what they learned then and this is the key use the next
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:45.680]  election uh as a referendum on the president's actions instead of waiting until after the election
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:53.440]  as rudy juliani and others have recommended i think the president must act now to take control
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:40:00.960]  of his own administration the president must act now to release all this information to the american
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:08.720]  people the president must act now to avoid avoid the indictment of members of his own family now
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:15.440]  some will say well roger stone this advice is in your own best interest because it is not a secret
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:22.560]  that the special counsel seeks to jack me up for some non-existent crime having come up completely
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:31.280]  empty-handed of any evidence of russian collusion or wikileaks collaboration or any nonsense pertaining
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:39.760]  to john podesta's email they now are out trying to fabricate some offense on which they can indict
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:47.440]  me why because they want to silence me this is part of their campaign to silence the critics
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:54.800]  of mr moeller it is part of the campaign to silence info wars in fact part of their motive in trying
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:02.480]  to shut down info wars across multiple social media platforms is to silence us in preparation
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:09.600]  for the takedown of president donald j trump and the reversal of the last presidential election

[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:46.720]  sunday evening there's a coup d'etat a foot in the country folks the deep state led by robert
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:55.200]  muller is making their move now who is robert muller exactly we know he's a former fbi director
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:02.000]  and a former u.s. attorney for the city and region of boston but you should know so much
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:10.480]  more about him you see robert muller is the man who covered up the fact that five of nine of the
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:19.040]  saudi hijackers who attacked america on 9 11 were training at a sarah soda flight school and despite
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:27.120]  numerous complaints from the florida department of law enforcement to the fbi they never investigated
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:33.760]  reports of what these men were up to and then according to judicial watch and documents that
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.920]  were obtained from the federal government under a freedom of information act request mr
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.720]  muller covered up the fact that a local saudi family that harbored the men but disappeared
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:55.280]  in the middle of the night after the 9 11 attack had very clear ties to the 9 11 plot robert muller
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:03.840]  is also the man who let three boston men rot in a jail cell for a murder that he knew they did not
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:12.960]  commit in order to cover up fbi mob informants that were related to the mobster whitey bulger
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:20.240]  robert muller is also the man who arrested the first the wrong first three suspects
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:29.120]  in the anthrax case and then the man that he finally did arrest died mysteriously in custody
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:39.120]  of yes a tylenall overdose uh it's extraordinary uh that this entire chain including the cover-up of
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:49.200]  the bcci scandal the cover-up of the flight 103 the lockerby scandal all traced back to none other
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:57.520]  than deep state cover-up artist and hitman silent bob muller so the idea put forward by senators
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:04.640]  like linsey graham that robert muller is beyond reproach that he is the very picture of propriety
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:11.200]  don't match his actual public record my strongest advice to the president is to let the american
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:18.960]  people know who robert muller really is and what is his real record trust me folks if they bring
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:24.560]  some phony indictment against me i will bring it be bringing that record to the attention
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:31.440]  of the american people and if they manage somehow to silence me others will jump up in my stead
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:39.040]  completely prepared with the facts and with access to millions to make that case robert muller
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:47.280]  is a hitman for the deep state now uh one of the things that i found particularly aggravating this
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:55.280]  week as many of you know my longtime friend and associate christin davis was subpoenaed to appear
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:02.160]  by the special council in front of a grand jury in washington dc she was told that the government
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:09.920]  would reimburse her travel expenses she was given two days to appear she had to arrange for child
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:19.120]  care for my godson carter stone davis uh and made her trip to washington now we have learned
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:26.160]  that the special council has stuck her with 1800 dollars worth of travel expenses for airplane
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:33.920]  tickets and a hotel and left her stranded at the washington dc airport without a ticket
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:41.200]  that is how they play the game it's abusive in fact the special council thinks they're clever
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:48.800]  to go to the grand jury and say roger stone is a dirty trickster roger stone has admitted that
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:56.320]  he will do anything to quote win at any cost for the candidates he supports close quote without
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:02.480]  ever telling the grand jury that on every occasion i have told folks that i will do anything to elect
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:10.080]  my candidates short of breaking the law short of illegal activity you see they want to paint this
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:18.160]  caricature so that they can create a fabricated crime they can't find uh any collaboration with
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:26.000]  wiki leaks i received nothing whatsoever from wiki leaks or the russians particularly allegedly
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.960]  hacked emails and passed them on to donald trump or the trump campaign it's a fairy tale a canard
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:42.560]  a left-wing conspiracy theory a gross lie yet over this weekend a cnn producer called me to
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:50.720]  tell me that my arrest was imminent and reporters and others were camped out outside my house waiting
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:57.840]  for something that never happened uh it is uh this kind of mind game that the special council
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:07.200]  thinks they're playing they don't leak they leak like a sieve and cnn posted a story that said my
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:15.360]  longtime associate in drew miller had been given and accepted immunity to testify against me this
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:23.840]  was saturday night pardon me friday night oops that turns out to be wrong cnn takes the story down
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:32.720]  but not before a dozen fake news outlets like the very worst of them all the palmer report a complete
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:42.800]  sack of nonsense uh the bs site of all time the epitome of fake news recycled this erroneous report
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:50.880]  cnn has done me no favors uh it is uh therefore more important than ever that the president
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:57.920]  realized that he should move not after the election but before and then use this election as a
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:05.520]  referendum on his strong actions they are without any question continuing to target the president
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:11.840]  for a takedown and if they have to take down the president's son or other members of his family
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:18.400]  they will do so it is time for the president to recognize that the voices of timidity
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:25.280]  around him the voices of caution are wrong and that he must throw caution to the wind now
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:33.440]  and provoke a direct uh confrontation with the deep state and with the special council
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:39.280]  the special council continues to talk about getting the president to sit down for an interview
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:47.200]  such an interview is a trap a perjury trap seeking since they can find no russian collusion on the
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:55.440]  part of the president to entrap the president in some kind of bogus process crime it's as clear
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:02.400]  as the nose on my face and that nose is pretty prominent i've got a nose for politics and i
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:10.640]  understand what the deep state is up to here the the uh truth of it is that i am subject
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:17.440]  to a political prosecution or an attempted or planned political prosecution my crime
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:25.120]  supporting dylan trump for president my bigger crime the defeat of hillary ronam clinton yeah
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:33.840]  this is payback for my book the clinton's war on women which is the the definitive oppo dump on bill
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:40.560]  and hillary clinton and which very clearly candidate donald trump used uh as his playbook
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:47.360]  in an extraordinary election who can forget that terrific moment in the third debate when
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:53.440]  hillary clinton having practiced her lines carefully said we can't have a man like donald
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.640]  trump running the justice department and donald trump turned to hers and said yeah
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:05.200]  because you'd be in jail it was at that moment that i knew donald trump was about to pull off
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:12.480]  the greatest upset in american political history and so he did what we see unfolding
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:20.800]  before our very eyes right now is an effort to undo the results of the last presidential election
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:27.440]  but the precursor to that was the takedown of alex jones and info wars because we are the
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:35.200]  flagship of freedom because we are in the front line of the revolution because we broadcast the
